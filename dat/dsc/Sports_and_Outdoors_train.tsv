This came in on time and I am veru happy with it , I haved used it already and it makes taking out the pins in my glock 32 very easy	1
I had a factory Glock tool that I was using for my Glock 26 , 27 , and 17 . I 've since lost it and had needed another . Since I 've used Ghost products prior , and know that they are reliable , I had decided to order this one . Sure enough , this is just as good as a factory tool .	1
If you do n't have a 3/32 punch or would like to have one in your Glock bag , this is okay . The butt end of it is handy for pushing pins back in place . If you already have a 3/32 punch and do n't need another , do n't both with this one .	1
I purchased this thinking maybe I need a special tool to easily pop off my base plates for my magazines , but it does the same as a regular punch tool . Glock mags are a pain to get the base plates off . The tool does not really make a difference .	1
If u do n't have it .. Get it . All you need to completely take down your glock . Any model any gen .	1
This light will no doubt capture the attention of night-time drivers . It has three functions for the LED , blinking , strobe ( kind of ) and solid . The lasers project well and can be set to flash or remain solid . Awesome product . Hopefully it holds up .	1
Light and laser torch work well , very bright . Just installed on trike , had it a week , but seems to be well built . Only time will tell .	1
Does everything it says it will do . I would like it so that the & # 34 ; lane & # 34 ; markings were a bit brighter on the ground . This does add a bit of safety to riding in the dark , as long as the motorists pay attention .	1
Very bright . I would recommend this lite to anyone . I put one on my wife 's bike . I love this light .	1
Mine arrived with only one of the lane-generating LEDs working . I do n't care . For $ 11 , I can order another one .	1
It works great its just a little bulky ... I feel like it could be shaved down easily . its def rain resistant no problems on my end with that . Its EXTREMELY bright	1
I love this light ! I have two of these ! It is very bright . I like the different blinking modes that the light offers . I recommend this to everyone who rides at night .	1
Bit bulky . One button is sticky . Works for now . Stars based on price point as well . I 'll update if any significant changes occur . Very bright at this time !	1
it is bright and it has multiple settings for design and speeds . Assembling it to the bike is fast and simple .	1
A mice bright light with multiple modes . I would have given it 5 stars but it is not designed to clip onto the bag on my bike . I had to midify it to do so .	1
Had one ride on the light ! Mounted on my cross bike but rode it on the road . The laser worked well . Did n't spend any time adjusting for laser lines on each side of the bike like some have said in their reviews , It 's simple unless you have a small bike . The laser lines are only seen when you come up about 10 feet from the bike , It 's just there for the cool factor I believe . People riding next to you or a few feet behind can see the red laser lines very well . I believe the laser beams are not going to make cars more aware of the distance they need from you but it might help if they are approaching slowly.The LED light is plenty bright , just got ta make sure you aim it correctly when viewing from the rear . The mount seemed sturdy enough . Bounced bike up and down several times to see if it would slip it did n't . You can also see the LED lights from the side very well , witch I think is important . I do not know the run time since I only had one ride so far , but I assume it will be normal for LED lights . I 'll try to come back and edit review ( if I can ) after a lot more rides. & lt ; edit > I 've had 4 rides on it now and still holding good charge . Works great	1
I worked out once back in '08 . I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - & # 34 ; too easy & # 34 ; . So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them . Now I 've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable . I 've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday .	1
I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7 . This is one tough band . Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises , such as back rows and standing chest press . But too difficult for tricep kick backs . It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet . There 's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band . Overall I 'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger . Keep up the good work .	1
Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps .	1
Works just as advertised . Great , soft , but rugged spongy handles . Great tension . Seems well built . The locking device for the door works perfectly .	1
This band works well , and has lasted a long time despite heavy use 3x a week . The company was a joy to work with during communication over questions I had . Have already ordered another band in a lighter pull weight for my wife .	1
These bands were as claimed all sizex and good for me a 5'7 inch 145 pder who loves to use them daily They pkg was complete leg band good soft handles and door anchor Great buy	1
If you are creative , you can do almost any exercise with these bands , and they all fit into a small tote bag . Build quality is good -they are durable .	1
I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to & # 34 ; loop & # 34 ; the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises . I ended up using the & # 34 ; ankle & # 34 ; attachment to do that and works for me . Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time . I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger .	1
Love the wide variety of resistances you can combine . Because I do n't have room for a weight set with bench , these bands and an exercise ball are perfect for my workout .	1
You can vary your workout and custom it to the part of the body you want to work . It is high quality equipment that can be used for a toning workout or a tough muscle building set .	1
the bands are great the services is great , when can you make a call and get the owner on the phone what more could you ask for , great bands great price great services that saids it all	1
I absolutely love these resistance bands ! You have every amount of resistance you could need , and bands can be easily added together to get your perfect resistance . The handles are comfortable , and the door anchor does stay in the door . I was a little scared to try the door anchor because I was afraid it was going to come flying out and hit me in the face , but I tested it using a long broom lol . I do love using resistance bands instead of weights because you get lean muscle instead of bulky muscle like from free weights . This is a great set , and I highly recommend them .	1
This was a great surprise for the money . I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out . At this price why not ? I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try . The door anchor worked great . I 'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible . This I just keep in my night stand and any time I 've got some extra minutes I do a little workout . Pleasantly surprised and pleased . I highly recommend .	1
took this on vacation , worked great . got through the airport ok. now i use this at home . the bands are strong . you can exercise most of the major muscle groups , might be a few gaps but not many . holds itself in the door just fine for the exercises that need it . I personally like to have it pull towards having the door shut , i do n't trust it pulling towards the door open unless there is a dead bolt .	1
This is a pretty decent set of resistance bands . The only thing I would change about it , is that the band themselves are a little bit long . When you put the attachments on them , they are too long to do some of the exercises I would like to do . I have tried to tie the bands in knots to remedy this , but they are very hard to untie , so I try to avoid doing that . Also , if you call the company after you get your package , they will send you a free orange band , which is even stronger than the strongest band in this pack . That was a nice little bonus !	1
I bought these along with a recumbent bike and wanted to wrap them around the front to work my arms while I pedal away on the bike at the same time . Work perfectly and I could not be more satisfied with the quality of these bands.~ Ben Donley	1
They work really well you can use them in any way they even work out with pull-up bars and can attach it bench and use for reverse push-ups	1
Personally , I do n't think Resistance Bands get enough good press . If your wanting to tone , trim , and sculpt your physic , rehab injuries ... this band set will do it ! Pay a annual membership to a gym or spend $ 30 one time . Your choice ! Worth every penny !	1
Good for those small exercises that one ca n't do with freeweights . I use it for slight rehab on a knee . It 's perfect for that . With the door stoppers you can get angles that really help ( if you have old joints ) . Of course it 's all very light , so I ca n't see doing anything heavy ( for those looking for something to supplement freeweights , such as wrapping around barbells when doing squats and so forth ) with these , but they 're good so far and seem to be made to last .	1
Upon opening , it looks like a Boston Strangler 's equipment kit . Seriously ... they are perfect for all around resistance rehab or training . Workable for retired folks , too .	1
This is a perfect set to keep packed up for when you are traveling . They do n't take up too much room and if you know what to do with them you can get a complete work out no matter where you are .	1
Compared to other brands , where each band is its own resistance , here you can combine multiple bands to increase your resistance as you need it . That was a huge plus for me . The little accessories like the detachable ankle strap and door anchor are great add ons , and on top of that there is a nice little bag to keep them all organized.I have just had them for a short period of time , but look forward to using them alot .	1
I 've only had these for a little while and I did end up buying extra handles ( different company though because the handles I got received better reviews and they definitely are better ) ... I ordered enough handles for all the bands but the strongest since I 'm not at that point yet . I had my husband hang a hook on the back of my door to store the bands and install two different heavy duty hooks on the wall ( one at waist level and one at over the door level ) . I use these bands on these hooks to work different muscles . I also ordered the FitDeck ( I think that 's what their called ) for resistance bands and it gives me ideas on how to use these bands best . I looked on youtube too for some ideas . These bands are actually fun to use . I have to figure out a certain routine for myself still but I do like them and they seem pretty sturdy . I store them up on the back of the door so the cats ( I have two ) do n't get at them . They love things that hang and they attack ( ugh ) . I would recommend these as long as they do n't break easy ... if they do , I 'll update .	1
I bought this set of bands to work on rehabbing my knee outside of the gym . This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes . However , for those intent on building gobs of muscle , weights are of course ideal . I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands . While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it does n't feel accurate . The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band . I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands . I knew what I could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance . From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with for other exercises . The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles . The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling . As another reviewer noted , the bands are rubber and are subject to wear . It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update : I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding . I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement . This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer . Hopefully , I am not overstating the obvious , but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights .	1
I am really big fan of Lifeline products and was about to buy similar product by them . But , I decided to get these as this was 10 times cheaper . I am so glad I did ; I am sure lifeline are great . But , these are also awesome ! really nice . I will be buying another set for a friend . Sorry Lifeline , but , these killed you and a lot cheaper .	1
These work well . It is easy to attach multiple bands for more resistance . They 're easier to use that way if you loosely secure them together in the middle . The weight of each band is n't marked on the band itself , that I could find , which could be a nice addition . Overall , though , they are durable and do what they 're made to do .	1
I used to bodybuild and from lifting heavy weight my joints started to hurt . So I bought these resistance bands and they work great . They are not heavy but after so my repitions you can feel the burn . I work out home , work , and on the go . I a gym in the bag .	1
I bought these bands for some rehab at home after having surgery on a severe tendon tear in my shoulder . The easier bands are all I have been able to use thus far , however , I 'm looking forward to using the heavier blue and black ones once my strength comes back . I also happen to be a Certified Personal Fitness Trainer and would definitely use this equipment if I was working with a beginner or intermediate ( male or female ) at their home or office . VERY VERSATILE equipment that allows for an incredible range of motion/movements . The clips are easy to attach/detach and the door anchor allows a full range of positioning . There are probably 50 different exercises ( maybe more ) you can do with these bands.One word of caution - even the toughest band would n't be enough for an extremely strong person , so if you bench 400 and do 150 lbs on tricep pull-downs , you may have outgrown some of this equipment or will be bored with it . However , even for the biggest person , there are some neat balance exercises and small muscle groups you could work on.I really like this set so far . Quality seems excellent , however if I have any problems with it , I will update my review .	1
If you like to lift , enjoy having some definition , but hate the gym and lack the space for larger weight sets ... Buy this !	1
These bands are made of strong , high-quality material . And I like the door attachments . But I 'm 6-1 and find the bands too short . However , there is a workaround . To increase the band length , simply add a carabiner in between the handle and the band . Also , the color-coding is confusing . Instead , they should label the bands from 1 to 5 .	1
I got this for some basic workouts . Does the job well . Definitely ca n't replace dumbbells though . Took off on star because I really wish it came with a way to wrap up the bands because all the bands being lose will make it a jumbled mess .	1
Plenty of different band widths , and since you can combine multiple bands on handles , you have a large variety of resistances.Comes with two nice handles , a strong velcro wraparound , and a carry bag .	1
These bands are great , I started using them after dislocating a shoulder again and I really like them . At 5'6 '' I have no height issues with the band length and find them as versatile as my imagination for exercises . As a gymnastics coach , I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to exercises . the door anchor and ankle strap are both good quality.The bands , although not a substitute for gymnastics rings , high bar and the like are really really great for a whole bunch of exercises . Using one of the band combinations with the door anchor I got a couple of really good ab exercise and some good pullovers ( for muscle ups ) . Sure today I was able to do some levers so but these exercises are really helping me stay strong through injury and I can see them going way beyond . Far better and more versatile than weights , these band are fun and create exercises that require small muscle stabilization far better then weight machines.For the price you could do far worse . If you 're one of those folks in a DVD program , start to improvise , do what feels good . Yes I have push up bars , I use them for handstand practice , really good stuff . Get them and enjoy . If you 're a serious pump monkey , keep these around for vacations or while watching tv.I have since purchased some of the new heavier pull bands , this product is now an exercise stable for a gymnastics coach . The nature of them makes them better than free weights and the versatility of exercises is amazing . I have a pull up bar identical to the one Black Mountain sells , you can do some really cool stuff , limited only by strength and imagination.As an aside , the Black Mountain guys are really nice and answer all questions . All bands and handles are reasonably priced .	1
My husband drives and only really walks as exercise . His cab is cramped and does n't have room for weight or other things . So on a whim I bought this one day for him . Although he has n't been & # 34 ; motivated & # 34 ; lately to exercise he did give these a try and likes them . He now uses them quite often as they are so convenient and he can do it regardless of the weather .	1
My husband is a pilot and takes one or two of these at a time . States he gets a great workout from them . Really not small enough of a bag to take it all at once .	1
Not a whole lot to say about them , other than the fact they seem like good quality bands that have lasted well over a year now . I do n't use them daily , but try to get a couple uses a week . I 'm happy with the purchase .	1
My wife and I both use these , and they are great.If you have a good DVD routine or even check out YouTube you can use these to their full advantage.You 're not going to get super bulky using these , but they do work you out.I 've found that I can double up on different bands to get more resistance , and my wife can just use one or two at a time to get less resistance.We really like them , and I 'm sure you will to .	1
My arms are burning as I try to type this review . I was n't looking for a muscle building as much as a muscle defining device and this is the best on a budget with not much room to put much else . Between these and a jump rope you have everything you need to tone up and stay in shape ! They seem well constructed but only time will tell how they hold up . I 'll revisit this review in a couple months to give a accurate update on exactly they held up .	1
I 'm using this to work out my hips for an IT Band issue . I tried using it for a full workout , but just do n't like a resistance band workout for my full body . But for my hips , the door peice is awesome .	1
For the price and what you get i love it , bands like this should n't cost you an arm or a leg and should last and not rip when you put strain on them . these live up to my expectations with repeated use . good buy	1
I used to be a personal trainer and I needed something to fill in on the days I could n't make it to the gym . This was great quality esp for the cash	1
i purchased these to help with a shoulder injury and now that that 's healed up they 're great for everyday training/ traveling . Just throw them in your bag and you do n't have to worry about the hotels gym .	1
I bought these resistance bands to use along with P90x , and so far they are holding up well . It 's been about 2 weeks since I 've started using them and none of the bands have broken yet ( as some reviewers have mentioned ) . I do n't yet know how they will hold up in the long run , but I 'm not too concerned about them since Black Mountain Products has a great warranty on them.They come with 1 set of grips that attach to each of the bands via a metal clasp . If there is n't a weight that you like in each of the bands , you can combine multiple bands and customize the weight yourself.I really like these , and assuming they hold up - I give it 4 stars .	1
I am about half way through the P90X workout and have been using these straps . So far they have held up well . Clipping straps onto and off of the handles is quick and easy , so I can move from less to more ( or more to less ) resistance without hassle . There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band , so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want . While I am sure there are better bands out there , I am also sure you would pay more for them . This is a good product at a reasonable price .	1
These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen . They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem , so the red , black , green , blue , and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance , which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance . The door anchor included is a very simple design , but it works well . All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty , just call them and they will ship you a new one ( you have to pay shipping though ) . The handles are well constructed , and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff . Will buy from this company again .	1
This is a nice assortment of workout bands -- the first I 've purchased or used . They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely . The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are ! It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information , but it 's really no big deal . I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually . NOTE : I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor , just the handles .	1
I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set to allow me to do strength training when I travel . I had previously purchased another name brand set of resistance bands , but they had plastic & # 8220 ; D & # 8221 ; rings that would slip under strain . The metal & # 8220 ; D & # 8221 ; rings and & # 8220 ; O & # 8221 ; rings on this set is a much improved upgrade for me . The door holder and foot strap completes the accessories . The set is easy to use and the bands are strong enough to meet the workout needs . This is a high quality set or resistance bands . The only negatives would be the work-out instructions are weak . I downloaded a more comprehensive work-out guide for resistance bands that have better diagrams and more exercises . Also , using multiple bands can be tricky . It would be nice if there was a sleeve that would gather the bands when using three or more for safety and ease of use . Overall , the quality for the price is outstanding . I would recommend these to anyone who would like a good quality set of resistance bands .	1
I primarily use these attached to the door , I am emulating pull ups , trying to gain strength . I use them all at once , figure if I do 10 or so a day it will help to gain strength in those muscles . I have a different set I use for workouts . Only because of the handles , they are great when you want to use several different bands together to increase the resistance , but for a workout you want to be able to grab something quick , not have to to stop and put the handle on the right band . Great product and it does come with the door attachment .	1
I like the bands . The quality of the bands and the handles are good . Never used the door anchor or ankle strap . I do wish there was a way to keep the bands together when you hook several up at the same time . Overall I am happy and to date have not broken the ends off of any of the bands . The size is nice and small for taking on the road if you need to .	1
I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I 've read here on the product and the customer service . Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service . But the product is as advertised . I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while . I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly . The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain . Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has . I highly recommend these bands .	1
The reason I went with these was to be able to stack extra weight together for more resistance . For areas where I am stronger it is nice to be able to put 2 or 3 bands together to get the desired resistance without paying an arm and a leg of lots of bands .	1
I bought one set for my wife and my mother in law came over and tried them out so i irdered a set for her . They work great .	1
Everything a beginner to resistance bands needs , has different strengths of bands handles , door uses . I just strapped the ankle strap around the support pole in my basement and it worked fine . Love them	1
I looked around and compared item and price and the best deal was here . This is a small family company and their products hold there own against the more expensive ones . Unless you are a workout crazyman or do n't take care of them , these bands will last years .	1
What you see in the photo is what you get along with a guide for the resistance of each band or combo of bands . It took a while to get this item delivered . Ordered on the 23rd of May and did n't get it until the 3rd of June . Seemed like a longer that usual time to get it to my home mail box . Snail mail was indeed snail mail in this instance.I got these bands to facilitate some rehab exercises for my back post surgery . I think they are a great value for all that you get and they seem to be very well constructed . I looked around before I got these bands and there are really a lot of choices out there . I think this set is one of the best values for the money . They would also work well for travel as an exercise system in a very small bag that comes with the kit . I really like the adaptor that allows you to hook into a door jamb v. having to us a door knob . Also the ankle piece is nice to have as well .	1
easy to use , easy to change out parts . colors make it easy to determine strength of band and easy to grab which one i want .	1
This set of resistance bands is complete with everything you need for a light workout . I bought them to help with my shoulder workout . This is a really nice system . You get handles , carabiners , ankle strap , and door anchor , along with 5 different resistant bands . I purchased the wall-mount , 5 position exercise station to use with these , so I am ready for rehab after my upcoming shoulder surgery .	1
I have free weights , but I do n't want to lug them all over the house to work out . And for the most part I do n't use them where they are stored . These really help out if I want to move to a different room or even when I 'm on the go .	1
I was looking for resistance bands to help with strength and conditioning for taekwondo . These really fit my needs quite well since the package comes with a door attachment and ankle strap that allows me to train without a partner . The tubes clip to the handles/ankle strap/door attachment with spring loaded clips rather than just sliding into some fitted slot , and they seem very secure . I was n't too sure I would like the metal clips at first , but they are very secure . I 've not seen the door attachment on other products , but this accessory is pretty slick , at least for my purposes . Rather than attach to the doorknob or under the door , the attachment consists of a nylon strap with a ball inserted into one end . The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door . What makes this work so well for me is that I can adjust the height of the anchor ; low for kicking drills and higher for hand techniques . The variety of tubing is also more useful than I thought . I had anticipated needing only one heavy band for my training , but my 8 year old son and wife also like the bands and use lower resistance than I do . All in all , a very neat little package for the price .	1
full workout in a bag ! This set is well made and very versatile . I could carry this on a trip to get a great workout . This is my first tension band set , but I am very satisfied .	1
These are very high quality resistance bands . The rubber pieces are guaranteed forever . I just wish there were more than one set of handles , although I 'm pretty sure more can be ordered - probably on Amazon .	1
een using these for a few days and so far I 'm very happy with them . Good all metal connectors , removable handles allow for lots of variability on tension . Ankle and door accessories nice . Storage bag is a nice extra . Overall , I dont think I could have bought a better kit for more money !	1
This was one gift that will give back , great tension and feels strong , A good work out for all.I 'm going to get me one next time .	1
The product came just as advertised . Easy to set up and use and the bag is nice if you plan on working out when you travel .	1
BACKGROUNDCurrently , I am in the process of starting my second round withP90X : Tony Horton 's 90-Day Extreme Home Fitness Workout DVD Program . The exercises call for some equipment to be utilized . If you lack that equipment , the program shows those preforming the exercises utilizing alternative methods to complete the routine . I thought it would be nice to mix up the different methods for something different.REVIEW : The purchased showed up with everything included in the photo . There was the carrying case , an instruction manual that was brief but explained what the combination of colors would add up to , an ankle/soft grip strap , and a door anchor.The resistant bands are of a higher quality . I tried out the resistant bands in the store and felt that the material making up the bands including the clips were very cheap . These feel durable and have held up quite well through vigorous usage during this second round of P90X.I know it states one size fits all . Myself , I am 5'8 , these bands are perfect . If you are shorter and have slack , you are able to adjust . If you are a taller male , you might have some issues preforming the exercises to their full extend since they will not stretch the distance you need them to.PRO : ++ Durable material . Built to last++ Includes everything needed in one set up plus extras to complete exercise routines++ Great for any exercise routine as well as physical therapy if lifting weights is too great but need natural resistanceCON : ++ Only one set of handles included . Annoying to continuously switch bands during work out routine++ Need labels on bands so I can remember the weight strengthCONCLUSION : These are a great addition to anyones work out gear collection . They are durable and able to fill a variety of roles from additional exercise routines to aiding with physical therapy . A recommended purchase .	1
Not exactly ripped , but prettttay toned . It 's been a couple of years since I bought this , but they still work great and use them almost weekly when I travel to hotels with my work .	1
I have arthritis in my hands and these high-quality resistance bands allow me to do a lot of exercises I ca n't do with free weights . Highly recommended .	1
These bands arrived promptly . They were in mint condition . They were a gift and the person who received them was thrilled with them . They loved the selection of levels of difficulty the bands offer as well as the bag since she travels with them . Thank you !	1
I bought this for my husband who has a free weight set upstairs which he loves , but he said he likes the bands better and the freedom to use them anywhere he wants . Total score !	1
These are very useful and are just as pictured in their add . I have used them and they are really user friendly .	1
My new triathlon coach started integrating & # 34 ; tubing & # 34 ; into my workouts to help build strength for swimming . I purchase these instead of the company 's $ 30 price for only 1 resistance band ( aka tube ) . This has several high quality bands and there is a strap to use in doors and another one that will likely be useful if I want to use it at the gym.I was really impressed with the quality and the bag .	1
While I still ca n't figure out how the door anchor works ( and there was very little documentation with the product ) , the quality of the bands and the variance of weights included is very good . The handles and joints are solid . I 'd have no problem recommending this .	1
Very pleased with product , build quality just as expected and top notch . Been using daily for weeks , strength and durability seem to be very good , and resistance levels are MORE then adequate for most any exercise . Also QUITE enjoy the versatility of being able to manipulate the different resistance levels by adding/removing the different bands from the primary hand grip ring , very easy and quick to use ... . Very helpful in adding that extra element to any fitness routine !	1
We purchased two sets of these bands for use with P90X . We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle , although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program . We continued to use these bands for pull-upsThe Good : These bands are easy to use , and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful . Some people may need more weight than this set can provide . Since my wife did not use the & # 34 ; heaviest & # 34 ; red band very often , I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.The door strap works well near a hinge , and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar . Overall they have held up fairly well.The Bad : Out of our two sets , one strap broke at the metal clasp . I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out , but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band . Fortunately no one was hurt when it went , but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension , as the P90X videos demonstrate . Again , none of them have snapped , but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.Overall : I liked the bands to get started on P90X , but ultimately decided they were n't giving me the workout I wanted . As soon as I switched to some & # 34 ; dial weights & # 34 ; I felt I was getting a better workout . The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all . In theory , if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating , I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.Still , we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands . They are a good value and we are pleased to own and continue to use them .	1
You can combine these bands to get a wide range of tensions and between the wrist strap , handles and door piece they can be used in a variety of ways .	1
I could n't be happier . These were a great price , made in USA , and are high quality . I 'd definitely buy these again and recommend them to a friend .	1
These bands are made of good latex . The carrying case is nice . I like how you can attach multiple bands to the handles to create a custom resistance level . The door anchor works well also .	1
This is one of the best resistance band systems I have seen . Love the clips changes are very easily , you can adjust for different exercises . The door hook works great , and the selection of bands let you get a great workout .	1
I love this set of exercise bands . I purchased them on a recommendation from my personal trainer for use when I stay at hotels without a full gym . Any hotel room with a door will allow me to do 90 % of the exercises I normally do . All these bands roll up into a nice bag for travel and the whole kit is fairly lightweight.I think the lighter gauge bands are pretty useless for strength training unless you are a petite woman , child , or doing some rehabilitative work . I 'm not exactly sure who uses a 2lb band . Maybe for stretching ? But the red and black bands are heavier gauge and excellent for male strength training.There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon complaining that the bands eventually wear-out or break . They are supposed to . They stretch and , after repeated stretching , yes , they will wear out . Good . That means you are using them and your muscles are getting a workout . Quit whining . Buy a few more replacement bands . Wear them out too.The company that makes these bands appears pretty solid . In the package I received , there was a coupon for a free extra orange band which was even a heavier gauge than the black band . I 'm looking forward to receiving it , and I think the company offering it at no charge was a very nice touch .	1
We bought two of these for our sons . The kits have all the attachments that are needed to clean a variety of guns -- both rifles and pistols . It is nice that each attachment has its own spot to snap into , and there are additional spots to accommodate additional things like solvent and patches .	1
This is my first cleaning kit . So glad I went with this one . Has everything I need and some . I previously had a otis kit but do n't think i 'll be using that anymore .	1
This is a great little kit that provides everything you need to take care of your handgun except the oil . You wo n't be disappointed with this product .	1
i bought this cleaning kit to keep in my car when i go to the range.comes in very handy for a quick cleaning at the range	1
Run of the mill cleaning kit I bought as a gift for my brother-in-law . Of course he has a .32 caliber pistol so I had to buy a separate brush . A basic kit that will suit most anybody 's cleaning needs .	1
Like : Very large selection of items for most caliber fire arms . Contents seem to be made well.Dislike : Case is not the quality that I expected , seems cheaply made ( flimsy ) .	1
This has everything you need for every gun . Plus stuff you might never use . Looks like it will be good for all guns and years of use .	1
These kits are amazing if you have multiple guns and calibers to clean . It has everything you need in terms of brushes and jags . I also buy these to refill my larger unit since it is cheaper ordering it this way than individual brushes and rods .	1
Most notable is that it does n't contain everything you might need and it is missing some calibers that are not entirely uncommon -- - there is no provision for .40 for example.The individual components are not made of the strongest materials , but then you do n't have to worry about any of them damaging your rifling . It is a really nice size overall and the container is pretty good . Some items may shake loose into other parts of the case , but they never fall out entirely . The extra room between some of the items is also pretty good for storing hex keys and what-not.The lid latches very securely on both sides and the rods snap very securely easily in and out on the top . Everything in the bottom is loose.Not the cleaning kit for the connoisseur ; but a nice economic kit for the hobbyist that has guns in a number of different common calibers . Pretty good for under $ 30 . ( Also , the shotgun mops and brushes are actually on opposite sides from the picture ; obviously not a big deal and since they are the same size they can pretty much be re-arranged but the mops are actually bigger and have slightly larger slots in the middle . If you try to make it match the picture then the mops might smoosh a little ) Complete list of contents : Thin rod set ( for .17 and .22 ) Freely rotating brass rod with handle - rod length 8 & # 34 ; 10.5 & # 34 ; extension x2 ( 28 & # 34 ; fully assembled useable length ) Thick rod setFreely rotating brass rod with handle -rod length 8 & # 34 ; 10.5 & # 34 ; extension x2 ( 28 & # 34 ; fully assembled useable length ) Thin rod to thick rod adapter ( required for the .22 ) you could possibly use the thick rods to clean a 22 but it would bump against the edges of the barrel for sure .

This 62 piece gun cleaning comes with copper brushes and mops of all sizes ti ft any caliber handgun , rifle and shotgun . It does work great and you can eye which item you need to clean your firearm because the items in the cleaning kit are not marked for what caliber that it is for . It is not a deal breaker but it would be nice if it was labeled . Other wise a must have for cleaning .	1
This product came with everything it advertised . I did have a bit of a problem , but they made good on the sale .	1
I sincerely hope anyone who thinks about buying these uses common sense when reading the two DUBIOUS posts that gave these 1 star . In my opinion ... .they are bogus posts . I have these ... .and here are my findings.1 . They are awkward at first , as with any new skill you try when lifting weights.2 . Someone said he could n't use his `` normal '' weight when doing incline press ... ..if you can do 90 lb incline press WITH DUMBBELLS then these hooks will NOT hamper your ability in doing incline presses with the same weight . That does n't even make sense . However ... .if you never or rarely do certain exercises with dumbbells then yes , you will have to lower the weight ... at first . Anyone who lifts knows if you go from a bar to dumbbells then you will have to take time to get used to each arm lifting independently.3 . Yes ... .it will take a few times to get used to placing your bench just right under the bar that holds the hooks for you . I do not bump the bar when using these . And just like lifting on your own , without a spotter , with a barbell ... ..it 's no different with dumbbells . You need to be able to muscle them back up to hook the bar.4 . They are NOT made to be dropped ! ! ! They are made to hook on the bar when your set is done . I read a review on here that complained that they get banged up or something when you drop the dumbbells . Duh ! You would n't throw your barbell on the floor when you got done bench pressing , would you ? No ... .then why would you think you would throw these on the floor ? It does n't make sense . These hooks are designed to be placed BACK on the bar after your set ... NOT thrown on the floor.5 . They are comfortable ... to me . Unless you do n't find padded material comfortable , you will find them comfortable too . Someone actually said that if you have big hands then you ca n't use these . What ? ? ? ? ? They fit ON THE HANDLE ! If your hands do n't fit around a dumbbell handle then it 's not the hooks fault . They take up ZERO space on the handle , other than adding just a few centimeters in thickness around the handle.6 . In my opinion ... .they also help prevent shoulder injuries from trying to muscle up the dumbbells to their position . There are a few videos on youtube demonstrating these hooks . There is also one that shows how to use chains hanging from a power cage or from rafters in your basement hooked on to these as a spotting system in case you ca n't muscle them back up to rehang them back on the bar . I have the chains hanging from the top of my power cage and attached to the hooks so I can go to exhaustion on my last set without the worry of dropping the weights on the floor .	1
these barbell hooks work great ! just be careful when returning to bar when through with set if your working out alone ! you could miss the bar !	1
Played with this today in fact in our living room . My kids love to make forts out of it with our dining chairs . I think the fabric quality is good , and was what I expected . It has a little vent in the middle so that kids can put it all the way to the floor sitting in it and the air wo n't get stuffy . The 10 feet does n't seem like much until you actually get it out , it 's a surprising nice size .	1
What do you do when you have 4 or more kids of the same age in your house . Here take this parachute and go outside . Putting a ball on the top and letting them bounce it out is a fun game . Or bouncing the ball and trying to keep it on the parachute for a more difficult game . This one is not quite big enough to walk under and pull it down while you are inside . Well it would work for small kids , not with an adult in the group .	1
I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys , as well as for a gift for a girls ' 3rd b-day . I admit that it 's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute . It will be a big hit at any party , playgroup , or get together . All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast . It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play ; turn taking , cooperation , and collective participation . I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play . Get outside and have a blast !	1
This parachute is a lot of fun ! Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it , but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down . He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be , which is a good thing , but unfortunately we actually do n't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home . If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around . But if you have only 3 people to play with , while it still works , it 's more fun with more people . But I guess that 's the way all games/toys should be ! Definitely recommend this for outdoor ( or indoor with a lot of room ) activities with lots of kids !	1
Our dog likes running through tunnels , so this works well for us . He 's a corgi , so he 's short and fits right through it . He does n't like it when it moves on him , though , so we always put something on either side of it so it ca n't roll around .	1
I originally bought this on the advice of people who train puppies in agility skills . Their suggestion was to not buy agility tunnels , but instead , find a decent & afforable tunnel in kid toys . I went with this tunnel based in other buyer reviews and now it 's time I add my own review.I have a now 26 week old pup and did n't want to invest too much in materials if agility ended up not being her cup of tea . As I said , this tunnel came with good reviews for durability and the price was right.Well , turns out she loves training to go through this tunnel , so I just ordered a second one to extend the length . I love that option ! and it 's one of the main reasons I went with this particular tunnel.Now , to be real : I never leave the tunnel out for her to just play with . I am sure she would ruin it ... after all , she is still a pup with a big chew & destroy drive . Fortunately , this tunnel is easy to set up & take down.So for those of you thinking about dog agility training - or not - this product worked out well for me and I can recommend it .	1
This was a fun product . Used to practice your putting . It can be used indoor or outdoor . Hope to use this for a long time .	1
My daughter is qualified to play in the Junior Golf World Championship and she uses putting greens like this to practice at home . I have 5 different models of these electric return putting greens and in my observation , it seems like they are all very similar in quality and construction . The speed on all of them are a little slow , and the plastic is a little cheap and thin . But they do work as far as getting some practice on the tempo and direction of your putt . For the price it is being sold , it is a good deal . Please do not try to compare this to the quality of putting greens 5 times its price . If you want to get one that is an excellent and accurate analog of a real green , expect to pay that much more.I have the professional type of putting which I had ordered and it cost me $ 230 for almost the same dimension as this , and it did not come with an electric ball return .	1
For years we have had putting machines that kick the ball back to you . Great for practice putting when you are bored with everything else . However , putting on your living room carpet is not at all like putting on an undulating green with grass on the course . It is hard to maintain interest for even a avid golfer.The Club Champ Super Sized Electric Putt N ' Hazzard Putting Mat changes that dramatically . First off , it comes with carpet of its own similar to what you find on mini-golf courses , so you do n't have the irregularities of the house carpet textures . It is about 9 feet long so it gives you an opportunity to truly practice . There are 3 destinations the putted ball can reach ... the hole itself , a water hazard ( no water ) , and a sand trap ( no sand ) . If it goes in any of the 3 , the ball is kicked back to you , and it comes back with sufficient force to bring it back the full 9 ' distance.We found that by placing small objects under one or both edges you can make the putting more difficult by requiring the player to take the angles into account so it is not a straight putt any longer . Also , we made the 9 ' runner into small hills to putt over ... all the different layouts made it a fun game for the entire family.It comes with a & # 34 ; & # 34 ; 3D & # 34 ; background of trees , is simple to assemble , and high quality materials . No clubs or balls included.Fun game for ages 4 to 94 ( our household and relatives who have played this in the last few days ) .	1
This is a putting mat with a ball return which is very similar to any putting mat I 've ever used . It has a length of `` green '' which is basically a fuzzy piece of fabric , a slope at the end , 3 features including a ball return . I 've seen many of these putting mats and the inexpensive ones are all pretty much the same price and similar features . I suspect this one costs more because of the ball return feature . Others which do n't have a return and is simply a piece of green fabric with holes would cost less . At the other end of the spectrum you can buy ones costing thousands of dollars . But I digress . For this price , this is not a bad putting mat . It 's got a nice 9ft green , 3 features and the return .	1
I saw a lot of negative reviews for this practice mat , but it looks like they 've updated the device , because it worked really well for me ! First , for the most part , it 's all one piece . The putting mat is all one piece ; there is no gap or attaching of the putting surface . You just unroll it . It 's not the BEST surface ; mine has been unrolled for days , but is still & # 34 ; bumpy & # 34 ; from where it was unrolled . But , it 's all one piece . The only things you need to do is attach the tree-backdrop ( velcro is used here ) , add a sticker for the bottom of the & # 34 ; hole & # 34 ; , and stick in the flag . I noticed the instructions were not applicable to the putting green I received ; the instructions talked about putting the ball-return in place , etc , but really this is plug and play . I did notice a problem with the flag ; the hole that holds it goes down into the ball-return area , so I just do n't use the flag . The neat thing about this is that if you mis-hit a ball into the & # 34 ; water & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; trap & # 34 ; , it feeds the ball into the center area and shoots the ball back at you . It 's a powerful ball-return ; it seems to depend on where the ball is located once the ball-return kicks in . Sometimes the ball would roll back off the mat , sometimes it would make it halfway.It functions just fine . Even with the & # 34 ; bumps & # 34 ; in the mat , I still made good putts . It 's more of a neat toy than a serious practice device : the hole has an incline just before it , so you have to hit the ball harder than you would normally . I had some solid shots get hung up on the incline at the end . Your mis-hits have to be gentle ; I had a few roll up onto the back of the green and roll back down , blocking the path of future hits . Sometimes balls would get hung-up on the ball return area . I would just hit a second ball , and the ball-return would shoot them back out.For the most part , I would recommend this toy . It 's nice to not have to walk back and forth for every shot just to get your ball . The green surface is n't the thickest I 've seen , but it 's OK . It 's a fun distraction rather than a serious training device , and I think it would make a really good gift .	1
My 6 year old is a budding golfer and we got him this putting mat to practice . I like the variety of hazards and that it automatically returns the balls . It is well made , and does n't take up much room to store .	1
Bought this for my son in law for xmas . The guys spent hours practicing in the livingroom . Setup is easy and stores away out of site .	1
Sure this thing has a fun water and sand hazard as well as a flag . It was meant to be fun . Does n't mean you ca n't use this seriously to practice your stroke . The mat is nice and long but does take a while to flatten itself down from it 's initial rolled packaging condition . Unlike other electric putting set , this one has a nice background . I have loads of fun with this thing .	1
One of the two best multi-tools on the market today . ( the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200 ) PROS:1 ) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2 ) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3 ) Useful Chisel blade4 ) Anti-rust finish5 ) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1 ) The file on the `` X '' model seems to be made of aluminum . After some use the `` steel '' plating chipped off . The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2 ) You might break your nails trying to open the blades . *UPDATE* > > I sold sold the `` X '' model and purchased the `` RS '' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade . I like this tool much better now .	1
What first struck me was this thing is heavy compared to 20-30 dollar multi tools I have . Everything fits with surgical precision . The tools snap in place and are steady as a rock . Quality like none other .	1
this tool is awesome and can do most anything , snip wire take anything apart and even a good hammer.I have had mine for a long time and just sent it off to be fixed under warranty got ta love it.this eviscerates the leather man devours the little gerber toys and laughs at the boker 125 years experience makes a perfect tool .	1
In my humble opinion , the best supertool around , and I own probably two dozen of them that I 've collected over the years . The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there , and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle . It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it , including the famous Leatherman . Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other , this took remains head and shoulders above the rest . Next to this , as with a previous reviewer , I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best .	1
I have carried one of these for about seven years and it has proven it 's worth . Recently I lost it and am replacing it with the Spirit version . I want the scissors instead of a serrated knife blade .	1
I have carried one of these on my belt for over 25 years and recently left mine on the tailgate of my pickup and drove off without thinking . I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and could n't go any longer . The price is a little spendy but trust me you wo n't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month . It is extremely well made , engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants . I do n't go 24 hours that I do n't use this tool at least a half dozen times . It has it all and then some . The steel in the blades is exquisite . The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp . I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw . Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime .	1
I bought this tool around 10 years ago to replace my Leatherman Wave . The wave was fine , but after four years of intermittent use the pliers began to loosen and while the blades on the outside began to feel very sticky . After trying to clean it multiple times with various solvents and re-oiling it never felt too good . I have also used a gerber multi-tool but I did n't like it near as much as my Wave.Once I replaced my Wave I felt the Victorinox was just a slightly more expensive tool , but it has proven to be much more . I have used it at least twice a week ( many times much more often ) for the past ten years and it still feels great . The tool closes and stays closed all the blades still lock and are easy enough to remove . The driver set still works great , though many of the bits have been replaced due to wear and tear . The nylon pouch is tearing and is almost ready to be replaced , but this is to be expected after ten years of wearing this tool on my belt . The only problem I have with this tool is that many of the tools are difficult to unfold due to their recessed fit , but this is negligible especially in most cases since this is the tool to use when you do n't have access to real tools . It has saved me on many occasions when my bike breaks down away from home , or anything else that needs a quick tweak . This tool also comes with a lifetime warranty.If you are in the market for a multi-tool I can not recommend this one enough . I also recommend buying one with the extra tools , these ones are easier to use in moments notice and the bits are easily replaced as they are worn out .	1
I own several brands of multitools but Victorinox continues to top my list for its funtionality , smooth deployment , craftsmanship , and durability . Although Leatherman is a far second , I put my trust more in the Victorinox . I have one that Ive owned since 1983 and to this day , its main blade is sharp enough to slice paper floating down in air . Premium grade carbon stainless steel used in making Japanese swords ! The wood saw in it also cuts through lead pipes . Put it this way , if I were lost in the thick jungles of South America , I would choose to have the SwissTool ( rather than any Leatherman and Gerber ) stuck to my belt . Maybe that 's why MacGuyver favors Victorinox .	1
Like many of you , I 've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad . My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s . At that time , Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside . The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this , I got an original Leatherman , figuring I 'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports . This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one : weight . It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed , it is 4-1/2 '' . It seems to weigh about half a pound . Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally ( yay ) or vertically . ( yawn ) Coming from a Leatherman , the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby . It is the same as is on their knives . Just top quality througout . Do n't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily . It does n't matter , because it WILL NOT rust . ( this is unconditional with Victorinox , unlike with many others ) The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk . After that , I noticed that ALL the tools lock , and lock solidly ; not just locked from closing on one 's fingers.After that , I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position . Therefore , when one needs a tool besides the pliers , there is not even the need to open the pliers . ( unlike with the original Leatherman ) This is the real handyman 's multi-tool . Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman . There are no one-handed blades , like on the newer Leatherman Waves , but that is not what this knife is about . ( it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open , as they are so tight & with small opening slots ) Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives . Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with : - # 2 Phillips screwdriver : is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver : it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file : Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things , whether plastic or metal . The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing . The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel : While I do n't use the chisel much , this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base . These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers . These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver : This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver : This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws . It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw : I rarely cut wood with this , but it is also useful for cutting plastic . I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors : As many of you already know , this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness . I 'm glad Victorinox did n't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight . Be sure you 're willing to carry a big , beefy tool . The big quality and functionality are there too . If you do n't want to carry a big , beefy tool , I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade , and realize that it is for comparatively light duty .	1
The victor inbox Multi-Tool is an excellent tool . Every function of this tool is well made ( Quality ) and very useable .	1
I was given this tool some 11 years ago by my wife on the day she announced i was to be a Father , she gave it to me in a box with my daughters name on it to me ... Im a Director Of Engineering at a property , been in this industry for over 25 years . I own more tools than my garage can hold , but i will say this once you feel this tool in your hand and feel the weight and quality and design , youll agree that its WELL made and very well crafted . I have tried Gerbers , and Lethermen but they never hold up for me . This tool is NEVER away from me , I use it and this is no joke , but I use this tool at least 5 times a day . I plan to retire this one real soon due to the `` value `` of it to me personally and Im getting the exact same one again . If I can get over 11 years use out of any tool its a hell of a deal ...	1
First trip , I filled 2/3 of this cooler with ice then lay it on its side on a roof rack . A day later , I got it off the top of the car and although some ice had melted , I was amazed that nothing leaked from the lid . Filled the cooler up with water at that point and 2 days later , still had a little bit of ice.Second trip , filled about 1/3 with ice and water to about 3/4 full . Next day , most of the ice was gone even though outside temps were about the same as trip # 1.So now I know not to skimp on ice ( I already do n't like drinking water so if I have to it better be ice cold ) but I 'm impressed the lid holds so securely . The spout is easy to operate with one hand and our 5-year old has no problems with it . Handles feel sturdy and are comfortable enough to carry a full jug with just one .	1
This is a very big water cooler that is handy to have around for gatherings and outdoor events . I fill it with ice tea for BBQ 's in my backyard and have gotten a lot of good use out of it . Build quality is excellent and construction is sturdy . A grown adult can even sit on this with no problem . It 's a nice , attractive bright orange color that 's fun to look at and easy to spot . The side has a cup holder , but I never use it as it 's clumsy to keep attached.The spigot is easy to push and automatically shuts off when its released . It enables one-handed operation : use your fingers to grip the cup and your thumb to push the spigot , important when you 're trying to juggle several things at once . The spigot does not leak or drip . Because the spigot is positioned low on the unit , you do have to place the cooler on the edge of a table or other raised surface so you can get a cup under it . Gravity draws liquid out.I 'm very satisfied with this cooler .	1
Very durable construction . Just like I remember as a kid at soccer games this cooler will be for my kids to drink out of at their soccer games . The spout is so easy to operate my 5 year old can use it . Will probably buy some more of these for camping .	1
Works well , no problems . I like that the cap screws on and stays on . It does not spill in the car .	1
Sturdy enough . Top is easy to remove . I have seen no leaking issues so far , whatsoever , and it gets some pretty harsh use . The handles are on there good as well .	1
I was thinking of buying a pool float to use as my camping mat and I found a great deal . $ 10 for an air mattress SOLD ! Luckily for me I have an air pump with me when i go canoe camping because my canoe is inflatable . If I did n't i would Not get this , as it is VERY hard to inflate . Because I have a foot pump it takes me 5-10 minutes to pump this up and for $ 10 it works for me.If you have a pump then this will do for your camping or pool needs . If you do n't then I would not get it as it is VERY hard to inflate.Others said its also hard to deflate , i found if you cut/puncture the inner seal and just let it deflate on its own its fine .	1
These pool floats are the best design by far . Wide enough that it 's easy to climb off and on in the deepest water , extremely stable in operation . All around a great product . Unfortunately , like all of these plastic floats they eventually spring a leak and are very difficult to repair . The provided repair kits are practically useless . But great while it lasts .	1
Bought 3 of these for the pool and they are very well made and best part is WIDE . You should have an inflater though to fill these . Love the way they roll up even when inflated unlike others that are stiff . They are thin but this allows water to enter the top of raft for cooling and roll up for storage without deflating .	1
I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress , but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It 's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together , but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat ( 29 vs. 20 inches , and that nine inches makes a great difference ) . I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve , but it 's a small price to pay for light weight , portability and comfort . If it were sold as an outdoor mat , I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product . After all , neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak , but for the comfort , it ca n't be beaten . Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in ...	1
Most sleeping bag pads are either paper thin foam OR big bulky blow up mattresses OR very expensive auto blowup thin padsTHESE 2 inch thick mattresses blow up reasonably stiff , are not huge bulky things are cheap and very comfortable and are quite large for their bulk . Much larger than any sleeping bag . I was amazed at how well they supported my 6ft 250lb frame . and the pillow is an added bonus.EXCELLENT value in sleeping bag pads	1
I bought this for my 8 year old son last year for his birthday , and it 's been a ton of fun . First , I had my first trac ball set in the early to mid 80s so I never experienced the styrofoam balls some are discussing . So , while the balls from my old set looked very similar - textured , hollow yellow plastic - they weighed quite a bit less than these modern versions.The hardest part to get across to my kids is that you need to be pretty agressive in putting spin on the ball in order for it to curve or `` float '' . But my kids love it and I still find it a ton of fun . THe quality seems pretty much the same as the old set , which is nice to see . The `` raquets '' are plastic and it would be pretty easy to break them if you do n't take care of them.On a side note : this goes back a few years , but did any other Trac Ball fans notice a raquet ( painted silver ) in The Phantom Menace - hanging in the shop on Tattooine where Anakin worked ? I think that says something about the thought and imagination that went into TPM , but I 'll leave it at that .	1
Our game friends wanted to add this game to their game pantry , so we made this purchase on their behalf , and we have had no personal experience with product , but our friends have made no negative comments about it to date , so we hope they are having fun with it as they expected . Blessings .	1
Bought to put in the RV for camping toys , but use it in the yard often . May need to buy a second set . That ball flies and curves like no bodies business !	1
I love this game and its even more fun with 4 people . Great product . Surprised no one has hurt them selves with it and got it banned : )	1
This is a simple , but fun , game . It 's also very durable . We bought a similar-looking game ( not Wham-o brand ) from the 99 cent store and it literally lasted about 30 minutes before both rackets and the ball were all cracked/broke . So far we have n't had that problem with this Wham-o one .	1
This net is great ! It is well made with a strong tube steel , adjustable frame . It launches balls back at you and makes goal shot practice a snap . I bought this for my son but have been using it more than him lately !	1
I bought this for my daughter 's birthday . It took a bit of time to set up , but it was worth it . She practices for hours with this rebounding net . A set of metal stakes keeps it securely in the ground for kick after kick . This might just be my favorite purchase of the year .	1
It does n't look super quality but it 's been very good for several months in the garden . it gets the sprinklers every night and no sign of damage to it . I hope it lasts a long time	1
I just received this item a few days ago and it 's well on its way toward being a kitchen favorite . I followed the directions for seasoning , cooked some eggs on it this morning and they did not stick ! It was great to do scrambled eggs on one end and over-easy on the other . Around 25 years ago , I got my first cast iron fry pan . What an ordeal to season it ! This is already performing beautifully and can only get better !	1
I have a cheap gas stove and I always wanted one of those expensive versions . ( You know the one 's on everyone 's TV kitchen ) ... This griddle cooks pancakes , french toast , cheese sandwiches and eggs on the smooth side wonderfully . Just kick the burners on high , let it warm up , knock them back to medium until its hot evenly and throw the food on . Do n't worry about heating an empty pan , Cast iron can take it . When a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready . ( Smoking is too hot , duh ! ) The other great use is to put it in the oven , turn the broiler/oven on and let it heat up . Then toss on the steaks , ribs , or fish ! Yum ! The Lodge seasoning is ok for that first time cooking . You do need to wash off the manufacturing dirt , and a good coat of oil is a good way to start that carbon buildup.On the down side , the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots . There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate . If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove , it sets in just right . But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well . The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them . ( These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate ) ( I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store . I think they were `` storm '' grates . In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove . Also Lodge has a 8 '' castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well . ) It is heavy , yup . It does n't fit in my sink very well , but then if you 've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill , he does it right on the stove . So while the giddle is hot , give it a good scrape with the spatula , and wipe it with a paper towel . You 'll get 90 % of the food/grease off the pan . Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest . ( In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things . ) Also if you cook bacon , or other high fat food , it splatters . Since the lip is low , it does n't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does . More stove cleanup ... While it grills ok on the stove top , It 's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker . You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke . ( Well yeah ) Also if you plan on using it inside your oven , measure first ! Not all ovens are 20 '' wide inside . ( I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that 's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true . Took about 5 years of off and on cooking to do it , and 10 to become perfect . Grandma 's pans went to my mother so I had to season my own pans myself . This pan because of the dual sided cooking only took about a month to equal that old fry pan .	1
I DO N'T KNOW WHAT SOME REVIEWERS ARE USED TO- BUT I 'VE FOUND THESE BINOCS TO BE IDEAL FOR MY PURPOSES..I BOUGHT THEM FOR A FUTURE CRUISE AND HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING CLOSE IN PRICE/QUALITY . THESE ARE MORE COMPACT-HAVE A BETTER FIELD OF VIEW-AND ARE AT LEAST HALF THE COST OF OTHER BRANDS . I CAN SEE CACTUS NEEDLES AT 50+ YARDS . SOMEONE NEEDS TO CONVINCE ME THAT HIGHER PRICED OPTICS ARE SUPERIOR IN PERFORMANCE ... THEN MAYBE I 'LL RISK DROPPING THEM OVERBOARD .	1
I ordered these because I wanted a pair to carry in my vehicle that were small , but powerful enough to be useful . The glass quality is very good considering the price and is appropriate for what I wanted them for . Obviously the glass is not comparable to higher end optics , but these are great if you want a small pair that are reasonably price .	1
Easy to use and gives very good resolution at high magnifications . Its great if like to watch birds as well cause image is still bright at high magnification .	1
I have nothing bad to say about these binoculars.I use them at work to watch ships movements in and out of the bay.They are light , easy to handle , and are clear during bad weather.Good optics . You ca n't go wrong.I have dropped them once . A fall of about 3 feet - all is well !	1
i ordered this and very happy ... arrived on time and in good condition..instructions although written very small type it is unstandable..enjoy..will order again if necessary . tks	1
This fits my Sig P220 and Glock 30 perfectly . It 's snug around the trigger guard preventing accidental access , what I was looking for .	1
It does the job and the price is right . It 's kind of wide so it would n't work inside a custom fitted case .	1
I 've had one of these in use for nearly a dozen years and it is a solidly constructed , reliable locking device for use on the trigger guard of even a very large frame revolver . I always recommend putting firearms in a safe or locked gun cabinet ( secured to a wall , floor , or both ) , but these kind of trigger locks added to unloaded firearms are an excellent backup , and keep unauthorized fingers away from triggers.Rim-fire guns , and a lot of vintage center-fire guns are best never dry-fired . Using a trigger lock can help prevent accidental damage by people who just do n't know better . Of all of the different types of trigger and action locks I 've employed , this one is the most ruggedly constructed and durable model I 've owned .	1
The lock is well built but it is too thick to fit in the Stack-On PDS-500 safe with Glock 19 . It 's not the lock fault .	1
Requied in Calif for all firearm purchases and trasnportation . If you live in a & # 34 ; Nanny State & # 34 ; , this is the exact thing you 'll need.Price was right.Would buy from this seller again . A+ .	1
Wow , for the price I was expecting total crap.I was really surprised by how heavy duty this thing is , and how well made the keys are . When this thing is on you 're gon na have a pretty tough time getting it off if you do n't have a key.One thing I 'll note though ( and this is not related to this product ) but a design flaw with these is that if you attach one you 're not 100 % in the clear as it literally takes 1 minute to unscrew the trigger guard from most guns re-exposing the trigger . This is definitely the case for my Remington 700 as anyone who actually wants to shoot the gun but does n't have the key can just unscrew the hinged floor plate assembly and reattach a new one without this thing on it . That 's why I also got one of those long locks that goes through the action .	1
Not a substitute for a proper locker or safe , but an excellent backup and transportation measure . Secure , simple , wo n't scratch your finish , wo n't take up unnecessary space . And if you find it easier to remember a few numbers than it is to keep track of a bunch of little keys , this is a must .	1
I 've been an NRA Instructor since '94 and I 'd like to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and not one reflected by the NRA entity . I am a firm believer that the BEST `` safety '' is a well trained and disciplined shooter . I happen to like this product for a few specific uses . When traveling it may be good to have to have an extra layer or margin of security on the trigger . Yes , in some cases a firearm may still be fired with this on , and yes ALL locks are defeatable . BUT if the firearm in question is not going to be in a situation where an individual can fiddle with defeating this lock for a period of time it may be for you . Will it prevent theft ? Probably not . Does it hinder use when in a heightened threat level , Yes . I personally like to travel with a steel lock box to stow away a loaded at-the-ready firearm . But depending on an individuals comfort and perceived threat situation this will vary . Once again , this is a personal opinion and hopefully you will take it for what it is ... additional information . As far as the build quality and ease of use go it is a very good value for the money that is why I am giving it 5 stars . I know that some reviewers have given it lower due to personal use philosophy which I 'm not going to do since that is an individual variable .	1
I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run ! No need to try and look for a tiny key . In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them . Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him ... THAT EASY ! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially . Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key ! No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day !	1
Great trigger lock . I keep it on my gun at all times . I can get this off in a matter of seconds if I need to.You can change the combination very easily . Well made item . I do n't see how you would be able to break this off or open without combination.Keeps your gun safe but ready for quick action if needed . Nuff said .	1
I bought five and four worked well . I have them and depend on them every day . They work fine . The fifth -- oh well ! It just did n't work and I did n't care . ( Too much ) .	1
Strong , reliable lock . Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock , involving complex curves in three dimensions , of all weather Benjamin Trail . No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals . Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun , but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with .	1
I used this to lock the BB gun I have on the wall . I remember what it 's like to be a kid .	1
This is a great product . I did n't realize how much I would like the combo lock . Nice to have to keep track of keys .	1
For people who have n't seen one of these : it 's pretty darn awesome . The picture makes it look plastic , but this is solid metal . Sturdy . Heavy . I put this on my Mossberg and even though it wo n't fit behind the trigger , it still locks on there tight . Adjusting it to my own combo was difficult because the last dial was difficult to turn when I was putting in the new combo . With a little persistence , I was able to get the right number.NOTES ON GUN SAFETY : Better to pay $ 10 now for this product than thousands in court fees ( or worse ) down the road .	1
I use this for my home defense pistol . Hardly any play once it 's tightened down , but you will need to give it some good force to tighten . Works great !	1
Heavy , seems very well made and fits nicely . Setting your own combination is easy once I found something that fit the pinhole .	1
It works great and conforms to many different shapes and sizes of firearms . Works perfect and easy to use .	1
The title says it all . The fit and finish is nothing to write home about , but it will keep your firearm safe during transport . The only real downside is the limited number of combos available , but for the price that 's a minor issue .	1
Better than nothing.. Yes I bet someone can figure out how to get this off but it would take some time . This ca n't be your only means of securing a weapon but it is better than nothing and a 2nd security if say you did n't have a great safe.. Or maybe a 2nd thought if someone did get access .	1
I 've transitioned to using these on each firearm , for their ease of use , so I do n't have to worry about mixing up keys . They serve a purpose , so use them accordingly . These should not be used on a loaded gun , especially if the installation wo n't allow the bar to fit behind the trigger .	1
I 'm very impressed with the Master Lock 3-digit combination trigger lock . It fits well on the various firearms I own , without any tendency to scratch or mar my expensive weapons.As a test , I took one of these and tried to pry it open using pliers and various other tools ( of course , not when it was attached to one of my firearms ! ) . Only way I found to open it was using a large diamond tipped drill bit to punch through the side of the unit . Still , I suspect that when attached to a firearm , the weapon would definitely be damaged by this sort of forced removal . Compared to the typical locks shipped by gun manufacturers , I 'd say it 's at least as secure.Otherwise , I found it easy to set whatever code I want , and to operate the lock . I could get it on or off my firearms in just a few moments , with one hand if I needed to . Feels to me that Master Lock has the right combination of security and accessibility here.Definitely recommended .	1
Work great on the shotgun and is a lot easier to use over the cables you normally buy to look through the receiver . If you need a lock this is the one to get ! ( plus I never have to worry about losing a key anymore with a combination )	1
Fits great on wasr.Grabs trigger guard firmly , does n't allow lock to move around.If you do n't want to fuss with keys but want peace of mind with quick access , this is a great choice .	1
Awesome gun lock .	1
These look nice , are well made and it is great having a combination vs. having to carry around a little key . I definately recommend them as it works well .	1
Exactly what I wanted and expected ! Fits and locks both my 12-gauge and my full size .45 ... ..great price for a quality product , and shipment came quickly ! Highly recommended !	1
I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using . Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking . I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes . Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes , how easier can it be , I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this ... .Silly me for forgetting ...	1
A must if you need to safeguard your weapon , no need to fumble looking for keys especially in an emergency .	1
This is a great trigger lock that serves the purpose of keeping accidents from happening . Nothing can prevent better than a safe , but this is an extra precaution . I	1
Ideal product for securing long guns . I use these for my shotguns that I transport in a soft case , Highly recommended	1
I do n't have anything amazing to say about this . It does what it is intended to do with no problems . I gave it 5 stars because I have nothing bad to say about it and the price was good .	1
I bought these locks with combos . So in an emergency if I could not get to the keys I could do the combo . But in the dark you ca n't see the numbers maybe a light up lock combo would be better	1
Fits HK USP & P220 well . Seems sturdy and locking mechanism is smooth . Would consider this in the future for other models .	1
I ordered a few of these and they work great . They fit all different sizes of guns . I have them on pistols as well as rifles and shot guns . Definitely worth the money .	1
fits almost all my firearms in one way or another ( from one side or the other ) . easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit . much safer then keys that can be lost . i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed . i have them on almost all my firearms . not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is . buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100 .	1
I appreciate a combination vs a key because I know I ca n't loose a combination . I use the first 3 digits of my ATM PIN number so I do n't have to worry about forgetting it either ; - ) .	1
well made product - just what I needed to make me feel secure with my purchases . first time gun owner .	1
Nice little trigger lock.Now if we could get the NRA to stop blocking their use we 'd all be safer .	1
great price and locks work great with the weapons I use them on . I wonder if criminals use gun locks at home ?	1
Great combo lock , provides all my 1911 's and .40cal 's perfectly . virtually tamper-proof , a must have when you do n't like having keys to lose .	1
This is a quality lock and I like the combo feature . No need to go searching or fumble for keys . The lock is easy to use and fits my weapons without issues . I would absolutely recommend this product .	1
This lock is easy to install and remove . better than the keyed version . Also the changeable combination is a plus . I will definitely recomend this lock to my friends .	1
These are great for legal compliance and peace of mind . I have a bunch of them so I can lock up multiple guns.My only complaint is that it does n't seem to fit on my M & P ; handgun .	1
I would recommend this item if you have fire arms . It works on hand guns and rifles . No need for a key and it 's quick remove , when needed . It is very sturdy .	1
I have a them on all my firearms and am very please with them no key to worry about or lose	1
Got this for my remington 870 tactical shotgun . I switched out the trigger lock that came witht he gun since I changed the stock to a mesa tactical stock with pistol grip and the OEM lock would n't fit anymore . Easy combo lock , better than using a key in my opinion . Sits a bit loose but it 'll do its job , does n't hit the safety that is on the trigger guard . it should work fine for rifles and pistols .	1
This lock gets harder and harder to find in stores . I remember picking up one from Cabela 's last year , and ended up loving it so much I went back to buy a few more ; they were gone . I made a few trips back and forth a a few other stores in the area over the next few months and all I could find was the keyed version of this lock . Went to Amazon , and there it was for the same price and ordered a few more . I highly recommend these , but also hope you use your own personal judgment as far as gun safety and security . I am not really good at keeping up with extra keys , so I opted for these as it would allow me to unlock them in the event that I ever lost the keys . For home security , I have a weapon that is more readily accessible to me , and I use these locks on guns that I store away .	1
I bought several of these because I 'd moved onto base housing . That required me to either have a trigger lock or a locked case to transport a weapon on and off base . These were cheap , they are easy to set the combo and they are solid . A trigger lock is just that , its not offer the speed of the quick release lock boxes or the safety of an actual safe . But they do add a degree of safety by locking the movement of the trigger on most weapons . Keep in mind there are weapons this will not work well on like lever action rifles , ARs with folding trigger guards and the like . As mentioned I went with these because Master Lock makes good locks and because I could set the combo to what I wanted . That means all the combos can be set to something easy to remember and changed later if I wish . The price is very good and there is nothing I can really complain about . A good product that works well if it fits your need .	1
Best trigger lock available in the market . Highly recommended for all shooters . I have it on my all of my firearm .	1
I love it so much I bought more . It is a great combination lock works on all type of firearms . Safety , safety . You ca n't go wrong , great price , for a great product .	1
I purchased two locks to provide an additional level of security on both a full size rifle and a Ruger 10/22 . I selected the Master Lock combination model because it will allow me to keep firearms secured without having to keep track of a key . For those gun owners who want to balance the always-never dilemma ( always have ready access but never allow unauthorized users access ) , this product works extremely well . Despite customer complaints about setting the locks , I the process to be extraordinarily easy . I had both locks reset and on their respective rifles in just a couple minutes.I will continue to use these locks for any firearm which is not already secured in a suitably locked hard-case .	1
this is an great product to secure and make safe your pistol against unauthorized use specially buy minors . this is excellent for those who keep pistol beside their bed .	1
I love this lock . No more worrying about losing keys . I 've used this on a number of different types of firearms without any issues . In short it 's worked for my needs .	1
Locks securely , if used right.However I realized that I do n't use it most of the time since it adds so much to the gun thickness that the gun does n't fit in my Plano case . Would be good for folks who need extra layer of security because of kids at home or other reasons .	1
Easy to set and use good proce	1
I like the combination and it works real smooth . Do n't like having to carry around keys . For a few more dollors it 's worth it .	1
I bought this for my brother as he was always complaining about losing the key to his trigger lock . It fits very nicely on his Remington 870 express . It performs flawlessly with ease and it 's nice to have one less key to worry about . I will be buying this lock again , no question about it .	1
I bought the Master Lock 94DSPT 3-Digit Combination Gun Lock for all my firearms and they work on all the handguns , rifles and shotguns plus my High Powered Pellet Rifle and BB Gun . I wrote to Master Lock to get this lock DOJ approved and if they can it would be the best bang for buck in protecting your firearms . As always Amazon was priced competitive with on time delivery .	1
the lock pulls and connects from the back of it and it fits nice and snug over the trigger and guard . and the setting your own number works fine as well . easy to understand instructions and good weight and quality of product .	1
I really liked the product = inexpensive , easy to use , seemingly well made , excellent visual deterrent , etc ... But I just could n't make it `` work '' on my Walther P99 . Maybe because of the bilateral magazine releases , maybe because of the shape of the trigger guard , who knows ... If it `` fits '' your pistol it 'll probably be perfect for your needs ...	1
Quality gun lock that I can feel confident about . Purchased one for a Remington shotgun and one for an M & P9 pistol . Easy to set combination and stay secure and tight on firearms .	1
This was purchased for my S & W ; M & P ; .40 handgun . It can take a little bit to get it on JUST RIGHT , but once you find that perfect position , it 's gold . Numbers are n't the smoothest , but it does what it is intended to do . Like I said , just take a little bit of time to set it up.Overall , I 'm pleased with the extra level of safety I now have when transporting it in the car , and you just ca n't beat the price and fast shipping !	1
I use these combo lock trigger locks on a lot of guns . Really like them . Fit well . Easy to set combination . And you never have a key to lose . Works on handguns , rifles , shotguns , assault rifles . Happy with it .	1
I keep a trigger lock on all firearms when transporting them or they are not in the safe . This model works very well and is easy to put on and take off .	1
I bought 3 of these to replace the key locks on my weapons . No more having to look for the key or need to turn on the light . If you preset the combo off open , you can open this in the dark . I also like the rubberized center contacts that prevent scratching the finish .	1
Kids find keys . A scary enterprise for sure . Ca n't shoot the gun even if you do find my key . Easy enough to use reset and keep out kids	1
It 's a MasterLock , not some cheap knockoff and it 's pretty strong . It does n't however fit my S & W M & P 15-22 trigger too well , but it works ok . I do wish that the numbers were easier to spin in both directions and I did n't realize I was ordering a pack of 2 locks ...	1
I have just ordered three more of these locks . I already have one and I am very happy with it . I am especially happy with the fact that I do not need to carry keys to unlock my firearms . The keyed locks are sturdy and reliable ; however , all it took was one occasion when I forgot to bring the key and could not shoot.Not only are these locks more convenient , they fit my Yugo M57 Tokarev ! I have several different pistols/revolvers and so far these locks fit every one.Though I am very pleased with these locks , I rated them a four-star . I did this because it would be nice if these locks were available in a multipack . Paying about 9 dollars a shot for them is a bit much ...	1
This protects you gun from firing . I know the warnings say otherwise but I hammered at the thing trying to get my shotgun trigger to click and it never budged . Perfect for home defense ( my reason ) as I need no key , no one else can get my key ( kids etc ) and I can access my gun when needed . Combination is the way to go , why worry about getting an expensive case or safe if unless you have a collection .	1
I got three of these and placed them on my guns within a few minutes . Nothing too shabby or great about these . The old saying & # 34 ; locks keep honest people honest & # 34 ; applies here . I just want to make it difficult for somebody to hurt themselves or others . I 'm not a freak about home invasions and think I need access to a semi-auto rifle within 5 seconds . I 'll turn on the lights , unlock my gun , and get to clearing the house .	1
Decent quality , and semi quick access to your firearm.The only issue , I think it would only take a day or so to figure out someones code and reset it . But heck.. if it gives crooks a harder time gaining access to YOUR firearm while you 're not around . I 'd get a few more if i felt inclined I guess .	1
Well , it does what it 's supposed to do . I love it and it will protect from my little ones shooting my gun so that 's all I care about . Great construction though ... very sturdy . This is one investment that should last you a long time ... .if not a lifetime .	1
I 'm very pleased with my choice to buy this lock , Sturdy construction with smooth edges so my rifle/ trigger guard wo n't get scratched . Would n't hesitate to by again .	1
This lock fit my mauser just right . It was easy enough to set the combination and get the rifle secured . As far as I can tell , this lock will completely secure the rifle from use while attached . I cant imagine the kids could break it , but given long enough , and through process of elimination they could guess the combo .	1
going to get two more , great for locking up in the home or on the move in the car , easy to use and easy to remove do n't have to find another key ,	1
a little klunky -- it does the job and the price was nice . It only took a few minutes to program the code	1
This is a good sturdy lock for the price . I use this on both my handguns and rifles . This is much better then using the cable locks that require a key . If you have ever went to the shooting range with your guns and forgot to bring the lock keys you know what I mean ! The only reason I did n't give this product 5 stars is that it sticks out quite a bit once the lock is engaged . No big deal but if your tight on safe space this can be a problem .	1
So easy to use and fast to remove .	1
This product does an excellent job of what it was designed to do . . . namely , prevent a child or a person not yet trained in the proper use or handling of a handgun from being able to accidentally pull the trigger . It should go without saying that the handgun should not be loaded with live ammunition when this lock is in place . Once you move the lock around , with the lock bar positioned behind the trigger , and try a few different positions for the lock , it is easy to find the most secure position for this lock on your specific firearm . The three-digit combination is simple to use , easy to re-set to a new combination , if needed , and there are no keys to lose or find on an already over-crowded key ring . The lock case and lock bar are very strong and well-made , yet the inside of the lock that touches your handgun 's finish is soft and non-marking . All in all , it is an excellent product , and I recommend it highly -- for its intended use .	1
While trigger locks are not intended to make a gun safe ( you can still place a round in the chanber of most firearms ) , They can act and serve as a deterrent to the use of the firearm . The lock easily attaches to the trigger guard of all firearms . It is only effective on firearms with fixed trigger guards . I prefer a combination lock because it eliminates the need for keeping a keyring with multiple keys . I keep and store each of my firearms with one of these combination locks .	1
These hold up well . they do n't remain white for long , at least if left outside they yellow a bit . but they hold up well . Have had them for a season and there 's no obvious deterioration or ripping of the bases so far .	1
This is a good product for the money but as the other reviews mentioned , a little thin . So I would n't leave them outside . Overall they are perfect for light use and we like them . Still a good value .	1
Very good quality item that will last for several years . My grandson loves it and uses it often . You will not be disappointed .	1
Nice heavy duty base set . Could n't believe they were as well made as they are . I was expecting something a bit cheeper , but was pleased when they arrived . The kids love them !	1
We 've only had these for 6 practices and one game . They 've been holding up great with all those little cleats running over them . I like that they are thicker & heavier than other brands I considered . However , I would n't use metal cleats on a rubber product . Really , for the same price there are many products which are inferior as far as thickness & durability go . Also , the & # 34 ; tread & # 34 ; on the bottom helps keep the bases in place . Obviously , if the grass is wet or the dirt is dry , they 're going to slip ... these are n't designed to compare to a secured base . Do n't have unrealistic expectations . Still , I 'm loving our set & think it should make it through the season . They fit in one of my baseball gear bags , but then it becomes too heavy & no room for helmets or catcher 's gear . Got a collapsable wagon for the bases , tee , net , & gear bag . Some have complained about not having a pitchers mound . It 'd be a nice inclusion , but for tee ball , we do n't need it . Besides , temporary mound rubber would only mark distance , not give a push off point . I 'd like one , but it does n't seem real necessary for the price .	1
These are a great buy - very weighted down so they do n't slide too easily but light enough for kids to easily transport themselves . These are our favorite bases , I highly recommend them .	1
I use these with a team of 13 little leaguers that are 7-8 years old . We use these before every game and every practice and the boys run around them 4 times per event . So , that 's about 50 touches per event . We 've had about 30 practices and games so that 's about 1500 touches so far . They 're getting real dirty but they are n't breaking and I 'm very pleased with them . They 're quite heavy but that 's necessary to make them last . I am very happy with them . They make a great warm-up station . Have your kids run around them and practice their base rounding technique , checking for signs from the 3B coach as they run , etc ... I like being able to set them at a shorter distance so we do n't tire the kids . We 're just warming up . After two round trips we do a full round trip doing shuffle steps and then we finish w/ a & # 34 ; 4 step combo & # 34 ; which is a run to first , shuffle to 2B , back pedal to 3B and criss-cross to home . It is far better than running out and touching the outfield fence .	1
We use these all the time for travel and rec baseball . I 've used them indoors and at the park for practices , these are a must have as they are heavy solid construction . Buy these over any of the light weight $ 20 base sets .	1
These bases are very nice for the price , even if they were cost a little more.They are very thick rubber , with a waffle design on the bottom . i coach my sons baseball team , and these have held up very well for 2 seasons of practices . These are MUCH nicer than the thinner version of these bases , which tear after a couple practices with kids running on them with cleates .	1
I purchased this for my son to practice with in the back yard . The bases are well made and will easily hold up over time .	1
Both my girlfriend and I use Fireline on our weekly outing to the Sacramento River . We use the 8lb . Fireline paired up with the 6lb . P-Line CFX fluorocarbon for a leader . This past week she caught a 20 pound king salmon with a 1/2oz . Kastmaster and the setup held up without a problem for nearly 30 minutes ( the time it took to bring the fish in ) . The fish was released being it was out of season , but this line will forever be kept on our reels . I 've snagged my treble hooked lures many times and been able to pull it free , only to find out the hook is bent downward , and that 's with 8lb . Fireline . If it 's strong enough to bend a hook before the line breaks , it 's strong enough to bring in nice sized fish . We 've tried PowerPro and find the stuff to be junk . As others have noted , the stuff breaks when you least expect it . Even a normal cast and your lure will fly into oblivion while you stand there with an O-face and think `` wtf ! '' Also , wind knots seem to be much more prominent with that stuff . Nothing good ever came out of that line for us . Fireline is the braid of choice for us and with a proper leader , it can make a deadly setup .	1
I have n't used theBerkley Fireline 125-Yard Fishing Linein the 6/2-Pound Smoke for fishing yet , but it is the best for beading projects , particularly those with faceted beads like crystals or stones . I double the line and first wipe it through a paper towel , then run it through beeswax after threading my needle . I never knot this superline when beading , but use silk or nylon thread in those cases . Amazon sells this product for much less than any other source I 've found . I also can recommend theBerkley Hot Line Cutterwhich does an outstanding job of cutting and melting the fireline when a project is completed .	1
I 've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years , and it works great for when you 're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects ; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this , and I 've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers , but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread , and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it 's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website !	1
Simple review ; I LOVE IT ! Believe me , I looked all over the internet , looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc . This is what I found and what I purchased . It 's the best ! . Buy it , no hassle , easy to use , comes in a handy bag with all the goodies . The steady view ( IS ) is AMAZING ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's like a digital camera that you focus .	1
Excellent optics . Image stabilization works well but do n't expect miracles . Note that you must hold the IS button down , it 's not an on/off switch . That said , the best binoculars I have ever used . I bought a 2nd pair as a gift .	1
These kick ass , they work as described I just wish they had more magnification , the stead button is a major bonus , just wish they had color action like fde , desert tan	1
I chose this rating because the binoculars are as they were described . They work well and were at a price I was willing to spend . These certainly are expensive enough .	1
I 've had these bino 's for a few years and they continue to impress me . They were a bit expensive but the image stabilization was worth it . I estimate they allow me to see objects clearly of unit with double the power . I use them at auto races , birdwatching , and other sporting events . Highly recommended .	1
Very quality glass , Crystal clear . I use these for hunting and bird watching . They are incredibly stable when using the IS mode .	1
Bought these as a gift for my mom . She still goes on about how great they are . In her backyard it 's like watching a documentary on birds with the auto stabilization on . What did people do before IS ? ! Thinking about buying a second pair for myself !	1
Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball . But two flaws stood out right away . The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated . I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball . Not a hard job , but one I did n't suspect I would need to do . The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the `` Made in China '' stamp . I find it hard call this a replica ball when it 's not made of leather nor made in the USA . That all said , the ball is really cute . We tossed it around the yard today . I got it specifically for my 2 year old son . He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball . Now that he has his own , fit for his small hands , he is so very happy . As I write this review , he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him .	1
This is the perfect size for a toddler and is of great quality . There 's some really cheapo small footballs and this one is NOT one of them .	1
Good for kids and adults with small hands I guess . We enjoy the football . Good size , not too big not too small .	1
bought this one over other because it has the rubber wheels , the other were plastic and does n't go very well over gravel driveway . This has steel frame and nice paint job . The seat and handle bars are all adjustable for different proportions . All in all , good product that I suspect will last even with my tornado of a son .	1
Every kid has a tricycle , do n't they ? Well , it 's such a standard toy it almost seems so . My boy just had his third birthday so I got him a trike . It was a Radio Flyer Classic and was all decked out in red , white and chrome . Nice toy . Just as I remember from my own childhood . I got it at Toys `` R ' Us . Too bad I did n't check Amazon as I could have saved twenty bucks plus tax.The Trike came in a box and took about 10 minutes to assemble . Real simple . When he first saw it he was afraid . That did n't last long . I rang the bell a couple times and his interest was piqued . The next day we went to a neighborhood playground and tested it . First , the trike was a little too big for him . It specified 2 1/2 to ? , but his legs were n't quite long enough . With the seat all the way down , his feet wo n't stand flat on the ground and with his feet on the pedals , they are n't quite long enough . No major problem . He 'll grow . It 's just a matter of a couple more months . I sat him on the seat and put his feet on the pedals and pushed him around the basketball court . He loved it , although his steering is going to take some training . In any case , it was a success and he wanted more.The trike is quite handsome and well built . I would j/udge that it would last and last . Some people complain about stability and I can understand . That just seems inherent in trikes . There 's going to be a certain amount of bruises and scuffs . That 's just part of childhood , is n't it ? Gary Peterson	1
Our three year old has one of these . It is by far his favorite riding toy . He must have spent 50 hours riding it in the past year . It is very well built with strong materials . Other than a little wear it looks like new . It has been kept outside under the patio cover about 1/2 the time and the other 1/2 in the garage.He parked it behind our boat trailer a couple of weeks ago and I backed the trailer and bent the rear wheel . I was able to easily order a new wheel from Radio Flyer and had it fixed in a few minutes after the wheel arrived.Great product .	1
Found the tricycle to be fairly easy to assemble . Should not be a problem for anyone with a hammer , wrench , and screwdriver . Once assembled , the unit is quite sturdy . My older grandchild was standing on the rear platform while the younger one pedaled . Not a problem . Also looks very sharp . Just tighten the seat bolt well . Highly recommended ... .	1
This is the best knife I ever had.I was n't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large . It flicks open easily and locks up firmly . The blade stays sharp . It continues to work like and look like new . You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages . The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties .	1
this knive is a great knife , solid lockup -- THIS is the original with the arc-sog lock . beware , lots of currently made sogs are taiwan ( mine was seki ) ; the new sogs are S*** . they are shoddy metal and plastic , and the lockup is now linear , which is weak and flimsy . would not recommend a new one . get an old one like the one i got a few yrs ago	1
I own several other SOG knives . This is the largest I have . It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring `` flip out '' operation . This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others . But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand . It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives , the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong . The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I wo n't need it . If I should need it however , it 's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products . This is a more `` handsome '' looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades , but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner .	1
Double bladed , my only gripe is the blade 's a tad short . Most manufacturers of great knives do n't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges , but SOG . The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife , but a little on the smallish side . Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money . Chances are you 'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great , too , but too many of these outfits want $ 7 or $ 8 to send you a $ 45 knife ! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales . At least on smaller items .	1
INTROI needed a utility knife for deployments , and since I went to Haiti , I found this to be the perfect tool . The knife clip is secure and is stable on my web belt ( It is reversible , if you are a left handed user ) . The weight of this knife is evenly balanced.CONSTRUCTION AND USEThe blade has a serrated edge for cutting through hard material very easily . The Shark Tooth Tip adds to its potential use for defense , as well as for its ability to cut anything with ease . This looks like a double edged knife , but it is not - only the tip is . The knife is razor sharp and resists corrosion . The matte finish is useful to eliminate glare or for avoiding bringing attention to its user , if unsheathed . The handle is durable , textured and feels comfortable in my hand.Action of the blade is smooth , and allows for quick one-handed operation . The lock is secure and given the smooth action of the mechanism , it allows for one handed closure , also . I can open this knife one-handed in about 1 second.PROSQuickly opensShark tooth tipGreat balanceLifetime warrantySerrated edge for tough materials to cutCONSNone , in my opinionSUMMARYOne of the best utility/tactical knives in the market . Highly recommend .	1
These two are like cousins . The handles are exactly alike and you do n't know which one is which until you open them . The blades are both VG-10 steel , which is very sharp and holds an edge fairly well . They make a nice set and are both superb knives . The Pentagon Elite is serrated and has a dagger like appearance . Open easily and looks fierce . I prefer the 4 inch blades since the 5 inch are illegal to carry in most areas .	1
The action is smooth and one handed , the blade is razor sharp . The blade is rock solid when in extended position , no wobble . The pocket clip is rock solid , unlike other knives I have owned . I literally shaved my leg with it , no razor burn ! ! ! Now I walk around with a bald spot on my leg . I also own the big brother of this knife , the pentagon elite II , they are the best folding knives I 've ever owned . I would recommend them with enthusiasm .	1
Whether you 're working in the yard , the garage , at work or in the field , having a tool kit is essential . This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release . A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire . An 8 cm and 3 '' ruler are integrated into the handles . The file , screwdrivers , bottle opener , Phillips screwdriver , and knife are all easy to access and operate . A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools . For the price and the number of tools , this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried : Leatherman ToolkitOverall , I am pleased with the Tool Kit .	1
Man , I loved this thing until stupid Polish Airlines bastards took it away from me . After that I felt lost . Only bad thing I can say about it is that when it 's in wrench form , the head wiggles from side to side a little . I never found the need to use it one handed . It did n't really work anyway , always got stuck sliding it in and out . I need to get a replacement soon .	1
nice knife but love my gerber gator II more ! this knife blade is a tad smaller in the width and gator II has a better sheath . i paid $ 8 more for the gator II , so for the price you can not go wrong with this knife .	1
I bought this knife a while back and have used it for a few years now . It is one of my blades that tasted my flesh . I cut myself opening a back of Gatorade . This knife has done some carving , fishing , gutting , food prepping , etc . It is a neat little folder I use at home and outdoors . The only recommendation I 'd make would be to have the sheath velcro be replaced with a button . Then I would feel better about carrying the knife on my belt . Just saying if Gerber is listening . This blade design just works . Never slips when wet . And I love how it just feels in my hands .	1
I just got my Gator and it is awsome , felt great im my hand , pirfect size , easy to open and close .	1
My wife uses this as her camping `` kitchen '' knife . She , however , does n't like to carry it , finding it too heavy for wearing in her hiking shorts . It does not have a pocket clip , but comes with a belt sheath . This should have been my first warning it was too heavy for her pocket . Oh well , still a great addition to our gear.The unserrated blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well and the locking mechanism is strong and positive . The grip truly is `` all weather '' as claimed . It has an excellent texture , which combined with its rubbery construction gives one a great grip even when wet .	1
Great knife for the money . I recommend this to anyone . Tightest lockup I 've ever seen and a grippy handle . Buy it .	1
Quality grade and tough enough for moderate outdoor use . 5 stars if made in USA .	1
Gerber ( A Fiskars Company ) put out some of the best knives for the money in the market . Fiskars is my favorite scissors company and everything I 've used of their stuff is top notch - so this is a good combo.I have this knife in the partially serrated version . It is 8.75 '' long when open , 5 '' when closed , and the blade is 3.75 '' . If you have the serrated model , the first 1.5 '' is serrated . The remaining smooth blade hones nicely and stays sharp . Gerber 650 & Portland ; , OR U.S.A are printed on either side of the blade.The grip is exceptional . The Kraton handle is very tough and offers superior traction and grip with it 's rubbery feeling alligator finish . It has a notch for the index finger and the butt curves down to fit your other fingers very comfortably . It feels like a part of your hand when you hold it and is balanced nicely for a folder . It simply stays in your hand when you want it there.The lock is solid with a lever-lock cog/pin system in the backside . The cordura/nylon belt sheath has a velcro closure that has some adjustability to it . Mine is several years old now and I still love this knife . For this price , it 's an amazing buy . There are knives that cost 3 or 4 times as much that do n't feel nearly as good . The steel could be a little harder , but it holds its edge admirably.They came out with this over a decade ago and you can still find it and it 's popular . I think that says a lot . I have n't used the ones with the hook point ( sinew cutter for hunting , cutting rope etc . ) but they seem virtually identical.The only thing this knife is missing is an ambidextrous notch for quick opening . I give it 4.5 stars , rounding up for price/performance ratio and fantastic quality and grip .	1
I have a pretty decent knife collection and love Benchmade and Spyderco knives which I use for various purposes and when I carry a largish knife in my pocket , it is usually an old style Griptilian since it is light . But I always have the Gator in my backpack or pocket when I am in the woods . I do n't even remember how old it is - at least 10 years . It gets more rugged use than any other since it is functional , strong , easy to sharpen , comfortable , and inexpensive . I am not afraid to use it as a tiny machete or pound a rock on it to cut through a branch or small tree or even make a spear . And the handle is comfortable enough for tedious jobs and whittling . I much prefer the Gator 's back lock to liner locks , which most other knives in this range have . If you keep it oiled and cleaned , and practice , you can sling out the blade in a fraction of a second as well as easily close and stow it with one hand . If I could only have one knife , it would be a hard choice between this one and the Griptilian . If I could have one knife that cost less than a hundred bucks , it would be the Gator . And it 's way less than that !	1
i owned this knife the week it hit the market years ago i loved the handle and the shape of the blade this knife can skin 3 deer back to back and steal fill razor sharp the steel is awsome the handle is made out of this rubber that just wont slip even when covered in blood or mud i wish it had a pocket clip but it does come with a nice nylon case this is a great buy	1
I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great . As others pointed out , it 's not perfect like fancier brands . I bought mine in the late 1990 's . I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I 'm not a hunter , but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing . This is my second Gerber product . I own the original multi-tool - Gerber 's version of the Leatherman . That got a lot of use.Bottom line : A great value to have in your collection .	1
As usual Gerber does not disappoint . I had a similar Gerber knife many years ago and loved it . Quality appears to have remained very high . the grip is comfortable and the locking mechanism seems solid . extremely sharp . I have not had it long enough to comment on how well it holds its edge . I would buy again and recommend it	1
I could hold onto this knife in a puddle of motor oil ! Great rubber grip and very sharp ( I found this out the hard way ! ) The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I wish it had a peg on the blade to allow for single hand extension .	1
A little too big for me to carry everyday in my pocket ( I wear slacks to work ) . But I just repurposed it for camping and fishing and it is perfect . High quality at a low price and made in the USA . Cant lose with this one .	1
this knife is rock solid when open and its grip is second to none even in the snow and freezing wet conditions . ive used this knife for everything from carving my name into lean-to 's on rainy days to opening cans and as said in previous reviews it doesnt hold an edge for long but thats why you carry a small stone or just hone it up before each trip . for the price i dont know why everyone doesnt own atleast one !	1
I 've had this for a week now so I ca n't speak to its longevity but it seems like an excellent knife . It 's light enough for everyday carry in jeans or dress slacks , but It 's a good sized knife so be sure to measure so you know what you are getting because it does take up some room if your pockets are small.Grip : excellentLanyard clip : NoneOne-hand opening : Not possible so far ( though I suspect a little silicone spray might make it possible ) Lock : seems excellentBlade : I 'm not a knife fanatic so I ca n't tell you about the quality of materials in the blade but I can tell you that the blade is very sharp out of the box ! Also , I love the angled tip for ripping packing tape ( on boxes ) so I do n't have to use the blade side.Knife made in United States . The case is made in China.If anything changes quality wise I will be sure to update this review . So far I 'm VERY happy with it .	1
Great knife . I lost the first one and had to get the same ASAP.This is like a Mini Rambo survival knife.And I do say it is a great tool , not weapon..I carry it all day everywhere I go , except airports and court .	1
I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years . I have lots of knives , as I 'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes . For the price , it 's hard to get a better knife . I still use my old one after 15 years , even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas . There 's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife . It 's a no brainer . The newer one changed ever so slightly , but for all practical purposes it 's the same one I 've been using all these years . Just get it ... ... .trust me !	1
I have gone through 3 of these over the course of 15 years and I am about to order number 4 . I had one of the older ones with the solid blade , not the skeleton type . I liked that one best and wish they still made that type . I lost it in a movie theater 10 years ago and I still miss it to this day . I bought another one and lost it somewhere in Appalachia . I bought a third one and loaned it to a friend who offered to sharpen it for me before returning it . When I got it back the handle was severely damaged , like he had tried to pry it apart or something , but I got another 5 years of use out of it before it finally broke . Even so , the blade is still in excellent condition , razor sharp , and I will keep it for spare parts.It 's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned . I never feel right without one . It is slender and sits nice and flat in your pocket , which means it 's comfortable enough go everywhere with you , which means you will always have your knife when you need it . It flips out smoothly , locks tightly , and keeps a nice edge . Every other comparable folder I have tried has been too bulky or heavy compared to the E-Z Out . This knife just feels `` right '' and I highly recommend it .	1
I have carried a knife of this design for over 17 years . It is an outstanding quality knife and my oldest one ( A model Gerber 450 , 1995 Production Run ) looks new after 17 years of carrying it . Gerber stainless is the best and the knife holds an edge well . I like the easy open one hand design using the thumb oval hole in the blade and you can open it with either hand . I have big hands and the handle is large enough that I can securely hold it when working and I like the Kraton rubber inserts that improve your grip.Locking blade knives are the safest as the blade will not accidently close on your hand while you are working . I love the serrated edge to cut tough items but yet you still have the smooth edge of the knife for more precision work . I carry mine in my pocket but it does have a stainless steel belt clip on it.The 3 inch blade is the right size to work in the yard , garage , hiking or hunting with and yet still carry in inconspicuously in your pocket . It is lightweight but big enough to get the job done when you need a full size knife .	1
I am not a knife guru , but I 've owned about 6 throughout the last 10 years . This knife is the best I 've bought in the price range . Sharp enough out of the box to cut up small game without frustration and can make short work of a deer . I recently bought another so I could keep one in my car and truck , for the price its justifiable to buy one to leave in the vehicle for emergency use.Happy to say it puts a great edge back on , I actually use an Accusharp knife sharpener for the straight edge , and picked up a `` Smith 's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener '' to handle the serrated edge ( both on Amazon ) . I 'm pleased with both of those products as well , I usually just use a stone to sharpen but these do a better job in less time.I purchased a straight Buck knife for around $ 70 , and have found that it does a better job in cutting up larger game . If you are an avid hunter , I would recommend looking into a Buck , as it does noticeably cut my time and work down in the field . For rabbits , squirrels and the like I always go to this knife .	1
I really like this knife . Quality wise it does NOT come close to a SPYDERCO knife , but I love the skeleton blade , I loce the price and I love the fact that it is VERY light ! ! Good purchase .	1
I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA . Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online . This one does n't say it anywhere , so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland , OR stamp on the blade . I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it . I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts . It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived .	1
This was my first knife , ( the original version with only one thumb hole ) , and it 's served me well for the past ten years . I loved it so much that a couple of years ago I bought the fine edge skeleton model . This knife is perfect for everyday carry . It 's light , and the name `` EZ out '' fits it perfectly . My original one has been worked with for a decade , so it opens faster than I can describe , but the second one I bought came out of the box , and since I knew what I 'm was doing this time , could open it just as quickly.It 's light , has a comfortable grip , and a sturdy easy to use pocket clip . ( It 's not one of those you have to force like my wife 's Buck Bantam , it just slides into place and holds securely there ) . The skeleton model is even easier to open with one hand than the original which only had one thumb hole . This knife is great when you need quick access and one handed opening capability . Perfect pocket knife , and razor sharp out of the box . Plus this is one of the few Gerber knives still made in America.But it 's also tough enough to handle field dressing . I 've gutted deer with this , and had no trouble at all . I 've since switched to the Gerber Gator 2 with a gut hook since I 'm now able to afford a few knives , but the EZ out was a great starter blade . I still carry my first one on small game hunts , and the second one clips onto the shoulder strap of my backpack/camelbak during hikes in case I need a quick weapon to fight off a bear.If I had use for a third one I 'd buy it in a heartbeat . It will be the first knife my sons carry .	1
Awesome Sharp knife . Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen . It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this . My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it , had a lot of memories tied to that knife . LOL ... So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now . SHARP , HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom . Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning .	1
I went to a knife fighting school in 1993 or so . This knife was recommended then . I have been through about ten of them since then . I always have it with me and believe me when I say it is extremely easy out . With training and practice , it is the fastest out-of-pocket inexpensive knife on the market .	1
I own several pocket knives , and was looking for a relatively inexpensive one to carry with me ( in checked luggage ) when I travel . This Gerber Skeleton pocketknife is very light compared to my others and came very sharp . Seems to be well-made , and I was glad to buy an American-made product .	1
I bought the DMT diamond sharpening rod ( fine ) for a Henckels 8 '' serrated bread knife , it fits the curvature of gullets ( i.e. , the serrations ) perfectly , also quickly sharpens a regular straight blade knife easily . Made in USA !	1
Just the right diamond grit to be effective without taking off too much steel . Great for all-around use . The only drawback is the big handle flange , which I cut partly off with my bandsaw so it would fit in my knife block .	1
Had a Henckels International sharpening steel that came in a set with 6 or 7 other blades and a block . It never seemed to keep things sharp , and in fact , I swear it made some newly sharpened knives worse . Our son wants to be a chef and is currently a line cook , and when he saw our steel , he said it was so coarse that it was almost a joke . He tried to fix up our Henckels International knives with his own steel , but the knives were too far gone . I got the DMT diamond steel and it still has not done much with our Henckels International blades , made them better for sure , but has really ressurected som old Victorinox and Chicago Cutlery knives I took out of the basement . Also fixed up my swiss army knife and Columbia River Knife and Tool pocket knife blades . Worked so well I got a DMT serrated blade steel to go along with this item .	1
My wife and I cook a lot , using kitchen knives regularly . Our GO-TO every day knife sharpening system is our DMT diamond steels . I still use my water stones from time to time but it 's hard to beat the edge I get from DMT products . I bought two DMT diamond steels - Fine and Extra Fine .	1
This sharpening instrument should be used alongside its brothers , the extra fine and the ceramic . Together they represent the best possible tools if the objective is to provide the sharpest possible edge on knives such as kitchen knives or large pocket knives . If properly taken care of , they should last a lifetime to boot . Use is not as easy as drag through carbide sharpeners , but it 's not excessively difficult either . Very good instructional videos are provided by the manufacturer .	1
Cheap , easy to use , TINY , no excuse not to throw in your gear to always have with you when you 're in the field . Perhaps should have gone with a medium instead , as I use it to bring back a quick edge when away from home but it works great as is .	1
This works really well and is perfect for my smaller 'emergency ' bag . Definetly would recommend it for its size and usability	1
I got this to keep in my day pack while hunting , The size is perfect , it folds flat and takes no space but when it is open it is large enough to sharpen my any of my knives easily , My everyday clip knife gets abused , and I was able to quickly get it back to a sharp edge in short order with this . A lightweight American made product that sharpens knives well , it will be in my day pack all the time now . A must have for western elk hunters quartering up an elk .	1
I bought a couple of these in different grits . They are really handy for keeping a keen edge on a working blade . My family is in construction , and I 'm the only one who seems interested in doing much if any knife maintenance . I got this for my brother though so I do n't have to resharpen the knives he uses as often , and it let 's him keep safe sharp knives instead of dangerous dull ones . I may have to get a few more for other family members and then I might only have to sharpen my own knives .	1
This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife , or neck knife . Its pretty short , so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger , though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener ... ..I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out , just not how I thought , as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine .	1
Great sharpener , I keep it in my toolbox for work , saves my razor knife blades . Works great on my pocket knifes too , as I use both types , at work . Buy this item , and you 'll be very pleased .	1
For years I 've been & # 34 ; sharpening & # 34 ; my knives with those handheld sharpeners that have the & # 34 ; V & # 34 ; . I thought they were sharp until I tried this diamond sharpener . All I can say is WOW ! It gets a very fine and sharp edge on any blade . Buy with confidence .	1
I carry this product with my camping/survival knife.. I played with it a bit after I got it , then packed it away in a travel box and that is where it lives.. Lucky for me I have not needed for it to work , but I think it will if I need it ... .	1
The fine grade sharpener is ideal for touching up blades . Very handy to reapply edge at work site . Size is perfect for the working person who require a sharp edge .	1
The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit . I use them in the kitchen and in the garage , from sharpening a shovel ( yes , it really works better when the edge is sharp ) to sharpening steak knives . These were purchased to add to my truck tool box , small , easy to stow away . They work very well , just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you , do NOT press down hard , you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface .	1
I bought these for sharpening my skis and they work well . They 're the perfect size to clamp onto your edge tuner . Make sure to wash them when you 're done , and do n't let them fill up with wax ...	1
Good product . Great small set to put in a pack and use in the woods . Not really user friendly on bigger knife but it will get the job done . I wish they came double sided so I could carry just on but this is a great product non the less .	1
Great little stone set ... These make a colorful gift and I keep a set of these with my luggage when I travel because they are lightweight and only need water for lubrication ...	1
Fit in my ski sharpener tool and are excellent for honing a fine edge . Use water sprayed on them and the ski , though , to lengthen life and increase effectiveness .	1
I 've really come around to diamond sharpeners , and most especially to the DMT products . All the DMT stuff is great . These sharpeners are small enough to pack into a survival tin and I use them for field touch-ups of all my bladed tools . They stack one on another and you can wrap that with cordage , rubber bands , etc . There are no handles , you 'll need to prop the sharpening stones against a flat surface , or , hold the stone as you would a file and move the stone across the blade ( a good solution for a machete or large field knife ) . A knife is considered essential for bushcraft , survival , and to me , everyday life . Keeping that knife sharp is just important as having it in the first place . Do n't get these as your first DMT sharpener , but get them for your 'always with you ' bag soon . Water clean-up , water to cool and clear the blade during sharpening . Break-in consists of light use , but use normally , for a dozen or so times . Keep rinsing and working the blade . If the sharpeners need to get cleaned , sprinkle on baking soda and scrub with a brush and rinse . No oil . Ever.Clean , light , easy to use and keep up , small , essential . Made in USA .	1
DMT need i say anymore . Flawless . Custom knife shapening . Highly recomend their products	1
These little guys put a nice edge on my knives , the only drawback I could see was they 're on the small side , So you wo n't easily be sharpening a blade larger than your average pocket knife or maybe a filleting knife in the tacklebox ... Bowies and such would just be awkward at best !	1
In my opinion this is the best 'pocket ' sharpening tool available . The coarse and fine sides can handle just about any field sharpening chore and it provides enough sharpening surface to handle even medium sized sheath knives . Highly recommended !	1
Over the years I 've used oil stones and water stones , ceramics , electric sharpeners , Wusthof and other sharpening gadgets.This item beats them all . Four strokes of the coarse followed by four of the fine restores the knife edge to a sharpness I 've never achieved before .	1
I collect many different types of knives . Although most usually come sharpened , I wanted a good portable way of renewing the edge when needed . This sharpener is fast and light weight to carry in a bag or pouch while on trips . The diamond parts sharpen in seconds without any effort at all . Once mastered with a little practice , you will be able to create a perfect edge on any type knife . You will be happy with this fine/ x-fine sharpener .	1
Found this as I was looking around for a better sharpener for my EDC and other knives/tools . This thing sharpened my Benchmade Pardue to be sharper than its been since it came new after half a dozen passes on the red and green each . I definitely recommend this sharpener !	1
Keeps everything sharp that you might require personally utilize the red more than the blue but eh what are you going to do .	1
What can I say ... It will sharpen your knife pretty well as long as it is under 5 inches . Also , I have had this for probably around a year and put a lot of miles on it and it seems as good as new . I do wash it off after each sharpening . This is really all you need but most people like to use finer grits to finish off their knife . Also , a strop is very helpful for maximizing sharpness . I would reccomend this product .	1
Its a sharpener . Very light and useful . Works seamlessly and i would n't hesitate to buy again . These sharpeners are a million times better than pull through sharpeners . I really have no complaints at all . The handle is cheaper plastic but i do n't mind . Great product and better seller	1
Seems to work alright , fast and easy . A little tricky sharpening curves on certain blades , but this seems a little easier than other methods	1
I was looking for a small compact knife sharpener i could put in my pack for hiking and normal outdoor chores ( hunting , fishing , bushcrafting , ect ) ... Well i just foung it . This thing is pretty amazing considering ive never been a fan of diamond sharpeners . I have a old school Remington 9 '' hunting knife that ive had for years , that was a pain in the ass to sharpen up until now . After a few mins of working it on both sides , the knife has made it out of my drawer and back into my rotation . It even had a small `` nick '' towards the end of the blade that i worked out with no effort . Ive brought alot of my old knives back to life because of this product due to the short time it takes to sharpen them . Now for me the edge it puts on the blade is perfect for what i use my knives for , but i do intend on getting the Extra fine Diaflod just to see how good it works . SO , if your looking for a good pack sharpener thats lightweight and works , you may wan na try this one out . Hope this helps ...	1
I have sharpened my own blades for years and own a Lansky kit which is getting a bit old but still has some useful life . I have several good-sized old rectangular stones but its been so long I 've forgotten where I got them and who made them.I selected a diamond sharpener as I found they work best on some stainless steel alloys I 've encountered . I do n't ordinarily use a diamond on anything else as it tends to remove metal more aggressively than stones/ceramic and the diamond sharpeners tend to wear out rather quickly . But admittedly diamond types do the job faster than stones.This is a replacement for my last diamond sharpener , which of course wore out.I 've already given this item a preliminary workout by sharpening a stainless blade that was surprisingly hard and giving my Lanskys too much of a workout , but the edge was almost done . It took a bit of sweat and patience but the DMT performed well and now that tough stainless blade is a hair splitter.I then used this DMT on some other knives for a quick , couple of swipes edge touch-up.This DMT fits the bill . The handle fold conveniently and protects the sharpener surface when not in use , but when deployed offers a good size hand grip . I have no worry about the durability of the plastic , it will probably outlast the diamond.The sharpener rectangle is good enough size for small to large blades although I would n't use this for machetes , axes or even a CS Laredo . For blades that big I 'll use something else.Because the two sides offered are Fine and Extra-Fine , this sharpener is primarily relegated to light touch-up . I have only two tests to determine if my blades are sharp to my satisfaction . 1 ) the ease of shaving hair ; and 2 ) the thumbnail test.I like this product and do recommend it . I 'm just curious on how long the diamond will last .	1
Awesome little stone to have , fits in your tool kit , car , or backpack . Use it a lot out in the field to touch up my knives .	1
best knife sharpener . buy the magna guide , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Fast and efficient . Like most hunters and knife guys , I have a dozen different sharpening tools , but this is by far the fastest and easiest , and gets the job done .	1
This is a compact , handy , well made tool . I debated giving it 4 stars because the handle material seems thin and perhaps a bit fragile , but , so far it holds up great and takes up very little space , all things considered . I also have a few Smith 's diamond sharpeners and the DMT beats them all . The folding design protects the surface when closed and provides a handle when open . Tip : when using this as a typical bench whetstone , lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top . Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up . Although this angles the stone , it steadies it , making for solid grining angle and surface . I 've sharpened a collection of knives and even got a really good edge on some scissors I was debating tossing - fist time sharpening scissors . Look out edged tools ! This is one of those tools I 'd buy again to have a back-up . MADE IN USA .	1
This may be one of the finest pocket style sharpeners available.The caveat to that is , you have to have some skill with sharpening in order to use.If you do n't really have much experience sharpening knives and or do n't intend to learn ... I would just go with one of the many small `` pull the blade through '' type of guided sharpeners , ( although these tend to take off a lot of material ) .If you do know what your are doing with it , and you do n't forget which side is course and whichis fine , ( blue is course ) , then you really have an excellent tool that is perfect for hiking , camping , and general outdoors use.For the outdoors , I wants something that does a decent job in a short amount of time without damaging , or changing my edge . Its also got to be lightweight , and fit in my pocket . This fits those need perfectly.If I take a larger blade , I keep this strapped to it , underneath a ranger band . Otherwise , I keep itin my `` possibles '' pouch.Things I dislike ... .Mainly , the price . I just think its a bit pricey for something I only intend to use on outdoors trips.If it last for years , that might be a different story , not sure yet.I 've seen complaints about the handle seeming cheap . I 'm ok with that , as long as it works , and it does.However , on my particular sharpener , It fits over the stones EXTREMELY tight . I have to assume that sooneror later , simply opening this thing up repeatedly , after a while , is going to serve to wear at the abrasivesurface , or scratch away enough plastic so that this thing wo n't stay closed anymore . Have n't noticed any of this yet , just seems like an inevitability.Anyway , so far , mine has been great and I think its one of the best options for a sharpening system on the go .	1
This sharpener is ideal for those seeking a quick , trouble free alternative to standard drag through carbide sharpeners or ordinary sharpening stones . It is easy to use and actually performs better with time . The coarse grain will set the edge rapidly , and the fine grain will set most knives to optimal sharpness .	1
This is a great sharpener , the coarse side will take away any chips or folds and the fine side allows you to get a fairly sharp edge . It 's not as nice as some stones , but it 's small and portable , which means I can use it while I 'm out camping .	1
I have a quite a few knives in my collection , ranging from spyderco 's , benchmade , cold steel , ka bar to name a few , and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them . It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp . The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by , basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it . And hey it 's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality . Do n't think about it , just buy it ! !	1
These stones are the real deal . works better than I had expected ! Just a few passes on each side brings back your blade , As long as it do n't need major work . if it needs a lot of work , Like a really dull blade , the coarse single sided diafold will be a big help . I could n't be more pleased in this purchase . Thanks DMT and amazon.. Pitbullman216	1
I have a saying . `` Give me your dullest knives , and I 'll make them duller ! '' I stink at sharpening knives . Always have . But since I purchased the DMT I 've been able to keep all my blades in shaving sharp condition . It does the job fast , and thats cool , because I can be impatient . I have found that the fine side does most of the sharpening , and is adequate for most needs . The lite , small , compactness of it makes it great for any trip where regular sharpening is required , ie . camping fishing , backpacking . So for all you unskilled types ( like me ) , you will be happy buying the DMT diafold sharpener .	1
Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came ... well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen .	1
I bought this as my wife had a diamond sharpener and her carving knifes are sharper than mine even though I used a whetstone and file . When it came from Amazon I sharpened my Beretta 2.5 inch , VG10 stainless , folding pocket knife , Trident modelin about 2 minutes . The small depressions in the sharpener , are there for the purpose of catching the metal dust and filings and keeping the surface clean so theDiamonds in the surface can do their work . That was an excellent idea . The blade was so sharp , that drawing it across my forearm , the hair was cut clean to the surface . You wo n't go wrong with buying this sharpener .	1
It 's light weight and has gotten a good edge on my pocket knife . does n't need oil and it should be perfect for backpacking . Very happy that it 's made in the USA !	1
I have owned this sharpener for some time now and use it to sharpen camping and kitchen knives . It worked great . Also , I would like to point out that DMT is a responsible vendor and respects its customers . I had an issue with another product of theirs and once I asked a question on how I can remedy the defect . They immediately responded same day with offer to send me a replacement , even though I did n't even ask for it . Thanks guys .	1
I was new to sharpening . I sharpened my first knife with this , and really got hooked . I obsessed over getting all my knives to slice through paper ... and I accomplished it lol.It took some practice , and patience , but I even straightened out an uneven grind on an Ontario SP 10 with this little guy lol ! Bigger would obviously be better ... but I wo n't use it enough to justify , and this thing gets the job done !	1
Really Liked this sharpener , quickly put a razor edge on all my backpacking blades . Kukri , Leatherman Mutt , and my CKRT as well as 3 other camping knives . The compactness is nice .	1
It is what it is a sharpener a very good sharpener if I do say so for myself . It can get a dull knife back form 30 % to a good 90 % in just a few seconds . I like it you should buy one of these instead of a cheap ceramic and steel handheld sharpener .	1
Diamond Machining Technology Inc. ( DMT ) has a patent on true crystalline diamond coatings for their sharpeners . While others advertise diamonds , DMT 's diamonds are truly sharp - making them the best functioning diamond sharpening tools available . You can read more about this and how to use the products at their web site [ ... ] . Never use oil on diamonds as it can clog the grit - simply use then dry or with a little water . Use gentle pressure as the diamonds will do the work . I consider this double-sided unit to be the best all-around `` starter '' sharpener with course ( blue ) and fine ( red ) . These two grits will meet most basic needs when used as directed . To establish a truly keen edge , consider their alignment system which holds the blade and stones at a constantly perfect angle , ensuring a perfectly angled and level sharpened edge [ ... ] - noting it may cost several times more as it comes with several more grits . If you prefer a more universal power sharpener , consider the Work Sharp WSKTS motorized sharpener which is highly portable and flexible in its uses . Finally , sometimes a good old metal file ( `` Bastard '' type ) is the best way to put a quick initial edge on larger items like shovels and axes . Wear gloves and eye protection - and avoid breathing fine metal dust - be safe !	1
I like to put VERY sharp edges on my tools and weapons . This makes that very easy and possible . I had an old hatchet that I ground a rough edge on my bench grinder , then took it all the way down to a razor edge with this tool . This can be used to sharpen everything from axe heads down to your kitchen knives . I can vouch for this .	1
Sharpener is very easy to use , and puts a fantastic edge on knives , tools , and hatchets in short order . Easy to kleep clean ... .just rinse off and dry ! Keep one handy in your shooting emergency bag at all times !	1
I did n't want to spend around thirty bucks to buy a small sharpener but I did ... and it works the best so far . I have a few of them no skill type sharpeners like the fur ozitech or whatever its called and that does n't work very good at all , but this sharpener works wonderfully . It is a little slower and harder to master but it allowed me to sharpen a few knives to shaving sharp , which is exactly what I wanted and could n't do ... until now . Just buy one ! I bought the fine xtra-fine because I did n't want to buy 2 and I wanted to be able to shave with the knife when done sharpening . If your knife is dull it may take longer to get it to sharp but it will eventually .	1
I 've been using this sharpener for about a month and it is pretty good . It has held up surprisingly well and when it gets dirty from extensive use , just wash it in the sink with dish washing liquid . I had only a basic knowledge of knife sharpening before buying this sharpener and I can now make a blade `` hair-popping '' sharp using it , no BS .	1
I guess I could lay the DiaSharp stones on the bench , or maybe on a rubber mat , but the convenience of this base is well worth the $ 16 it cost . I use mine at least weekly .	1
I first purchased two Diamond whetstones and they worked great . However the whetstone did n't always just sit there and not move during sharpening -- I purchased this whetstone base to hold my whetstone and allow me to use both hands to hold a large kitchen knife while sharping . It is so much easier now using this whetstone base .	1
This is a no-brainer . If you purchase the bench stone , you absolutely need the base , otherwise I am not sure how you would even use the stone .	1
does what it says and nothing to shout about . Can fit 10-in and 8-in places , and 6-in DMT whetstones too .	1
I love this base ! I use it with my new DMT sharpening stones and it provides a very sturdy and usable base for those stones . Makes sharpening a LOT easier . Easy to set up and easy to use . I 'm satisfied . : - )	1
The only reason I did n't give this item 5 stars is because it 's made of plastic and call me old fashion but it just does n't feel very substantial when I 'm using it . Now other than that this little bad boy is dang near perfect and really helps sharpen knives .	1
I toyed with the idea of making this myself out of PVC , b/c thats all it really is . but in the end it was worth the price and much easier . took 3 mins to put together . and comes with two sticks and a ball ! ! !	1
This is a very nice street hockey set . The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver . The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints ; Easy to do ! Both sticks work for left or right handers : Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right . However , we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the & # 34 ; proper & # 34 ; fitting of the stick . They just use them ... .PERIOD ! Again , a great product and price .	1
I was impressed with the quality . The kids love it . So far , it appears it will last much longer than their usual toys like this .	1
Size is decent , but it is a little on the flimsy lightweight side . Tough to stand up correctly in grass , so when my daughter tries it for field hockey , the hard balls easily knock it down , and once busted apart the connections . It did n't fully break though , and with a little tightening , and lighter pucks , balls , etc . works fine . Best suited for rubber balls and street hockey on smooth surfaces .	1
Used consistently for garage hockey . Easy to assemble and light to lift goal . Sticks are holding up well . Good starter set .	1
This is a great gift for our kids . They use them all the time . The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the construction of the goals are somewhat thin pvc piping that I worry will break easily . That said , it has stood up to some rough play so far and has provided hours of fun .	1
In 1895 , Karl Elsener thought of manufacturing quality Swiss Army Knives ( SAK ) to be used by Swiss Army , as he was irritated to see the Swiss using a German multipurpose knives during the military operations . What makes Victorinox stand apart from other ( so called ) manufacturers of SAKs are that it was formed by none other than Elsener himself . For almost a centuary , only two manufacturers ruled the SAK market they were : Victorinox , and Wenger . In April 2005 , Wenger was acquired by Victorinox . Now the Victorinox has monopoly in supplying SAK to Swiss Army , and to the retail civilian market.I am currently using the Victorinox Forester , and the Explorer , but my favorite is the Explorer , as it is comes very handy in your everyday 's work . The most used features by me are : Philips screwdriver , scissors , magnifying glass , and of course the large blade.I am using Swiss Army knives since last 5 years . I tried Wenger ( before it was acquired by Victorinox ) , and I was surprised to see the difference in quality . No doubt , Victorinox came out as the winner here . Exceptional high quality and attention to detail makes them the world 's best Swiss Army Knife manufacturer . Do n't even think of buying the cheap ( made in China ) SAK , you will just waste your money . So , the Victorinox is your best bet !	1
I have carried a Victornox knife for years with me for more than 5 years . I use that at work , home and on the road . There are many models I have , but when in doubt , I carry the Explorer . Simply because it have all tools needed for many different situations , with no fancy or out of purpose tools that will increase the size just to be there and not to be used.Victorinox has extreme good luck when designed this model , that is the all we need for 99 % of the situations , and those 1 % that Explorer will not fit , probably will need specific tools for the job.For me the main tools are the straight Phillips screwdriver and the scissors . The T shape Phillips screwdriver of the Thinker based models are not long enough to reach some deeper screws . The magnifier glass is handy for me to inspect some electronic boards and circuits . The corkscrew is the less used tool . I spent 1 more buck on a small screwdriver to put on it , so I have another function and make my knife better to the eyes . It is not too heavy but not too light . It is perfect for jeans pockets.It is stylish , handy and useful on day-by-day . For those who need a really helper and companion for urban life , it is the best deal you can bet , by far .	1
Everyone knows Victorinox is the best ... and in my opinion , as an all-around pocket knife , this is the perfect blend of functionality , affordability and moderate size . Mine is in my pocket every single day . I have kept a Victorinox on my person every day for the past ( almost ) forty years ! This one is probably my fourth or fifth.The pluses that distinguish this from other lesser knives.+ The Phillips head screwdriver is ON THE END- like a screwdriver ... instead of a T-handle like so many others.+ Ball appoint pen . I use it probably every week when I can not find a pen in the car or when you just NEED to write something- even on your hand+ Scissors- other knives have them too , but they work well and I 'm happy they are on this knife+ Magnifying glass . It works . Use it to examine splinters , plants ( is it mites or dust ? ) , used to use it to look at photographic negatives ... + Big blade for general use- small bade kept very sharp for when you REALLY need sharp+ Pin . In the end under the corkscrew . Useful for splinter removal and other things+ Tiny slot screwdriver resides inside the corkscrew . When you need it , there it is ! It 's as if you left a SAK to evolve in the wild and reproduce if successful ... THIS would be the survival of the fittest.If there were just a small pliers ... One other improvement , I wish that one of the red side plastic pieces was solid magnesium with a flint rod . In a survival situation , you could removed the handle side , scrape magnesium shavings and use the knife to strike a spark and start a fire . ( similar to Doan fire starter ) I think would be a smart upgrade for Victorinox to consider.Hey , maybe they could even add a small knife sharpener as the other red `` side '' of the knife . Would n't that be perfect ?	1
I 've had Explorers for years and love them , EXCEPT for one thing -- the crappy scissors . When is Victorinox going to put a decent pair of scissors on a knife .	1
I 've had my Explorer now for about 23 years . My mom 's boyfriend at the time was going to treat my brother and I each to any Swiss Army Knife of our choosing . My brother foolishly chose the Swisschamp . I say foolishly because it is too thick to pocket carry , and too thick for a comfortable grip . One gives up ergonomics for the ultimate tool set.I , in my infinite wisdom , chose the explorer . Even then , before the internet took off , I knew I did n't want one that was too thick , because I wanted the option of pocket carry . That is not without qualifications . This knife is 4 layers thick , so it does look a bit goofy if pocket carried in dress pants . But in jeans , carpenter 's pants , or cargo pants , it is fine.The tool set is ideal for the typical urban or suburban person with an indoor desk job . Here are my thoughts on each tool.- Knife blades : Some folks use this as the all-around blade , and use the small blade as a sharp back-up . Others , save this one as a `` clean blade '' for food prep , and use the small blade as the general purpose utility blade.- Can opener : Works smashingly well for opening cans . Better than the can openers on any other Swiss Army-type knife . More importantly for everyday use , is the small flat head screwdriver on the tip . Not only does it fit small flat head screws , but it can also be pressed into service as a # 2 Phillips . ( not important on this knife , since it already has a dedicated inline Phillips ) - Bottle opener : Works very well . It will usually open a beer bottle cap in one try , and if not , two tries . I use the large flat screwdriver tip much more often , both for screws and as a little pry bar . The wire stripper toward the base is NOT useless . One simply has to cut a ring around the outside of the insulation of the wire with a knife blade first . Then , bend the wire over a bit , put it in this slot , hold the end with one 's thumb , and pull . A wonderful tool.- Inline Phillips : ( as opposed to a T-handle Phillips on the back of many Victorinox SAKs ) Great tool . The fact that it is inline means that it is loads more useful than a T-handle version , because if the screw is right up against something , one can still use the inline Phillips . It also has a stop at 90 degrees , for extra torque.- Magnifier : A great tool , when needed . Some have pointed out that it can be used to start fires on a sunny day . Others like it as a tool to read small print . It even works well to really get a good look at that splinter or thorn tip that is buried in my finger before proceeding to `` operate '' with the tweezers.- Scissors : Wonderful . Probably the most-used tool on my Explorer . I use mine to de-tag new clothing , snip threads , and cutting out newspaper and magazine articles . You will likely find a load of other uses for it.- Reamer w/sewing eye : Very useful . I 've used mine to punch and widen new holes on my leather belts and as an awl to start the hole where I will drill a hole in wood . The edge is sharp too , so it can be used as a general scraping and poking tool . Victorinox 's reamer is much better than Wenger 's . It 's sharper on the tip , and it is sharpened on the side.- Corkscrew : This is another implement that some folks consider useless , as they do n't drink wine , or they always seem to have a real corkscrew at hand when drinking wine . However , if one keeps an open mind , then one will realize that it is an EXCELLENT substitute for a marlin spike to help untie knots.- Hook : This is a tool that my pre-1991 Explorer does n't have . However , my Super Tinker has it , so I will comment . Some folks consider this useless , as Victorinox calls it a `` parcel hook . '' We do n't really wrap parcels with twine any more , so it is useless for that . However , keep in mind that it is just a general purpose hook , that can be used to pull wires , strings , etc . from tight places , where one 's fingers can not fit it . Just remember you have it , and it will come in handy one day.- Keyring : Not really for attaching to one 's keys , as this knife would overwhelm the keys and make it too clunky . I consider this as more of a lanyard ring . To those who find this knife too thick for pocket carry , a short lanyard comes in handy to pull it out of a belt pouch . Or , if one is out in the field , where fashion is secondary , fit a long lanyard , which can be attached to one 's belt or belt loop.All that said , I would recommend you go for the new Explorer Plus , as opposed to this original model . The Plus model adds a straight pin , an eyeglass screwdriver for the corkscrew , and a pressurized ballpoint pen for the scales . These implements are well worth the extra ten bucks or so . The straight pin , especially , is useful when paired with the tweezers for removing those tricky splinters . The ballpoint pen works really well , and has saved me a trip on foot more times than I can count . ( on another knife , since my old Explorer does n't have it ) I do n't use the eyeglass screwdriver often , as I do n't wear glasses . However , it also has the side effect of smoothing out the profile of the corkscrew ; it makes the knife more comfortable overall to grip , especially when using tools that hinge on that side of the knife.If you are a whittler , camper , etc . you may want to give up the inline phillips and magnifier for a saw , and get the Fieldmaster or something.Just so you know , I have probably 20 other Swiss Army Knives , and this one is my overall favorite , just edging out the Super Tinker . I also have a Tinker , Compact , Sportsman , Adventurer , '61 Soldier , '07 Soldier , Electrician , Classic , Minichamp , Rambler , Recruit , CyberTool 34 , Hiker , Spartan Lite , Wenger EvoGrip S16 , Spartan , and many others I ca n't recall right now.Update , October 16 , 2013 : Some folks complain about the magnifier being flimsy . It is thinner than the one on my Explorer , but not flimsy . It 's just molded out of one piece , instead of two or three pieces like they used to be . Optically , it is about the same . It is strong enough to do its job , and was not intended to be super strong , like the large screwdriver , for example.I 've been carrying this knife more in my pocket . One gets used to the four-layer bulk after a while.To clean pocket lint of of it : carefully open all implements , blades last , so you do n't cut yourself . Blow out all the loose lint with your mouth . Get an old toothbrush or gun cleaning brush in there to get out the stubborn bits from the nooks and crannies . Close all the implements . Then , dunk it under soapy dish water , and open and close the implements , one by one , operating them several times each . Remove from the soapy water and rinse thoroughly with fresh tap water . Shake out all the loose water . Set it out somewhere to drip-dry for a day or two . Lastly , consider whether you want to add a tiny droplet of oil to each joint . The upside is that everything will work more smoothly ; for a while . If you carry your Explorer on a belt pouch , this is probably the way to go . If you carry it in your pocket , the oil will attract lint , which will necessitate that you clean it pretty frequently.They work fine without oil . They just have a more satisfying *snap* when they are clean and oiled . ; )	1
Cuts well , all tools work well , though I cut myself accidentally when I first opened it , but it 's alright .	1
I have had one of these on my key chain for over 15 years now ; it 's only been replaced 3 times and I use it almost daily . It comes with a removable plastic toothpick and tweezers . I love having a toothpick handy after eating out somewhere and the tweezers work very well . The tweezers do not have the strongest grip because they are very thin and therefore a bit flexible , but I have never had them fail to work and they have very sharp edges for getting out the finest hair and/or splinter.The knife and fingernail file/screwdriver are obviously useful in many instances ; the only problem I 've ever had is that if you are trying to remove/loosen a very tight screw it might close on you if you press too hard . The implements do not 'lock ' into place , so you have to use some caution.The scissors were originally my primary reason for purchasing these and are fine enough to help trim your cuticles and strong enough for smaller cuts . They are definitely not super strong but definitely cut paper and thin plastic easily.Overall , these are a terrific gift for just about anyone and a great purchase for yourself . I 've seen them in the store for upwards of $ 14 but you can get these for less frequently on sale at Amazon .	1
I bought a few of these for my family . I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead . Still , there is a reason why this is a & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; ! You wo n't be disappointed with this small keychain knife . I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys . The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys , adding bulk .	1
Bought this knife for a friend , the price was good , and it shipped quickly , I have no worries about the quality as I have carried the same one on my key ring for the past seventeen years , and its still going strong .	1
I will always have a Victornox Swiss in my pocket . They are small , sharp and they have a toothpick and tweezers . Could n't ask for more . For what I need a pcoket knife for these are fantastic , fairly durable , at least for my uses . If I were doing anything more heavy duty I would carry an Old Timer . But the size of the Victornox and the functionality , I have kids , makes this a sweet tool for me .	1
I got these as stocking stuffers for my step-kids ( they 're adults , actually ) . All of them loved the knife and more than one told me how handy it was and wondered how they got along without them .	1
If you carry one of these , you 'll forget you have it . The Alox are extremely thin . High quality .	1
Baby McGyver all the way baby . No need for a big clunky knife when this little one does it just as good . Bonus is that if I lose it then it is inexpensive to replace . Still have n't destroyed or broken one of these . My biggest trouble is forgetting I have it in my pocket when I go to the airport . A few airport security guards now have one nice knife in their pocket .	1
I have had these for many years.They are always dependable little pocket knives.I have one on every key chain in the household .	1
I did n't know they made white ones until my friend showed me his.Victorinox may be rivaled , but never equaled or beaten ! ! This is the EDC size including knife and scissors if you wear a suit and ca n't carry anything bigger .	1
Got it today , way quicker than I expected or was said , it 's so cute , it 's tiny , got it as a gift for my fathers b-day who has all mac stuff , laptop , phone and think ipod , so this goes along with his style , did n't take it out of the box so as not to finger print it up , though it is really cute and think he will like it . Has toothpick and tweezers . Assuming like my old faithful swiss is sharp as can be though wo n't find out till he gets it .	1
I love these things ! ! This one was bought as a gift for a niece and I hope she loves hers as much as I love mine . It is really handy . I keep it on my key chain . I do n't know what I 'd do without it .	1
Just like my other knives I keep one in each car and in my pocket at all times . Love it .	1
A marvel of compact utility ( 3/4 oz . -- 2-1/4 '' long ) . Put it on your key chain . Except when going through airport security.All handy , especially the toothpick and knife blade . The scissors makes a good nail trimmer in a pinch.Somehow mine is extremely sharp after years of use.- - - Pricing - - -An amazing deal for 11 bucks . Compare alternate amazon listings for the best deal .	1
I wear this on my keychain . It has come in handy so many times that I can not count them all . What cracks me up is when , from time to time , someone at the office will ask if I happen to have any scissors , not expecting me to say & # 34 ; yes. & # 34 ;	1
Would make a great first pocketknife for your young ones , or for the car , or maybe even a keychain . Quality product as you would expect from Victorinox . Knife comes really sharp ( non-locking ) , and scissors are surprisingly sharp as well . Highly recommend !	1
Bought this as a joke/gift for my girlfriend . Yes , it is a bright , hot pink , not a more subdued tone . It is surprisingly small - no longer than two inches in length . I personally own a Swiss Army One-Hand Trekker Lockblade , though , so this may be why I expected a larger tool . The blades are very sharp , and the knife works beautifully , My girlfriend and I are both pleased with this knife .	1
I 've owned a couple of these over the years and recently received a new one for Christmas . They are excellent and I carry it on my key chain every day . It 's lite , small , well crafted and offers a variety of very useful tools for everyday tasks . And at around $ 12 they 're basically giving them away . For me , it 's the perfect key chain tool .	1
Great gift for an outdoor kind of girl who happens to be part Irish . I got it for a friend of mine for Christmas , and she loved it . It 's a good price for a quality SAK from Victorinox too . Either way , there 's nothing like a Swiss Army Knife with or without the shamrock .	1
These little tools are the absolute best thing you can keep in your pocket for everyday use ( but do n't bring it with when flying ) . I have had them for years and they continue to work as if they were brand new . I keep a few handy for gifts as well . They are well worth the money . Highly recommended .	1
This is a great girlie knife . It has the same tools/functionality as the classic Swiss small army knife but looks much nicer . It is clear medium pink translucent with opaque pastel pink and medium lavendar color camo spots . I have not kept it in my pocket , so I ca n't comment on how the design holds up while rubbing against keys . I keep it on my desk to open boxes or use the other tools when needed . The knife is super sharp , at least when new .	1
I was on a tour bus in Bavaria with 40 of my closest friends when a woman said , `` Ouch , I broke a nail ! '' I grabbed my Swiss Army Classic , flipped open the nail file and offered it to her saying , `` This should help . '' And it did - she was happy but it took about 30 minutes to get it back . That 's because someone else used the screw driver to fix his glasses . Another person used the tweezer to pick at a splinter . A fourth person used the scissors to cut some threads and so on throughout the bus . Over the rest of the week , I must have loaned my classic to nearly everyone on the tour.I used to be able to bring it along when I flew , but those days are gone . Now , when I check luggage , I pack it with my toiletries - otherwise , it 's always with me . I must use mine every day for something or other . I especially love the scissors . They are sharp and work great at opening CDs , cutting articles out of the paper and snipping loose threads . What else in the world is so good and so inexpensive ? Note , I did n't say cheap - because this knife is definitely not cheap .	1
This knife is something I 've carried for many years . I alternate between the Wenger and Victorinox versions . The Wenger version has a better spring mechanism for the scissors and is slightly larger overall . I 'll upload a picture of both alongside a larger knife so you can compare.This is a great knife ; it 's amazing how often I use it . I carry it so often that I 've lost a few , occasionally due to airport security . This is about as small as could be useful , the Wenger is a little easier to use for my larger hands . I find the file and scissors the most useful . I usually keep the knife either on a keychain or attached to a small tag so it 's easier to hold when in use.The knife is made of quality stainless and does n't rust even though mine has been sent through the laundry many times . In fact it comes out rather clean after a wash in a pair of jeans ; - ) 4 stars for a very useful tool and part of daily life for many years , not 5 because the flimsy spring on the scissors can get bent and cause problems .	1
This is a nice little pocket knife . I 'd rather call it a key chain knife . Perfect size to use it as a key chain.I 'm not sure about the quality . It looks like it is only good for very light jobs . But it will be there when I need it because it is with my keys .	1
a cute little pocket knife.had one before lost it didnt even get a chance to use it , in red color.so i got me another one in white this time , looks cool and cute put it on my keychain that i hook onto my chain on my wallet so i wont lose it .i hope i get a chance to use it this time .will come in handy when i need it .	1
The aluminum case is thinner than the plastic Classics . I prefer that . Its knurled surface makes it easy to hold . And it 's classy .	1
Very small and light . Right at home on a key chain . The knife blade was very sharp when i received this . While it is not intended for heavy duty use ( of course ) it is great to have in your pocket .	1
I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack . I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it . It 's very easy for her to use and carry it with her . Most likely she use it for craft work . Then she wants her friends to have it , so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift , even very girlish girl ( she got pink one ) likes the knife too . It 's a very cute and excellent tool .	1
I wanted a small pocket knife and this is perfect . The quality is great and the tools are all useful ... except the file .	1
IBefore I lost my last one I have had several of these little Victorinox knives -- I especially like the scisssors and the blade is really sharp and stays sharp . Wish there was some way to prevent losing them .	1
it is what it is . i knew what i ordered ... no biggie ... i have been using one for the last 20 years .	1
we purchased this product for my son for his first knife to be used on his scouting campout . he loved it . he still carries it around in his pocket and he used it when he can . it 's perfect and a must for everyday use .	1
i have used one of these for twenty years with no problem except i tried to cut some thick wire with the scissors and messed them up.. otherwise this is the best tool ever	1
I love these things . Perfect for a keychain . Has exactly the tools you need , and nothing more . Small as you can get to have the tools you need.Funny story , I always have one of these on my keychain and I forgot to take it off when I was getting on a plane . It was confiscated , so I used my phone on the way to the terminal to order a new one with Amazon Prime , and it was waiting at my doorstep when I got home . I heart capitalism .	1
Better than a pocket in a shirt .	1
practical , basic , good little thing to have on your key chain . Lots of flavors to choose from . Scissors , although small , work well . I have one on my keys and recently bought another to give as a gift item . It was well received . Excellent gift item .	1
I have bought these at Target , Walmart , Amazon , and probably other places - I 've bought so many I ca n't remember . My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included . I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it ( like happened the last time ) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys , etc.I expect that I 'll keep buying them for the rest of my life .	1
Each year , I give these little classic knives as gifts to an assortment of people . With the restrictions on knives on aircraft now , they are always appreciated . Since owning and using these on a daily basis for many years , I have yet to have one break or be problematic . I do oil the hinges every year or so at least , more when the knife is used often . It 's the most basic knife without bells and whistles and I love it . They are offered in a wide variety of colors and patterns and usually can be found for $ 10 or less . The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is the best in it 's class and at the low cost , it 's not heartbreaking when one is lost . It 's also nice to have a couple on hand in the gift box for the times when someone compliments mine -- I give it away and know that I have a replacement at home .	1
First of all , great price . This is the classic small Swiss Army knife , only 2 1/4 inches long , but comes with the most basic tools you need : a knife , scissors , file , tweezers and pick . The best thing about it is it 's small and not bulky . You can keep it in your car or office for small emergencies . Both the knife and the scissors are sharp . This is a very well made knife , high quality everything , and a keeper .	1
I love this tiny little SAK . It 's manufactured with very good quality and is super handy to have on your keys.Not a single complaint !	1
Great build quality , functions like a victor inbox should but with a beautiful royal blue color . I would not hesitate to replace it if I ever lost it .	1
As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25 , I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors , tweezers , a small knife , and a nail file/flat screwdriver . I wish that it had an LED light , and some mini pliers would be nice , but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA : according to what I 've read , the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width , starting April 25 , 2013 . I suppose plans could change , but from what I can tell , this should qualify.Update : After some more research , I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager , which adds a Philips screwdriver , a bottle opener , and a pen , but loses the tweezers and toothpick . This is still a great tool , though , and less pricey , so poke around and see what you like .	1
I carry this around on my keychain and use it for daily activities when the need for a tool arrives . This knife is very handy .	1
To me , these knives are like socks in the dryer . Every so often I just lose one . But like socks , I use this knife daily . Not as a knife proper , but to pick on things , open this or that , fasten or tighten a screw . I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead . The small jeans pocket . This should be a standard issue , everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off . Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one .	1
I have been carrying one of these as long as I can remember , at least 20 years . It is the most usefult single thing I have . My wife always raises an eyebrow when I say that . I call it my WMD ( Weapon of Minimal Destruction ) .This is the Victorinox version . There is also a version made by Wenger . As I understand it , Victorinox and Wenger are at odds about who is the `` original '' swiss army knife . I do n't care who is right about that , but I think the Victorinox version of the knife is nicer . It 's a bit thinner , operates more smoothly , and is finished a little nicer .	1
I put this on my keychain and use it a lot more than I thought I would . The little knife and scissors are great . The tweezers are handy too . Read the description , this is a small knife , but because of that I can keep it with me and actually use it . I think it was a good purchase .	1
And I already lost it before I could give it away for Xmas . Nonetheless , I took it out and played with it a little and it 's a perfect little knife for a key chain .	1
This little knife and pocket tool certainly eternalizes its name , classic . It is what every young kid strived for when then were young and for good reason , it is useful , compact and lightweight , and affordable . This triple threat makes the Victorinox Classic a truly useful blade.The blade itself came to me legitamately SHAVING sharp . It will pass the paper cut test with flying colors and will hold an edge for a fairly decent amount of time . I have had mine for a number of months and it still continues to shave . However , keep in mind , my use has been limited and only for small tasks . After all , this knife is TINY . That being said , we must choose realistic jobs for this knife , such as opening mail and small boxes , opening packaging , and cutting that stray strand of string hanging off your t-shirt . The 420 stainless steel blade still will dull , but its easy enough to sharpen with a wetstone or ceramic rod.Next , we need to look at an excellent nail file and screwdriver combination . The file itself works well , not being too gritty as to hurt your finger and not being too soft as to not serve a purpose . It finds that happy medium of comfort and effectivness . The screwdriver tip proves most handy . I actually used this screwdriver on a Phillips that fell out of the inside trim of my truck . Its a '95 F150 , so its old and the entire side panel on the door fell off . I located the screw on the ground and inserted it back into the hole and screwed it back in with ease . I would not recomend really putting too much strain on a job like this , but it will offer a temporary solution to an unexpected issue . This tool leaves you prepared ! The scissors are also a handy item included with this knife . They are extremely sharp and will precisely chew through paper and other managable materials . Once again , this is small tool that can do SMALL , everyday jobs . Do not try to cut through a chained link fence with this thing . Choose your battles wisely.Like most Victorinox Swiss Amry Knives , this tool includes the reliable and famous tweezers and toothpick . The tweezers are of high quality but do not have precision accuracy as seen with other more expensive pairs of tweezes . But with practice , you 'll be able to master the art of splinter removal . The toothpick is essential for those nights out at the restaurant after a nice steak consummution , leaving stringing remains in your bicuspids . This thing will dig 'em out no problem.Overall , this Classic is excellent for a keychain edc knife . Sure , the handles will get beat up and scratched but it only gives the knife more character . Over the past few months I have felt reliant on this handy micro tool and do not plan on removing it from my EDC ( everyday carry ) . The tools are of the reknowned Victorinox quality and will withstand the test of time . I am sure ANYONE would find some sort of use for this tiny , but powerful knife from an excellent company .	1
I love this mini swiss army . I carry it everyday and I use it almost everyday . It is super small and skinny so you do n't even notice it in your pocket . I have actually dropped one out of my pocket and lost it before so that can be an issue for others . But I think everybody should carry one of these on them at all times . Highly recommend !	1
I purchased three of these , one for my keychain and two for gifts . They took quite some time to come but arrived in near perfect condition . The only defect was that one of them had a deformed but still usable key ring . This is easily replaced . The blades are extremely sharp and smooth . I use mine almost every day and have been completely satisfied with the purchase .	1
I am unable to imagine myself going somewhere without my Swiss Army knife ( except a plane , of course ) . This 2 1/4 inch all-purpose tool is always on my key ring , and is useful for about 70 or 80 % of those cases where you need some sort of tool but the tool box is inaccessible.This gem has a tooth pick , a pair of tweezers , a sharp knife , a nail file , a screwdriver formed on the end of the nail file , and a pair of scissors . I have probably used the knife and the scissors more than any other tools.The knife and the tweezers are useful for splinters and thorns , and thus the tweezers often become the third most useful tool . I must admit that occasionally I use the toothpick , particularly when real toothpicks are not available.The screwdriver is small enough that it can also fit into a Phillips head screw . I have even been able to use the flat blade on some small hex head screws.The difficulty with carrying tools is that they can fill your pocket very quickly . This small Swiss Army knife is small enough to fit into a purse or a pocket and yet large enough to be useful . While the larger Swiss Army knives have even more and larger tools and blades , they are also harder to carry . Of course this particular knife will not replace a tool box , but I find it amazing how many tasks I can accomplish with the simple tools available in this gem .	1
i have one of these and my girlfriend wanted one for valentines day . I found this one in pink and it is the real deal , just in pink . We both use ours all the time . Having this on your keychain comes in handy very often . Its small enough to put on your keys , but sharp and durable enough to cut open stuff with all the time . And you never know when you are gon na need a toothpick !	1
Outstanding pocket knife . Very sharp Very handy .	1
Fits right in your pocket without much notice , and it never ceases to amaze me at how often I call upon its tools .	1
I purchased this for my father 's birthday presenthe loves itIt is the bare minimum thobut still nice	1
I was looking for a long time for a small knife to carry on my keychain . I like my keychain SMALL .. I can not stand bulk . Prior to this knife , i had 2 keys and the keyfob from my car - that 's it . Most other & # 34 ; keychain & # 34 ; tools are huge/heavy/bulky.So , after I got this thing , I 'm impressed at its overall length and weight . The length is maybe 1/4 & # 34 ; larger than your typical house key and the weight is negligible . The tools work well for nail maintenance and small tasks you 'd use a tiny knife for . The alox scales are awesome and seem like they 'll stand up to abuse for years . One thing to know if you 've never had a real Swiss Army Knife but only knockoffs . The construction is a LOT better . For instance , the scissors are tight , sharp and the rivet holding them in place seems very tight . The other advantage of alox is that the knife is thinner than the plastic-handled equivalent .	1
This is a very small , basic function knife , perfect for carrying in my road bike bag . It comes with scissors and tweezers build in , as well as a super sharp blade . A perfect mate to my biking tool for long rides . I 'm very happy with the purchase	1
Many backpackers like this for it 's utility and lightness ( one ounce or two ) . I like it because it is a slip joint without a lot of strength to it , so no real snapping back on the fingers . Great first knife for a young scout to learn knife safety with . Really , great utility knife for almost anyone to carry . Some find the file , scissors and toothpick provide the most utility . A bit over-priced , in my opinion , though .	1
Very handy little tool , or should I say tools . I had one before and after many years of service broke . Now received it for Christmas and will have it for many years to come .	1
When I opened up the package , I was astonished but very pleasantly surprised to find out how *small* this is ! The red housing measures 2-1/4 '' x 1/2 '' ( dimensions exclude protrusions from the tools contained within the housing ) . This makes it real handy to take along with you on camping trips or on hikes . It is small enough to attach to your key chain ( it has a ring for that purpose ) .I 'm simply amazed at the quality of the craftsmanship . The ruby red plastic ( I picked the ruby red version of this knife ) is transparent , not opaque like the housing of a classic Swiss Army knife . It contains some of the most essential tools for a survival toolkit and then some:1 ) Scissors2 ) Knife3 ) Tweezers4 ) Screwdriver ( Flathead ) 5 ) File6 ) Toothpick - Eew ! Gross ! The knife and scissors are EXTREMELY sharp . The tweezers come in very handy if you ever need to extract a thorn or a stinger from a bee from the flesh . The tip of the file is a 1/8 '' flathead screwdriver . As for the toothpick ... use a disposable toothpick for chrissake ! -- -The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife contains many indispensable tools for when you 're out camping or hiking . The built-in key ring makes it easy to attach it to your key chain so that you can bring it along everywhere you go . Highly recommended !	1
I use this knife at least once everyday:1 . Open mail and packages with knife in a flash , no paper cuts.2 . Use scissors to trim sleeping baby 's nails , so sharp they work perfectly and do not create ragged edges like baby nail clippers did . Also , they fit perfectly in my hand for highest precision trimming , I 've never nipped her ever.3 . Tiny screwdriver is a life saver ! I used it to fix our towel rack in bathroom and it is perfect for opening battery hatches on baby 's toys.4 . The tweezers are very good , I use them to keep my eyebrows groomed when I have a free minute anywhere.5 . I use the toothpick all the time.6 . All tools help keep natural nails groomed.7 . Perfect to trim stray threads and such when out of the house.8 . Have used blade to cut flowers ( with approval ) to bring home while out on walks.9 . Have used screwdriver/file to pry out spent car fuse while out.10 . I keep these with me all the time on my key chain with a clasp , instant removal for ease of use.I recommend having a knife like this with you at all times , you never know what will come up and it is so nice to be a bit prepared .	1
We use the scissors all the time . This model is noticeably thinner than the regular plastic scale versions , which I like .	1
Another of my pocket knives became the property of the TSA ( did n't see the extension of the & # 34 ; no pocket knife & # 34 ; rule for flying ) . Consequently , I was in the market for a replacement . Why mess with perfection ? I 've had a dozen Victorinox knives over time and have never been disappointed . My new one is no exception . Highly recommended .	1
Small and lightweight . Weighs approximately 0.6 oz ... perfect for the keychain . If you only need basic tools , I can highly recommended this Swiss army knife .	1
I ordered this knife to replace one I 've had for a good while . It is just as nice as the original knife . I like these flat little victorinox pocket knives .	1
A light weight well-made medium duty knife with lots of handy uses - what 's not to love ! With a price like this , you could stash these in your house and car/truck for the price of a pizza - two thumbs up !	1
I purchased this a year ago when my husband lost his . He 's owned about 4 and has never had a problem with any of them . Unfortunately , he 's lost all the rest . So , I bought him the new one and , of course , he loves it .	1
Good knife , easy to carry in a pocket , small enough to go lots of places , we always use the scissors at family holiday gift opening .	1
Kidding , I 've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it . I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker . All tools function well . My favorite is the toothpick . The fingernale file comes in at a close second . the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size . This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit , but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC . Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible . I rotate all my other blades , but this one is my constant companion . Now if only they would add a corkscrew .	1
It 's very thin and a bit smaller than expected , but I think it will do a fine job for what I bought it for . I just wanted a simple knife to cut open Amazon ( hah ! ) packages at work and to file any rough nails from snagging on drawers and such . I 'm sure the scissors will come in handy too .	1
I carried one of these for years and mostly took it for granted . That is , until I lost it , and then realized just how often I used it and for how many things . This new one is exactly the same ( minus some scars and dings ) and I feel like I have my old friend back . Arrived very quickly and exactly as described .	1
Bought this for the wife , she loves it . She thought I was nuts because it comes with a toothpick but she uses it everyday , and what woman does n't use tweezers ?	1
It 's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a `` knife . '' Like other Swiss army knives , there are multiple functions . I 've used the scissors more than anything , but the single slim knife blade does come in handy . Unless the TSA takes it away , eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break , and you 'll lose the toothpick , the tweezers , or both . Then , perhaps , it 's time for a replacement . Until then , however , you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions !	1
I have a number of Swiss Army knives - but they 're all the bigger , bulkier sets . They are awesome , but as a girl , and at work , they 're not always convenient or welcomed by others . I use the little scissors all the time . Unlike knock-off brands , the scissor blades touch and actually do real cutting where you want it .	1
You need this tool . The sharpness of the scissors is incredible and it will last for years . I have had mine for 10 years . Still works great .	1
I get these for gifts all the time , especially for the women and girls in my life . Like all other Swiss Army knives , this little gem comes shaving sharp right out of the box ; the scissors are also razor sharp .	1
It turned out to be a lot smaller than i expected . I had a bigger one before but someone stole it : - ( So I went ahead and bought this one . Comes in real handy .	1
My girlfriend was elated and pronounced the knife & # 34 ; cute & # 34 ; . She was amazed at the sharpness of the knife blade and the precision fit of the scissor . Victor has been making unequaled knives for a long time , and this is one .	1
I 'll start by saying this knife may be small , but it is sturdy . It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it 's small size wo n't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you 'd need for day to day uses . It has a knife that is great for cutting small items ( string and packaging etc ) and although i 've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it . The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well . The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times . These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved , they manage to be aesthetically pleasing , easy to use and sturdy all at the same time , no mean feat . A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .	1
perfect , small knife with several nice additional blades ; the Swiss Army people manufacture these and many other to consistently high standards	1
I had been carrying a regular SA Classic and wanted to get the Alox one.PROS : Metal durability and lookSlimmer than the plastic onesCONS : You lose the toothpick and tweezers	1
A small , sharp knife , combination file and small screwdriver , tweezer , toothpick , and small scissors , all in one package that can go on your keyring . What could be cooler ? You 'll be surprised at how often you use the Classic.The only question is , should you get the Classic , or the Rally , which is the identical pocket knife , but with a combination small philips head screwdriver / bottle opener instead of the scissor ? It 's a matter of which you get the most use out of ; I have both but prefer the Rally for the bottle opener . Most people have the Classic , perhaps because the Rally is newer and is n't as well-known.Have a look at the Rally before you decide ; it is on the Amazon website for the same price .	1
It 's great to have with you at all times and the aluminum finish looks great . Whether to cut a loose string from your clothes , open a package , tighten a screw or filing down your nails this knife works great . It 's so small yet feels really sturdy . Giving up the tweezers and toothpick is a trade off but it 's so slim you barely notice it in your pocket .	1
Just so nobody gets confused here , this is a very small pocket knife . To be worn on a key chain . Nothing remotely what is considered EDC ( every day carry ) . But here is why I got it : You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc . Scissors , a nail file and what I like the best ... .tweezers and a toothpick . None of the high priced Leatherman etc . multitools have tweezers , and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be .	1
I 'll never forget the first time I saw a Victorinox knife , my grandmother kept one in her purse and I always asked if I could see it ... as a kid I thought it was the neatest thing in the world.Moving on when I got older I turned to multi-tools : they were more compact , sturdy stainless steel , and they were more comfortable to carry than a thick Swiss Army Knife loaded with everything but the kitchen sink ( and pliers ) .But to the patient individual who can carry an SAK in their pocket everyday I can only say it 's level of handyness really depends on what you get ... but let 's get to the classic SD.So what 's so great about the SD model ? it 's nice to have something useful on your keychain and this knife is it ! Think about it : the knife is only two layers so it 's reasonably thin.Does n't weight much so it 's not a bother on your keychain.And do n't forget the tools ... for something this size efficient and useful your keyring is practically naked without it.Being that the SD is smaller in size it 's more for light-duty tasks or uses where intricate use is involved and though it does n't seem like much you 'll find it to be handy when you least expect it.Take the tools for instance ... *Scissors : Now and then I 'll get behind on cutting my fingernails and mine have a tedency to grow fast , I deal with the public alot as a technician so appearance is important.I just whip these little scissors out on the way to a service call ( not while driving ) and since their small they do make nice and small clips more in tune with a nail clipper ... a real timesaver.Using them for cutting things ? well you can but you 've also got the knife . *File/Small Slotted Screwdriver : As a guy I do n't really file my nails as a routine function but I do work with my hands alot and my nails get chipped or torn , I can deal with that except when they snag on your pants pocket , your work shirt , or heck even a blanket in bed ... then it 's annoying.But the file 's right there and it does the trick so I 'm not ragging on guys who file their nails but it 's nice to have the file on a 'as needed ' basis.The small slotted screwdriver gets an odd use for me-I use it to get out the lint that collects in my fans during the summer.Or when I 'm cleaning one of the service vehicles and there 's cigarette ash or dried out soda that collected in those little gaps in the consoles ... that tip really helps get it out . *Toothpick/Tweezers : As you might have guessed they serve their simple purpose and there is the most common flaw ... the toothpick is proned to fall out.The only thing I can mention to you for preventing that is do n't force the toothpick into it 's slot , there 's is a machined notch on the plastic surface that secures the toothpick and by shoving it in your'e wearing down that notch.Beyond that the two implements serve their purpose . *The Knife : It 's a reasonably sharp and thin blade and of course it 's cheap versus a dedicated knife ... but it comes handy in a pinch.I usually never forget my personal carry knife so this little blade gets seldom use but after years of owning my first SD it finally needed a light sharpening ... two or three passes on a stone and it was sharp again ... got ta love soft steel.So that wraps it up on the tools with only one word of advice : use rubbing alcohol and wipe down the tools you use for sanitary reasons then wipe off the alcohol and dry.The tools are polished stainless and fight off rust quite well but wipe the alcohol completely from the tools ... if it sits on the steel for extended periods of time it will eat into the finish.The Handles : Plastics can do two things for a consumer-they can win someone over and prove their worth or they can break and dissapoint someone ... Victorinox just uses a basic plastic and nothing specialized like delrin or zytel for the handle scales.But I 've tossed my keys on the kitchen table countless times and I 've dropped my keys on concrete a good share of times and both my old SD and my new one have never cracked or shattered , only scratches.The handle colors have changed over the years , first time I bought one they were only available in Red or Black and the colors seem to vary throughout the years ... my new one was in Forest Green ( seems discontinued in that color ) .Final Thoughts : I 'm sure many other reviewers have said this but it is the most handy thing in a compact form on your keyring-it does n't take up space and it 's truthfully useful.The tool selection may seem limited to some but I think for it 's size the Victorinox Classic SD brings alot to the table ... 5-stars ! *File :	1
Good buy and a handy little tool to have in your purse.Do n't leave home without it !	1
Great to always have a knife and scissors and nail file AND tweezer handy . Very rugged , last for years . Had one for a longgg time , but forgot and tried to take it through airport security . So I bought another one . Indispensible !	1
Great size and very functional . I had one on my main keyring for several years but lost it when out in the woods years ago . So this was a replacement . If I loose this one , I 'll buy another . Very good little knife .	1
This knife is so handy . When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it . I thought I would have to replace it right away . I am amazed that I have not lost it . The blade is very sharp . The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car , after purchasing something in the store . It is a very sharp , sturdy for it 's size and just a great little knife . I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition . I highly recommend this knife .	1
This is the perfect keychain Swiss Army knife . The scissors work well and are probably the most useful tool , for me . I have owned these for years , but one got confiscated at the airport and my second said a company name on it , so I wanted a plain black one .	1
A nice little knife with a few basics to always have on you . Fits well on the key chain , sharp , good quality.I have noticed that the shinny scales scuff much easier than the older swiss army knives . 2 weeks riding around in my bag and my new knife looks as warn as my 15 year old camping swiss army knife . Does n't affect use though .	1
I have these knives in all of my survival kits and emergency kits . They are small and contain several useful tools that could make life easier in a situation that is far from & # 34 ; easy & # 34 ; . reliable and worthy of your purchase !	1
It was a christmas gift for my husband . perfect size , he keeps in his car as a quick go to tool .	1
What else can be said . A must for anyone that wants to be prepared . I keep it on my key chain and reach for it fairly often .	1
Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD Pocket Knife ( Blue ) is so compact and cute ; It is so convenient to carry on .	1
I have had this on my wallet for a while . It is so handy . What I use the most are the small blade scissors , and pen . Very Very useful .	1
This is an amazing multi-tool and I give it a strong recommendation . The action on all the tools is smooth and feels solid . Everything locks into place nice and tight.I have recommended SwissTools to the guys at work and several have picked them up , everyone loves them.One side note , although I recommend this ( and Victorinox other multi-tools ) without reservation , I do feel that I have to mention that I purchased one of these tools from Amazon and the one that came to me was clearly refurbished . The bolts that it swivels on where clearly ( and poorly I might add ) restamped and there was serious marring along the side of the tool . I ended up returning the one I purchased from Amazon , getting my money back and purchasing from another vendor ( on another web site ) . Additionally , this is not the first multi-tool I have purchased from Amazon that I felt was a refurbished/floor model . I also bought a Leatherman , that I also returned.I recommend this tool with no reservations , but I would encourage you to purchase from elsewhere .	1
I 've had a couple of Gerber Multipliers that have served me well but kept reading how good the Swisstools are , so I ordered one from Amazon last week . My initial impression is , `` WOW ! '' The Swisstool is really well made and finished . It feels considerably more solid than the Gerbers I have , or the Leatherman tools I 've handled . I should n't be too surprised , since I have four other Victorinox Swiss Army Knives : a Cybertool 41 , and three Pioneers , one of which I 've gone back to my everyday carry knife , having bought it in the early 1980s . ( I keep one Pioneer in my truck and my wife 's car for emergencies . ) Except for the pliers , the individual tools can be accessed without opening the tool . Each tool locks in place , so you do n't have to be concerned with them closing on your fingers . The handle is contoured so that it does n't dig into your hand when you squeeze down on the pliers . The knife blade , belt cutter , and reamer are very sharp . The seat belt cutter is a serrated , curved blade with a round point . The cutting edge is on the inside of the curve . I could this being useful on boats when you need to cut something but do n't want to risk using a pointy knife . The scissors are slightly larger than those on my Cybertool 41 , with which I 've cut a fair amount of CAT5 . The scissors are nice and sharp.A well-constructed black nylon belt sheath with a snap closure was included . The sheath is designed to stay open so that you can easily re-sheath the multitool with one hand.So far , I 've used the bottle opener , to open a bottle of Yuengling Lager . Works great . : - ) I also tested the scissors on some heavy corrugated cardboard and they worked well . Both the knife blades are very sharp and cut well.If you 're in the market for a good multitool , the Swisstools from Victorinox are definitely worth looking at .	1
I have several multi-tools . I use one or another on a daily basis . But this one makes them all pale in comparison . Its heavy and all the blades are razor sharp . Mine came with a lite coat of oil from the manufacture so it was good to go out of the box . It was a bit tight but after use it loosened a bit	1
I 've wanted one of these tools for a long time and I finally decided to go for it . I 've handled the SwissTool as well as multi tools by Leatherman and SOG , which are brands I highly respect . I decided for the SwissTool because it feels more like a `` real '' tool than the others . It is simply more substantial , appears to be sturdier . The tools locking open is also a great feature and that alone had a lot to do with my choice . You ca n't go wrong with any of the 3 name brands but if you need durability the choice is easier.Note : the tool comes with a sheath . So unless you dislike nylon , you do n't need to order the sheath separately .	1
What I like : Aesthetically pleasing to look at , handle and use . The stainless steel is very appealing , and holds a nice shine . The tools opening and locking have a very substantial , visceral click . The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice , light-weight nylon SNAP pouch ( I hate the velcro ones ) .It 's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge , which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike : Nothing . I 'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT .	1
I use it almost constantly at work and I love this thing . It has come in handy so many times since I got it . Very durable and works good ! Awesome Victorinox !	1
The Victorinox Swiss Tool RS is just what I was looking for - a mini tool set . I ca n't wait to try them all out . This is one of those 'do n't leave home without it ' items and comes in handy when I go hunting and fishing . While , you ca n't carry every tool with you to handle each and every unforseen emergency situation , this Victorinox comes as close as any to being able to do just that . It 's a little too big to keep in my pocket but since it comes with a sturdy case it works fine on my belt.My Marine Corps experiences from the cold of Norway to the steaming jungles of Panama tells me this is a winner . Just like myVictorinox Swiss Army Explorer with Free Pouch , this is truly a quality product , one that you can count on to get the job done . You will definitely be glad you ordered it . I know I am . ~ The Boss	1
This has been an EDC since the purchase . Though it 's a heavy tool , the cordura sheath is sturdy , quiet and out of the way on my belt at a 5 o'clock carry position . The Victorinox logo on the pouch makes it much more acceptable for wear at the office than my Gerber or Leatherman ; must be a subliminal 'peaceful , neutral Switzerland ' kind of thing ! Fit and finish are amazing ; much better than the Gerber and Leatherman I own . Pliers are strong & close tightly . Too soon to rate the strength of the steel.I did not buy the `` Plus '' model ( Bits , Cork Screw/Micro Screwdriver ) . I opted to purchase a quality micro ( eyeglass ) screwdriver separately . It lives securely in the bottom of the standard pouch . If I ever find I need those extra bits and wrench , I can customize to my needs cheaper than what these extras cost.I would recommend the `` RS '' to a friend and that they buy it from Amazon . It came 2 days after I placed my order !	1
I own several brands of Multi-tools , SOG , Gerber , Leatherman and now Victorinox . Nothing against the other brands , they are each very good in their own right , but this tool is nothing less than the Swiss perfection that you would expect from Victorinox . The pliers are very smooth and not stiff like the other brands ( with exception to the spring assisted Gerber EVO or Butterfly ) . And the accessories are the easiest of all brands to open , they work just as smooth as opening up any Victorinox knife , and I might add they are also just as sharp . The only thing that could make this better is the opening of the pliers ; I have yet to find any multi-tool that opens as smooth and as easy as the gear driven SOG PowerLock . Just my $ 0.02 ... .. ! ! ! I highly recommend the RS and would definitely buy this one again .	1
This is my first and only multi-tool . It is exceptionally well built , rock solid , and has the tools I want . I have not compared it to other brands or to other models by Victorinox , but can not imagine how any other multi-tool tool could be better made .	1
I had been wanting a multitool with a good set of pliers for a long time now . But with all the choices on the market and most of them being less than cheap I did n't know what to do . Then I saw Victorinox made multitools and they had really good ratings . As soon as I saw the Swiss Army brand I was sold . If you 're looking for a solidly built multi tool this is a great choice . I like how all the tools lock into place and I think the pliers are a good size and shape to handle a variety of uses .	1
I really like this MT and give it 4 stars , and the reason it is not 5 stars is because I noticed that although the multi tools lock in place and work very well , its moves slightly when I wiggle it with my fingers . Compared to my leatherman Charge TTi , the charge TTi tools lock and do not move % 100 . The swisstool RS locks but does not move % 98 . OVerall even though it moves very slightly if I wiggle it with my fingers , It does not hinder performance . I like the fit and finish , the polish i believe withstands rust better than the leatherman , but I have not yet to see either rust.I do not like the pouch it comes with , when I got it i noticed a lot of tiny fine hairs shedding inside it and it got stuck in between the multi tools so I had to clean it off and wipe it down with some rubbing alchohol , I do not like that the fine threading sheds because I do not want to ingest or inhale it by accident and could be a potential health hazard . Also I do not like how the tools are a bit tough to pick out with your fingernail but I have healthy strong nails so I have practiced getting them out , but I am sure it can hurt your nails for most people . I believe the tools get easier to pick out with your fingernail over time as you use it more . Not a deal breaker though I still like this tool a lot.Overall this is a high quality product that I like and i am happy I bought it .	1
This is my initial review . I will update this after using it in Afghanistan.BLUF : I would buy another one should something happen to this one right now and would recommend it to a friend . I have used two other brands of multitools extensively for the last 13 years and this product is more solid and feels better made . Each tool can be extended without pulling out other tools and does so smoothly yet firmly enough not to feel cheap or to come out when you pull the tool next to it out . The tensioner on the back of each handle is very finely cut to produce an individual tensioner for each tool . The tools themselves are very general purpose and do n't seem to be designed for any particular trade or use . The pivot pin of the pliers is smooth , has no spring or tension to it , nor any lateral/sideways movement . The case fits well and does n't slide around much at all on my 2 '' utility belt . The tool arrived well oiled appearing to have been cared for until packaged for distribution.My overall initial impression is this tool strikes a good balance of tension and smoothness to provide a quality tool suitable for general purpose work . It would certainly suffice until more appropriate tools were on hand . I will edit this review after the tool has loosened up and I have had a chance to use and sharpen all of the tools . ( Update 1 : The carry pouch for the tool closes via a button which I have not been able to master . It takes some finesse to close properly and if it is hit just right it will open unknowingly . I 've recently replaced it with an old multi-tool case that has a velcro closure because I fly helicopters with the doors off . The case itself is the sturdiest of the four nylon cases I have owned in the past and the closure suffices for day to day uses , but if you do work where the tool could fall out if the button were not snapped , I would either look at getting a different case or know you will have to modify the existing one . I have downgraded my review from a 5/5 to a 4/5 because I believe the people that use a multi-tool like this on a daily basis are probably performing a job that would require a more secure closure ; however , if I were to rate the tool itself , I would rate it 5/5 . )	1
I have owned or evaluated multitools by several manufacturers , and Victorinox makes the best . The manufacturing quality is outstanding . The selection of tools is excellent , the tools lock solidly in place , and the knife is razor sharp out of the box.When used as pliers , the outside of the handles do not dig into your hand.Highly recommended .	1
This is a beautifully constructed , solid tool . Being so it is on the heavy side . The only faults that I find with it are : the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades . In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades . On the other hand , the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size ( size 1 ? ) , a larger or smaller one would be more useful . I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect .	1
In my opinion , this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them , you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful , every tool has a nice crispsnap . Its a little heavy ... .but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable , as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made ! Thats all nice and good ... .but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these ... like I said , you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman . I like buying American products too ... .but when it comesdown to it , I 'm going with quality .	1
This one has all the tools I was looking for - sturdy pliers , scissors , sharp plain edge blade , file , saw , and the all-important awl which seems to be a hard to find feature these days . I own several Leathermans , and I ca n't stand how their tools clump together and are difficult to deploy . The Swisstool has no such problems . Every tool is easy to deploy individually , and locks in place . Also important is that the tools can be deployed without having to open the pliers . The product has good fit and finish , is reasonably comfortable to hold , and has no sharp edges poking my hand where they should n't . The included holster holds the tool securely , I did n't observe the problem of it opening too easily as mentioned elsewhere .	1
This is a very nice tool , feel like I 'm a fancy engineer or something when I hold it . Now engineeringwise , its kind of tough to get to some of the tools and when they come out , they are at a weird angle . I ordered this along with a bunch of other items and found myself reaching for my Leatherman Sidekick 's blade to open the other items . Like that everything locks .	1
This is a really nice tool , fantastic fit & finish.I like how all the tools are available without opening the pliers , do n't clump together and all lock.I feel so well equipped when I have this multi-tool with me .	1
I owe Wave and Vic.X tool as I found them to be the best of the best on the market among multitools . Recently I bought Leatherman TTi Charge ( the most expensive one ) and pliers broke with first hard squeeze ... that was unacceptable for me and I returned it . I owe first Wave and X tool for 4 years now and will say that for more delicate job you probably would want Leatherman Wave but for the tough job ( any job ) - X tool is 100 % the leader . Just look ahead of time and decide where , and how , you will most likely use your `` knives '' . The best future for me over Wave is quality of steel . I did n't see anything of the same or better steel quality in other knives yet . The best description I found from Aj Viljoen here : [ ... ] Good Luck !	1
I use this day in , day out for work , home , and play use . Well worth the money , and very well made . It 's the world 's best nail file , and much much more .	1
I do n't see this as a serious every day tool - there are far better ( and more expensive ) knives out there . If you really need a knife , adding one with too many multitools makes it too awkward . Alternatively , if you really do need a lot of tools , this knife is n't it . No corkscrew ( I actually use that one ) or scissors ( ditto ) or saw ( same there when I can find a sharp one ) .But it 's a great starter knife for a kid or as one to throw into a kit or glove compartment just to have something.As a pocket knife - it 's serviceable . Victorinox is the official Swiss Army knife of course . This one is n't super high quality , but it 's pretty decent . Since the description does n't tell you the tools , here they are with comments . Let me first just say that saying it has 12 tools is misleading - many are `` combo '' tools that kind of do n't merit being called separate items . I had to look up the description on their website to find them all ( again the packaging has a nice picture to help you also ) :1 ) Standard Phillips head . Stands up so that it is roughly emerging from the middle of the handle making a T shape . Good for leverage , bad for any kind of tight space that can not accomodate the turning radius of the handle or that needs length on the blade to reach down in as the metal portion of the screw driver is only 1.5 '' ( look at me getting out my tape measure ! ) 2 ) Long blade - this would be your main knife blade . Clicks securely into place - so long as you do n't do anything that goes against the safety rules in the boyscout ( and used to be in the girl scout thank you very much ) manual , you should be fine ! Takes a fairly intentional ( but not unreasonable ) amount of force to close . Doable by a child by the way , but definitely not loose enough to present obvious hazards . Comes reasonably sharp , sharpens up real nice by stone . Have n't used enough to say if it holds the edge well , but theoretically being Swiss steel it should ? Did not see a rating on it and was hasty enough to have already tossed the packaging well over a week ago . Reasonable balance if holding by the handle - enough for good control . Reasonable utility . Length is 2 and 5/8 '' if measuring all the way down to where it emerges from the handle ( as the TSA pictures do ) meaning it is , unfortunately too long to take on a plane under the new rules about to go into effect . ( only 2 1/4 '' is sharp though ) . Just under 1/2 '' at its widest point.3/4 ) Can opener with small flathead screw driver - This is one of those hard to use , easy to cut yourself with can openers that you will none the less love if you are in a pinch and the only food you have is in a can with no pull top ( getting rarer all the time ) . It 's basically a hook that goes under the can lid and a sharpened part that stabs into and mangles the metal . Some people are really good at using these ... I can usually get the food out of the can in 5 minutes with minimal blood loss . The `` small screw driver '' is a flat bit at the top of this tool . Again , very problematic if you are in any kind of tight space . The width of the `` can opener '' blade will prevent it from going far in and the length of the tool at 1.5 '' does n't give you much to work with past the handle anyway . This does come out directly from the end of the handle though ... not in a T like the phillips . Honestly , I 'd find something else to use in most cases if at all possible . If you slip , there 's a sharp can opener to cut yourself with . Joy ! 5/6/7 ) Cap lifter or Bottle opener ( same thing ) /Wire stripper/large flathead . Well , same comments on the screw driver as with the small flathead except that its bigger and no sharp hazards when it slips . As for the `` cap lifter '' or `` bottle opener '' - yep , it opened my can . But it slipped on the first try - not as good as the one built into the handle of my Oxo can opener , that 's for sure . Could use more of a `` hook . '' But it 's okay . Wire stripper though ... that 's just a joke . I 'm an electrical engineer and I ca n't for the life of me think what wire I 'd strip with this . It 's just a non-sharpened notch . You 'd need a wire of exactly the right size with sleeving precut , loose , and not so long you can push it without the wire slipping out of the notch . As I said ... I ca n't think what wire that would be that I 'd ever run into . Seriously , this seems next to useless . If you NEED a wire stripper , this is n't it . You might have better luck stripping your wire with creative use of the `` can opener '' 8 ) Small knife blade . Good for finer things ( scratching corrosion off of small parts for instance ? ) but probably less useful ( to me anyway ) than the large blade . 1 5/8 '' from the handle to tip , 1 1/2 '' of which is sharpened . Comes out of the opposite end of the large blade just in case you 're one of the people who has some odd use case ( that I have not yet fathomed ) why this matters.9 ) Reamer - skinny little tool with a sharp blade reminiscent of one half of a scissor blade . If you do n't know what a reemer is , go on ... google it ( using the search term `` reamer blade on pocket knife '' . You 'll learn something ! Basically it 's for making holes in material or cleaning up rough edges . The little hole in it is ( apparently , according to the internet ) for assisting with sewing applications ... maybe . This also comes out from the middle to make a T shape with the handle . That 's probably for the best if you 're punching holes in leather honestly ... more control I 'd think ? 10 ) Toothpick - it 's one of those little white plastic jobbies . I 've only known one person ever who used this ... and it gets gross and chewed looking easy . This particular one seems a little bendy and easy to break ( did n't take it to that point , but it seems it would be easy ) ... so not so good even for something where you just need something stiff and pokey ( shut up ... ) 11 ) Tweezer - also a small little thing that comes out of the handle - metal , easy to bend , but actually kinda better than I thought it would be . Can get an okay grip with it . Would be useful for slivers or where you need to pick up something with slighly more precision than fingers can manage.12 ) Key ring - *sigh* this is a feature , not a tool ... but yes , this is listed as the 12th tool . Seems okay ... secure which is good if you 're going to hang this knife off a string ( I do ) . Kinda small but I do n't see where that 's a downside ... keeps you from putting other stuff on the same keyring.Also a few more things to mention : Comes oiled . As in , it got oil all over my fingers while I was opening the tools . Good ... mostly.Handle - seems reasonable quality , but the way the metal insert ( with all the tools ) is set into it , it 's not the most comfortable . Has some `` edges '' to it ( the straight edges of the metal insert and of the tools ) that are that you will feel if you work with it . Less comfortable than a good pocket knife that is just a pocket knife.On the whole - not a bad pocket knife at all . Seems good quality . A bit lacking on tools , but honestly , I feel most of the tools a person could add ( though I do like saws and scissors ) are not all that useful in this form anyway . Quite serviceable for a whittling knife - would be a good starter knife for a ( responsible ... ) child or handy for a generic tool kit or camping kit . None of the tools ( including the knife ) is as good as the tool itself as a good single item , but most will serve if you have nothing else , which in a swiss army knife is kind of the point.Probably worth it for fifteen bucks or so ... more than that and I 'd consider other options . Honestly ? Best bet is go to a store , look at and handle a selection and choose the one that best fits you .	1
This is the perfect pocket knife . Sometimes I miss having the wood saw , but I gave that up in order to have a slimmer knife .	1
After a traumatic experience with my old knife ( also Swiss Army ) that involved an impossible to open wine bottle , I was in need of a new knife . I searched and searched with the following requirements . It had to have both a small and large blade . It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver . It also needed the punch , toothpick , and tweezers . I found what I needed in the tinker . Its two blades wide , and the length in the description is accurate , no extra bulges in my pocket . I can easily say that i use it 4-5 times a day .	1
This knife has lasted me over 4 years already , but anyways there is one bad thing about this knife , it can easily get scratched if dropped , which is a problem i have encountered many times . but the cool thing is that if you drop it in a pond or a lake , it will not rust at all , it is a very good knife and have only lost the toothpick and the tweezers , and this knife is almost indestructible . i could try and smash it with a hammer and it would be perfectly fine . but do not attempt to smash it or it could leave a dent on the steel . also , all Victorinox knives are made in Switzerland.BOTTOM LINE : best knife ever ! ! !	1
Got this SAK for my brother for Christmas . It had everything that he wanted without some of the extras that can end up making it too bulky for carrying daily . Personally , I do n't consider the absence of scissors to be a real loss since it is a knife and comes with a pretty sharp blade ( two sharp blades actually ) , but that 's just me . Although a locking blade is always preferred , all the implements in the SAK `` lock '' /snap into place pretty firmly and do n't pose as much of a hazard as other non-locking blades . Like any Victorinox , the quality of materials is high and the expectance of performance is commensurate . It really is a classic knife .	1
I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter , Champion , Climber and this small Tinker . I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools . While the other might have more `` tools '' , I do n't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade , bottle opener , philips and flathead screw driver . The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great . Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper . The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase . Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best .	1
I purchased this knife to replace the one I lost . The Tinker model ismy choice because it has a variety of tools and is not too bulky .	1
I have carried a swiss army knife for 30 years and it is still going strong . Never leave home without it . Got this one for my son and I hope that he keeps his for the rest of his life .	1
I have used just about every tool on this knife . The can opener really works . It is handy to have two knife blades . One can be kept extra sharp for cutting paper , as in cutting articles from magazines and such . The other can be used for more ordinary and varied jobs . The Phillips screwdriver is a little cumbersome because you are restricted to a 90 degree angle to the handle for its use . This makes it difficult to use when tightening the mounting screws on a door 's lockset . I also ground away the square corner so the Phillips screwdriver would fit into round holes . I did square off the small screwdriver blade at the end of the can opener so it grabs better . The wire stripper is of questionable value . The metal Swiss Army Knife emblem came off of my knife after a while . The stainless steel blades hold an edge very well . I have had mine for 30 years .	1
If I recall correctly , this was the 1st knife I ever had . That was many , many years ago , and I lost it somewhere along the way . After all this time , partly due to sentiment/nostalgia , I decided to get another . And just like that 1st one I had , it is an extremely useful , high quality product . I highly recommend it .	1
About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one . I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart . This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket . Forget Leathermen or the like . This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife , better than Buck . I lost my original last week : ( . I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper . When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat .	1
I got this for my father-in-law for Christmas . The knife is a smidge bigger than what I would have liked , however , it does have all the basic tools I would want in a Swiss Army Knife . After reviewing multiple knives I do n't think there is another that has this convenient a set of tools . There are others with more bells and whistles , but I would n't want to have anything bigger for daily carry . If you are willing to sacrifice some tools there are smaller knives , but then you find yourself missing things when you need them . This knife is a good balance in the middle . Quality is what you would expect from a Swiss Army Knife .	1
Arrived in good condition and as advertised.I gave a couple of Swiss Army Knives to airmen I know so they would have them if they were deployed .	1
It 's a swiss army and it 's just as good as any I 've ever owned , I ca n't really figure out what to do with the one sharp daggerlike thing that comes straight out of the side , or the hook for that matter , but it 's still a great bottle opener , knife , pair of scissors , and corkscrew	1
Swiss Army knives really are one of the few products that I have nothing negative to say about . They are well built , durable , and useful . This particular knife has a good set of tools , but is small enough to carry in your pocket without being a pain in the buttocks . In my opinion , both Victorinox and Wenger knives are top notch .	1
I 've been buying a collection of the SAKs from Amazon , but this one I bought from Target when I was in the store . Mine 's the SilverTech version and it looks really cool . The Climber is exactly the same knife as the Super Tinker , except the Climber has the corkscrew and the Super Tinker has the Phillips . I own both models , and am I 'm torn between the two . I used to think I could n't live without the Phillips and had no use for the corkscrew , but my opinion is changing slightly . They 're both terrific , but lately I 've been favoring models with the corkscrew over the Phillips and here 's why : - The dedicated Phillips screw driver is a bit redundant because the can opener tip works well for Phillips screws.- More often than not I find the dedicated Phillips tip too large for most of the Phillips screws I come across.- The corkscrew can be a 2-in-1 tool , since it can house the mini screw driver.- Since there 's already a usable Phillips tip on the can opener , having the Climber with the corkscrew provides two more tools than the Super Tinker with the Phillips.- Lastly , in the rare occasion I 've used the Super Tinker 's Phillips on deck screws , sometimes such larger screws require more torque , which requires more pressure on the tool , and I 've had the Phillips collapse on my finger . Ouch ! Other SAK models which have the square-shaft Phillips on the END of the knife ( as opposed to the center ) work much better for heavy duty use . But that center-mounted Phillips makes me just want to get a regular screw driver.I love both models though , and if you 're really that torn over which model to get , why not just get both ? I would welcome any comments and perspectives regarding your opinion on the Phillips vs. the Corkscrew.Thanks for reading my review.Cheers !	1
I 've carried a Victorinox Swiss Climber for over 30 years . I 've lost a couple , and that 's the story with this purchase . I lost one I had been carrying for about 5 years.Still , hands down , the best multitool to carry around the world with you .	1
This is a great design for EDC in polite company , when you do n't want to pull out a red knife ! It is amazing that a 125 year old company is still coming up with something new and really in tune with the times.A little thinner than my usual Explorer , with everything important , lacking only the magnifying glass and Phillips screwdriver.I always have to say that Victorinox is definitely THE brand of Quality for SAK 's . Their factory-original blades last longer than Wenger , and much longer than ****ty Chinese knock-offs , most of which are nearly impossible to resharpen .	1
it has everything a person can us in its daily activites and besides that is cheap , it cuts , open cans do everything	1
This is a great pocket knife and multitool . As long as you know what you want from a multitool , this will make you happy . It 's a good size while still having plenty of functionality .	1
& # 34 ; Was & # 34 ; a GREAT knife and I really enjoyed using it . Opened many bottles of wine on the road ! I say & # 34 ; was & # 34 ; however because I forgot that I had it in my backpack and it was confiscated when going through the security line at & # 34 ; Fiumicino & # 8211 ; Leonardo da Vinci International Airport & # 34 ; My bad ... smile ... it has since been replaced !	1
A have a bunch of these all over the place . This one shipped quick arrived undamaged in original packaging . Not very sharp but that 's easily remedied . You can order replacement toothpicks !	1
One of the best Vicotorinox pocket knives made . This has everyting you would need in a multi-tool pocket knife without all the bulk . Great for EDC ! ! !	1
I have found this knife to be very handy having all the tools that I need . I particularly like the scissors . I bought this knife as a direct replacement of one that I had lost . I like the black case which gives it a classy look .	1
I can not say enough about the quality of Victorinox knifes . Owned Spartan since November of 1978.They have never disappointed me except once when I drop my Explorer and the scale cracked.They would no longer send you a replacement scale you had to mail the knife in.I had a similar problem in 1988 and they just mailed me the scale and a new spring for my mini-scissors after we talked on the phone.If you need a tougher knife just get the Silver Alox type , limited styles no toothpick or tweezers but they are great .	1
I have owned this brand of pocket knife for 40 years . Never used any other because they 're perfect . I 've had maybe 15 in that 40 year period and none was ever broken or failed to work in any way . I think they were all stolen by people who realized how utilitarian they are . I just chalk it up to fact that the thieves were jealous of my owning something so perfect for their pocket .	1
Outstanding ! Ca n't tell you how often I use the scissors on it ! ! ! I usually buy them in pairs , as either TSA or a couch cushion ends up with them .	1
i basically wanted these for the larger scissors and extra blade . while I rarely use these blades , I like having options and keep them razor sharp . the I mainly use this for when I 'm bored at work and file my nails or trim my 'stache . I 've yet to use the orange peeler but it 's pretty sharp so i do n't see why it would n't be able to peel and orange . it 's about half an inch longer than the classic .	1
the best nail file ... the perfect size . whats not to love . This is the handiest knife victorinox makes . two more words ...	1
Very good for a small pocket knife . Victorinox is the best for the swiss army knives . Has the basics and a good size	1
This is the perfect every day knife . It is very practical and I carry it in my pocket every day . It is well made and sturdy and the blades hold an edge very well . Scissors and rest of utensils work perfectly .	1
This is a really nice pocket knife , hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy ! The next time I buy some oranges I 'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm ( smallest ) SAKs , and those scissors are n't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that does n't come with scissors .	1
I bought mine when i was in my teens and have had it ever since . I have lost it a few times and came across it usually during a move or when I was looking for something else . Always happy to see it . It fits nicely in the small change pocket above the right front pocket of my levis . Its not to big at all and great for everyday stuff . My son will surely get this one when he is of age .	1
This is the sweet spot for pocket carry Swiss Army knives . A bit larger than the classic , with larger scissors and a larger knife blade , but not as bulky or large as the standard sized which are more effective but a bit larger than I like in my pocket . I still have n't peeled an orange with it so I ca n't comment on that aspect of that blade but it does work well opening packages , especially the frustrating plastic ones . This one is with me at all times ...	1
I 'm a businessman and a former Boy Scout . I like to Be Prepared , and that includes carrying a small pocketknife with me ( except when I 'm flying ) .I 've owned between 10 and 20 of this particular model of knife in 20+ years . Why so many ? Well , some of them I lost ... some were borrowed by my children and never returned ... some were abandoned at TSA security areas when I forgot to slip the knife into my checked luggage ... some are in my desk at work as an emergency reserve . And I always worry Victorinox will stop making this model , so I buy ahead.For me , this is the perfect pocketknife.- It has a great selection of blades ... the large and small drop point.. the fingernail cleaner/file ... the scissors are the best scissors I 've found on many a pocket knife ( on many others the blades are serrated , or the spring is misaligned , or too weak/strong ) ... and it 's amazing how often I use the orange peeler ! - The steel is gorgeous , never stains . It stays sharp for a long time ( I sharpen it with a diamond stick maybe twice a year ) - I use the toothpick for lots of tasks , from tooth hygiene to marlinspike for small problem knots.- It 's comfortable to carry in a pants pocket . Too many of the Swiss Army Knives are so loaded down with less useful implements , and too thick/heavy for business trousers.- Hinge tension is perfectly balanced . The blades open easily without breaking a fingernail , but keep the blades securely inside the handle.Any Boy Scout will tell you that a knife is the very most important tool you can carry . With a knife you can make rope , which is the second most important thing you can have in a survival situation . With knife and rope you can make shelter , acquire food and water . With a knife you can make fire , defend yourself.In addition to my various copies of this knife , I own another dozen or so knives for other purposes : Multitools , hunting knives , a folding knife for opening mail , and the kitchen knives of course . But this is my workhorse knife , the one I carry on my person .	1
The Executive is perfect . I 've owned one since spring of 2006 and it has never let me down since . I lost it once but my dog found it for me . I think the size of this knife is perfect , it is not as small as they come nor as big as they come . It is still big enough for heavy use however . This knife is a better option than the big Victorinox knife.I used to think that the tweezers , toothpick , orange-peeler , and nail file were pretty much useless , but they really ar n't . I ca n't go a day now without all these tools ! These knives will last forever ... I promise ... .but they will scratch and so on . But who cares ya 'll ! This is the perfect knife and gift for anyone who loves good ol ' fashioned quality.Buy this knife ! ! ! !	1
good for kids is durable and not damaged so fast with water . I worked to improve her shooting and practice my dribbling	1
This is a great basketball . My son has had it for over a year and it is still going strong	1
My daughter said `` the grip was n't the best , and it did n't bounce as well as other balls she has had in the past '' . She is only ten years old but she loves basketball and the ball was for her so I thought you should hear her point of view . The ball has been serviceable and is very good for the price . I must also say that it has taken a beating with all my children and the neighbors children as well giving it a torture treatment every day , yet it still bounces and it still is in one piece .	1
This ball is the size used by grade school teams . It is an outdoor ball so it may be a little heavier . Make sure you have an air pump and air gauge to get the pressure and size right .	1
I took this on it 's first trip this weekend . We hiked to a isolated lake inside of an island in Michigan . This was about a 5 mile hike . The boat is pretty lightweight , I had no issue rolling and strapping it to my backpack . The pump took a good amount of time to get the raft nice and inflated , but it held air for the remainder of the trip.I fished out of the raft for 4 days . I constantly had hooks rubbing against the rubber and never once did it puncture . I was pretty rough against the paddle-holders and they held up nicely . The boat moved through the water rather well for an inflatable raft , no complaints there.This is good for one grown adult and maybe a child . This fit myself and my fishing gear pretty comfortably . We used the explorer 300 for two adults , and that worked well .	1
This is a great heavy duty raft ! Great to go out on ponds or lakes and even fish off of ! Lots of fun ! A++ seller	1
I bought this for a float down a river and this was perfect . It stayed inflated , the oars worked well and did n't fall out during use , and it was pretty comfy . I 've only used it once so I ca n't say anything about longevity .	1
This little boat was a good price and came with the oars ( they are expensive if you purchase alone ) . I got this boat and the oars for only $ 4-5 more than just the oars , so we were happy , we now have two little boats ( and yes , one set of oars ) . Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore . I would n't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up , but we 've had ours for a year and it 's still holding original air , so that boasts well for the quality .	1
Small but it fit me 5'8 & # 34 ; 210 lbs and my 3 year old . Took it out on the lake and it held up great . Came with 2 surprisingly decent paddles and a pump . I definitely got my money 's worth out of it and will absolutely buy it again .	1
This thing is amazing ! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes , coolers , keys etc . Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it , it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it . I 've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me ( 6'2 & # 34 ; -185lbs ) and I did n't feel like it was going to sink . I 've also not used the oars yet . If I were going to make this purchase again , I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I 'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that . I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft .	1
For the price and what you get , ca n't beat it . Neighbours have been floating down the creek for 3 years in one , just got their first leak this summer.If something happens to it , no big deal . To patch a hole , duct tape or tuck tape will work fine if you do n't have a real patch .	1
Bought this for the kids to play with in the pool , they love it and have n't been able to pop it yet , first summer down , I think it 'll last a good while , get yourself one .	1
Arrived fast . I blew it up to check for holes since we do n't plan on using it until this summer . The oars were fairly easy to assemble . The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway . The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up ( even if only in the living room ) . I ca n't wait to take this to the lake this summer . It 's going to be a huge hit with the kids . Deflated easily for storage .	1
This thing was a trooper ! took it on a tubing trip down 3 different rivers lazy and rough . the oars were great it comes with a hand pump works great till i slid down a dam with do rough rocks and bottom tore but still stayed up above water great buy for cost just dont drag it on floor or scrape on rough rocks . but it was loads of fun and held up and im 350lbs and a case of beer !	1
worth the price . the kids love this little boat . only holds 2 small kids or 1 adult will fit snuggly .	1
I purchased this raft to have some fun in the pool and take it the Ocean in So cal . Its very nice for the price . Its held up great so far , ive done flips and jumps into it in the pool and no pop yet : ) . I brought it with to the beach yesterday and we had three of us crammed in it , held us fine and we had lots of fun flipping and riding the waves .	1
This is not anything but a toy , kids enjoyed them on vacation then we threw them away . The price is right .	1
I have used Dr. Bonner 's products for years and enjoy them . This particular soap , I use to partially refill the method foaming soap dispensers in the kitchen and then fill the rest with water . It saves me a lot of money , is gentle on my hands , and leaves a nice scent .	1
I have been using Dr. Bronner 's soap daily for years as my shampoo & soap . I keep it in the shower . We have used many different scents & I never travel without the 2oz travel-sized bottle.We have not found this to be a good dish soap but we know some people who swear by it . It does not create many suds & the dishes do not appear to get super clean . We have taken this soap camping to wash dishes , occasional clothing , utensils , camp stoves , etc . We do like to use this while camping.We uses the Sal Suds Concentrated Soap to wash our floors , bathrooms , fruits & veggies , etc.This 1 bottle lasts me almost a year so I become a little tired of the smell . It is intense . I made the mistake once of buying a gallon to refill my bottle & I was so sick of the smell that I almost dumped it down the drain ! & take the time to read the bottle ( or watch the documentary ) . This guy is a hoot !	1
I have been using Dr. Bronner 's almond liquid soap as a shower gel for over a year and love how it leaves the skin moisturized . Each time I use another bath or shower gel ( using the same one every day is pretty monotonous ) , I realize how much superior Dr. Bronner 's products are . I am about to buy my 4th 32-oz bottle.My husband , however , is not crazy about it .	1
The Good : I have been using this soap for years . From camping to my shower , I love its simple and cleansing feeling . There is no oily residue after you wash it off , and the peppermint really lets you know you are clean with that zing it packs . I have fairly oily skin and usual body soaps never really left me feeling like I had cleaned my pores and stripped away all the grime . This soap does just that . Finally , when using a lufa , this soap suds of tremendously.The Bad : There really is nothing bad to say about this soap . Some might consider it on the expensive side , but you wash yourself every single day , sometimes twice a day , so why not spend a little more to get a really great soap ?	1
I am so excited that I have found Dr. Bronner 's Castile Soap . I got the tea tree scented one in hopes of cleaning some stubborn grease from one of my pans . It worked like a breeze ! I now use it when I had wash dishes and I love that it 's organic and gentle on my skin . I have not tried it as a body wash or shampoo yet , but I think I will get a different scent to try it in the shower !	1
Universal house cleaner , laundry detergent without chemicals . Very good smell and feel . Though can be a little dry for your hands , as any soap , if ur using it daily for a long period.I recommend to dilute it ( make 2 out of 1 ) than u 'll get much softer skin , but the soap quality would be absolute same .	1
omg ! ! all of my life ive had body acne i work out alot and and its really hot here in san diego so its a given for my skin type . since using this soap only in for a week my acne has dried up it also took the redness out of a few small breakouts overnight ! also i examined my skin where i get black heads and the pores are all cleaned out the soap has really gotten deep into my pores cleaning the dirt and sweat out that would have cause me future blemishes i cant remember how i came across this soap but im never turning back to any other body was or bar soap nothing can compare i need to order this in more sizes and im willing to try in other scents in the future when my blemishes have fully cleared up . im just in shock right now how damn good my skin looks especially before summer time if i have only used this soap for less than a week imagine what it can do for me in a month ? ? ; D i cant believe all those chemicals were harming my skin and just making everything worse ( my previous body wash ) . i can literally read the ingredients of this soap and its just a bunch of good citrus oils in here with some glycerin thats all ! ! FOR BRIGHTING THE SKIN ! : : : if you have dull skin that flakes your constantly putting chemical lotions on . you have un even skin tone what i use is this http : //www.amazon.com/Salux-Nylon-Japanese-Beauty-Cloth/dp/B000CSDDDG/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1362350338 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =salux and dr. bronners citrus soap and i go to town ! this towel makes the soap extra lathery . it gets rid of dirty ashy skin and makes you bright and glowey with an extra clean feeling i also use it on my privates and it actually makes me smell better and i dont feel irritated it doesnt burn either and i really scrub ever where even on open cuts i noticed it heals them quickly and cleans of all bacteria and germs ohh ! ! ! another thing dont be disappointed when you get this soap it looks watery instead of thicker consistency and then think that you need tons of the soap to make it lather for your whole body you only need a small amount that barley covers your palm trust me its not alot then just lather it up with the salux towel i swear the bubbles just keep on growing and my whole shower experience smells like an orange juice factory its fantastic ! the bubbles wash away immediately on contact with water.CLARISONIC USERS ! i have the clarisonic mia and i use this soap with it it really deep cleans my pores and gets rid of my oily skin and blackheads around my nose makes my face glow and even tone skin my blemishes from my face are minor but there all gone now it even shrunk my pores more and my dry skin is no longer there i have dewy even skin its great ! ! ! ! ! ! natural is the way to go ! ! !	1
Love this soap and its gentleness . However , it needs diluting to really reap the benefits . Without dilution , it can be drying . I mix mine with 50/50 water . Sometimes I add extra virgin olive oil to make it more moisturizing . All in all , I love it as my shower soap and salivate over the almond-hemp smell !	1
The smell is amazing . It smells just like you have squeezed some oranges and lemons . It does n't have that bad fake citrus scent . In that regard this soap is excellent . When I use the soap it does n't dry out my skin like so many other soaps and for this I am grateful since I have to wash my hands several times a day . I have one word of caution though this soap is thinner than most soaps I have used so you must be careful when you are using it so that you dont use too much . But once you realize this it is not a problem .	1
My title pretty much sums it up . I grew up smelling this in my bathroom as my mother used it daily , and still does . It 's cheap , lasts a long time and does n't leave my skin dried out like other soaps that have additional chemicals within . It can be used for a variety of purposes , but I use it for my body only .	1
I was hesitant to buy this because I thought it would n't be any different than regular soap . But it 's awesome ! ! I use it to clean my breast pump parts , baby bottles & any toys that go in the baby 's mouth . I also use it to make a wipes solution for cloth wipes . I just add squirt to a cup of water and pour it over the wipes . LOVE it !	1
smells super clean , can use this for just about anything ! cleans quickly and does exactly what it says it does .	1
I love this soap . I use it for cleaning everything ! It works as a house cleaner , a personal cleaner , and a it is a great biodegradable backpacking soap . Just be sure to dilute as it is quite potent !	1
I used this as body soap for its gentle cleaning and I like the almond fragrance . Too many soaps are designed to remove all the natural oils from your skin but we need those to keep the skin from becoming too dry . I would have liked to see this product be a bit more viscous so that it does n't just run off of the loufa . Overall this product i recommend this product .	1
I made my first batch of diy laundry detergent this morning . I used one cup of sodium carbonate ( aka soda ash ) along with one cup of borax powder then I grated a bar of fels-Naptha soap . I combined all of these ingredients into a giant pot of `` near '' boiling water ( 5 quarts ) . Here is where I added 2 ounces of Dr. Bonner 's Magic Soap Peppermint . I just let it all melt with the burner turned off . I only had to stir it a few times until it was all blended.I have also used this peppermint soap for shaving , showering and shampooing . I do not have sensitive skin . I like to wash my hands with it as well . It only takes about one or two drops to wash my hands.A little bit goes a long way.I took a little bottle to work with me so I could use it all day.You will like it too .	1
I absolutely love this soap . I use is in a soap dispenser for hand/face washing , a squirt bottle in the shower for a shampoo and body wash . I even tried the peppermint formula as a tooth . . . errrr soap ( ? ) just because you can - it was ok but I wo n't be getting rid of my toothpaste . A little does go a long way so I 'm still experimenting with dilution percentages.After a month my skin feels great and I actually look forward to a refreshing shower . I 've read some state that it will dry out your hair/scalp if you use it as a shampoo - its made with olive oil for Pete 's sake ! ! ! It took several days for my scalp and hair to begin adjusting . Your hair never has the squeaky clean feel/sound and when your done your hair feels like it may not be clean . My hair looks and is very clean without any dry static , it does n't feel oily at all and it has brought back a hair feeling I long forgot - a feeling back when I was a kid . I 'm a guy with short hair by the way.My wife is a nurse and she associates this soap with enemas so she was not willing to try it , she is gradually opening to the idea tho - the soap not the NMA .	1
This review is for the 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint 16 oz soap . The dropdown for all the different scents and sizes is quite a nightmare , but the hemp peppermint one is 5th from the bottom of the list.I 've been using Dr. Bronner 's soaps for many years now and love his products . Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle , espousing the late rabbi-chemist 's philosophy and spiritual views ( on the unity of mankind : `` We 're All-One , or none '' ) . It wraps around the label , some of it 's written vertically , some in very tiny print . It 's idiosyncratic to say the least and gives me something to read while I 'm in the shower . He was n't officially an ordained rabbi , M.D. , or PhD , but I like his products all the same.But aside from that , it 's just a fantastic soap and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world . It 's 100 % natural , biodegradable , not tested on animals , supports Fair Trade , ingredients are certified organic , and the bottle is made from 100 % post-consumer recycled plastic . It is type 1 PETE plastic , so it is accepted by municipal recycling collection . The bottle even encourages you to conserve by refilling from gallon jugs or drums at the store.The soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice . It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly , without a filmy , slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave . I keep a bottle of it in my gym bag.I also use it to wash fruits and vegetables because I do n't like to peel them before eating in order to retain all the nutrition and fiber . Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables . The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this ( whereas before , I was using Palmolive ) . This soap is safe to go in the mouth and is even somewhat pleasant tasting ! I can not recommend this soap more . It 's simply fantastic .	1
I bought this for its natural ingredients . Product smells great-leaves me cheerful when i shower in the early AM . I used it to clean all of my makeup brushes and it worked great . People say one should use baby shampoo since it is the most sensitive , however , they are mistaken since most mainstream products contain harmful agents such as parabens and phalates . ( YES EVEN BABY SHAMPOO ! ) Dr. Bronner 's Soaps do not , hence the reason to use it instead . Plus it has multiple purposes ; who can beat that ? ! I would n't recommend it as a shampoo unless you dilute it and have semi greasy hair . I have combination and it dried mine out a bit .	1
I use this soap to wash my face , and I have also used it to wash my hair . What I like about this soap , is that it also clears my sinuses in the shower , which is an added bonus , as I always have sinus issues during allergy season . The soap does feel a bit drying on the skin initially , but it does n't feel squeaky clean like it does with sulphate soaps . I think I 'm probably using way too much , as a tiny bit goes a very long way . I really like this soap , and it will certainly be a staple in my house for a long time , given the incredible sinus clearing added bonus . I used to use a neti pot , but I stopped using it because I read about the brain eating amoeba that can be found in our water supply , and it freaked me out . I do n't need a neti pot anymore ; score !	1
Dr. Bronner 's soap is truly the best : it 's all-natural , mainly organic , all vegan , handmade , and comes from an ethical* company . Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get , remember that 's its highly condensed , so a little goes a long way . It 's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus . I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type . It 's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve ! *The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee 's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee .	1
This is my favorite scent out of all of the Dr Bronner 's scents . My only problem is that whenever I have a cut anywhere , the citrus in this soap stings me . I do n't have this problem with the bar soap version . I usually have either the almond or lavender liquid soaps as well so that I can switch them out when this happens . Also , none of these works well as a shampoo so I would n't use it for that purpose .	1
This is a favorite soap of mine due to it being all-natural and having excellent natural anti-bacterial properties due to the tea tree oil . It 's a great face and body soap.That said , I have had many times where the pumping action in the pump dispensers of any kind I use it in , build up clumps that look like blobs of glycerine soap on the end of the pump with a bit of a clog ... so you pump it a few times and WHAM it spews out . I ca n't fault the soap totally for this as it 's a great soap if you use it in the container provided , but I did want the consumer to be aware in the event that you decide to switch it to a pump dispenser.Two days ago I did this and it sprayed directly in my eye . It had clogged the pump dispenser because the pumping action makes a glob build up . The pain was so intense I could n't stop screaming and it dried out my eye horribly . I simply could n't seem to rinse it all out.I know this clogging property happens to everyone who uses a pump with this . I wish they could make it not do that . That said , as an adult , as long as you know and remember to pump it once then clean out any dried glycerine blobs at the end of the pump dispenser , it could work just fine . Better yet , just do n't put it in a pump dispenser and use it directly from this bottle.It 's a technical difficulty and an inconvenience but not one big enough to hinder my love of the soap and the great ingredients in it . I 've used it for a long time now and do love the soap , but wanted to give a heads up at the same time .	1
I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine 's recommendation . The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $ 5 therefore the 32oz here for $ 15 is a super bargain ! .I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing . A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck . For you superlight backpackers , this is a must have for the functionality , weight to use ratio , and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND !	1
So , my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well ! Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool , this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating , but dissipates quickly enough that it is n't overwhelming . The guys have buzz cuts , so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well . I would n't recommend it for longer hair , as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited . All in all , it is great for multi-uses , goes a long way diluted , and washes away clean . Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $ $ $ $ using this product .	1
People complain about the lavender smell . Yes it is STRONG when you smell right from the bottle . Actually using it as a soap/shampoo it leaves a very faint smell . You just have a nice clean smell with a hint of the lavender . I have used Dove body wash for years and this is a much better product . It does n't have the lotion that products like Dove contain , but it has a really nice , clean , refreshing feel and smell that is hard to beat . No lotion-like residue like the Dove ... but still the skin is pretty moisturized.It does n't foam up quite as much as most commercial soaps , but you actually use about the same , or less , of this product to get the same level of cleanliness . Plus being fair trade , environmentally friendly , and having an ingredient list that is actually comprehensible is a huge plus.I will never go back to Dove ... and will stick with this unless I end up finding something superior .	1
Bronner 's soaps are awesome . I bought the smaller size to put in our BOB and hope to never use it . But I am a huge fan of the tea tree smell .	1
I love Dr Bronner 's . I 've been using it for over 40 years . Goes a long way . Makes you feel refreshed !	1
This soap has many uses and is very gentle . I love love this soap and it does not dry out my skin .	1
This is the first time of use for us . It is a new and rewarding experience . The peppermint is tingly , but not overly so . It seems to leave my skin feeling really clean . It is not oily and the smell is not overpowering .	1
Leaves you with a fantastic clean feeling . I live in an area where a water softener is necessary and I was always grossed out with the slick feeling after using other soaps . I tried this out and wow , what a difference . No more greasy feeling skin , plus the satisfaction of knowing this is all organic and not made in some gigantic chemical mass production line.Recommended !	1
The reviews that say this smells like tar , I 'm puzzled by.Anyone buying tea tree oil soap , one would think , is buying it because of its antiseptic properties , in which case , one would think that you would know that tea tree oil smells strongly . I dont understand why people would buy the tea tree oil soap expecting it to smell like flowers ... thats just silly.I dont know about `` tar '' though . It smells like tea tree oil , which is sort of minty , strong smell , I dont find it unpleasant , myself.I like the smell of tea tree ! Anyway , I bought this soap to be an antiseptic soap to wash my piercings and keep them clean and free of infection , and thats what this soap does . Its Gentile , cleansing , and it kills germs , what else do you need soap to do ? This soap is very thin , but dont be fooled ! a little goes a LONG way . I use a tiny drop to wash my hands , and a Qtip to wash my ears . It lathers a lot , and you dont need a ton of it . You could even dilute it if you wanted , but its so thin I chose not to.Good product , great price , arrived super early.Plus the weird religious cult writing all over the bottle makes for humorous bathroom reading : x	1
I 've bought them for years and this one smells nice , too . I try to get different scented ones because the soaps lasts quite a while and has a great lather . When it comes to all-natural this is one of the best .	1
Nice unscented castile soap . It has minimal scent and is great for cleaning new ear peircings as well as for babies and general use if you are looking for an organic cleansing option .	1
This is good stuff , smells strongly of Peppermint , even when diluted . If you are good with that you will love this stuff for cleaning your body , countertops , etc . Be advised that if using this to clean your body a little bit goes a long way . If you are at all sensitive you may want to use the Baby mild or perhaps the Almond formula as this soap leaves your skin literally tingling . I feel cleaner and more refreshed when using this soap on my body than any bar soap I have ever used . Good stuff .	1
I honestly have known about this soap my whole life and have never tried it . Such a shame that I waited to try it ! I am using it for my laundry because every other soap for laundry leaves a residue and I ca n't tolerate all the perfumes in most detergent ! I like that there is a light fragrance for laundry but still you can smell the cotton , denim or whatever else you wash ! Great for delicates too ! I tried using in the shower and it was awesome there too ! Rinses off your body leaving you feeling clean . I used it to wash my hair and I must say , I would n't use it all the time for that . The occasional hair washing to get our all of the & # 34 ; hair product & # 34 ; residue maybe , but I 'm concerned it would leave my hair dry because it cleanses so thoroughly ! Recommended 100 % for almost anything else though !	1
I use this as a travel laundry detergent , and for handwashing when hotels do n't provide liquid soap . It has no scent other than a mildly soapy smell , which is nice . It does n't dry hands even when used at full concentration . This is a nice little bottle that does n't leak .	1
Have used this for years Backpacking . Cleans my cooking pots/plates and me and it 's organic ( OK it 's nasty to brush your teeth with ) And these guys pack it great , no leakage !	1
Greatest soap ever ! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint ! It is very refreshing ! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though ! Seriously the best soap ! Try this soap if you have not already . That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE ! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time .	1
... if you purchase lots of it at one time . Otherwise , the shipping charges are `` brutal . ''	1
The price of Dr.Bronners has skyrocketed of late . Used to be I could buy a 32 oz . bottle at Trader Joe 's for under $ 10 . My local TJ 's no longer carries the product and the best price I found locally was $ 17.99 for the same 32 oz . bottle . I did a search on Amazon and found a 64 oz . just at about $ 29 with free shipping and NO sales tax . Great deal	1
i have been in love with stuff for 30 years , i use it for cleaning , washing , bathing , and when you are in a jam , shampoo , brushing teeth . there are so many different kinds , pretty uch one for everyone . ph balanced , fair trade . natural , i love it	1
I was introduced to Dr. Bronner 's organic peppermint soap by a very health conscious girlfriend in California , way back in 1979 , and I 've been a loyal fan ever since . The tingly peppermint feeling I get when showering with this stuff is like no other soap product I 've ever used . Just put a couple of squirts on a facecloth for a ton of super-rich lather that serves as both shampoo and body wash . Very refreshing . I ALWAYS keep a couple of big bottles in reserve . I never want want to run out of Dr.Bronner 's excellent product .	1
Love this stuff . Has so many uses and is so concentrated that it lasts a long time if you want it to.It leaves no greasy residues like a lot of modern body washes - it just rinses off totally in any water ( hard or soft ) .But best of all is the amazing tingling sensation this Peppermint variety leaves you with . It 's so refreshing and will wake you up even if you had too much scotch the night before ...	1
Dr. Bronner 's products are very very good . I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower . A little goes a long way . The main thing is that it really does work ! It will really clear up what ails ya ! I use it as a shampoo too ! My scalp has never felt better . Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount . If a soap product such as this suds up heavily ... then it probably is n't good for you at all ... This one will suds up a little ... and it cleans very very well . If you have dry skin , ring worm or fungus type skin issues , this will really help it . Meanwhile , using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay .	1
I had my hopes high for this soap , and I was not disappointed . I did not try the bar version of this , only the liquid and it is pretty impressive . First thing I noticed when opening the box up is that there are A LOT of words on the bottle . It is some serious bathroom-reading material , has stuff on there not even related to the soap . Forget smartphone poops , it 's going to be peppermint poops from now on . Next , when using a loofah it builds an amazing lather . Only a few drops will build enough lather to form a beard worthy of Santa himself . What else is good is that when using it , it tingles the body after a few seconds AND it smells just like candy canes . So while you 're tingly and refreshed , you 'll be smelling candy canes for the duration of the shower . So let me summarize all this up in simple pro and con form.Pros : Builds great latherSmells like candy canesLots of reading material on bottleTinglesCons : Soap itself is just barely more viscous than water , easy to use too much ( if trying to ration ) Price is higher than other body-washCandy cane smell does not last long , and is not powerful once dry	1
This is my first time going Organic and I was nervious . I used to use shampoos and conditioners that had ingredients unkown to me ( SLS ) and ( SLES ) . I needed a shampoo and body wash that did not contain either ingredient . I bousght this product because it does not contain neither ( SLS ) and/or ( SLES ) . This soap works very very very well with my hair . I do not even need an after shampoo conditioner . For me , this soap does both . It cleanses both the hair and scalp ; and it conditions it . After letting my hair air dry , I can lightly brush it out with no problems . I like using the soap as a body wash , because of acne issues . I have seen less breakouts and my skin does not feel stripped . Very good product . However , the product arrived one day late ; and I was not too happy with that . I hope in the future it will arrive on time . Thank you !	1
I bought a small bottle first . Love it so much , I bought the larger bottle . I use this to wash my face . My face feels tingly refreshed and clean when done .	1
This soap leaves you feeling clean and refreshed like no other ! I bought this after using some at a friend 's house in his outdoor shower . I have never felt so clean ! ! !	1
I bought this to wash my hair and body , do n't like it on my hair ( I have Bubble and Bees organic shampoo that I like better ) but I do use this as a body wash and to wash my make-up brushes . It is great and smells great . Super concentrated and a nice big bottle . Love it .	1
I have used this soap for years and love it ! The way it makes your skin tingle all over and you feel so refreshed after using it . I highly recommmend this soap to everyone . Please do yourself a favor and try it , give yourself a long over due relaxing treatment .	1
I 've been using Dr. Bronner 's for many decades . It 's my favorite camping soap , but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere . I use it to freshen water bottles too . It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell . Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores . I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin , but even toned down it 's a great soap . I 'll continue to buy it .	1
We mix this soap with water because it does n't have to be quite so concentrated . It 's nice and easy on the skin . It has a pleasant citrus smell .	1
I have been using Dr. Bonner 's for over 30 years , especially when back packing or traveling in areas where you want only the mildest soaps/detergents . I have used it to bath , shampoo ( myself and the dog ) , wash dishes , etc . It cleans well , rinses out quickly with minimum water , and smells great . You could actually brush your teeth with it . Good Stuff .	1
My gramma had this in her bathroom when I was a kid 30+ years ago , and I still use it . I 've moved a lot in my life , and I always had to start over looking for a place to find this soap ... so thanks , Amazon Prime ! This soap is useful as a shampoo , but I normally use Aveda . It 's useful as a toothpaste/mouthwash , but I normally use Crest . It 's also a great general bath wash or bubble bath , but again I tend to have specialty products . Even better , it 's biodegradable , so it 's my primary for camping trips.A small amount goes a long way , lathers up well , and when rinsed , it does n't leave a sticky film or dry out your skin . The peppermint oil has a pleasant and refreshing tingle & aroma to start the day feeling just a little bit more chipper.The packaging ( printed bottle label ) also has a bunch of interesting writing on it - and even after 30 years , every now & then I find myself reading bits and pieces . It does have a religious bent to the writings , but not in a typical preachy-to-heck-with-glass-houses-I'm-throwing-stones so I find it more entertaining and inspirational and philosophical.Keep in mind that the fluid is very thin - a bunch will flow out if you 're not careful and you only need a little bit.I recommend Dr. Bronner 's !	1
Dr. Bronner 's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we have n't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes , we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes , including to use to wash our hair , faces , and bodies . I 'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo , as it 's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it 's rosy scent , however , it 's really nice to use as a face and body wash. As a shampoo , it tends to dry out my hair a little too much , also . As a face and body wash , I have n't noticed any effects of drying out my skin , and the scent is not strong enough to overpower , but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented . The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap ! Highly recommended .	1
love this stuff and it is hard to find where we live . Great for bodywash and handsoap ... or an addition to laundry	1
I bought my first Dr. Bronner 's product almost twenty years ago - it was the bar-soap form , in lavender , mainly because all the positive-speak phrases on the label made me smile . Turns out the soap did , too - it smells wonderful , AND it works really well - gets oily skin really clean and fresh , but does n't dry your skin at all.I buy the liquid form now for lots of things , from general housecleaning to shower-gel . It really lathers up nicely in our hard water . ( I do n't use it for dish-washing , though , because it does seem to leave a dull film on glass . ) But by far my favorite use for it is in the foaming hand-soap dispenser . Dilute it at one part Dr. Bronner to three parts water , to get a nice , rich lather . I keep it on the kitchen sink and honestly , I probably wash my hands a lot more often than I need to because the scent is so uplifting . ( Referring to the lavender here - I 've tried the other scents , and they 're OK I guess , but I love the lavender most ! ) The store I normally get it from just stopped carrying it recently , so I bought some of that `` Mrs. Meyers Clean Day '' stuff instead , hoping it would be similar . But it 's not the same at all . It smells kind of harsh , and nothing like lavender at all . And it does n't lather without a fight . Sorry , Mrs. Meyer - I 'm here on Amazon now , getting my Dr. Bronner back again !	1
This soap lathers very well with a small amount on a wash cloth or luffa . Nice scent and cool tingling feeling . As one reviewer noted it is a great summer soap for its cooling affect . Very happy with this purchase .	1
I do n't want to get into the details as to what this stuff can be good for , but try it out on any type of skin condition or rash , or for daily use in the shower . It has a light , refreshing tea tree scent , and works wonders as a medicine if used properly . Tea tree oil is amazing ! You can also buy tea tree oil whole and add a bit of it to this soap to strengthen its microbial properties !	1
The soap smells nice , lathers up easily and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed . I am a firefighter and after being exposed to smoke from burning plastics etc the smell stays with you for a day or two . I use this soap and it seems to get rid of that nasty smokey feeling after the first shower . I have it in my locker at work and in my shower at home . I will probably never buy any other soap at this point . I like the tip from others about using a foaming dispenser ... will try that for sure.I dinged it one star due to the preachy label . I peeled the label off as soon as I got it since it only has a few lines about the actual product and ingredients , all the rest is like scripture . If religion is your thing , good for you , but I do n't need it in my face and I do n't need a religious message on the stuff that I am paying for .	1
i love this stuff . a little goes a long way on a loofah . the bar version is good too . I like the peppermint , gives you a tingly sensation and makes me wake up in the morning . My wife thinks its a bit too tingly and complains it almost feels like its burning down there but i like it . had it for about 2 months now and have hardly put a dent in this bottle . highly recommend	1
I became a big fan of body wash when I realized how much more efficiently I can get through a shower . I then decided I wanted to get something that was less perfume filled and would keep from feeling like I just bathed in my deodorant . Dr. Bronner 's was an excellent choice , it does n't dry my skin , it rinses clean and it 's supposed to break down better , meaning it 's better for the environment . I also can get about 6 months out of the 32oz container , a little goes a very , very long way .	1
We use this in our laundry , on our armpits , for dishes , handsoap , etc etc.. sometimes even as a toothpaste ! Thanks for a great , safe product . Watch the documentary if you have n't already .	1
If you 're like me you 're reading these reviews to see whether or not you should buy the product . Buy it . I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money . IT LASTS FOREVER . For $ 10 you get a really nice body wash that , if you do n't like it , you can use on your dishes . There is no risk here . I bought the Tea Tree and I really like it as a body wash , though I ca n't attest to its other uses . I will say though , do n't get the rose ; i have n't personally tried it , but nobody in the world has given it a good review , here or otherwise .	1
I was n't sure what to expect with this , but it is fantastic ! I love it , I strictly use it as a body wash and to clean the shower . If you mix it right , it will last forever .	1
I was an Dr. Bronner 's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time . I 've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far . The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to , almost an acquired taste.Fun fact : tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic . Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This is n't my favorite scent , but what can I say ? I love Dr. Bronner 's . For a grade I give it an A .	1
With essential oils and gentle soaps , this all in one body wash has been my family 's favorite since we started using it 10 years ago . Perfect for baths and showers , this soap lathers nicely and leave my skin feeling and smelling amazing . It 's gentle while effective . Not to mention , the price ! Great company too . The Tea Tree and Lavender are my favorites !	1
Perfect soap for me . It does n't dry out my skin , its hypoallergenic , it is biodegradable so I can use it while backpacking , it has tons of freaky pseudo-cult stuff written all over it for shower time reading , what more could you want ? No weird fragrances means that it is basically just castile soap mixed with peppermint oil . The peppermint oil can be a bit jarring on really cold winter mornings , but it is completely amazing after working out . When you are trying to cool down after a workout , the peppermint oil is so , so nice.Recommend for anyone who likes simple refreshing soap ?	1
My kids tend to be sensitive to ALL shampoos , soaps , laundry detergents . No matter how `` Natural '' of a product I find , someone gets a minor rash . Also , my daughter has thick naturally curly hair , and I do n't want to use harsh chemicals on her hair , but she does n't need tangles ! THIS IS AMAZING . No rash and makes her hair so soft ! Takes the tangles right out ! Plus it 's great that it can be a body wash too . Love the all in one option with kids . I absolutely recommend this to parents for their kids . Four years of searching and two kids- this is the one !	1
I love this soap . I have used it to wash the dog because it does n't have a bunch of chemical junk in it ( and he liked it ) . I use it to wash my hair . I use it as a body wash . I am sure it could be used for other things , but those are my three main uses , and I love it for those.I enjoy the minty feeling all over , however , if you are using it below the waist , you should use it lightly and be prepared to rinse it immedietly in case the minty feeling starts to become too much . I have never had any problems other than feeling like a big peppermint but others may react differently.One thing you should be mindful of is that this stuff could gradually slow rate of water drainage in the drains of the bathroom -- it gradually builds up a little , even inside the bottle itself . It is easily remedied with a home made or commercial drain unclogger .	1
At the beginning of 2013 , I decided I was going to clean up my act and start going natural . After looking up multiple soaps on GoodGuide.com , I found this gem on the site and was intrigued . 18 uses in one , for a cheap price ? Ca n't be true ! Oh , yes it can be . After seeing how highly rated it was on GoodGuide , I checked it out on Amazon and the same thing , great ratings . I looked at the reviews and after spending about 30 minutes reading all the things you can do with it , I decided to buy . I ended up buying the Peppermint soap because it was offered Prime and I love it ! It smells so fresh and wonderful . I have only personally used this product for shampoo , body wash , and as a hand soap but there are so many other uses for it and I 'm excited to use it for everything ! My boyfriend has started using it as a shampoo and we both use it as a body wash . I just diluted it ( 1 part soap to 10 parts water ) and it works like a charm . It smells wonderful when it first comes out but the smell does n't linger after you 're done and out of the shower . It does not `` sud '' like a normal shampoo or body wash would but that 's a good thing ; it means it is natural and does n't have chemicals to make it do so ! I am hooked on this soap and ca n't wait to find out what else I can use it for . Because you dilute this product with water it makes it that much more affordable . And , like I 've already said , you can read reviews to find out what else you can use it for so it is versatile as well . I have a feeling this bottle will last me a very long time and I look forward to purchasing more ; maybe in different scents . Great product and I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone .	1
Dr. Bronner 's Pepperming Soap is my favorite . The quick free shipping was a bonus since I joined Amazon Prime , and makes this soap less expensive to buy on Amazon than any local store . It 's my favorite soap !	1
This stuff is awesome . It makes you feel so clean and gives a nice cooling effect . It 's also nice knowing I 'm not rubbing a bunch of random chemicals all over me . I 'm on my 2nd bottle and I use it as my main shower soap and shampoo . A little goes a long way , which means it lasts a long time . A 16oz lasts me about 2.5 months of everyday use . Highly recommended .	1
*****This hemp rose soap from Dr. Bronner 's is amazing ! It has none of the harmful ingredients found in many commercial soaps , like sodium laryl sulfate , etc . It 's pure and smells absolutely fabulous -- not overly rose-y , more like an earthy-type rose . The scent is very natural and authentic too , not perfume-y . One thing you should be aware of is that it does n't foam up a lot because it has no chemical foaming agents ; this , however , is fine by me . I just use a little bit more , or clean up without the foam.I like that it has natural oils in it as well so that it 's not drying . I use it solely as a bath soap , but apparently all of the Dr. Bronner 's Soaps can be used for everything from body care to household cleaning . I love this soap and find it gentle enough to even use on my face , yet it does clean thoroughly . I love how it makes shaving my legs easy as well , because of the oils.It leaves little to no residue . I have read that it can be used to brush your teeth , do the dishes , and bathe your pets ! I am hooked , and plan to use Dr. Bronner 's exclusively from now on as a mainstay in my home . I 've been looking for a natural and versatile product like this for a very long time.Highly recommended . *****	1
Yes , my title is exactly what you will feel like after using this . The peppermint is great and not too strong . I used this in the morning shower to wake me up .	1
good product	1
I use this soap as a face wash . It is mild leaving my face clean but not dried out . It is also very invigorating , like some other more expensive `` men 's facial scrubs '' . I tried this stuff as an experiment and I 'm glad I did , I will be purchasing more of it in the future .	1
The label is obnoxious and I get annoyed by its hippiness , but Dr. Bronner 's makes a great product . Hurray Capitalism !	1
I purchased the 16 oz bottle of this nifty gifty as part of my research for when I 'm out and about traveling . : ) I was mainly interested in how well it cleans the body , how well it acts as shampoo , soap , tooth paste , and cleaning laundry . For the latter , it does very well cleaning laundry . I had a worn down , not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar , but the stench was still present . When I bought Dr. Bronners , I did the same thing and the smell was gone , replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap , which is a welcome addition . : ) As a toothpaste ? It 's definitely more of a `` function over fashion '' kinda thing . Has a very soapy quality to it , as one would expect . But hey , it cleans the mouth/teeth , and that 's what 's important . Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it 's unbearable . For me , it was fine -- did n't bother me.For shampoo ? Do n't use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly . It does n't last after you 've washed your hair and dried it , but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.Overall , I 'm not very sure if I 'll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling . I think it 'd be necessary for washing my clothes , so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me . ; D And it 'll also be good for emergencies , when I do n't have body wash , shampoo , tooth paste , or if I need it to clean something else.I hope my review has helped ! Just reiterating , it 's a GREAT product . But when a person is able to bring as many 3 oz bottles that can fit comfortably in a zip lock bag , there 's really no point in JUST bringing Dr. Bronner 's , which is what I was interested in . : ) It 's definitely not something to knock points off of this product .	1
I have heard a lot about this soap , and finally I broke down and got a bottle of the peppermint . It is amazing stuff . **Completely organic**Smells amazing , but strong even when diluted . It goes away pretty quickly though . **Fantastic for sensitive skin . I used to be able to use whatever I wanted , but thanks to immune system problems , I had to switch to completely natural/organic body and household products . Especially with how hot this summer has been , the peppermint makes for a totally refreshing shower or quick hand/face cooling wash.**Safe for color treated hair since it does n't have any sulfates which is what fades color . You do need to use conditioner though if you use this for shampoo . **Great for pets too . I checked with a couple of vets and all three agreed this was a very safe wash , especially since it contains no funky chemicals . And yes , whatever scent used fades pretty quickly , though a minty or lavender scented dog is much preferable to one that just rolled in a dead rabbit . Trust me on this one ... .**It is super concentrated . Since it can be diluted one part soap to 40 parts water , a bottle can last months . For heavier , dirtier jobs , I add a bit more soap . Best part ? No filmy residue that makes me have to go back and rinse mop the floor several times . A really welcome change for me from most commercial and some natural products . **Works well in my HE washing machine since it 's low sudsing . **I have n't used it for some of the other uses like tooth brushing , but I imagine it would work well for that , too.Yep , I am pretty pleased with this soap . It 's hard to find a product nowadays that really does live up to it 's promises . It may not work for everyone , but I really recommend getting the smallest bottle just to try it out . One of it 's 18 uses is bound to work for you .	1
I hike with this soap because it 's easily biodegradable and multi-purpose . You barely need more than a drop for much of anything . But , it lathers A LOT so be weary of brushing your teeth with it . It made me choke .	1
I 've been using Dr.B 's mint soap for decades . I used to buy the liter bottle , but it 's so concentrated and you use so little , that it lasts a long time . There 's no preservatives in it ; so as you get to the bottom of the bottle , the soap starts smelling old , or rancid . If you 're a slow user , keep half of it in a hand pump or spray bottle , keep the original bottle in the fridge .	1
Been using this for years . A little goes a long way , and it gets you clean and minty . Makes your eyelids and , um , some other parts , tingle like mad , to the point of being nearly annoying , but it is a transient sensation . Do n't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts , burns like hell . But that is true of many soaps . I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo , it is gentle enough for that , at least for a ( non-metro ) guy .	1
It cleans , it rinses , it smells great , it lasts forever . I prefer rose , lavender , and tea tree , over peppermint but rose is pleasant enough to wash with every day .	1
This is probably the best relaxing soap I have owned in years . I have the Dr. Bronner Peppermint Castile Soap which is great for the morning . It really helps wake you up with its tingly sensation . But there is nothing better then taking a hot shower before bed and using Dr. Bronner Lavender Castile Soap . Its very calming , has a great lavender scent , and leaves your skin feeling soft . I also use it on my face , dishes , and more . Its really an all purpose soap . They are n't joking when they say 18 uses , and more . I 've also tried it in my hair . It is drying . There are some reviews out there where people say its not . They must have very oily skin/hair . Because I 've found it to dry my hair . However , it does get all the oil out . After the gym Ill wash my hair with Bronner 's soap first , then use my regular shampoo after . Then apply conditioner . Seems to be the best way to use it without drying your hair . I would defiantly get the 32 oz over any size . Seems to be the perfect size for multi uses . I 've also price checked , and this was the best price I found anywhere .	1
I bought this product and was surprised at how pleasant it smelled and how easy it was to use . I like the fact that it is organic and it works well .	1
I am very sensitive to soaps and this is wonderful ! Does n't leave a greasy feeling and bubbles into a great lather . My little girls wash with it , too . I also use it to wash my & # 34 ; unmentionables & # 34 ; in the washer on the delicate cycle , as I ca n't tolerate even the fragrance free laundry detergent . It cleans and works perfectly ! Amazon ALWAYS has it priced lower than I can get it in the store . Thanks , Amazon ! Highly recommend !	1
I grew up with Dr. Bronner 's Soap . Dr. Bronner 's does n't advertise , they do n't need to . Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you , this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course . The soap is very refreshing . Unlike other reviewers I do n't recommend it for shampoo though . I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner 's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse , and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing is n't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though , I 've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this . He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner 's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean . The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint .	1
My child has sensitive skin and can not use fragrance products . I usually get Aveeno , but heard about Bonners and wanted to give it a try . It worked great . The soap lathers well and gets off the dirt and grime without stripping your skin of its natural moisture . Most importantly , my child 's skin did not break out . I still use Aveeno products , but this is a nice alternative .	1
I have used this brand of soap sense 1972 . Need I say more . But I will say it has gone up 300 % sense I started using it .	1
Works great i used a cap to a gallon of water and it cleans for me . I purchased the peppermint , smells great not chemically .	1
The late Dr. Bronner 's masterpiece , millions of people use this cult soap for basically everything but beverage purposes . The packaging is as inspirationally baffling as ever , but the product is as good as ever as well . Just awesome , delightful , uncannily good , and available in a nice variety of scents too . Only downside : it can dry your skin out a bit if overused .	1
I 'd like to preface this review with a few important points . As stated in the title , I hate hippies . I do not support Dr. Bronner 's pothead activism . I also do n't buy into all that vegan , organic , or sustainable garbage . And the grammatically incorrect `` inspirational '' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said , this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME . It is intensely refreshing and I ca n't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin . So while I do n't endorse the brand , the man behind it , or their target consumer group , I highly recommend this soap . Shower with it and it 'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp , tingly refreshment .	1
After discovering the possible dangers of traditional soap and shampoo , I was recommended Dr. Bronners by a co-worker . I received it without realizing you can basically use it for anything , not just shampoo and soap . I 've used Dr. Bronners for shower soap and shampoo , for washing my hands , for shaving , and for even cleaning a sink . Rumor has it you can even use it for mouth wash and/or brushing your teeth . I am not 100 % sure if that 's true , but it is a rumor . Try at your own risk.The smell of Dr. Bonners is great and even though it 's expensive for a small amount , it & # 34 ; lathers & # 34 ; really well . You only need a dab of this stuff to clean a wide area of whatever you are cleaning . It does n't leave your hair/skin dry like traditional soap and shampoo can sometimes do . It makes you smell great for a while after using it . Highly recommended to traditional soap and/or shampoo .	1
I purchased the Rose . This works well for me . It cleans well , but does n't strip my dyed hair . After shampooing , my hair is soft and tangle free . It 's clean , but not squeaky and harsh feeling . Only a few drops are needed . There 's none of those chemicals found in most shampoos . I love the Rose . It 's milder ... not as stimulating as Peppermint . I think it smells exactly like a rose fragrance . If anyone has ever tried Joy parfum , this scent is similar . There 's definitely pure rose fragrance in this soap.The Tea Tree is a good anti bacterial/viral soap . It really works well to keep `` boils '' and sores clean . It helps prevent spreading and re-infection . The tea tree assists in healing.My facial skin is too sensitive to use this soap . I find it non-drying , but irritating ; however , it works very well for some as a facial cleanser . It 's great as a shower soap ... does n't dry the skin . It feels invigorated after a shower.I used Dr. Bronners as a child ... many moons ago . This company has been around a while.After trying Wen haircare , without satisfaction , I remembered my Mom used the Almond and Peppermint for our hair and baths . So glad I did . This is great stuff . Because so little is needed , it economical . It 's good to have a multi purpose product , too . I will use to clean my dusty bedroom walls this spring . Also , I like it for washing delicate clothing . This soap does a great job preserving the color in cotton clothes that are n't colorfast . Sometimes , I even put a little in mop water .	1
I 've been using it for about 2 months and it works great , i love it for my hair , I have Thick Curly hair , my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell , I 've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables , I 've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner 's Magic Pure-Castile Soap , i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner 's soap , pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry , over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more ! and Recommending to people i know , and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap !	1
This is a great soap . It has a nice citrus smell to it . Only takes a little bit to make lather and the lather last . leaves you squeaky clean .	1
I use this for shower gel to cleaning the house . It 's great for everything , smells fresh . This bottle is a good price .	1
Dr. Bronner 's needs very little introduction , as his entire life mission is on the side of the bottle . It is good stuff , it works well , I use it every day , all I can say is : yum .	1
Dr Bronners is the best . Been using for 10+ years now and ca n't be beat . Not my favorite scent but I keep it in the rotation .	1
This is the only soap I use ( with occasional excursions into pine tar soap , for specific uses ... See my reviews on pine tar soap ) I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it ! I use it as bodywash , shampoo , and to do dishes with.I 've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Do n't know if it 's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part . Either way , I am a proud Dr. Bronners user !	1
I live in a humid area and mold can be problem . I first realized how good tea tree is with this kind of thing when I bought a leather rug that had a mildew smell . I mixed the soap with some water and applied it to the rug . I threw in outside on balcony and waited a couple days . The rug smelled faintly of tea tree , but the mildew smell went away . Its a one step process unlike baking soda and vinegar .	1
I use Bronners soap all the time for everything ... This is the greatest camping soap ... Do your dishes or wash your body ... Smells great ... Almond is my favorite ... Great to tuck away in your camping bag ...	1
I got the Thera-band Red 55cm Slow Deflate System Pro-Series Anti-Burst Exercise Ball for my wife who uses it as a part of her exercise routine .	1
This ball is great . I 'm actually sitting on it right now ! It 's my desk chair . It is firm and made from good quality materials . When pumping it up , if it 's too small , just keep pumping , do n't be afraid ... it will get to the size it is meant to be .	1
I use this primarily as an office chair and it is subjected to daily use ... so far so good ! I do like using it and it seems pretty rugged .	1
I bought this item to help me with a new exercise plan . My personal trainer recommended I get one and had suggested I just to a local discount store and pick one up . However , a friend of mine had bought a ball that way for her son . She told me about a month later that the ball had leaked and her son did n't want to fix it , so it was tossed out.I have two cats and one of my fears with an item like this is thier front claws and curiosity . So , I decided to get a ball that was puncture resistant.This exercise ball was far superior to the one my friend had bought . This one feels very strong . My cats could n't puncture it I do n't think even if they tried . It does not loose air . ( My friend also had to add more air at least once a week to the cheap ball she bought . ) I hate the color orange and the picture showed that the 55 inch ball was red so I figured I was fine . Nope . It is bright orange . That is my only complaint .	1
I bought these to replace my daughters scooter wheel that broke while she was riding it . They are a little wider than the original but I kind of like it as it would seem more stable	1
I bought these for the kid and they seem to work better than the original . Easy to install and should last longer than the original ones .	1
The last set of these wheels lasted 2 seasons of abuse by my 10 yr old . Decent wheels for the price .	1
It was difficult to find a bike rack made that would fit my Ford Taurus and hold 4 bikes . This one does . While the rack is a tad heavy for me ( not surprising because it needs to hold 4 bikes ) it is functional . I recommend some extra velcro straps to help secure the wheels and keep them from moving in transit .	1
I have not taken this on a long drive , but for getting around town and taking my families bikes out it has worked wonderfully .	1
I love this rack . I used it a ton last summer and it worked great on my Chevy Equinox . It is so easy to load and unload . The price is great too .	1
Looked everywhere locally for it . Found it on Amazon and am happy w/ the purchase . We used it and it worked beautifully . It was easy to install/uninstall .	1
The bike rack is heavy , has a solid feel and is well constructed . Installation is very easy , go to the allenracks website for an instructional video . It took no more than 5 minutes to install the bike rack . I was able to install the rack on a 1999 Saturn over the rear spoiler and on a Mazda MPV mini van with no assistance ( See pictures ) . The rack easily accommodates 4 adult bikes , if one is transporting women 's bike purchase theAllen Tension Bar Bicycle Cross-Bar Adaptor ( $ 20 ) as it makes mounting the bike a lot easier . Even without the tension bar the tie downs on the rack swivel to accommodate bikes of different configurations . There are 3 pairs of ties that secure the rack to the trunk , all of which are very easy to install.I have used this rack on two 100 mile trips with no issues . The bikes were stable , and did not shift during transit . I did use additional ties to secure the wheels . I would highly recommend this rack.Amazon has the best price on this rack . Consider purchasing the tension bar and some extra straps .	1
I have tried a few different camping mattress and this one is by far the most comfortable that I have tried . I would even rather sleep on this instead of a full blown Aerobed . I am 5 ' 8 & # 34 ; / 170 lbs . Not sure how this would work for anyone significantly bigger.This is ideal car camping , ie : not backing . I would n't want to rely on this if I am out in the woods far from civilization for several days . There is only one continuous chamber and if you spring just one leak , you would be totally out of luck . Other backpacking mattresses typically seem to have multiple chambers or some foam inside that could help get you through if there was a single leak . Have to say this one is much more comfortable though.Pros : * Very comfortable . * Not very heavy . * Blue top material feels more comfortable than straight smooth vinyl* Little built in pillow is a nice touch ... although probably will still bring a small pillow to be more comfortable . * Did I say ... . VERY COMFORTABLE.Cons : * No carrying case , but they never advertised it came with one so not taking a star away for that . * Takes a little while to blow up and does n't come with any sort of pump to help . Took me about 4 minutes and getting light headed to blow it up . * Might not be suitable for extended use & # 34 ; out in the wild & # 34 ; .	1
I ordered this mattress because of the price , weight , and size . I was looking for something small and it worked pretty well . By morning the mattress was needing a little more air and got soft . It did n't loose so much air that I was on the ground so I was perfectly OK with it .	1
Have n't used it yet at the campground , but tested it at home and works fine . Use a toothpick to hold the valve open so you can deflate it easily . If you sit on it and your butt just touches the ground , your at the right pressure.For the price , I would recommend it for occasional use . If your a hard core camper you may want a name brand . It suits my needs perfectly .	1
I needed a couple of beds to lay side by side in a 2 man tent , and these worked perfectly . Measurements were spot on . The texture of the bed does catch a little bit of fuzz , but cleans easily .	1
Since this seems to be a big deal for some people , let me fill you in . I have a Masters of Fine Art . I teach color theory . The topic matters to me more than most . With that in mind , camping gear has yet to be something you can color coordinate . And actually , that 's not a big deal . Maybe if you camp in your back yard ? When I 'm out in the woods , I 'm not looking at my site , much less the interior of my tent to see if it 's aesthetically pleasing . Seriously ? There 's nothing sexy about the deuce gear I lugged around in the Marines . However , the fact that I 'm still around tells you that it worked pretty dang well.Focus on what matters .	1
Have n't went camping yet , but have tried it out on the living room floor . The flaw I see in this product is the air valve . You have to squeeze it while inflating or deflating . Makes the two processes more difficult than they need to be . Took 7-10 mins to blow it up , but took just as long or longer to deflate it to pack it away.Air valve aside , it 's a good product . I 'm 6 ' 270lbs and the mattress supported me well . Was reasonably comfortable to lay on . Material seems tough enough to hold up to regular use . Overall , good product for the price.EDIT : Just took the thing camping , worked great . Did n't lose any air over night , was comfortable to sleep on . Worth the money .	1
Well constructed pool raft and takesabuse well ... .been using it all summer here in FLand shows no signs of wear ... ... ..real easy tofall asleep while floating in the pool .	1
After sleeping on the Intex mat on my last hiking trip , I may never be able to use my old ground pad again . This mat is extremely comfortable . It feels like sleeping on my bed at home . It 's long enough to accommodate a person who is at least 6 feet , probably more . It 's only wide enough for one person . No chance in hell that you can squeeze two on this mat.The black color is actually a piece of fabric that has been glued to the mat . It 's only on the top side of the mat and I 'm not exactly what purpose its supposed to serve . Maybe it keeps you from sliding off ? My only complaint about this mat is that it 's a few ounces heavier than my old inflatable trail & stream ground pad . BUT , and this is a big but , my Intex mat is a hundred times more comfortable , so I 'm more than willing to carry the extra weight in my pack . I had no trouble at all carrying this ten miles into the grand canyon . I truthfully could n't even notice the difference in pack weight.I 've already ordered my second mat from Intex and I 'm expecting it in the mail any day .	1
This mattress is sturdy , not cheap at alll . It is heavier than you want to carry for a 3-4+ day hike , however would be goodfor a base camp or fishing/camping excursion w/truck car ... Fast shipping . good seller.I 'd buy again .	1
This is a great air mattress ! Used it for a few days camping and it was perfect if you are traveling light . Construction of this air mattress is very thick and seems like it will last for a long time .	1
Got it on sale a month ago ! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve . So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing . So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast . But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween . For the price it 's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice . Do n't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter . This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad . hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger . No problems with loss of air . A truely amazing deal .	1
I got this because of the price . I saw there were a lot of negative reviews , but I took a chance anyhow . It worked fine for me on a 4-day motorcycle camping trip . I did n't lose any air over the night that I could notice . Sure , it 's basically just a pool float ... but you get what you pay for . It definitely beat sleeping on the ground .	1
I have been so sick of failed air mattresses that deflate or get the mystery holes , and you spend a lot of money on them . I decided to try these . I bought three of them , one for myself and my two kids . This is much more comfortable to me as when I shared a mattress with my kids I would be the one squishing it down , as I weigh much more than them , and waking up with my hips on the ground ; which really killed my back ! These mattresses can be a pain to air up and deflate , but with the use of a pump both of those processes are much easier .	1
inflated easily , and was very durable i will buy more for all my sleeping bags for next camping trip . Still a little big for hiking bag though	1
I got this to sleep on when I go camping or visit my mom - it works well . Easy to blow up and deflate . I recommend .	1
For the price , you really ca n't beat it . Needed an extra mattress for my 8 year old daughter for our camping trip . Used an electric pump to inflate it and my girl was comfortable for the 4 nights she slept on it . Did n't deflate for the entire time we were camping and packed up nice and compact .	1
Hands down the best air mattress I have ever used ! All summer all over the country I have used this thing often relying souly on it to do the job and it performs flawless ! I hope they keep the quality up , good to have a few of these things in the house or camping gear . I am 6'2 & # 34 ; and about 165 and works perfect . My hip bones do n't touch the ground at all and hold nearly all it 's air throughout the camping week . It 's heavy not for backpacking but that 's why I like it . Beach trips , people visiting , car camping , and fitting into small tents . I even accidentally laid this thing out on too of small cactus and barns in the outer banks and it never popped !	1
Nice air mattress for camping or use in the water . The material is thick and seems durable . The only drawback is that the top portion is black , which is perhaps not the best when playing in the sun . But it did not seem to bother the kids when playing with them in the water .	1
Works great with the intex bellows foot pump . Also can be rolled up with my sleeping bag and still fits in the stuff sack , great for camping or an overnight guest .	1
Got them for camping to be more comfortable . Kids slept like babies , and were much happier than with sleeping bags . They did n't lose air , but can be a witch to inflate . A cheap battery pump fixed that problem . Seem durable and had no problems . Not really lightweight so would not recommend for backpacking .	1
I have not had this mattress out yet but did blow it up and take it down to see how long it would take me and how hard it was.It only took a few minutes to blow it up by mouth and a little longer to take it down . You do have to hold the valve open whendeflating this mat but for me that is not a deal breaker . I am going on a kayak trip and I wanted something a little more thanjust a thermal rest because I want to have a little extra padding when sleeping on the ground and this seems like it will work for me .	1
Bought this air mattress for camping out with the kids . Used it a couple times , with several different size people ( child to large adult ) , everyone seemed to find it comfortable . I like the fabric surface , still want to try it with only a blanket underneath and cover . I have difficulty lying in one spot , this is an issue for this mattress , as it 's not wide enough to roll over , etc . Overall , I found the mattress a good value.Pros : PriceSurface material ( not all vinyl ) Length is very good , I 'm 5 ' 10 & # 34 ; , plenty of room leftCan handle a heavy person ( 230 lb ) without hitting groundCons : Width - which is obvious from looking at it online	1
I 've been camping now for about 40 years and so I know what I like . I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to buy ones camping gear at expensive stores like Ripped-off-on-Every-Item , just because it 's cool to have their logo on your stuff . Paying over a hundred bucks for a Thermarest is not necessary either . The extra pack weight of one of these is easily worth it to me for the comfort . This mat is amazingly heavy duty in design and construction and holds its air ( unlike today 's politicians ) . This is a fantastic product for the modest price . What really sold me ? One guy said that he had used it all summer at the beach -- which means high stress conditions -- and he said that it held its air . These do . Oh , the shoulder width is perfect too , ... .they were conscious of the need not to be excessively wide -- they were thinking tent.I have wide shoulders and I 'm perfect on this one . One last thing : your friends can snicker all they want about their super duper $ 120 self inflating mats -- but you 'll be sleeping 3 '' above the ground on what feels like a bed . Sorry suckers.LOL .	1
It 's not a Thermarest , but it 's also a fraction of the cost . For the casual camper , this mattress works . It 's far more comfortable than those thin Coleman pads . As others have mentioned , it 's a bit of a pain to inflate and deflate , but it 's not that bad . I 'm happy with the purchase .	1
This product is dirt cheap but it has lasted many uses these last few months and has good support . I still expect it to spring a leak someday but it has not happened yet . For indoor use this product is perfect and the price is right . It is noisy to inflate and turn on when you move but the price is right . This unit is the perfect solution for expandable sleeping equipment .	1
ordered this for my son when he was over seas in military . He loved it and recommend it for others there or camping	1
I bought this for someone as a gift for camping and it is well appreciated . I may buy more as gifts around the holiday season .	1
These goggles were a gift for a boy who just learned to swim . Now he has a whole new world since he can open his eyes in the water . This was a big hit .	1
My 10 year old son loves these goggles and they fit perfect . The silicone strap is very stretchy and durable . Strap length was easy to adjust . The eye gaskets are soft and seal very well . No water leaks ! The lenses are darker than what they appear in the picture , but my son loves the all black look . I 'd buy these again .	1
My son wears these and seems to really like them . He does n't have much trouble with them filling up with water while swimming and they stay fairly fog-free . They do sit close to the eye and his eyelashes get squished against them .	1
These fit my 8 year old son great and are very comfortable . Great product , very durable and easy fit . Would highly recommend this product .	1
My son was on our local pool swim team . Between meets and just splashing around in the pool , I 'd say they worked great . No leaks ( if put on right ) . He loved them . Hope they last through next year . So far so good !	1
Little 8 year old loves these . Easy to use and love the dark lenses . Next time I will buy the Aqua Sphere Kayenne for her though because they are so much easier to use . They have a sliding buckle that adjusts the head band and she fits into them .	1
This appears to be a fun and useful frisbee type , seems different than other solid plastic ones . It is a spongy-rubbery texture , so we 'll see how it works and flies !	1
This thing really is awesome . Flys great . I used someone 's for the first time a few weeks ago at the river playing a game . It was such a good Frisbee I had to buy one to put in the boat ...	1
I 've bought several different brands of frisbee and this one flys the best . my dogs love that it will hang in the air and is easy to catch . if you want one that your dogs will love to catch then this is the real deal .	1
This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever . The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends , the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch ( Well , you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it , people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves ) .It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well , you can do long , straight throws with it.And as a bonus , the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit ( it still hurts though ! )	1
I love these things . We use them for ultimate Frisbee . Very forgiving when thrown by beginners and they do n't hurt as much as getting hit with a real Frisbee . They are n't indestructible though so try not to bend them or step on them , or they wo n't fly as well . Also some die hard frisbee players do n't like them as much because they fly differently than a normal frisbee .	1
This really is the ultimate frisbee ... it has the power/flight capability similar to an Aerobie , but is dead easy to throw . You can even try and throw it wrong and it levels itself out in flight and goes nice and straight.The rubberized grip/edges make it really comfortable to catch/throw and is about 100x better than solid plastic frisbees and a HECK of a lot easier to play around with than a real Aerobie with folks that do n't want to have to learn a lot of technique.If you like parks , stop reading this review and just buy one and keep it in your car . It is awesome .	1
I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size , flexes nicely during catches and flies very , very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to `` Float '' as much as other disks ; so goes where you want it.My children , 5 and 7 , have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product .	1
I have had this light for about two years now I have had no bad luck with mine at all.I wonder about the other people here.I know some people you just ca n't make happy at all no matter what you try.I have seen this to many times.I think Bell products are good.Far as rain getting in my light that want happen I have a clear bag for days I think it might rain.I keep a few on hand at all times.Never know what the weather will bring our way when out riding.I have three lights on my bike.Having a light on a bicycle is a must have for me.I ride to work on my bicycle and I never know what time I might get off from work.I also have a small engine on my bike too.I do n't our car much any more I have more fun riding to work and going shopping on my bicycle.Yes I do have large Baskets on it too.Now go out and start having fun ride that bicycle again .	1
I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool . If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night ( I guess folks do that ) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light . Essentially , this will do . The Bell light makes light and flashes . I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road . It is fairly cheap construction , but it should n't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work . The light is inexpensive and it works . If you are concerned with batteries and the environment , buy a generator light ... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one .	1
Item arrived quickly . This was a gift purchase- have two other sets . Headlamp has four settings a bright and a dimmer incandescent setting , as well as two settings for the two leds , one constantly on and one blinking . The bright incandescent setting provides good lighting for night rides , but is not to be mistaken for one of the expensive headlamps which light up the roadway . Batts are 4 AA and they last approx an hour on the brightest setting with rechargables and then defaults to the LED continuously on setting . This setting stays on for over 24 hours . Provides enough light to see your way home , as well as being seen.Tail lamp uses AAA batts and has multiple settings for constant on as well as different blink modes . Only flaw is that the tail lamp assembly can work loose in the housing , particularly if you have a seat pack . That said a piece of tape keeps it from coming out . Battery life is great , still on the original set after many night rides . Light is bright and shows up well.Ca n't beat this set for the price . Alkaline batts seem to last longer , I carry a spare set .	1
This is the standard for most cycles I 've seen . Every feature is well designed and it works as I hoped for . My only concern was when the tensioning required to keep the front lamp handlebar mount broke the clamp , I discovered the clamp is not sold separately I had to buy the entire set in order to replace it .	1
I rarely ride at night but there have been a couple of bicycle/vehicle accidents in my town recently and I figured a little visibility is worth 15 bucks if it prevents me from an accident . The directions are not very detailed and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to install the batteries ( 4-AA for the head lamp and 2-AAA for the tail light ) . They both work great , both have multiple functions to suit the type of riding you are doing . It took some finagling to get the head lamp mounted because of the front reflector and mySchwinn 17-Function Bike Computer . I was a little disappointed in the back light for two reasons : ( 1 ) myTopeak Explorer Bike Rackhas a mounting plate for a light , but this one comes with a seat-post mount and ( 2 ) the tab you push down to release the light from the bracket broke the first time I tried to separate the pieces . So now I have no mount and a tail light I ca n't attach to my bike ( yet ) . A great concept set though and I would still buy it again !	1
For the price , this light is hard to beat . Over the years , I have used approximately twenty different bicycle lights by brands such as Cateye , Cygolite and Planet Bike . While some of these were significantly better than the Bell , they were also three to ten times as expensive . If you do n't mind the large mass of four AA batteries on your handlebars and have under twenty dollars to spend , the Bell Night Trail bicycle light is the way to go.The real downside to having the batteries in the enclosure is the hazard created when the housing becomes dislodged during an impact . While this has not happened with the Bell light , it did occur with a Planet Bike light while riding through traffic in NYC . The distraction was extremely dangerous . Losing half of the batteries was not fun either.Fortunately , the Bell light has a sturdy enclosure where the top half slides backwards to open . This makes it almost impervious to front and vertical impacts . However , the internal latches never quite give you a clear indication that it is closed . Rather , you must squeeze the top downward and push forward simultaneously until you ca n't move it further.Much like the headlight , the taillight compares well to more expensive lights . Similar to competing products , it has various blinking modes as a well as an always-on setting . Due to the design of the lens , light escapes from the sides and top of the light . Such side lighting is crucial for riding in urban areas.The build quality is good but not on par with the $ 100+ lighting systems . But again , the selling point of this light is overall value . Some of the nicer features include a bright Xenon bulb paired with miserly LED lights that can blink for hours . Unlike some of the MR11-based bulbs ( parabolic track lighting bulbs ) , the lens assembly has two ports on the right and left sides . This spreads light perpendicularly to the path of travel , which is a nice feature when in traffic . These features combined with a very modest price make this light an excellent choice for the budget conscious.ProsValueBrightnessCombination of LED and Xenon modesDecent build qualitySide lighting on headlightConsQuestionable design of battery compartment ( top half of headlight ) BulkyLEDs could be brighter	1
this mattress is great . I got it for my boyfriend , who sleeps over every weekend . It is really comfortable and it holds the air . The material on the top of the mattress keeps the sheet from sliding . It is easy to blow up and to let the air out of and pack away . I recommend ! ! ( P.S . You do have to buy a pump seperately for this mattress )	1
bought this for company and also when i feel like a change of scene ... .like sleeping on the living room floor ! ! ! blows up quickly with a hair dryer and easy to store on my closet shelf . recommend ! ! ! !	1
This was pretty easy to use and filled my full size air matress pretty quick.It takes four D cell batteries not very quiet , tho I have n't heard one that is & # 9786 ; Would recommend & # 9786 ;	1
I really like this because it 's battery powered , perfect for the campsite to blow up mattresses for everyone . Carry extra batteries though . I have not used it yet , but it replaces an identical one that we lost along the way somehow , and that one was perfect , so I expect no less from this one .	1
The pump works fine . Filled the bed in about a minute . But if I need another ( or a replacement ) I 'd get one that works on household AC power . This needs 4 D cells . Since I expect to use it only occasionally , the batteries might be dead by then.Of course , running on batteries is better during a power outage ... but , come to think of it , I do n't need any power to sleep in my bed . ( Just to get up , some mornings . ) Since I 've only used it once , I ca n't attest to relaibility .	1
Yes D batteries can be expensive , but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time . Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus . My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress . Inflated both in under 2 minutes . Deflation even faster . Remember , sometimes you get a dud , try again . I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price . I have tried those aero type beds , and not for me . Uncomfortable , heavy , must have a plug near by to inflate . I 'm spur of the moment , so this travel pump is just perfect ! p.s . it 's advertised as a 4D pump , so you know before you buy it takes D batteries , so if you do n't want the weight by a bike pump ! !	1
I bought this to go with a group of items to be used in a camping basket . I did n't personally use the item .	1
It 's a very powerful Pump and it can be used to inflate everything . I have a air bed and this pump inflate it in about 2 minutes . The only cons is that it is very heavy to carry everywhere .	1
I used it this past weekend on a camping trip . It inflated/deflated 2 queen & 2 full sized air mattresses and did not lose power . It has a nice long lasting rechargeable battery .	1
Great pump works great at lake house ! ~ We have all types of lake ridding toys and this really worked well . For tubbing rafts etc . Coleman has always been dependable ! ~	1
I would give this 5 stars if there was some sort of space on the charger where you can store the extra heads . I 'm pleased this product is not excessively loud , I live in an apartment and do n't feel self-conscious about blowing up my guest beds . Also , it works super fast , my twin coleman quickbed mattresses blow up in less than a minute . I recommend purchasing this product .	1
Very very powerful . It blows all kinds of air products in just a minute . I cut one star because it is just too much noisy . Maybe in that powerful mode it ca n't be lower noise . Anyway it is embarrassing if your air mattress leaks during midnight . It will wake up a few friends , let alone your family on the mattress.The battery lasts very long . It brings another side effect of heavier overall weight to other products.But I still recommend this to you . Never buy those 4 x D battery pumps .	1
We 've gone through quite a few cigar-lighter plug in pumps over the years , and the choice was always `` do I pull the truck right up to the tent door and risk dusting the tent floor from the fan , or inflate the mattresses at the truck and cram them through the door , possibly hitting a sharp stick or rock on the way ? `` Then , sometimes you get that mattress with a leak so small you ca n't find it , but after a few hours on cold ground with 210 ( or 320 if you 're lucky and Mrs comes along ) pounds forcing it out , you get a less than firm sleeping situation , and neither option seems very appealing at zero dark thirty in the cold . This one is right there next to you , so you can adjust the bed any time.No need to agonize over such decisions now.Amazingly , it held it 's only charge all summer , and pumped up a queen and twin mattress on at least 5 trips . We live in cold country , so warmer weather will tell if it 's astounding in that regard or just awesome , but so far , although I was hesitant about buying a rechargeable , so good.Plenty of tips , almost as useful for DEflating as inflating , and it fills them MUCH faster than our old plug-in unit . It 's quite a bit bigger than the plug-in it replaces , but being able to take it into the tent more than makes up for that . Chinese Coleman is n't always as good as US Coleman used to be , but this little guy is everything I would expect and more.The last thing to consider is that a 12 to 120v converter AND this pump cost less than a good quality 12v pump alone , and move much more air to boot ( and the cordless part is n't even figured in ) . If the battery continues to take and hold it 's charge , I think we have a winner .	1
I have a Coleman mattress and for years I was trying to get by using the cheapo pumps . They worked , but I had to hold them on my mattress just right , otherwise they would just blow everywhere . This one , on the other hand , fits right into the mattress and inflates in the blink of an eye , hands-free . I would have given it 5 stars if it had a tie or something with which to attach the nozzles to the pump , to avoid losing them . I wound up using one of the twist ties that came in the box , but come on ; there has to be a better solution .	1
This thing certainly & # 34 ; floats my boat. & # 34 ; It airs up my Seyvlor inflatble boat in just a couple of minutes . It 's lightweight and easy to carry too .	1
This is the perfect tool for blowing up an air mattress or anything that needs to fill up with air and you do n't want to blow your lungs out .	1
Bought this to inflate a mattress for camping trips and for when company comes over . So far we have used it on 4 occasions and it worked beautifully . Followed the directions , as far as the first charging , and charge it again after every use and have yet to have any issues . It is even handy for deflating items . I would buy it again .	1
I have n't had it long , but I just came back from a 5-day trip where I used this unit multiple times . It pumped my twin air matress up in under 60 seconds . One of the guys on our trip was impressed with it so much that plans to buy one from Amazon as well.The charge was more than sufficient for my 5-day trip . I ca n't currently speak to how well it retains a charge over time . It was well worth the money spent .	1
Exactly what the doctor ordered . Very nice with the wall charger and car charger . Fills up quick and deflates just as fast .	1
this pump had no problem charging so I could use it on my airbed when I have guest over at my house	1
We are campers and of course needed the comforts of home in having inflatable mattresses . We bought this pump to replace the first one we bought ten years ago because the battery would not charge any more . After each use , I always fully charge the pump before storing it . We often leave it stored for about 6 months before using it again . It is sturdy and the reverse airflow is handy for deflating mattresses as flat as possible .	1
It 's a good but the adapter is only for 120Voltage.I did n't know that . To use this product I need transformer to change the voltage ( 120V & # 8594 ; 220V ) .It 's small , powerful and useful to inflate and exflate the bed .	1
I 've been sharpening knives since I was a kid , but got really tired of hand sharpening kitchen knives everytime a family member cut through something on a ceramic plate ( seemed like daily ) . I was really skeptical of any motorized sharpener , especially as costly as these are , but most of the reviews were good so I purchased one . I am so pleased . Do n't try to use one of these without reading the directions ... they have specific steps to follow that are not always obvious , even to those of us used to hand sharpening . And , like others have said , the first sharpening takes a while in order to correct the angle of the blade . Once you 're there , you feel a huge burr/curl form on the edge , then you hone , and the knife will get extremely sharp . I have a large bald spot on my arm now where I tested the knives.I really like the blade guides . They 're not perfect in holding the blade , but are good enough to give you the idea of how to hold & draw the knife . Some have commented on scratch marks that are left on the sides of the blades . I got them my first try , then realized if I was more careful in holding the blade true to the angle guide , it did n't happen . As a word of warning , if you order one with a metal exterior it adds about $ 20.00 to the price . White plastic saves you money and does n't have anything to do with functionality .	1
... and that is purely because I am a traditionalist when it comes to sharpening knives . I spend a lot of time outdoors and sharpening a knife the old fashioned way is an essential skill for every man ... and sadly maybe for the woman whose man wo n't develop the skill . Even during a stint in the deli and meat business for 9 years , I stuck with the old methods . As often as I had to sharpen knives , only occasionally and with a lot of work was I able to get our knives really razor sharp . Other times , they were only just pretty sharp ! Many people do n't realize that the most dangerous utensil you have in the kitchen is a dull knife . A dull knife requires more force to do the same work . Dull knives are more susceptible to slipping and combined with the force that moved them , can still produce chilling and even life threatening accidental cuts . A sharp knife requires much less force , can cut more precisely and is easier to control.I bought this device for my son and daughter in law for Christmas 2008 . They owned excellent quality knives , but they were sharp only for the first few months after they bought them . After that , I discovered they may as well have used a butter knife because that 's the condition these knives reached pretty quick . The knives also suffered from the very bad habit of being stored loosely in a drawer . Consequently they had nicks in addition to just being dull . I was afraid that my daughter in law would end up with a nasty cut . The situation got so bad that instead of sharpening the dang things , my daughter in law would just buy a new knife each year ! I used this device for the first time just last week only because I remained as stubborn about my son learning how to use it as I did about my own traditionalist methods . He and a buddy tried using it ... without looking at the instructions ... and did n't get anywhere with it . I learned very quickly that had I been smart , I would have bought one of these machines for ourselves when we started our deli business in 1994 ! ! It is important to read and follow the instructions to get the best service from this machine . Starting with the dullest 10 '' knife and using only the weight of the knife , I drew the knife blade in 10 alternating passes . This very quickly produced the burr sought in the instructions for stage 1 along the entire length of the blade . ( Normally , a knife in better condition would need only a total of 2-4 alternating passes to produce the same result . ) After reaching the burr stage , only 4 alternating passes ( 2 on each side ) in stage 2 produced an edge on this knife that I could use to shave the hair off the back of my left index finger ! I gave that knife one more stage 2 pass for each side and went on to the next knife . This time fewer passes ... same results ! My daughter in law gave it a shot with another dull knife that would only smush a tomato and produced an edge in only seconds that would cut tomatoes paper thin ! She also got razor sharp results on a short bladed paring knife ! Once a knife is this sharp , the machine wo n't be needed for quite a while . Generally , only a pass or two with a high quality ridged sharpening steel such as those offered by Forschner or Mundial will be enough to maintain the edge for months of household kitchen use . This is because the edge of a razor sharp knife becomes so thin that it will `` fold over '' in the shape of a J during use . The steel straightens the edge and restores it 's razor sharpness with just a few VERY LIGHT strokes . The vision you might have of the butcher flailing his knife 10-20 times with the steel to restore the edge is really overkill and mostly for show . The two light strokes should do it ... and as quietly and lightly as possible . I have even used the bottom of a ceramic coffee cup or the back edge of another high quality knife in place of a sharpening steel , although the coffee cup will remove some material from the blade of the knife.In just minutes with this machine , we had 8 razor sharp knives and accomplished what could have literally taken HOURS to achieve with traditional methods . If you are not getting the same results with your machine , my humble guess would be that you are not using it properly . the steel in your knife is very hard or they are in really bad shape . Only as a last resort would I fault this machine . We were even somewhat saddened when we were done ! Remember to store your knives in a way that keeps them banging against each other . We prefer wood blocks designed for storing knives . They can get pricey if you buy them retail . We managed to pick ours up at Goodwill for $ 2 ... .a real bargain . They have them every time I go in there. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- UPDATE 11/29/2010This sharpener worked so well on my daughter-in-law 's knives that I took one of mine that I have been maintaining the traditional way on this trip to sharpen it on her sharpener . The knives I did for the above review needed only touch up sharpening and was done with them in a few seconds . My 10 '' kitchen knife , on the other hand , needed a lot of work . I was getting nowhere on the 1st stage and thought I might be using it wrong . In reality , the angle I had sharpened mine to manually was incorrect and the machine was putting the correct edge on them . I lost count of the # of 1st stage passes made to get the burr , but when I did , a few passes in the 2nd stage had the knife razor sharp . If you are not getting anywhere with this sharpener , you need to make sure you are following the directions and be persistent to get that `` burr '' . Then you will be only seconds away from the sharpest edge you 've ever had ...	1
I brought a pair of aqua sphere goggles and they work great , they did not fog up like the rest of the goggles do and the seal works great and stay seal so it does not leak . I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face . I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles . they are also easy to ajust . I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great .	1
Theses are really nice and my girls love them . They fit really good and are great for the pool of lake ...	1
1st . they come with a hard case so they do n't get a scratched up through rough handling by your little guy or girl.2nd . they fit really good around the eyes and they are almost gummy feeling.3rd . they have easy to adjust straps with little clips on the sides of the goggles making it easy to fit your child 's growing head.I like em ! they are the best quality kids size goggles I 've found . great any size adult or otherwise . well made !	1
My kids love these googles	1
Fantastic goggles . Provide full view and fit great . They do tangle in long hair , but not as bad as some others . Expect them to last several years .	1
will be getting more of them . fits my 5 year old little girl perfect and loves them . i would highly recommend for kids .	1
My kids is afraid swimming due to sensitive eyes . We tried many different kid 's googles , which are either belt too tight or eye 's shape too small . Aqua sphere seal kid swim goggle is the final goggle for my 3.5 years old kid use to join his swimming classes because of easy belt adjustment from simple chips on both sides and big eye 's shape .	1
I bought two ( 2 ) pair of this goggles ( clear lens , cherry ) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters , from Amazon , at $ 16,56 each one.Do n't doubt it : & iexcl ; SPECTACULAR ! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens does n't scare small kids , they do n't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT : Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it does n't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust , nice mechanism.Easy to put on : My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting : After heavy use ( 3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool ) in hot weather ( sun , etc ) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun . End of the goggles . But they lasted 18 months ( less than $ 1 per month = bargain for me ) .ok , enjoy . bye .	1
Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son . It 's a wide , comfortable , mask-like experience ( without a nose cover ) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose . I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles , but they 're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I 'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself . The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy . Oh , and the kids have n't managed to get the straps out of whack yet , which is a small miracle .	1
These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces . The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off . The material is tacky without being sticky , which is great for holding on to little kids in motion . The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color . They are n't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea , but as far as kids goggles go , this is a good investment to make .	1
I have a three year old who has not cared much to be in the Swimming Pool . These Goggles are fantastic . The individual eye goggles are very uncomfortable for him . These are one piece and the inside rubber is extremely soft and forms a very tight seal . He loves these and goes underwater all the time now.They are a little expensive , but tremendously worth it . One of the best products I have ever purchased .	1
Great little knife with useful attachments as are all swiss army knives . I had n't seen it in person and was surprised how thick it is . I think its great , but it has n't made it to my keychain for that very reason .	1
High quality key chain utility combo . There are many copy cats out there but , none beats a Swiss .	1
First , this has everything but a manicurist , BUT THIS DOES NOT HAVE A TOOTHPICK ! It says that that 's one of the tools , but it ai n't . And toothpicks can be used for things other than picking teeth . ***I have five Swiss Army Knives , from the next to smallest to one that is about 4 '' long and has 12 blades . All have a scissors and , of course , one primary knife blade , but there are two that I carry with me most often . This is the second handiest because it is still small and unobtrusive , and has the basic tools that I use most often : small blade , emergency blade , cut and picker blade , scissors , nail file with cleaner , ruler with screwdriver , cuticle pusher , tweezers , and retractable pen , To be honest , I got this because of the retractable pen which I wanted for `` emergencies '' such as writing down a phone number while on a walk or trek . However , although years ago I never would have thought of using the toothpick , I really miss it and it was replaced by the pen . Hey , I 'm older . Food gets stuck , and the toothpick is there . Ca n't get it out with the pen . I wish they had left out the cuticle pusher . Pushing cuticles can wait till I get home . In fact , I do n't remember ever pushing a cuticle ... I suppose I should have complained about the loss of the toothpick - especially after Amazon lists it in the `` tools '' - but I have used the pen once . Wrote the number on my palm for the owner of a lost cat that I happened to find . ( Funny thing was that I had my Sony MP3 player with me , but forgot that it also records so the pen is actually superfluous . ) The cat and owner were appreciative , and I turned down the reward although I could have bout the smaller knife.I carry the smaller knife ( do n't know which one , but it has two blades - no pen - and is about 2/3rds the size of this one , lies flatter in my pocket , and has the one blade I use daily : it 's either what they 're calling the cut and picker blade or the emergency blade , and I use it as a letter opener . The `` larger '' `` normal '' blade I use for opening cartons and heavier envelopes . This knife , which I bought 15 years ago at the Mall of America ( well , I had to come home with SOME souvenir ) is perfect . Sorry , folks , I ca n't find the name of it.I 'll apologize for this review , but if you can find this knife in a store , then look for one without the pen , with a toothpick , about an eighth of an inch thinner , and you have my 5 star favorite . And while you 're at it , but a pocket knife sharpener . ( It looks like a pen , but it 's a baby sharpener life you 'd use at Thanksgiving . ) It 's similar to the `` Executive . '' Maybe it 's a small Executive , but what kind of executive is peeling oranges in his or her office ( the executive 's `` extra '' blade that somebody in Switzerland must have thought was essential for army execs ) .All I can tell you is that they packed a whole lot of tools into this knife - some that I 'll never use but you never know . After all , I use the scissors once or twice a week , and the tweezers have gotten thistle and splinters and lord-knows-what-else out of my fingers over the years .	1
Many of the cool features of the various mini Swiss Army Knives packed into a mini Swiss Champ . Lots of cool features in a mini-me size . While I have a true Swiss Champ , the thing would look stupid in a pair of dress pants at work . This thing is smaller than most car alarm key rings and very handy . Well worth the purchase .	1
This page is for the Swiss Army MiniChamp . When you buy , they put a Swiss Army MiniChamp II in your cart . I can not yet figure out what the difference is , but the close up images of the other Swiss Army `` II '' versions , Amazon exclusive models , indicate that the red handle material is matte finish rather than shiny red , probably a different material . Victorinox has an EcoLine series in the rest of the world that has different handles , made of Nylon so possibly that is what is happening here.Added : Digging a little more , it seems as though Victorinox calls this a MiniChamp II officially , with the usual shiny red scales we are used to . The original Model I had a toothpick instead of the pen and did not have the cap lifter Phillips tool.It would have been better if Amazon had chosen `` 2 '' or some other designation for their exclusive series . They look like great knives , but they are quite different if someone is expecting the red scales that have been on the Swiss Army for years .	1
Bought this for my 6 year old daughter . She rides it all over the place . Payed more than you could get it in the store , but it 's Pink ( as compared to red or blue the box stores sell ) , so it was well worth it . My daughter loves it ! Pros : Great constructionGreat rideHard wheels ... no tubes to pumpFolds quickly and easilyAdjustable height handleCons : I ca n't ride it	1
We have three of these , one for each kid . They have been well used by all three children and have held up well to the use . They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk . We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad ( always a plus ) .The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open ( or closed ) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily . A quick clean will fix this , but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties . If you are a heavier adult or tall , you might want to look for a sturdier scooter meant to hold adults.Well worth the money.Enjoy .	1
They love these scooters . Even with the single digit cold spell going on they want to go outside and ride them . The foot board is wide and forgiving enough for the cautions rider . The scooter collapses and stows away easily and does n't take up much room in the garage .	1
The scooter is just as advertized . Even though we missed out on Black Friday deals this was close . The Razor scooters are very well made and durable to last through at least a couple of kids .	1
This scooter folds up easily into a fairly compact form factor . It rides smooth and has taken a beating without any issues . The step brake works ok but is hard for younger children to master the use of . As such , I wish this had a bicycle-style handle bar brake .	1
My son loves this scooter and it works great , it is pretty much as you would expect from the website . I like the braking system , press down on the back mudflap , and it brakes on the back wheel .	1
Love the fact this scooter can fold for storage or when taking with us in the trunk of the car . Though I think the clip you flip to fold this could be easier . ( My ten year old does n't have the finger strength to push the clip down to fold it ) . That 's a little disappointing , but Razor 's use of quality metal , foam and plastic more than makes up for this little annoyance.If you 're in the market for a child 's scooter - Razor is the best .	1
Bought this scooter for my younger nephew in green and he really loves it so far . It 's too small for adults like myself , but for kids 4-12 it really does the trick . It rides a little rough on the street , but it 's great on freshly paved surfaces and side walks . Do note that the wheels are on the smaller side , so they feel every single bump and road imperfection . Small loose rocks can stop the scooter if driven over at the wrong angle . Definitely make sure you purchase a helmet and pads along with this scooter if you have inexperienced little ones.One issue I did not like about Amazon is the constant price changing they do . When I first added this scooter to my cart , it was priced at $ 25 , then about a hour later , when I was nearing completion of my shopping , the price went up to $ 30 . Be weary , and pay attention to the price listings .	1
It was a gift sent out of state , so I did n't & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; it . But my niece said it was perfect for her .	1
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter . She loves it . Good quality , no complaints . I would purchase another .	1
I bought this for my son who at the time was 6 . He is now 7 and he still enjoys riding this . He is on the taller size and is about 105 pounds and it still performs at high level . He fits fine on the deck and brake works fine . Hope this helps ! ! !	1
We got this for my 5 year old daughter ( pink ) and she loves it . The color is great and the scooter fits her perfectly .	1
I had an original Razor ( got it in 2000 ) and wish I still had it , haha . Got this one for my daughter and she loves it . The pink highlights are nice for a girl , design does n't seemed to have changed much over the years . It works great for her and supports me as I have tried to teach her how to stand , move , etc .	1
We love these scooters ! ! My kids are almost 4 and 5 , and we all have one ! ! This one was for my husband -- my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us ! ! It did n't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them ! We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week ( 3 and 4 at the time . ) By the end of the week , they had it down pretty well ! We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around ! They are compact , and a lot of fun ! Just wonderful ! I am also not a tiny person -- I am 160 pounds , and my husband is 190 , so they do a good job standing up to our weight !	1
Bought it for my Great Nieces when they visit , so they have something to do that they like . It sags slightly when I step on it as I am at the weight limit . Well made and looks good -- thinkin ' 'bout getting an adult version for myself but have to pay off what else I bought first !	1
My son loves this scooter , he jumps very easy with it , he just turned 8 and carries this scooter everywhere with no problem , so it 's not heavy for him . The scooter is worth the price . I recommend it .	1
The seven-year-old is on this all the time . We `` customized '' it with some colorful neon animal print duct tape for easy identification , since the local Brooklyn park we frequent has DOZENS of these things lying around.The steering column and front wheel have slid out of alignment a couple times , but were easily fixed . Just keep an eye out for it .	1
I have a scooter that i got for my b day when i was 5 and it looks completely brand new . The only thing that i wouldnt do is if you get one dont go really fast then stomp on the brake because then the tires get worn out but they still work and you can buy replacement tires . overall ... ... AWESOME	1
My kids love their razors . Ride them everywhere and already went through one set . Lasted several years of hard riding and play . Great ! ! ! !	1
The price is great . My kids have so much fun scooting around . It 's great for getting out and getting some exercise .	1
I had one of these in college . My son wanted one for Christmas , so we got him this one . I can ride it ( 250lbs ) and she works great . Very adjustable , so it will grow with him for a long time .	1
Since the Razor originally came out , there have been many other types of scooters competing for our attention : 3-wheel , 4-wheel , and larger wheel scooters -can- fairly be called improvements , but the Razor is still all that most of us need , for short trips a bit faster than walking . Sure , you ca n't fit two feet side by side on it , it does n't have suspension of any kind , and the small wheels get hung up on sidewalk seams , but it gets you where you 're going three times as fast , ( it really -does- roll smoothly ) , it 's -very- compact , and -very- inexpensive . Unless you plan on spending -many- hours a week on your scooter , ( in which case a couple hundred dollars may be a fair expense for the big-wheel advantages ) , I recommend a Razor .	1
My son love his razor scooter . He is 5 years old and he is now a speed pro on this thing ! !	1
I was stunned when my son told me he wanted the original scooter and not one of the upgraded , more expensive ones . ( Hallelujah ) Apparently , this the one all the other kids he knows has . The reason is , and this is IMPORTANT- the newer ones have some kind of bar/guard on the back , that in theory , is a good idea , but according to my son , gets in the way , and inhibits breaking ( stopping ) . Cheaper AND safer- it has my vote ! !	1
My daughter loves this . It is very strong and she will be riding it for a long time . It 's nice to see a solid metal product once in awhile !	1
Ca n't believe I am writing a review for a girls scooter ... .but I am . My 10 year old still uses this scooter ... and it 's been 3 years . It takes a beating and is cute while receiving the beating .	1
I got this scooter for my son 's 4th birthday as he was growing tired of his 3-wheeled one . He was very excited to finally ride his `` big boy '' scooter and took off immediately , doing all kinds of tricks on it . I was pleasantly surprised he did n't need any training with it . The scooter itself is of great quality , seems to be very comfortable , folds in just one click , and is a great value for the price !	1
Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best . We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid ! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol !	1
My 5 , but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a `` princess '' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink . The `` sweet pea '' scooter is PINK . But it is a nice , soft pink . All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender . It 's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters . I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever . And it came totally assembled in the box . I did n't have to touch a tool . All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place . Even the pink pom poms were attached . These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far : Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model ( for me ! ) .So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard , this scooter will be perfect for her .	1
Well , not really . The thing that I had weighed more than I did , did n't have brakes and could not fold up on itself . But that was over sixty years ago and times have changed . I did n't get this for myself , but the young man who did get it loved it . He 's mobile around the block , he 's getting exercise and he 's state of the art on a hi-tech well engineered piece of steel . What 's not to liove ?	1
This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old grandniece last year . She loved it , especially the fancy tassels , but I could see that the wheels were not as large as the other kids ' scooters which is somewhat of a disadvantage .	1
I bought identical scooters , one pink and one blue . Both assembled quickly and were ready to use in seconds , providing smooth rides with a good solid feel . My kids and I give it a thumbs up .	1
For kids who are n't old enough to handle a skateboard , but still want to be out rolling along with the neighborhood kids , this is your answer . The ` Razor A Kick Scooter ' is perfect for those 5 and older . Made of aircraft-grade aluminum , with 4 '' heavy-duty urethane wheels , adjustable comfortable handlebars , and a patented rear fender brake , this little scooter will make any youngster mobile and happy . It comes in several colors and folds up into a six-pound storable package . Scooters are almost an American tradition and kids love the feel of freedom when playing around the neighborhood or playground .	1
highly recommend this scooter for your child ! It says 5+ , but I bought it for my almost 3 year-old daughter and while she is n't a pro at riding it , she LOVES being like the older kids and riding it . Especially if they are little , do n't forget the helmets and pads because there WILL be some falls , but it 's all part of growing up ! With that said , the weight limit says 143 lbs so definitely not a scooter for an adult to ride around on . I 've put all my weight on it ( 170lbs ) and can move around on it , but would hurt the long-term durability , for sure . For $ 30 , you ca n't beat the benefits of getting your kid outside and moving around ! For adults , you can get one , too , to add to the fun for your young child . ( get a bigger one like the Pro model $ 50 ) .Scooter folds up for easy storage and can get slammed all around without damaging it..In short , it 's kid proof !	1
Great product . The handle is fully adjustable so we can use this scooter for years to come . It 's very easy to fold up and carry . The break feature in the back is great . All around , a very good option for a scooter , especially for the price .	1
Bought this for my 3.5 year old for Christmas , and she loves it . Comes preassembled , breaks down to a compact size for transport , is lightweight , is easy to adjust the handlebar height when the time comes . Brake feature is n't being used yet , but once my daughter gets the hang of riding it , I 'm sure she 'll utilize . Overall a quality , well designed scooter . McFly would have loved this thing !	1
I got this for my 4 year old who is a bit clumsy.the base is shorter and narrower than the A3 and that helps my little one keep control of it better.I would definitely recommend this scooter for any young and the not so coordinated kids that are just starting to ride scooters for the first time .	1
After my neighbor went and got one , my 4 yo begged for one . I figured it would be good exercise , so I got her one . It did n't take her long to figure it out . My son , who is nervous about balancing on two wheels , saw my daughter having so much fun , he tried it out and they both fought over it . So , I had to go out and buy one the same day . Okay , I did n't have to , but it 's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid . I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds . The wheels glide smoothly . I am impressed with the quality .	1
This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter ( age 6 1/2 ) . This scooter is built like a tank ! The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever . The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade . This scooter can easily be handed down ( might need wheel replacements from normal use ) .It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category . I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare . I will warn you though , this scooter is not as light ( in weight ) as you would think . I was a little surprised . However , the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight .	1
This was easy to set up and fun for the grandkid . I like the quality of the materials . It seems well made and should stand up to rugged use ... ... cause that 's what it is going to get .	1
The scooter looks to be in Good Condition , how ever , the box was demolished , or I would have given it a five star rating .	1
Great product . Was as described and is a good price . My kids use it a lot and it 's held up very well . I recommend .	1
It is a cool scooter as my boy said . He uses it to & from school . Grandma can not keep up with him anymore .	1
I got this for my 6 year old son and it is just perfect for him . Its light weight but durable and easy to travel with .	1
The Razor scooter has remained unchanged over the years . Why mess with a classic design . Its well constructed and a great toy . Must buy for a growing child .	1
Bought this as a present for my 7-yr old niece and she loved it ! Good quality ( has lasted over a year ) and rides very smoothly . She , of course , likes the pink color as well ! For a simple scooter , Razor does a nice job with quality finishes and construction .	1
My daughter has had this for two years now . It stays outside ( although under an awning ) here in south Florida and has no rust ! Still looks and rides like it 's new . Great product .	1
bought this for a chrismtas charity- the girl specifically asked for a pink razr scooter . under $ 40 and prime ! amazing ! Saw this at Target for $ 70.had i not have bought it on amazon i wouldnt have been able to get this for her due to the gift cap ! ca n't comment on its function bc i did not actually test it out .	1
Got this for my 4 and 6 year old kids to ride.It is very sturdy and better than the previous generation model.The scooter folds up easier than before for storage and carrying . The wheels spin smoothly and the scooter can hold more than the recommended weight ( i 'm around 185lbs and it does n't even bend it ) .The height of the handlebars is way too short for anyone over 5'8 '' .When I need to ride this thing , by back ends up getting sore from having to bend down to grab the handlebars .	1
My son loves this scooter . And its his first one . The boy has it mastered already within 3-4 weeks after getting it . I like that its collapsible too . You can take it anywhere with you and it does n't take any room at all .	1
I bought these scooters for my children about 6 years ago . They ride them regularly and have put a lot of wear and tear on them . Not to mention leaving them outside in the rain and weather often . These have held up and have been well worth the 19.99 I got them for ( on sale on Black Friday ) . My son is asking for a new one , only for asthetics since his has rust and the handle bar grips are breaking down from use . It still rolls and works fine . I think I will indulge this Christmas and buy another and keep this around for friends.He actually rides this more than his bike . He is 10 years old . My daughter , 11 still hops on hers too.Easily folds for quick storage .	1
We have bought so many of these as gifts . They are excellent products and provide endless hours of fun for our kids and our friends kids . The build quality is awesome . The folding mechanism makes it easy to throw them in the trunk and make them mobile.Great product , quality , and entertainment value .	1
I rated Razor A2 kick scooter 4 stars because it is easy and fun to use . I like the adjustable handle and light weight . It goes fast with little push and is a nice green color.Overall , happy with this scooter but do n't leave it outside in the sun/rain because it will rust .	1
I purchased 2 units , one blue and one red . My kids love riding them.The quality of the scooter is very good considering its price . The handle bar is easy to adjust with no tools.Kids can easily collapse and fold the handle by themselves for storage.The ride seems fairly smooth for them even over concrete sidewalks , although they prefer to ride on asphalt park trails.The rear fender brake works well.The good thing is they go about as fast as an adult jogging , so they can tag along when I go out for a quick run.I own a Xootr for myself , and compared to that unit these are toys , but for sub $ 40 what can one expect ? : )	1
I spent $ 29 with no tax & free shipping , at that price , it 's excellent . My 8 , 5 , and 3 year old all have the A Kick , and they use them frequently . They enjoy them , I find them to be a very good quality scooter and a very good value for the money .	1
We got all 3 kids razors and when the weather cooperates , they are all outside tooling around . Seems to be pretty well put together and surprisingly , we 've had no injuries in the first week .	1
I bought 4 of these for my kids and they all love them . They have n't gotten bored of them yet after several months . They are built pretty well and have taken lots of abuse so far . I also like how they fold so we can store them easily .	1
I use this film and camera to make photos to give to my concealed carry students , who then turn in the photo with their application for their permit . So far , no problems with the images and I 'm satisfied with the quality of the images .	1
This film is cooler looking than poloroid , its wider . It makes nice old school photos . The only problem is that it 's super expensive . But if you love photos , it 's worth it .	1
Polaroid let all of this go several years ago . Yet in reality the market had not died buy had gotten a lot smaller . Fuji has kept making all of the professional films -n which are just outstanding and stunning in quality.The'Impossible ' makes the films for the polaroid consumer products - but they ar vexingly more complex than the FUJI instant films .	1
Very comfortable . The gel pad has taken away all pain and made riding quite enjoyable.However , after about 200 - 300 miles , the seam came apart and shows some of the gel . Not really a complaint , but it would be great if this lasted longer . I still consider this a good deal for $ [ ... ]	1
This is my second gel seat cover . I 'm already a huge believer in gel seat covers because I used to find riding my bike very uncomfortable and using a gel seat cover allowed me to bike a lot more with a lot less discomfort for a small investment . The gel padding takes the edge off the pressure on the pelvic bone and allows me ( a heavy guy - 300+ lbs ) to bike for hours . My last seat ( not Bell ) lasted 3 years - until the gel started to lose its integrity ( and form loose chunks under the cover . I was a little nervous about the Bell Gel Base because it 's so inexpensive . I was afraid it would smaller or thinner or somehow compromised - but no problems . The Bell Gel Base is just as good as any gel seat cover I 've seen and fit both my large seat and my wife 's small seat just fine ( via the adjustable pull cord ) . The Gel is firm but deep and works great.The concept with a seat cover is you just put it over your existing seat . The possible downsides are that it might slip a bit to one side during use . I periodically have to straighten mine out - but no big deal . The upside ( over buying a special gel seat ) is that it 's less expensive and when it wears out you just buy another .	1
I thought I could get away with my standard seat on the new bicycle I got . It seemed pretty comfortable on my quick ride around the neighborhood . But after I installed this , I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing . It does n't seem like it would do much when you put it on , but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air . It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame . I ca n't recommend the gel seat enough . This one fit my bike very well and for a great price . Highly recommend it !	1
I did a search on Amazon for bicycle seat cover . I saw the picture for this and the price and it looked perfect . Unfortunately , I scanned the reviews too quickly . What I thought I read was that it was a bit too tight so I was thinking this would be perfect for a road bike . But in reality it apparently is perfect for a STATIONARY bike . One of those with the huge seat on it . For a bicycle this thing is too big , at least for standard seats.I rated it for the quality and price which is good . The description is misleading .	1
It was not the easiest thing to assemble , and it does what I wanted for the most part . I 'm still not very proficient with this machine , but I 'm hoping being on it more will help with that . I do like the non-jarring motion and I 'm hoping for better results as I continue to build my time on the machine . Not as easy as Tony portrays it .	1
I 'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends ... .and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we 're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I 'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle ... its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23 ... I 'm very little now ... But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it .	1
OK.So no doubt the title caught your eye and you 're curious - what does he mean ? I mean some of the reviews here are a little inaccurate , and I intend to respond to some of these comments . But first , let me give my personal thoughts on this machine.Background : I 'm currently in the process of getting my body back into the shape it used to be in during high school . I have a Bowflex which does great for the strength training and muscle development , but regardless of what the commercials say , it 's NOT designed to help you lose weight . So I decided to get the Gazelle Freestyle.First thing I noticed was that the parts are very sturdy and thick , definitely not as cheap as it looks in the pictures . They 're hollow piping , so the whole deal is not too heavy ; less than 60lbs . There also are n't that many parts to assemble , however I was not happy with the assembly process , for many reasons.First , the parts had some bolts pre-screwed into final holes which irritated me . It means you have to unscrew , find a place for them , then re-screw them after you connect the parts which , incidentally , might not happen until the end of the assembly . It 's just an irritant ; I 'd rather just have the standard board of bolts and parts that comes with stuff today and let me attach it when it 's good and ready.Second , the instructions are n't clear and the pictures are ambiguous . It makes it extremely difficult to know how things should be laid out - additionally , one of the steps is wrong . It shows a picture of the foot rests upside down , yet if you install it that way , it 'll be wrong.Third is a symptom of the second one above . The steps in the instructions tell you to do things the wrong way - literally , assemble it in the wrong direction . If you do it in reverse , the assembly will go a LOT quicker and you 'll realize that it 's actually nowhere near as complex as it 's made out to be . It 's quite simple , really consisting of three steps instead of the 7-8 that the instructions have you believe.Ok , so now that the bad news is out of the way , onto the actual experience ( and my responses to the other reviews ) .Squeaks : Have n't noticed any . It makes a tiny noise as moving parts will , but it 's nothing deal breaking . If you get some regular grease and add a bit to the axle bar , you wo n't even notice it . It does come pre-greased , but again , if the squeaking bothers you so much ... .Ineffective : Uh , what ? I 'm in decent shape and I was able to get a decent workout from this thing . I think some of these guys had super-high expectations based on Tony Little jumping around like an idiot . You 're not going to start sweating on this thing after a minute of moving , even if you do it rapidly . There 's a reason for this , and it 's a good reason if you think about it : merely moving does n't cause you to sweat . Impact causes you to sweat , even if you do n't actually come in contact with something . That 's why if you were shadow boxing , you 'll get a good workout , because you 're actually making impacts with the air , sharp hits that actually exert your muscles . This machine does n't actually exert your muscles beyond normal range of motion , which is why it should n't be used for any strength or endurance training . It will , however , give you a good cardio workout after a time . NOT A MINUTE . That said , I did the workout all through a 10-minute WWE match , and by the end of it I was at the beginning stages of sweating , and started to feel a little fatigue ; comparable to what you would feel after having walked rapidly for two miles , but with less muscle exertion . I took a break , and got the feeling in my legs where it seemed as though I was still going through the motion.Heart Monitor : I think this device is not useful . I 'm serious . I mean if I were actually running or walking then I would pay attention , but as I mentioned before , there is no true exertion on this device which would really push your heart muscle . To me , a heart monitor is more useful on a treadmill or even an elliptical , not on this . If you use it , great ... I did n't even bother installing it , therefore I ca n't review it.So , do I recommend it ? Yes ... as long as you do n't have any misconceptions about performance . It 's not going to cause you to start sweating after a minute of use . You really need to work it for at least 10 minutes , consistently , changing speed and angle . If you lean forward , you add some resistance and will feel it .	1
I actually ordered mine from JC Penney , since I got a GREAT price on it by way of an advertising error on their part ... Either way , I only got it last night , and did n't find it too difficult to assemble just going by the sheet instructions . It IS quite heavy weight in construction , which I definitely count as a plus.The one thing that I can see that , so far , has n't been mentioned in the reviews is , if you 're on the heavier side ( I 'm 210 lbs at 5'5 '' tall , the heaviest I 've EVER been - ick ! ! ! ) , and wide through the hips , it does n't SEEM particularly roomy when you 're on the machine . I DID have a great time exercising on it last night after assembling it , though ! If you love elliptical machines , as I do ( they were my only motivation for going to the gym , and every time I went , I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get on one , so I cancelled my membership ... Now I 've got my own , dagnabbit ! ; ) ) , you should really like this machine.I do n't know if they 're as squeaky over time as the other reviews state , but I 'd assume that they are . Also , I live in a single bedroom apartment , and do n't have a lot of room left over to leave this standing up . The main problem ? I 'd planned on sliding it under my futon when I 'm not using it , but everything but the handles will fit - the handles just sit too high up to fit underneath it . It IS a heavy piece , as I said before , so a bit unwieldy , but the wheels on both the bottom of the rear frame , and the foot pedal pieces , help for maneuvering it.If you 're not big on exercise , as I am not unless it 's fun for me , but love cross trainer and elliptical machines , then I 'd suggest you get this , if it 's not more money than you want to spend . It does take a little initial exercise to figure out your rhythm , but once you get going , it 's GREAT ! I woke up this morning eager to get back on it and go , and I have n't felt that way about exercise in YEARS , if ever !	1
We 've had this stove for upwards of 25 years , and it has withstood the test of time , weather , and all kinds of camping conditions . The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska , Canada 's wild lakes ( for canoe and kayak camping ) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight , sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes , eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families , there are of course larger Coleman stoves . But for a family of two to four , this item is perfect .	1
We are novices at camping and purchased this to use . It was easy to assemble , set up and use . My husband even purchased a special tube attachment which allowed us to use a regualr bbq sized propane tank instead of those little canisters . Much cheaper and no worries about running out of gas !	1
The great old standby for camping . I have one We have used for years and now this one goes to the youngest son for his camping , fishing and hunting trips .	1
this is a classic we had the older version and as we could get a repair kit for it we just bought the new model . Well made and good value we use it car camping and have found it to work well the hardest thing is getting it to simmer as when you turn the burner down it creeps back up to a higher flame .	1
We were more than pleased with this camp stove . Easy to light , easy to clean . We had n't used this type before , and are very glad we bought it . The price was definitely better here than in the shops for the same item .	1
My family has been using Coleman propane stoves for camping as far back as I can remember , and for good reason ! Got my very own two months ago , and used it several times on my yearly camping trip ... and it works great . If you 're looking for something not too fancy , but reliable - this is the stove for you !	1
This Coleman stove has two 10,000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water ( on HIGH ) or simmer ( on LOW ) whatever it is you desire . You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions . This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results . It is a small unit , but it is very versatile and well-crafted . This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature . Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame . The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated .	1
I used to use these way back when . Anyhow , for car camping this stove is all you need . Easy to carry and clean .	1
The Basic propane camp stove has n't failed me yet . When this one dies , I will replace it with the same thing .	1
This is a good stove . The two things I wish it had are an easy place to store the extension you screw into the stove and the propane tank and I wish the knobs that control the propane flow were n't so sensitive . I 'd move the knob a tiny bit and the flow would increase a lot .	1
Overall : Highly recommend for car campingPros : durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons : flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals . Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove , as it has a nice heavy solid feel , and seems very well constructed . The heat output is n't fantastic , but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions . As others have mentioned , the flame adjustment is n't the greatest , but then again most camping/backpacking stoves are n't either . Love this stove , highly recommend and would buy again .	1
A good camping stove is essential to any good camping trip and I think this product fills that roll pretty well . It is simple to set up and use , and there is enough space to fit two decent sized pots next to each other . Unfortunately like others mentioned the temperature control is lacking which is my biggest complaint.Pros : -Easy to set up and use-Easy to find refill canisters-Packs small-Boils water quicklyCons : -Temperature control is poor , its impossible to simmer . It takes some practice finishing both meals at the same time and keeping everything warm-Quality , I suspect some of the rivets may break . I think there is a difference between light weight and cheap and this item is right on the lineConclusion : This stove is certainly not perfect but it serves a very utilitarian purpose . I do n't think you could cook gourmet meals with this stove but you can certainly make eggs and bacon or pasta with sauteed vegetables . I would recommend this product to others however I would caution them that it is n't the same as their stove at home , which in some ways adds to the fun of camping.Note : I found I needed a case to keep the propane cylinders from rolling around the car and to keep everything together , I purchased theColeman Stove Carry Case , I 'll let you know how it fits after it arrives and I actually get to field test it some .	1
Hey guys , I camp and hunt a lot with many friends . My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that . I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks , off bulk tanks . 1LB will last a long time , many cooks . I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid , so when I try to open it , I need to find something to pry it open . The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low , it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob , but it will do it , I just have to try several times . All in all a great stove ! I 'd buy it again ! ! !	1
This was a gift for someone . I have one and know how good they are . Camping or hurricanes . They are a definite must have . Get the hose to connect to the 20 lb tank and you 'll be glad you did ...	1
Stove is great for cooking while camping . If you can have a fire or not , the stove is there to make tasty meals !	1
I have owned one of these for more than twenty years . I bought this as a gift . Coleman is still a brand you can count on	1
The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed , but I did n't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit . The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be . It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other . I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy . The jump rope , ah , the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have , but i 's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn . It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch . I like it , it 's fun and it 's a really good outlet on very bad days .	1
This set includes the speed bag and mounting platform , speed bag training gloves , hand wraps , and a jump rope . I 'm mainly a karate and kung-fu student and teacher , but I 've done some boxing too , and one of the best exercises you can learn to enhance speed and agility is the classic boxing workout on the speed bag . More martial artists should use this great training tool . I never got to the point where I could mix in things like elbow strikes and head butts in-between punches like the real experts , but I got pretty good just hitting it with straight punches and back hammerfists and could really get it going that way . If you 're going to try this , keep your shoulders loose and try to hit with proper rhythm and timing -- those are the key elements . Do n't try to go real hard and fast in the beginning , as you 'll only be able to hit it once or twice before you miss . Start slow and build up from there . Altogether a great training for martial artists of all styles and stripes.The jump rope is a nice extra although perhaps not as essential for karate students . That 's because a boxer is poised on the balls of his feet , and his most powerful punch is the hook , which travels in an arc . A karate thrust punch is just the opposite . Karateists punch flat-footed and the punch is from the hips and travels in a straight line , so the karateist is n't always bouncing around on the balls of his feet like a boxer . He 's more likely to shift stances and move only when necessary to adjust distance , although that depends on the individual fighter , too.Overall , a useful set and at a reasonable price for the quality and features offered .	1
My 5-year old reports that these are comfortable and I can report that he can hit hard with them . Five stars .	1
We 've only had minimal play time with these to date , but so far they seem to fit well and be well built for general play .	1
I purchased this mat a few months ago from Amazon.com since I can no longer find it at any sports supply stores . This mat is just like the ones we used to have in our grammar school gymnasiums . I purchased it so that I can tote it around and use it at home . It is easy to use since it folds out evenly without bumpy areas and stores well since it folds in half . The mat is just the right thickness for comfort and I find that it supports me when I need to do exercises while lying on the floor . I can no longer lie on a plain carpeted surface without extra cushioning from a mat . The price is very reasonable as well . If you are looking for a simple but comfortable floor mat for doing exercises and stretching I recommend this mat . Note : when you get the mat out of the box you may notice a plastic-type smell from being in storage . This will dissipate over time and does not affect the quality of the mat .	1
Firm and easy to store . Everything about this mat is simple and made very well.. I would give it 10 stars if I could . Worth the money , Great buy .	1
I have been sleeping on this mat for several years and I love it . It is very firm but I like it that way . When I visit people I bring it along and lay it on the floor for sleeping . When I first got it the plastic mat cover had a plastic odor for awhile but that went away after a few weeks . In hot weather I wrap a sheet around the mat so it does n't stick to me and I can roll over easier .	1
Received as a gift 2 of these many years ago . Need 2 more so just bought 2 more . They are excellent for many purposes and besides looking good are well built and perform well . If you need a folding mat that is strong and well made , I strongly recommend this product . ( First product lasted over 10 years and the new product seems to be the same quality )	1
We 're using these to lay over our hardwood floors so the baby can play and crawl safely without fear of bumping her head ! You know , sometimes babies will & # 34 ; faceplant & # 34 ; as they learn to crawl or even fall as they learn to stand . Our only carpet is limited to smaller rooms , but a few of these unfolded and laid next to each other provide plenty of room for her to play while offering great protection ! Best of all they fold up and store under the couch and the handles really help to move them around easily.Cheap and functional ( though our purposes did n't include adult exercise ! ) and actually a bit nostalgic ( reminds me of gym class ) !	1
This mat is of a nice dense foam and provides a great surface for floor exercises . It folds up into a nice compact shape when you 're done . Perfect .	1
This is actually my second purchase of the same item . Really good exercise mat and it is good enough to use it as guest for sleep over .	1
This was exactly as described it came on time and it works great ... it is well made i would expect it to last a long time	1
Comfortable and thick . Very convenient to stow and large enough to do pull-ups and stretches . Looks and feels professional grade .	1
I got ta say that I felt like I was rolling the dice on this , because I was not sure if it would be firm enough . It is soft , but also firm , but not as firm as the commercial type blue mats used for things like gymnastics . Really that is OK though since for a exercise and stretching mat it does not need to be that firm , and this mat is a good balance . I think the quality is OK and there was only the faintest of odor up close which is not a minus , just an observation . The size is also good , I doubt many people would need something bigger .	1
This mat is a good size and although some reviewers have mentioned it 's lack of width , I do n't find any problem with that for the exercises I do on it . The thickness is plenty good enough to protect me from the hard floor , yet supportive enough for my back . The vinyl is very easy to wipe clean . One of the best things I like about this mat is the fact it folds in half and has neat carry handles . I have a small home gym so just pull it out when I need it then wipe down and fold it up and prop it up against a wall when it 's not in use . The color is great too . Compared to the much thinner mats I was using when I had gym membership , I think this is an excellent purchase . Seems pretty sturdy though I have only been using it for a couple of months so difficult to tell how it will stand up over time .	1
To keep it as simple as possible the product is a blue padded mat just like the ones at a gym . The only difference is that this one is only two feet wide and clean . I wish it could fold into thirds and that the mat was bigger but it works as it is suppose to . I use it to do simple exercises .	1
Great item for my rough carpet . Thick enough to support your body while doing some stretches , situps , pushups or any yoga poses .	1
Just as described ! I purchased because of the positive feedback this mat received . I bought the Blue one . It was cheaper for whatever reason . It 's great . Very comfortable for the use of stretching and sit-ups .	1
This mat is a great buy . It is firm but comfortable , looks very well made , and has not compressed after months of use . I liked it so much I bought another one so that I could do stretch during lunch at the office .	1
I purchased this mat for my daughter to use under her balance beam . I understand what others are saying that it could be a little bit firmer , but for the money , I do n't think you can beat it !	1
Everlast is a well known name and they make good products . I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat . This is definitely thick and cushy . But ... . it 's kind of bulky and heavy to carry . It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong . It was not worth returning so I will deal with it . But if I had to do it over , I 'd buy the yoga mat .	1
Ive had it for a few months now and it is working great . Folds neatly and feels like it is well built .	1
It 's ok for home use , I just wish it was a little thicker , as I have it on the concrete floor of my basement .	1
This is a great mat for the price . Enough cushion for floor exercise , easy to clean and carry . The one drawback is the fluffy nature of the foam . It is n't dense foam . So despite its thickness , it bottoms out pretty easily . making this a good mat for soft and slow moves , but wholly inadequate for anything that might involve impact . I used this for my prenatal yoga floor work and loved the cushy support for my aching hips and back . Overall , better than a typical extra thick yoga mat , but do n't expect yoga mat density/quality .	1
We had these when we were kids although the foot design is different . This one should last longer than those of 55 years ago and might be safer to boot .	1
This is the best Pogo on the block . All the kids take turns using it . The wide base makes it easier for them , and easier to store . It is also fairly easy to get going . I highly recommend this , even my clutzy 7 year old does great on this .	1
When we take this to the park , then all these children want to play with it . Funny , but it actually gets annoying , because as a parent , I have to hold other people 's kids to keep them safe while they are jumping up and down . PLUS , my kids do n't get to use it as much because of the other children . There is a weight limit on this pogo stick , so be careful with heavier children . Other than that , it 's easy to use , and even to store . Barely takes up any space and even stands on it own with the base . Make sure that you stay with your child until he/she gets really good with it .	1
I bought this for my 4 year old niece . I have n't heard any complaints from my sister about it so I 'm assuming it has worked out great ! She will be able to grow with it , obviously , so that was one of the main reasons I bought it .	1
My 5 yr old daughter got this for Christmas . It is very challenging for her to use , but she keeps trying to master it , so I guess it is still fun even if it is hard for her . She is small and light for her age , so I expect she 'll get plenty of use out of it . My son who is 8 has tried it a few times too and finds it challenging as well . It 's good exercise !	1
My twin 7 year old hyperactive boys love this thing - they have spent countless hours in the last few weeks hopping on it . We have only used it with the larger base but they are getting good enough at it that I think I might be trying to remove it in the next few weeks . The amount of energy my boys can burn on this is awesome . It seems very sturdy and it has not had any problems putting up with the abuse doled out to it .	1
Got this ball for my 7 and 9 year old sons who have loved this ball . It is great out of the box and is a great weight . They boys have been playing with this ball outside all over the neighborhood for weeks now and the grip is still great and the ball is still inflated.Worth it .	1
My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop , so we decided to give this one a try . The surface has a good , slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky , which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she 'd previously been using , which had been worn nearly smooth.We 've had the basketball for some time , and it 's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons . Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have , this one holds air well . It has a good bounce , and the surface is still in good shape after all this time . Being bounced against the cement on our driveway has n't left it any worse for the wear . I ca n't say how it might function in an actual court , but it 's a good choice for some outdoor basketball .	1
This Spalding Tack Basketball is very tacky . It makes it easy to palm the ball and provides a light soft touch . Using the ball mainly on indoor courts , it holds up well . I 'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court , but after a few uses outside , it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot , but I only gave it 4 stars , because I noticed that whenever we pick the `` game ball '' for our pickup games , everyone shies away from these balls .	1
This is the perfect ball for a family game of 2-on-2 . While it 's the standard size for a basketball , the softness is very nice , especially when playing with little children . They seem to be able to handle this ball a bit better than the harder basketball that we own . It 's quite easy to palm this ball compared to our other ball as well . The color is a rich , dark orange and quite a bit darker than the standard ball . I recommend this product for many hours of fun !	1
I love this ball . It feels great and professional . First time playing with it , it felt brand new straight out the box . After about a week of playing , everybody wants to use my ball for games . It feels good that your ball becomes the game ball out of all the other balls but I feel bad when its time for me to leave the gym . lol ... Jerry Ayers	1
The main feature of this ball is a tacky surface that makes the ball easier to grip . This feature works really well . This ball has a noticeably better grip than the Wilson indoor/outdoor ball that I have been using for casual driveway basketball . Otherwise , it is a typical indoor/outdoor ball . It is well made and keeps inflated . One interesting fact about this tacky ball is that when wet it becomes much slicker than a standard ball , which grips about the same when playing on a wet driveway .	1
The `` Tack Soft '' compound on this ball makes it terrific to grip and control . I have not had it long enough to comment on durability , but at least out of the box it is the most pleasant and controllable ball I have ever played with . A great product !	1
This basketball is a great game staple . It 's sturdy and has a good hand feel right out of the box.Even though it did get smooth really quickly when used outdoors , ( losing that nice 'tacky ' feel ) , it was n't unexpected or really a big deal considering the low price of the ball.It 's a good value and has held up to daily games without much visible wear and tear.All in all I 'm happy with it and would order it again !	1
Overall , good ball for the price . Looks and feels great straight from the box . Nice tacky surface that is great for grip . Does what you would expect from a new basket ball . This ball is marked for indoor/outdoor play . But the tacky surface feels artificial and wo n't last long outdoors . It will lose the grippiness after picking up too much dirt and dust and the it will feel worn out . Keep it clean , play indoors and the ball should last a while .	1
This is a fairly nice basketball , plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us . As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too ( indoors ) and so far so good . The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review . We have used this basketball everyday since we 've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball does n't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you do n't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price , I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike !	1
This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball . The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new , with deep seams allowing excellent ball control . Regulation size ( 29.5 ) . Being soft , it 's not Spalding 's most durable outdoor ball -- the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time , and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement . Indoors , it 'll last forever and stay nice and grippy . It needed a little air when I received it , but otherwise , I 'm totally satisfied with it . ( Although not a big deal , I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls . )	1
I 'm still feeling out the grip of this ball and what I think about it . Change can be hard , and I sometimes want to stick with the traditional grip . However I have to admit that it is nice to be able to grip the ball better . I also need to evaluate how well this ball will handle usage . I play mostly outside which can cause more wear and tear on the ball than indoor courts . This is probably the most important factor for me , and I 'll try to come back and edit my review over time . I am also still evaluating how the ball behaves around the rim . So far I have n't seen too much difference in that regard -- I 'm trying not to blame the ball for my misses . : ) The ball has kept its air well note . I 'd say that if you are on the fence with this ball , just go ahead and drop the few dollars and try it out yourself .	1
Nice grippable surface . A good ball for younger players . Good price too . Recommended for light play ... not a pro quality ball but fine for most .	1
This is a wonderful ball . I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son 's birthday . We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he did n't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice . It has a nice `` sticky '' grip , feels secure when grasp , and for preparing to shoot . It holds air well and does n't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season . Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you 'd expect in a quality ball . I highly recommend it to all . It even arrives inflated for immediate play .	1
I occasionally swim at the gym and these have worked fine for me . I do n't need anything fancy and these generally do keep the water out . I readjust them a few times each swim . Leakage will all depend on your face shape , depth of eyes , etc .	1
I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week . Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger . I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them . The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion . I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints . If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further !	1
Super water proof and easy to see through . I bought these for post-eye surgery so I could take a shower while my eyes were still not able to close . So nice to see and wash my hair with .	1
Am a beginner swimmer . These work really well and would get another pair like them . Probably will get a tinted pair for swimming in the lake .	1
I do n't know much about goggles or how to swim fast , for that matter . I do know that these goggles do what I needed them to do , so they get 5 stars ! They look cool , they stay on your head , and they keep the water out ( when properly adjusted ) . What more can you ask of a pair of goggles ? ?	1
Pros : They have a solid nose piece.They act as sunglasses.They are comfortable.They barely leak at all.They form a great seal.Cons : The anti-fog coating wears off after about two weeks.They are a little hard to adjust .	1
I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it does n't . Most of Speedo 's goggles have great reviews so I was n't sure which ones would work for me . Ordered the oversized Baja model which was n't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time . Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT ! Very comfortable to wear , keep the water out completely , do not get foggy ( I ordered the black ones ) , and do not hurt at all .	1
These fit perfect.. I do n't have to adjust it at all when I 'm swimming laps in the pool . No leaking	1
The goggles seem to be high quality , but the bridge could be a bit longer . The goggles do n't appear to have a size , so it seems that they would all be this way . But they fit well enough .	1
The last time I bought swimming goggles was probably 1992 , so I was a bit leery of these goggles at their relatively low price point . They fit great , and they do n't leak much at all . I exert myself pretty hard when I swim ( i.e. , I am out of shape ) , and they do n't seem to fog up very badly . Every now and then I need to de-fog them , but mostly they 're great . They stay in place , they do n't leak , and they 're adjustable . I particularly like that adjusting them is not particularly easy to do -- yes , I like that it 's hard to adjust the length , because that makes the length very stable and secure . They 're good goggles , particularly if it 's been 20+ years since you 've bought goggles .	1
I have long hair . I always experience with the goggle that has strap always pulling my hair , but this one not.It is very easy to wear . I do n't need to shorten the strap to make it tight . I feel comfortable when I use it.The water does n't leak . It is fog some time , but I just wash it by my finger and it 's gone.The plastic is clear . It 's easy to see when swimming.I really recommend it .	1
I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea , and this product was part of my pack . They lasted the entire year , and there 's only a few minor scratches on the lenses . They do what they were intended to do , keep the water out of your eyes , and they fit well on my face . I 'm sure this pair will last at least another few years of regular use .	1
You simply ca n't beat the price and quality of these goggles ; simply the best . I would hightly recommend these to anyone .	1
My son prefers googles with one-piece eyes . These are sturdy and holder their shape well . Nothing fancy , but they work .	1
Having tried a number of generic and even other Speedo swim goggles , I 'm happy I found this model as it fits my facial structure better than the others . Still tends to fog up and I 'll try some of the `` home-remedies '' when I swim again soon . You know , rub a raw potato inside the goggles ; smear and thin layer of non-gel toothpaste in the goggles ; spit in the goggles , etc .	1
I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles . They have a snug , relatively comfortable ( for googles ) fit and wo n't leak if you follow the instructions on the package . These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility . I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater . I have used these clear goggles for a year now , and after about 30 uses , there are no durability issues so far . These are nice goggles at an affordable price , better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time !	1
I bought these for myself . Was the first time I have ever worn goggles . I love the comfortable fit and they are perfect to protect my eyes in the water . So much so that I can wear my contact lenses while swimming and not worry about them . They do n't leak and are great ! Would highly recommend . I had seen other reviewers say that others leaked but the hydrospex did not . Very true. , these do n't leak and you see clearly underwater .	1
Nothing fancy -- just great suction that keeps the water out ! Is n't that what you really want swim goggles for when you 're swimming laps ? Very comfortable , adjustable fit , too !	1
These have worked very well . They fog just a little . But the main reason I got these were cost and other reviews . Other than the occasional leak due to me putting them on my head/eyes wrong , these work just fine for me . I 'd recommend these for splashing around in the pool with your kids or swimming laps at your local rec center/pool .	1
Kids love these speedos They are fully adjustable and fit everyone . Lenses are clear and they hardly leak .	1
I purchased the clear model before and I loved it . I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these . Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool . They work up to the Speedo name ! A few things to watch out for with these though . The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably wo n't fit right . They do not leak at all . But you will get some racoon eyes . I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes . But you have to take the good with the bad . The fit around the eyes is very comfortable . Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away .	1
Speedo makes great goggles with great quality . I usually buy a pair every year or two to replace older ones that I have scratched up and or stretched out ... yes I have a big head . : - ) That said I figure I would try a pair of these . True to form , they are perfect goggles and very high quality . Not much else can be said.I rate them 5/5 but with a hint of CAUTION ! If you are ok with wearing what seems like a pair of sunglasses under water..then these are for you . They do in fact block sunlight and make the experience a bit better during the bright mid afternoon but they do darken things up quite a bit Just a note ... .in the end its your choice .	1
This is the only brand/type of goggles that I will use while swimming . ( Going on 15 years ) Other brands do n't seem to fit right around my eyes and I 'll get water in them .	1
I have a lot of ocean miles with these goggles and LOVE them . I always say it 's the best 20 bucks I ever spent . [ and I have spent it happily several times because I keep giving them away or loosing them . SO this is a really good price . ] If you are used to the glued on foam seal goggles you should buy these immediately and throw all your old pairs away . You should go to the Speedo store and try on the various models to see what floats your face though . [ I think the other review is about the Speedo Jr . Hydrospecs . ] Further these goggles are GOOD to about 20 feet and seldom leak.GO OUT AND SWIM IN SOME BIG WAVES TREVERYONE wants T R Caspellmr . Toads wild ride . Todd Royall CaspellRIDE LOTS Tord and sundry ( expressed opinions not necessarily ofmy brain )	1
My kids have used the model for many seasons and I can always count on them to be reliable and lasting .	1
Does n't rock very well but my son loves me pushing him around on it . The foot rest that tucks under is great .	1
Short of pieces missing , I 'm sure this toy will be just fine . I actually got it on a 50 % off sale , and thought it would be a good Christmas present for a grandchild . And I 'm sure it will.If not I will come back and update !	1
I bought this for my son when he was a toddler and made good use of the `` convertible '' function of it through his tot years . He is at kindergarten now , and his baby sister has just started to enjoy it as a rocker . WE left it outside for months and hosing it down makes it quite clean again every fall when we take it inside .	1
I am buying our third one for our third child . This is a `` must have '' for our kids between 18 months and 2 years . The one we bought seven years ago is still going , albiet with a limp . They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids do n't care ! The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they do n't seem to notice that the wheels are n't round anymore . Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade !	1
OKAY ! As experienced parents , we know that the multi-use items , never do one thing- really well . The 3,4,5 in 1 's never quite do all that they claim . And this is no different . The `` rocker '' feature is just really stupid . It does n't do anything . As a push trike , it will fit the bill , for sure . It has respectable durability , and is gender neutral . So for me , it 's a great great value . I have toddler , boy and girl . As a stand alone trike , this is a perfect `` starter '' big wheel . The assembly was straight forward , just follow the directions to the letter , all 14 of the steps- do really matter . You need to understand the mechanics of the bike , to really `` get '' how to convert . Once you are all set , you have a quick and inexpensive alternative , to a metal bike . For a starter bike , this will do just fine , for your little one ( s ) . The price was good , for the value .	1
Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers ... .The red bar for mom to push , for example . It came in two pieces . Really ? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in . And the foot rest for the baby ? I 'm still not sure I have it in right . It moves , and I do n't think it should.That being said ... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike . My toddler loves it ! So , success .	1
A classic design , very tough bottle . Keeps hot stuff HOT and cold stuff cold ... But not at the same time . Great for soup or coffee for people who drink coffee , I have hot coco .	1
This thermos is one of Stanley 's famous vacuum flask thermoses . Vacuum flask technology is the best technology for preventing thermal attrition ( keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold ) . I enjoy my coffee very hot and my water ice cold . When I received this I tested it and found that it kept my coffee nice and hot ( not lukewarm ) for over 2 days ! As for cold , it had ice in my ice water in it after almost 3 days ( and I live in the south where it 's warm ) .The entire bottle is stainless steel . It is double-walled , with a vacuum between the steel walls . The screw-on stopper seals very nicely and is made of a very strong plastic , it seems very solid . The cup fits well and is solid plastic with chrome on the outside . Stanley also has a reputation for standing behind their products and offer a lifetime guarantee . It 's pretty much impossible to beat the quality of a Stanley and a warranty like that . I am a student and also enjoy the outdoors , and my Stanley is a companion with me everywhere . I always have fresh coffee or tea piping hot . I almost never leave home without it because it is so useful ! On camping trips you can also fill it with clean super-hot water and you can put oatmeal in the cup or in a bowl and have an instant hot meal . This thermos performs excellent in the winter too . I left mine outside in my car overnight in sub-freezing weather and the next morning I did n't have time to make more coffee and put it in . When I got to school , I figured = what the heck , I 'll see if it 's warm - to my surprise is was nice and hot and ready to drink ! Here are some specifics on the Stanley Thermos that you might find useful : Thermos : Height : 14 inchesDiameter : 4 inchesCircumference : 12-2/5 inchesComposition of interior : Stainless SteelComposition of exterior : Stainless SteelComposition of Top/Stopper : Plastic/PolymerComposition of Cap/Cup : Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance : VacuumMaximum Capacity ( Volume ) : 1 Quart ( 32 fluid ounces or 1/4 Gallon ) Country of Origin : Made in China ( not USA , sadly ) .Cleaning Method : Hand Wash Only [ Not Dishwasher Safe ] Not Microwave Safe - Do Not MicrowaveGuarantee : Lifetime GuaranteeI must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design . It is definitely a must-have for students , in offices and commuting to work , on the job where ruggedness is required , and out on the trail . The only drawback I see is that it is made in China instead of the U.S.A . Personally , I 'd happily pay double the price for one that was made in U.S.A . In any case , a good Stanley product is worth the investment . I am very happy with the product .	1
This bottle is a little pricy . But it does what it claims . It preserves hot water temperature very well . I did n't try the cold temperature . The construction is very solid for high impact resistent ( good for portability ) . I have no doubt that it will last for many many years . In all , I am happy with the quality of this bottle . But , I will take 1 star out due to its premium price .	1
I have seen the bad reviews . Do I believe them ? Yes . There probably are vacuum flask bottles that did not work . For what reason ? I do not know.But just like buying a car , sometimes you get a lemon . Quality control should be better at the factory . I suppose they just do not have the resources to fill every bottle with hot water , then see if the bottle actually kept the water hot for 24 hours . They should though . These days , most products get a visual inspection at best.But not every item is defective . I 've had no complaints with mine . From working double shifts to long road trips , my bottle has kept my coffee hot.For my personal use , my beverages go into the bottle at a boiling hot temperature . I will add boiling water to my bottle with a couple of teabags , and my tea will stay hot for well over 24 hours . I brew my coffee with a percolater on top of an induction cooktop . Sometimes I like to add boiling hot water into a French press.Boiling hot liquid going in stays hot for a very long time . If you are using an electric drip coffee pot , like a Mr. Coffee , then you did n't start off with very hot coffee to begin with . The boiling point of water is 100 C ( 212 F ) . Coffee shops typically keep retail coffee at or about 82 C ( 180 F ) . An inexpensive home drip coffee maker will be even lower in temperature ( which usually results in a poor cup of coffee ) . Does that make any sense ?	1
Quick shipping and great product . My dad is a truck driver and drinks a LOT of coffee . His old thermos was slowly dying so I picked this one up for him . Obviously it wo n't keep coffee SUPER hot , but he can drink it well beyond noon and it 's still pleasantly warm .	1
The classic is still the best . Took it out on the opening day of deer season . It sat next to me in the blind , with a temperature that wavered between high 30s and low 40s all day . The coffee stayed hot all day , and the last cup was still warm when I got home 13 hours later . That earned four stars , the fifth is because the price on Amazon is $ 5 less than the closest local competitor .	1
It 's more expensive than some , but it 's well-made , works perfectly , and will last for years . Not requiring removal of the top to pour is great . Just buy it already !	1
Stanley always a good quality product . It is well made and I use it frequently when on fishing trips . I would recommend it for any general use .	1
These are only $ 19 at Walmart . So why are they so much here ? I think someone is gouging at this price ! !	1
The Thermos insulated can holder works very well . I have 4 of them and keep them at home , at work , and in my vehicle . They keep a can cold for a very long time .	1
Love the Thermos beer can holder/cooler . You can even use it as a glass . Recommend it . Better than the foam ones . Later : I 've had this for over a year now and still amazed at how it keeps drinks cool . I also use it as a glass and ice cubes last for hours and hours .	1
I use this item daily ! It keeps my soda cold even when I get busy and it does not sweat . I even had my name engraved on mine !	1
this is pretty straight forward . it does keep the cans much longer than holding them without it . a good stocking stuffer kinda gift .	1
This can insulator helps to keep can cool , but also prevents the can from being crushed . Might not seem important to most but my autistic son would always want to crush them when he would have a tantrum . This way no more crushed cans .	1
I bought this at a food festival from the Owner of http : //stores.chillingthemost.com/ and I love it . I bought the version that has the bottle adapter for keeping your bottles just a cool . And from him , even with Shipping , its a little more than twenty six dollars.Highly recommended this cooler ! ! ! !	1
Thermos Stainless Steel Can Insulator 2700P , by Thermos.This insulated stainless can and bottle holder will keep your beers and sodas cold for at least an hour . Starting with a 12 ounce can of beer at 33 degrees , and a 16.9 ounce plastic bottle of soda also at 33 degrees , I put each of them in a room temperature 76 degree Thermos insulated holder , and left them unopened . After an hour , both the beer and soda had warmed up some , the bottle of Coca-Cola was at 48 degrees when opened , and the can of Budweiser beer was at 36 degrees when opened . I usually keep my holders upside down in the refrigerator , on top of soda bottles to save space . I also keep a gel insulated holder in the freezer , with the shape maintained by an empty beer can . Replacing the soda bottle cap will keep the fizz in the soda , but if a can of beer is left opened for more than an hour , it will start to lose its fizz and go flat . How many people leave a can of beer open for more than an hour if they plan on drinking it ? In the hot sun , any drink is better than no drink , but indoors , you might just dump it and start over , -depending of course on how many beers you have already had . After a few beers , you may not even notice how cold the beer is . ( - ; In the future , I will update this review on how well the beer and soda stay cold when the holder is also stored in the refrigerator . This item is expensive , but well made . As a future improvement , I think that the rubber collar should be extended the length of the can , to improve the grip , and to further insulate the can by isolating the heat sink metal sides from the influence of warm hands . Four stars for this can holder.03/25/14 Update . Just for giggles , I tried the test again , this time with the holders kept in the door of the refrigerator , alongside the 12 oz . can of beer and the 16.9 oz . plastic bottle of Coca-Cola . They all started out in the refrigerator at a temperature of 33 degrees . After being placed in the holders , both of them sat unopened on a table for one hour at a room temperature of 76 degrees , and the opened can of beer was at 38 degrees , and the opened bottle of soda was at 51 degrees , probably due to the fact that the top 2 1/2 '' of the bottle and its soda were above the top of the insulating holder , while only 5/8 '' of the beer can was above its holder.Strange as it seems , the beer and soda both did a little better in a room temperature holder than in a refrigerated holder . Whodathunkit . This was not a controlled scientific experiment , but I tried to control the variables the best I could so that I could compare the results . If anyone can explain why this same thing happened with both the hard rubber holders I reviewed on 03/24/14 , and these metal stainless steel holders as well , please leave a comment . The hard rubber holders had about a 2 degree difference between the can and bottle , while the stainless holders had a 12.5 degree ( 48 & 36 ; 51 & 38 ) difference between the can and bottle . The difference between the hard rubber and stainless for the beer can was 11.5 degrees ( 48 & 36 ; 49 & 38 ) , while the average temperature for the bottle was 50 degrees ( 48,50,51,51 ) for both the hard rubber and the stainless holders . So for the plastic bottle , it does n't seem to make a difference what type of holder you use . For the beer can , the stainless holder was a clear winner over the hard rubber holder , with an average temperature of 37 ( 36,38 ) for the stainless holder and an average temperature of 48.5 ( 48,49 ) for the hard rubber holder.A beer still cold at 37 degrees after an hour ? Hard to beat that ! These stainless holders are excellent.Next up , placing the holders in a freezer.04/18/14 Update . The freezer test . I started out with the stainless steel holders in a freezer at a temperature of -8 degrees . The 12 ounce can of Budweiser and the 16.9 ounce plastic bottle of Coca-Cola were in the refrigerator at 32 degrees , and the ambient room temperature was 76 degrees . After one hour of sitting unopened , the Budweiser was at 36 degrees , and the Coca-Cola was at 44 degrees . The soda was 4 degrees cooler than in the previous cooler at room temperature test , and the beer , at 36 degrees , was about the same as in previous tests , and exactly the same as the stainless cooler in the room temperature test . In this test , there was a 12 degree difference between the coldness of the beer and the soda , about the same as in previous tests . It does not appear that freezing or cooling the stainless cooler is any improvement over using a room temperature stainless cooler when keeping a can of beer cold , and at best , only a 4 degree improvement in keeping a plastic bottle of soda cold . I ca n't think of any more tests to run on this cooler , and about all there is left to say is : `` buy it ! `` Sold by Corydor and Fulfilled by Amazon . Manufactured by : THERMOS L.L.C. , 2550 W. Golf Rd. , RM , IL 60008 , USA ; Web : thermos.com/ Canadian Thermos Products , Inc. , 370 King Street West , Toronto , ON M5V 1J9 , Canada ; web : thermosbrand.ca07/09/14 Update . I have noticed that the rubber ring around the top of the can has started to loosen up a bit . I was thinking of adding some glue to keep it in place , but silicone glue might not dry without exposure to air , so I might use some rubber cement on both the can and rubber ring , let the glue dry , and then place the ring in its proper position . If anyone knows of a better glue to use , please leave a comment . Thermos should extend the rubber ring all the way to the bottom of the can , including the bottom as well , so the metal holder does n't have any way of slipping out and landing on the floor .	1
of putting this in my lunch box every ( week- ) day , it still looks almost new . It still works just like new . It 's good looking . I 'm not going to swear it works better than the thick plactic ones , but I did n't notice any drop-off . Cans are easy to remove . No downside .	1
This thermos definitely keeps a can cold . Keep in mind that it fits standard cans , not skinny cans like the latest Coors cans . Also , this thermos is pretty pricey .	1
I 've had one of these for a number of years now and finally got around to ordering another one so my wife and I could both use one at the same time.They 're great in winter when you do n't want a cold soda can making your hand cold and great in summer at keeping your soda colder for longer.The bottom is rubber and does a great job of staying put.There 's no sweating/condensation to worry about either.I really think these things are great and ca n't see not using them going forward but avoided giving it a 5 star rating only because of how expensive they are.I feel like you should get a two pack for the price one cost .	1
I ca n't stress enough how well these thermos koozies work . I own a can-am Maverick UTV and the cup holders in that thing will boil your drink in 5 minutes . Using these koozies I can set a drink in the cup holder inside this koozie and it will keep it nice and cold for a long time . Well worth the money ! The only problem I had was that the bottom plastic piece fell off when I dropped it about 6 ' onto concrete , I just put some epoxy on it and it is as good as new .	1
This Thermos works well , but with the open top , it 's impossible to keep the 12oz drinks cool for an extended period of time , like the other Thermos products . I 'd say that it really only keep the drink cooler for a slightly longer period of time . It 's definitely better than one of those flimsy koosies , but not as good as I expected it to be .	1
I have been using this over 3 years now , and never looked back for the koozies since . I was surprised how long it keeps my Dr. Pepper 's cold , I just figured a metal container would have the opposite effect on a cold can .	1
If you buy this can insulator you 'll never own another , it is far superior to every other product like it . It keeps beverages well chilled for considerably longer than the competition and is well worth the expense . You 'll make up the cost in all the beverage you wo n't throw away because it 's too warm ; this keeps my beer well chilled to the very last drop even in desert heat . That it fits in most car beverage holders is just one more plus .	1
Excellent item . Works as well as stated , last cooler I 'll ever buy as long as I keep a close eye on it and never let anyone `` borrow '' it .	1
It 's unbelievable how well this works . It makes a real difference . The canned drink stays cool for hours . It is a bit more expensive than I would like . If it were a bit cheaper , I would buy another..	1
I think it is double walled and has no insulation . I keep it in the freezer and it keeps the drink cold while you 're drinking it . It serves my purpose and I would buy it again .	1
I drink a lot of soda but never get to bottom without loosing it 's cool . this one works and the can will not stick inside and become hard to remove like foam ones and they fall apart anyway . This will be the last one I need to get .	1
I bought two of these , for my mother and myself . Living in Phoenix , the center console of my car gets *really* hot . As in over 180F in the summer . A can of ice cold soda dropped into the cup holder becomes a hot soda in just a few minutes.This insulator is incredible . The fit and finish is perfect for holding a standard can , and it adds almost no bulk to the can . The outside of the holder becomes the same temperature as the surroundings , but it 's thermal mass is low enough that your fingers do n't get burned picking it up.Here 's the important part : The can contents stay cold . The trick I 've found is to open the can and take a few swigs to the the fluid level down below the lip of the insulation . Otherwise , you 're losing insulation effectiveness . A 1/3 full can will stay cool longer than a mostly full can.If you like drinking a cold canned beverage , and want the cool to stay longer , I highly recommend this insulator.Once again : THIS COOLER IS AWESOME ! I give it a solid 5 stars rating .	1
This thing can keep a beer cold in the heat for hours . Seriously . It 's that good . it 's expensive , but if you like cold beer , invest in one . Especially if you 're the type of person who does n't finish the bottom of the beer can when it gets warm from taking too long to drink . This will solve that problem . I also noticed that since my beer stays cold so much longer , I do n't find myself drinking as much . This keeps me from getting too ... .. well you know .	1
I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this ... it looked like fun so I ordered it . I read the assembly directions , which said you need 3 people , but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone ... props to her cause I tried and nothing ... absolutely no movement whatsoever . I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily , but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open . The smell is obnoxious , which I hope will dissipate over time . All in all a fun purchase .	1
we love this thing ! ( tho i was afraid to assemble it from some of the reviews ! lol ) my mate and i put 'er togther in about 15 mins , took longer to get it out of the great packaging done my amazon than to assemble the romper and now we are using it a bit here and ther thru the day while the snow piles up out the door and loving it ! ( the cattys are having a bit of fun with it too ! )	1
If you want a mini-trampoline , I can recommend this one . It is built like a battleship , but assembly is non-trivial -- you need at least two adults ( the instructions recommend three ) to fight against the tension to pop everything in place . No big deal , but you are not going to put this together by yourself -- you can hurt yourself if something pops back due to the high tensions involved . The instruction book could use larger and clearer pictures . The legs screw on , and one of the legs in mine was slightly out-of-round , making for some stiff turning , but I got it on . There is an 800 number to call the manufacturer for any problems . I did n't need to call . We like this mini-trampoline .	1
This trampoline is giving me energy . It is great , sturdy , relatively easy to assemble ( by a man ) . It does not make noise when jumped on it . Great one ! !	1
I bought this trampoline for my kids to jump on when they are going crazy in the house but it 's not nice enough to go outside . For that purpose it works well . It 's not the perfect trampoline but I 'm glad I purchased it . The main difference between this and other trampolines is that this is based on rubber bands ( wide , strong ones ) instead of springs.The main things I like about this : ===========================* Build quality was a little surprisingly good . Everything seems pretty sturdy . * This is not just quiet , it 's silent . It makes no noise whatsoever while my kids jump on it . I was not looking forward to hearing squeaky springs all the time while my kids jump . So nice to have some peace and quiet . * Assembly was pretty quick and easy . There is one step where it is nice/necessary to have someone else hold one side while you do the other . The tension is a little scary at that point but then it pops into place and it 's done . I also messed it up because I put too many bands between two of the legs ( make sure there are 5 bands between each pair of legs before the last stage in frame assembly ) . I threaded a rope under and pulled and was able to get it over . * This trampoline is very lightweight . Easy to move around . I would have liked some fold-in legs or something . These legs screw in but you ca n't have everything.Things I do n't like : ===============* It 's not very bouncy . That 's my main issue with it . I 'm quite certain that spring-based trampolines are bouncier . Not a problem because it 's just for burning little kids ' energy but I was expecting something a little more elevating . Just be aware that this trampoline has a bit of a tendency to suck your bounce . Probably that 's good for working out . * This trampoline has a maximum weight of 200 pounds . I weigh 180ish so I 'm under but I still pretty much leave this to my kids . Not so much for big people . If you are a little 115 pound woman ( or you want it for kids ) this is a great trampoline . A burly 6 foot tall man , not so much . * When it 's on the floor it 's fine and flat . But when you put it up it changes from a ring to kind of a saddle shape . It easy twists back to the way you want it . Just be aware of that tendency . It 's not a problem once you know about it . * This trampoline stinks to high heaven . There 's some kind of really stinky lubricant in it . When I first opened it up I could n't keep it in the house for a couple of days because of the smell . It has been getting better every day but I 've had it two weeks and there 's still some stank . A temporary issue but one to be aware of . The first few days of use you will need noseplugs .	1
Very low impact on joints . I jog in place on it and bounce as well . It helps with balance by causing the brain to constantly adjust in keeping balance . This is important because this stimulates the growth hormone in the brain which helps the body recover and stay young !	1
UPDATE 11-12 : The trampoline still has a solid base and solid legs . We take it out periodically and jump away . The blue outer vinyl band looks a little worse each time but it is almost 10 years old . The fact that the basic trampoline structure is as solid and sturdy as the first time we used it is a testament to the durability . ***************************UPDATE 9-09 : My son is now 10 and I have a 5 yr-old daughter . This trampoline has lasted through tons of use . We continue to find fun things to do with it . We have used it on the end of a dock to jump into water . It has been part of 'obstacle ' courses . It is great for exercise and balance . The only thing that has given a little is the blue outer ring . Not a big issue but with multiple children using it for over 6 years , there are some tears to the vinyl . Nothing a little duct tape wo n't fix ! The trampoline base has no signs or wear or deterioration and the legs are solid and straight . ***************************I bought this for my `` just-turned '' four-year-old son who , like most boys , loves to jump on the sofa , the bed and anything that looks a little bouncy.It was easy to set up ( it says you need three adults but my husband and I did it easily ) . It appears well crafted and durable -- time will tell.The directions say that it is good for up to 200 lbs.My 37 lb son had a lot of fun jumping right away , although he did not jump as high as one thinks of with a trampoline . But for a small , indoor trampoline , I do n't think you want your children flying too high . I also think that as his weight and ability increase , he will get more bounce out of it.My biggest reasons for buying it are the safety ( no springs , padded edge ) and the size . I can easily remove the feet and slip it under a bed.On a really hot day , we can still burn off extra energy inside.We put a chair at the edge ( turned around ) and he then had a handle to hold while jumping.Safety is a big factor with any toy that increases the movement of your child so we went over all the safety rules before he took one step on . I think that any toy is as safe as its surroundings , supervision and appropriate use.We also have the Jump-o-lene ( an inflatable jumping toy ) . Although we enjoy that as well , it takes up a lot of room and requires a lot of push to gain any bounce . I am hoping this is the next step up in strengthening leg muscles and increasing one , and two footed coordination .	1
The assembly was relatively easy . It does however stink to high-heaven until you air it out . We left it outside overnight , and by the next morning one side had a rust stain on the blue cover . I do n't know how that happened , but oh well . My daughter likes it , and does use it frequently . It is a bit small , so you must put it somewhere with at least 3 feet perimeter for safety . I still recommend it despite the horrible smell .	1
Got this to try and get the kids a little more active . They use it randomly when in the living room and watching TV ... build quality is good , assembly was done by myself - though slightly tricky to & # 34 ; unfold & # 34 ; the unit with all the tension on it and make sure the blue cover was on correctly . The legs screw right in easily . Seems well built . No spring design which I like , less stuff to break or scrape your feet on .	1
I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews , I had my dad and brother help , turned out not needed , one helper would have been enough , as long as you take your time , and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started , recomend assembling on a flat hard surface , and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together , make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems , would buy again	1
I purchased this originally to use in my home gym . I wish I could say that that is what it is used mostly for , but I ca n't . This is the perfect size to have in a home gym or to be used by toddlers and small children . I 'd be careful if using it for toddlers since it does n't have a hold bar or a net . If you use it on a carpeted area or grass , as I do , you probably wo n't have a problem . It is also very durable . I have a toddler and a preschooler . They use it more then I do and It has survived for almost 2 years unscathed .	1
My son who skateboards and bikes a lot comes with knee injury every few days . We bought this and it has helped us a lot from worrying about him . I have seen him falling a few times and he is not complaining which is really good . I would strongly recommend for boys who bikes/scooter/skate on roads and is worth more than what we would have spent on his doctor trips .	1
However did I survive without all this stuff , but given youngest grandson 's first attempts at riding a bike , a good purchase ! Matches the Razor helmet well ! Cool means they 'll more likely wear it when you 're not standing over them ! !	1
Good protection when using the skates as well as any outdoor equipment such as skate boarding . I would recommend this product	1
These fit a 6 and 8 year old very well . They offer great protection and will be used with biking and a Razor scooter . I recommend , would buy again , and I hope this helps someone .	1
Fit my big 6 year old quite nicely . They are bulky , but seem to do the job without limiting mobility .	1
These pads offer good protection . It does not have the sock like material that covers the whole knee or elbow but the Velcro does the job pretty well and offers better ventilation . The only shortcoming is the Velcro for the knees . It seems a bit short for the top strap . I measure the maximum it can fit 10cm above the knee is a circumference of 42 cm . I think that is a important point to note when purchasing this item . Other areas should fit well as the Velcro is long enough..	1
After reading the other reviews , I thought these would work perfectly for my 4 and 5 year old children . I was wrong ! They are huge ! They kept falling down , and the kids were n't the least bit interested in wearing them , and they are truly very safety conscious . After realizing they were way too big for them , I tried them on , and they fit me ! They are really nice knee pads , but definitely not for little kids . The elbow pads could probably work for knee pads for them , if you do n't care about elbow pads . I wish I had only bought one pair instead of two . I will say they are priced well , though , as long as they fit !	1
These pads can take on a 9 year old boy any day- now getting him to wear them regularly- that 's another story .	1
They fit perfectly . I 'm a 5'3 & # 34 ; woman who is thin and the knee pads are wonderful . I do n't use the elbow pads .	1
These are comfortable for your kids , and will do a good job of preventing injury . Too bad more parents do n't think to use them . I guess it does n't occur to them that bones can break . Anyhow , these are good .	1
My daughter hates wearing this stuff when she 's riding a bike ( I do n't blame her ) but she admits that it has saved her from a few scrapes and cuts .	1
Bought these for my son when he was learning to use roller blades . They are comfortable and can fit many sizes . I would n't get them for kids under 50lbs because they can only get so small , and i think at 50lbs these would n't sag and you could get them to fit snug enough . These would be too big for my 4yo who is only 35 lbs . My son says they 're comfy and overall we 're very happy with this purchase .	1
have a grand daughter who is not yet a balanced on her bike as she should be so protection is necessary , these do the job.delivered quickly	1
I complained when I saw only 2 pads but upon closer look , they were not the same size . So doing some actually thinking , I took the package apart and lo and behold , there were 4 nested in two pairs . They are small but should fit up to a typical 12 year old . Quality is only OK , but a good deal for the price . They are not real comfortable as I would have expected with gel pads , but fit is OK . I suspect they will chafe with long wear , but I expect they will be fine for my requirements .	1
I bought these pads for my 8 year old . They fit him well and protect his knees/elbows well . They are n't the highest quality pads I 'd say , but they get the job done.If nothing else , get these pads to save skinned/scraped knees and elbows for your little riders !	1
They perform as described , serve their function , are not unattractive , and I would purchase from this line again . Good decision .	1
These are great compared to the toys I 've seen elsewhere . Fit my 5 year old great for skate boarding or bike riding . Others I 've seen were either too small or too big , these are just right .	1
The other kids pads just seem like toys . The elastic on these is thick and the pads have gel on the inside . Not the nicest looking set , but more durable and functional than the alternatives .	1
Unless you are an adult the size and weight of an average 10 year old girl , do n't buy these for yourself . Luckily , I have a kid who can use them since they were too small for me . However , they are well constructed and she seems very comfortable wearing them for several hours at a time . They have n't been tested in an actual scootering fall yet , but by looking at them I am fairly certain they can take quite a hit and keep elbows and kneecaps from serious impact damage . At least I hope so . Also they are very cool to look at being deep black with orange buttons .	1
Bought these for an 8 year old .They fit well and offer good protection.They would fit a wide range of ages .	1
My biggest concern while ordering this item had been the size . Most pads seem to fall on the small side . My son has already outgrown two sets of those , and he is only 4'5 '' tall . Fortunately , this set is reasonably large , enough to accommodate him for two or three more years at least .	1
They fit both my small 8 year-old and 5 year-old grandkids nicely . They seemed to be well-padded and fit for the job of pprotecting their skinny joints . Price was right . They both liked the looks , and stood about posturing their superpowers .	1
Great pod , easy to wear , very stylish . fits nicely on 8 yr old , and room to grow . Had razor pad before and they were pain to put and remove . Also the velcro as horrible on razor . Mongoose is awesome !	1
My kid feel on the very first day of using these and they protected his elbow from scratches . Light weight enough and easy to to wear means that he has no problem putting them on , and he likes wearing them .	1
There is nothing spectacular about these pads , light , small , and the quality seems okay . I would n't expect them to last under heavy abuse , but for added protection for a young kid that 's not shredding I think they are fine .	1
I am an average size woman , dress size 6-8 ( 5'6 '' and 130 # ) and these fit me with no trouble at all and some room to spare . They would easily fit someone larger too ( but probably not a large muscular male -- -he might be able to wear the kneepads as elbow pads though ! ) . They have stretch velco straps so the size is adjustable . The velcro straps are comfortable , not so tight that they cut off circulation . I like them a LOT better than my old ones , which were not straps but stretchy elastic and hard to get on and off , especially if one was sweating ! These are simple , fast and easy to put on and take off . These seem well-made ; I 've had them for about a month ( with usage 3 times a week , for biking ) and I expect them to last a long while -- -- but even if they did n't , at this price it 's affordable to replace them . They probebly would work equally well for skating . They do n't hamper one 's movement -- -when wearing them , I pretty much forget that they 're there . For the price , these ca n't be beat ! I 'm very pleased with the purchase .	1
Was having a hard time finding something with good quality for my kids to use when riding their bikes . These works really well as they are easy to put in and take off . Most important they stay in during a crash and protect well . Also , they do not restrict movement .	1
We bought these for our daughter while learning to ride her bike without training wheels . They are a bit big for a small 8 year old , but they stay on fine - just a little bulky . We had a cheap Barbie set of pads that came with some plastic roller skates , but they were hardly padded at all . These gel pads are well padded and comfortable . They go on easy with the velcro wrap arounds . Very helpful to prevent scrapes and cuts while learning to ride !	1
I purchased 2 sets based on all the reviews on these . I am very happy with them but they are a tad big for my kids still age 3 and 6 . I know they will grow into them but they still wear them and they never fall off . They have a really nice feel to them and the gel seems to work good . They do come with its own carry net to store them and that is a bonus . I would recommend these to anyone .	1
These looks more steady and they fit perfectly for different ages . I recommend these for any one greater than 6+ till 15 or so .	1
Bought these for my son who is 7 and just got into mountain biking with me . They fit well and look like he can get a few years out of them . I ride an old school Mongoose hardtail so he feels cool riding with dad with his Mongoose pads . He also said they are very comfortable to wear . Lets see after his first spill . Great price for under $ 13 and free shipping .	1
nice heavy duty lock I like a protective sleeve on it exactly as advertised I would recommend this product to all	1
Any chain can be cut , but it takes bolt cutters , something the average bike thief does n't normally carry . Bike thiefs do carry cable cutters : very affordable , easy to use , fit in your pocket and easily work on 90 % of the anti-theft devices.This chain is well made and not so heavy it is like carrying around an anchor , completely defeating the benefit of having a light weight bicycle . Otherwise why not get a cheap beater bike no one would steal and a cheap cable lock thief 's would n't bother to cut ? Overall this configuration would weigh less and far less would be at risk.The price on this lock is unbelievably low compared to the competition , but it is real .	1
I researched bike locking devices , and they can all be removed in high crime areas . This chain and lock are okay , and would provide a god deterrent , but if they want your bike , nothing is going to stop them .	1
Compared to the other chain locks that I 've seen , Kryptonite or what have you , this is BY FAR the cheapest and most epic chain for the money . It is HEAVY and I would n't think anything could cut through them unless you 're a fireman with some epic hydraulic jaws on hand . Though heavy it leaves me feeling safe that my bike is secure and unlikely to be stolen in its entirety haha . Definitely go for this one folks !	1
That 's a good thing . Once wrapped around your bike and a pole/tree/whatever , a casual thief will just move on to an easier target .	1
Feels solid , does its job . Pretty easy setup . The tire size was a bit annoying to calculate , but that 's not the manufacturers fault .	1
I purchased one a couple of years ago the the wires got tangled a coupld of months back . The wire broke and there is no way to fix it . I bought these that are identical to the old one because I like the scan feature , the large numbers in the panel and the small size . It works well . If I can say something back is that the mounting only allows a handle bar position and it does not sit very tight on the base . My handle bar is not very large and even being small it takes space there . I also have my headlights in there and of course those have to be a the front . Sometimes , it will stop measuring if you touch it forward . It will not come off since there is a plastic stopper at the end but it will move out of the sensors and stop reading your ride . It has happened with me several times	1
I bought this only for the odometer function . I just wanted to know how far I was riding each day . I usually ride only two different routes that can not be verified by driving my car over the same route . ( dedicated bike trails ) . It is really not a bad unit for the price . I do n't need something that will last for years . Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went . Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca . and I was riding 12 miles ( assumed it was 10 ) . So if you are looking to buy one , just do it . It is very inexpensive and will probably last a long time if you are careful with it ..	1
Easy to install , easy to read and easy to reset . It goes well on our 1982 Schwinn Tandem . Buttons are easy to use .	1
The only thing I do n't like about this bike computer is that the red outline blocking the function symbol .	1
This computer has been on my bike for almost 2,000 miles and it 's still going strong . It seems to be very accurate . Just read the directions and you should n't have any problems . The only thing I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself , rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark , and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need . But if you 're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips , then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring .	1
Bought this unit for my 8 year old son . Works fine . Not a lot of bells and whistles but you really do n't need more than what is offered on this computer .	1
I think this is a nice unit . I have 2 others . With a combined 3000 + miles . I get the batteries from Amazon also for like $ 1 or $ 2	1
THIS LITTLE GUY WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU HAVE READ THE INSTRUCTION FIRST AND MAKING SURE THE SPOKE SENSER IS LESS THAN A HALF A INCH AWAY WHEN IT COME CLOSE TO THE RECEIVER IT WILL WORK JUST FINE , I TOOK IT FOR A 17 MILE BIKE TRIAL AND IT NEVER SKIPPED A BEAT .	1
Bought 2 . 1 for a 26 & # 34 ; and 2nd for a 24 & # 34 ; bicycle . A little tricky to set the wiring and get the computer to exact tire size for accuracy but once done it 's done . Display is easy to read . Did a 25 miler and compared units on both sized bikes . The was a slight mileage difference of about 1/2 a mile so I 'll tweak the 24 & # 34 ; size a little more . Over all a good buy !	1
Bought this inexpensive bike computer at our local military store for just under ten dollars ; it 's available at WalMart for about the same price . The unit I have has a mostly red face [ the case color ] , otherwise , everything else is as described.I chose this Schwinn 12-function computer over the Cateye Velo 5-function computer [ the only other option at the military store ] mostly because of the display size ... the Schwinn 's is larger , and much more readable for most functions . I use reading glasses , and was concerned about being able to read the small Cateye display . As it turns out , it 's difficult to interpret the `` Speed Tendency '' function while cycling [ it uses a small bicycle in the top left corner of the display ... its tiny wheels turn `` forward '' to show accelerations , and `` backward '' to show deceleration ] . All other info is easy to read & interpret.You need to set in wheel circumference ... there is a table provided , which includes the standard wheel sizes . If you make an error , you can remove the battery to zero out the info , and start again.The components seem to be sturdy enough ... the handlebar mounting bracket looks to be slightly redesigned [ it is different from the operating manual illustrations ] . The bracket 's computer retention clip is still a bit puny . The unit comes with thin white zip ties ; they are difficult to cinch up tightly , so I recommend you use your own.I 'll comment again later if I have problems with longevity . For now , it 's a good value , and works well .	1
Useful little device and multiple functions . MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE PAPER WORK ! ! ! ! ! so if you get a different dimension tire , the codes are in the little booklet ! ! ! !	1
I already had one , so , I knew how to program this device . Once you get familiar with its functions , it is easy to use . It is also quick to install .	1
We bought two - one for my bike and another for my so n't bike . My son 's unit works fine , but my unit quit working within two months . The part that goes on to the fork ( sensor ) is n't sensing any more . I know , it is n't expensive , but I hate to throw away the entire unit when the real computer is doing fine.The product is adequate for what it is intended for . It has more features than I was hoping for when I bought it . Installation is easy . Learning to use it is a little bit challenge due to the poor manual , but you 'll quickly figure it out.I will certainly recommend it , but be prepared for it to die prematurely . In my case it died just before I was to venture on a training ride - not a good timing . You see , I depend heavily on this and my turn lists to figure out the training ride route . Without the distance assistance , I had to constantly check the street signs.I am seriously thinking of buying the same model to replace the broken one .	1
It amazes me that people on here spend $ 10 on a bike computer and then complain that it seems cheaply made . You do n't get a Cray supercomputer for $ 10 folks . It does exactly what it says , is easy to install and probably not going to ever get stolen because really , what can the black market value of it be , fifty-cents . It 's featherweight , easy to read , auto on/off ( really important ) and has a nice scan feature where it will cycle through the various functions continuously . I just generally leave it on speed/odo since my average speed usually reminds me how inadequate I am as a cyclist.About setting wheel size . For those that are absolutely anal about accuracy , borrow someone 's GPS and use it to calibrate the wheel size setting . The 2155 for a 700 size worked fine for me , a little off compared to the GPS but since I do n't see myself going for a bicycle land speed record , do n't really care that it 's a little off . However , was bored and so started changing the size setting by a couple numbers at a time and now have it matching the GPS exactly.One note of caution to mountain bikes and hybrid riders with suspensions - allow some slack across the suspension area of the front forks or you 'll snap the wire the first time you compress/decompress the suspension hard . Oh and if you are old like me and ca n't see worth a darn , get some powerful readers to follow the instructions ! They 're are either making install instructions smaller everyday or my eyes are getting worse faster than I thought .	1
Put on a 29er mountain bike without an issue . Very light weight and OK quality . I purchased this only because I like the design . The others were just ugly . It works fine and closely matches my RunKeeper App for mileage . Not the best quality but I 'm sure it will last a little while .	1
I 've had one of these for about six months and just ordered another from Amazon . This little computer is accurate , reliable and easy to use.The display shows your speed in large letters and has a selectable smaller readout for whatever function you choose . I wind up having it show speed and time all the time . If you 're satisfied with a simple , cheap speedometer and only occasionally use the other functions , this is the one.Here are some hints that fairly eliminate most of the small complaints.1 . Install the magnet close to the wheel 's hub and adjust it ( twist the sensor in ) so that the magnet passes as close as possible without touching.2 . Remove the computer when the bike is not in use . It has a quick release ; store it inside or in your pocket and the battery will last.3 . Leaving it outside in direct sunlight may cause a dark splotch on the screen . This is normal for led displays , and goes away in a few seconds . Also see hint # 2.4 . Read the manual to learn how to reset it ( which buttons to hold down ) , and to calibrate it for your wheel size.The only issues I 've had : the buttons will eventually get some `` play '' if you use them a lot and become contrary , and I need to be careful to secure it firmly in the quick release mount ( so that it does n't fall out when I hit a bump ) .	1
I ride my bike to and from work at least 3-4 days a week . When I started it was very rough . I was in pain from riding more than a half hour at a time . Since I bought this seat , I have been able to ride much longer . It does n't completely remove the pain from riding long distances/times , but it certainly helps . I have used it on several 50+ mile trips , and it has held up very well .	1
yeah this will work to help soften the seat especially if you are a intermittent to casual rider and do not ride enough to get toughened against the seat for those longer rides like maybe when you were a little younger or did n't have some form of arthritis to deal with as an example.There are several of these types of cushions around from other companies and in different materials but Schwinn has been around awhile and this is gel instead of memory foam .	1
I 've had one of these now for 18 years . Used this in backpacking in west texas . Great for night light .	1
Great for an emergency backup light . The only problem is if it 's stored in exstream heat the candle will deform .	1
i realy like this lantern . it gets very hot so be careful . i would definitely buy it again . it gives off adequate light for a tent or inside a car .	1
It has everything . Stop watch , date , light etc ... .Seems like water proof very durable and battery lasts forever.Tried other watch but they were bulky , heavy , battery life is crappy , bands dont last a year.I had all different expensive watches but they died on me with all different reasons.This is the only watch that still running .	1
I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym . This one does the job very well at its kind price ( can find at a cheaper price online ) and looks good as well . It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face . I have a relatively thin wrist ( Sz 6.5 ) so it looks proportional . I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway . It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak . It 's extremely easy to change the battery too . Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back , take out the watch inside ( it 's one piece ) , open it by opening four corners , swap the battery , then put it back together . Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch , you will figure out easily.Overall , I 'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter . But no problem reading the time .	1
I think Casio under prices this watch . I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite . The low profile makes it wearable every day . It says it is water resistant , but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues . The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it . The watch is very user friendly for first timers . You can not beat a watch like this , especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches .	1
Got it for my bf and he likes it . The lap feature in particular is nice . Other than that it 's just a good , basic watch . The watch face was a little smaller than I expected , but nothing wrong with that .	1
The band on this watch is very small . I can barely get it on . Other than that it seems fine .	1
I use the watch often and it functions well . The band is a thin flimsy plastic BUT strong enough that it has n't broken on several work activities . I have worn in the pouring rain and had it on when it was -5 F ... and still works well . I paid about $ 10 and I would consider getting it again !	1
I have been wearing this for about 3 weeks now nonstop and for the price you cant beat it . accurate time , has stop watch , alarm , beep at the top of the hour ( can be turned off ) , 24hr time and 12hr time , the only thing i wish it had is better night time lighting .	1
My dad has an older one that is close to 50 years old and still work great . This thing appears to be built the same . looking forward to many years of use !	1
Forget propane . In a real world long term crisis or emergency , propane will quickly be hard to come by . This stove uses Coleman Premium Fuel OR regular unleaded gasoline . Those supplies will last much longer . This thing will boil water in a flash or let you cook anything from stew to heavy game entrees . Rugged , compact and wind proof - I strongly recommend this product for your emergency preparedness supplies .	1
Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent , scratch , get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit . On the other hand , properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost . The white gas can be stored for years before using . Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots . I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones . It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out ! I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous , tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect . By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some . These are the good ones .	1
It does what you need it to do and it does it well . My only gripe is that the second burner is underpowered when using the primary . The thing is , that 's ok because the stove really is n't big enough for two vessels at once anyway . Stick with Coleman fuel when possible to keep the amount of soot down . Unleaded gas works great , too , but it 's dirty .	1
If you are in the market for a two burner stove , do n't cheap out , buy the & # 34 ; Powerhouse & # 34 ; . It is a little larger and it puts out more BTUs . I wish it were made of a thicker gauge metal , but it is still a sturdy stove . If you buy the standard two burner stove , I think you will be disappointed .	1
Wow ! Really does all that they claim ! I highly recommend this pen refill . Can be used all by itself , right out of the package in a pinch .	1
I got tired of ball pens that skip a little when you first start writing , so I got this and it works just as expected . First time , wet or dry - upside down or horizontal .	1
The pen is great . It fits in that little pocket of your jeans . I was never really sure what the purpose of that little pocket was until I got my spacepen . Now I know . Refill lasts me almost a year and I use it daily for quick notes and sometimes meeting minutes .	1
Everyone covets my space pen when I whip it out of my pocket . Some even try to steal it . When they try , I stab them in the eye with it . Needless to say , that 's why I need a replacement refill .	1
The original pressurized refill . This comes with a small cap on the back to take it up to the size of standard Parker refills . I 'm currently using it in a Karas Kustoms Retrakt pen body , and absolutely adore the combination .	1
I 've carried a small ( 4 '' ) extend-able sized fisher pen for about 15 years . The ink starts rolling smoothly w/o any smudges . There is a review saying they smudge w/ water , but my papers do n't usually come in contact w/ water , so I do n't know ... . I notice w/ the parker pen that the first word has a big glob -- that 's never the case w/ these .	1
I have used these in my Parker pens for years . They work in the freezing weather the desert heat and the Florida Everglades . Sure they take a little break and to write smoothly but once they 're going they keep going for a long time . If you need to write upside down on wet paper and keep your notes permanently look no further than this refill .	1
This is a perfect fit for the Fisher Space Pen for about half the price that you would pay if you went to their website and ordered one . RDE	1
This is an old , old cartridge and , by modern standards , is outdated . Yet I keep going back to it and makers like Benchmade have made it the refill of choice for their pens ( my personal favorite and I have many ) . Why ? It gets the job done.I love how rollerballs write . Smooth , easy , and some now use ink that does n't smear much at all . But you ca n't write on an angle or upside down ... sounds silly , right ? I agree ... except when you need to write something on an angle or upside down , it is usually important information as otherwise you wouldnt be doing it . Having a pen not be able to finish the last few digits of that phone number you are writing on a pad of paper you are holding to the wall with your knee is ... infuriating ... especially given it is probably an important number . So the pressured Fisher cartridges make a big win here.For a ballpoint , these are smooth . Some rollerballs are smoother ( the famous G2 arguably is ( great smoothness ) ) , but at the expense of smearing and mini-breaks in terms of the continuity of ink . So it 's a trade off . Which do you like ? I use both ... between a Space Pen and a G2 , you can write on anything.In terms of extreme heat or cold , these do better than most . For most people , that probably is not an issue , but still a nice addition.In terms of longevity , these really outlast the thin refills . At six bucks , they should ... if you are tired of going through Cross refills at a rabid rate , these will last 3-4x longer.But where these shine the most is something Fisher themselves do not advertise for reasons I will never understand . The impact resistance is exceptional . Multiple drops of a heavier pen directly on the point will not cause a change in ink flow . Most other pens will start releasing more or less ink to a point in which it becomes a nuisance to useless . While writing in outer space is something I will never experience , my incredible lack of coordination means dropping pens is something I am a master of . These are really impressive.So is this the best refill made ? Not necessarily , as great as it may be . Your application will determine what is best . Today 's market is characterized by high-performance writing instruments at a cost that is incredibly low ... gel , ink , ballpoint , rollerball , and experimental pens all offer different features and one person may fall in love with one more than the others . Luckily , this Fisher refill is not very expensive relative to other refills and so IMHO it is worth buying one to see what you like .	1
I 've had 2 of these now because they 're just too much fun . I kept one at home and one at work ( I work with middle school students at a summer camp/program ) and both broke but regardless I still love this thing . Mine at least have been pretty easy to aim as it is pretty consistent . It is a little tough to pull but should n't be a problem for anyone older than 8 . In high school one of my teachers had one just to shoot students who were falling asleep . Pure fun for any age ! I think their average life is about a year and then the & # 34 ; bag & # 34 ; starts to rip . Assembly was quick and easy , it 's just a fun product .	1
If you have the extra money ... buy this for the fun of it . It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood ; one of their magicians used it in his act , and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a & # 34 ; pop & # 34 ; ( thats obvious ) when you pull back to shoot it , but if you 're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe , fun , easy to assemble , kids and adults will enjoy .	1
The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20 ' or so . We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit ! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own , but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone ( young and old ) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up ( Note : No animals were harmed in the writing of this review : - ) Recommended !	1
Gave this to our son as a gift , was the hit of the party . has a good 3 hours of fun . Only lasted a few days , but was well worth it . The plastic film will separate after extended use . This thing packs a punch !	1
I 've taken this to work , outside , to the beach etc . I ca n't get enough of this thing ! When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it . Since he ca n't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him ! I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the & # 34 ; thump & # 34 ; was what was causing her hair to jump ! ! ! ! ! This is even fun for my 4 year old , she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she ca n't pull it back all the way and still aim . Great fun ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Just came today . I did n't get a chance to try it out yet but that 'll be this weekend . This thing is big and made in the good old USA . I had a single mantle Coleman years ago but the ex wife got it . I burned regular unleaded gas in that one years ago and it was n't recommended , but it worked fine and never had a problem with it . I 'll burn good old regular unleaded in this too .	1
These Coleman lanterns are incredible values . I 've had this model for 20 years or more . As a kid , my family had a similar model that is still going strong . There is n't anything advanced about these ; no electronics , no batteries . They just work . I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years , usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke . At only a few dollars for two mantles , it 's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output . On high , this will light up your entire camp site.I ca n't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used . As long as you get a new unit , you can not go wrong with this lantern . You 'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids .	1
tips:1. the lantern burns brighter on white Coleman fuel2 . gasoline is A LOT more dirty then Coleman fuel so try to pre-filter the gas before use.3.gasoline will gum up the lantern in storage VERY quickly , so dump out the gasoline after your use.4.if you burn gasoline a lot make sure to pack an extra generator ( a lantern part ) because they tend to plug up much quicker then with Coleman fuel . the generator is cleanable if soaked in parts cleaner or `` seafoam '' .5. if you need `` directional light '' cut a thick foil pie pan to the same dimensions as the globe , but make it only wrap half way around the globe ( it will stay in place by being pinched between the shade and the mantel metal bottom . this will give you about 200 watts of directed light ... .perfect for Sasquatch hunting or signaling the mother-ship.that being said ; these are great lanterns and simple enough to repair and pass down to your kids ... .a rare product characteristic nowadays .	1
Good quality . This one seems built to last just like my old ones that my dad had when he was a kid and are still working today .	1
This full-sized lantern is a good choice for a shelter-in-place ( SIP ) scenario or campsite . Backpackers or people walking to a bug out location ( BOL ) will probably want the much smaller/lighter eXponent lantern.This lantern lights easily and is quite bright . I find the lighting holes acommodate the long grill lighters if you get the lighter angled up-down enought . Remember that using Coleman fuel instead of unleaded will extend the life of the generator . Use of unleaded exclusively may be a false economy , depending the price of ( non-gasohol ) unleaded and generators in your neck of the words . Coleman fuel will also be considerably less stinky while running and particularly when starting and shutting off.The lantern does not come with a case but you can make one out of a pickle bucket . Line the inside with larger bubblewrap to absorb shock . There will be enough space inside for your long lighter , spare mantles , funnel/filler etc .	1
I wrote some pretty scathing reviews on the dual fuel gas stoves , but I got ta tell you ... this lantern is real nice . It casts a nostalgic amber hue across the campsite , unlike the bright , in your face LEDs that are so common . Keep the LEDs inside the tent , where they belong , this lamp is made to be outdoors and it is incredibly efficient . We burned it for four hours each night for 2 nights and I still had almost half a tank of coleman fuel left . Meanwhile , my neighbor was scrambling for D-cell batteries , LOL . Is a bit unusual to prepare the mantles and light the fire in this day of point and click , but , take a moment and relish the ( sometimes ) greatness of simplicity ... this product gets the job done . This is what camping is all about ...	1
Always get a dual fuel lantern if you are serious about using one . Makes for a nice option when you might be out of batteries or whatever . This is well made lantern , I bought the hard case to go with it . Great for camping or when the power goes out .	1
I have one of these already so I am a repeat customer and happy ! I dont ' need to say anymore except look out for the small version of the & # 34 ; Premium & # 34 ; lantern	1
Coleman lanterns are a must , not just for camping but for loss of power . You can use Colman fuel or unleaded gasoline ( the Colman fuel burns brighter ) I bought this to replace the one I had for 30 years . The old one did n't berak someone stole it or I would still have it for years . This lantern is very similar , it is a little easier to operate and my old one was green . Aside from that it is the same reliable product .	1
We just used our Coleman two mantle dual fuel power house lantern on our last camping trip and we absolutely LOVED IT ! ! It was super bright , burned all night long with no problems and was so quiet . I was thinking it was going to be loud and hiss like the lanterns I was used to having when we were kids camping ... ..nothing like those . They were great too by the way but this one was the real deal . I would recommend buying the case to bring and carry your lantern because the glass globe is fragile if not stored and carried properly . The case that was recommended by Amazon for this lantern fit the lantern just right and was perfect for storing it in . We packed all of our camping supplies in the back of our truck and no harm came to the lantern at all in the storage case ! ! I would highly recommend ! ! !	1
Coleman the only way to go with camp lights . If you seek the best this item is it . No competition .	1
Coleman Two-Mantle Dual Fuel Powerhouse Lanternwow this lantern is as bright as a cars headlights , i used it while camping recently , it was on full strength for 3 nights from dark ( 6pm ) till midnight and when i got home there was still 1-2 hours left in it ! i 'm getting the dual fuel 533 stove now , i hope its as radical as this is .	1
Burns a long , long time and on its brightest setting will scorch your retinas . I 've put this thing to hard use in the Mojave and it works well . Use Coleman fuel unless you 're in a pinch because it burns much , much cleaner .	1
I have had a coleman lantern for years , back before they were dual fuel even , I always burned dual fuel or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case , an amber glass globe , and a spark starter so i did n't have to look for matches . if you 're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case . These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern	1
Just make sure to buy lots of mantels . You do n't want to be without a couple of replacements when you need this . Also buy the one that comes with the case . You will want the case to keep stored or for travel . I wish that I had gotten the one with the case .	1
Tried and true old school lantern . always works and always ready for action . Only thing I would change ( and have ) is put a yellow globe on it so it does n't draw every bug for miles .	1
This is my third Victorinox Swiss Army knife . ( I lost the first and still have the second . I only bought this because I wanted more tools ) . These knives are incredibly durable . I 've never had one fail me . With some imagination , the tools can be used for many more things than their intended purpose . They are also much smaller and lighter than a Leatherman or similar tool , which makes them convenient to have on you at all times . They 're perfect for those moments when an unexpected need arises and you do n't have full size tools with you .	1
Great knife , pretty bulky but not as big as the swiss champ . Awesome tool , the quality is awesome and the perfect all around tool . seriously	1
I 've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years . My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic ' for over 20 of those years . I 've always been satisfied with the quality , and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel . This knife is no exception . Same fine quality . A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket , but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives . Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers . Of course you also have the available screwdrivers , as well as all the other features . It 's amazing how handy this knife has been . There have been times , when I do n't have the knife with me , that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task , and then , & # 34 ; Drats , I wish I had it with me. & # 34 ;	1
I know this is n't the biggest , most inclusive tool in Victorinox 's line up but before you scrunch up your face and say , `` Dat ai n't duh holy grail o ' swiss army knibes ! `` , just read my reasons.This tool has literally everything you need in a swiss army knife and none of the silly , gimmicks that you don't.It has all the tools I use regularly : screwdrivers , scissors , pliers , bladesAll the tools I use occasionally : awl , saws , filesA couple of tools that I use rarely : wood chisel , parcel hook ( which should be renamed `` boot lacer '' since it 's better used for tying/untying knots and lacing boots than carry tied parcels -- which no one sends anymore ) ... and NONE of the tools that I never use on a pocket knife : corkscrew ( truly ONLY Europeans would think this is a daily `` necessity '' ) ; clock ( watches and cellphones , thank you ) ; miniature magnifying glass ( if I 'm trying to make something look bigger , why do I want a TINY magnifier ? ! I 'd need a magnifier to see the magnifier ! ) ; flashlight ( seriousy ? ! How can I use the tool when the light I need to see by is IN the tool ? ! I can look at what I want to cut OR I can cut it -- but I ca n't do both at the same time ! ) ; hex drive w/bits ( I 'm just trying not to lose the toothpick , tweezers , or pin . I do n't want to keep up with screwdriver bits ! ) ; fish descaler ( Um ... pretty much any knife blade can take scales off a fish besides , I do n't want stinky fish scales in my swiss army knife ) ... .and I could go on but you get the point.I consider this to be at the top limit of size and weight for pocket carry . Now , I wear cargo pants most often and jeans pretty frequently too unless I 'm at work where I wear scrubs . I only wear slacks to church so I find carrying this Craftsman in my pocket to be no problem so far . It is only ONE layer thicker than the Victorinox-Swiss Army 53481 Deluxe Tinker Pocket Knife Knives , Swiss Army ( which I also own ) but you get FOUR more tools in it ! If you 're a desk jockey who wears slacks everyday , then you 'll probably want to use a belt pouch like theVictorinox Leather Large Clip Pouch Swiss Army Knife Pouches Black 33256to carry this . I actually bought my Craftsman on eBay and it came with this leather pouch and free shipping for less than the price of the knife alone on this website . If you 're a woman who carries a handbag , purse , or fanny pack everyday ; you really have almost no excuse not to carry one of these because you 'll hardly notice the weight at all . At 3-1/2 '' long , 1-1/8 '' tall , and 1-1/8 '' wide it 's slightly larger than a lipstick or mascara ; and at 5.6 oz it weighs less than 1/2 a pound ! Ladies , it wo n't buy you flowers ( but he does n't do that anyway , does he ) , but it wo n't fight you for the TV remote either . Keep one of these in your purse and you 'll only play the `` damsel in distress '' when you WANT to and not because you NEED to.The pliers on this knife are , of course , smaller than the pliers on my Leatherman Supertool ; however , the Leatherman is heavy and bulky enough that you must carry it in a belt pouch . It does n't lend itself to pocket carry ( except in the pocket of a large coat ) . So I find that I do n't really enjoy carrying my Leatherman . What good is a knife/tool if you do n't have it when you need it ? So I keep coming back to this Victorinox Craftsman.For the tool selection that you get for the size , weight , and price -- this is truly the holy grail of Swiss Army Knives ! Whether you 're working around the house , out at the campsite , on the job , or trying to get your Land Rover fixed in the middle of the Kalahari Desert ( OK , that last one might be a stretch ) -- I do n't think you 'll be disappointed in this knife ! If you are , hmmm ... .I do n't know ... there 's something wrong with you , I guess . LOL ! ( kidding ! ) This is just simply ... THE HOLY GRAIL of Swiss Army Knives ! Get it ! ( or you 're a punk ! )	1
Product arrived as described and well packaged . Works as intended . All edges very sharp . Movement of all items smooth . The only down side is that none of the blades or devices lock in place , but that is not unusual for this type of product . A great tool for emergency kits .	1
Everything I need for lighter home use , camping , hiking , glove box , etc . ( Too big to be my EDC , I prefer the Super Tinker for that ) . I have both the Fieldmaster and the Huntsman , and the only difference is the phillips screwdriver vs the corkscrew . You can not go wrong with a true Swiss Army knife as long as you pick a model that suits your needs.TIPS : -There 's a tiny hole under the phillips opening to add your own straight pin.-The hook is useful for pulling tent loops and stakes , hooking things through loops.-Reamer is great for punching belt loops , creating holes , getting out shoelace knots.-Be very careful with the saw - it is the sharpest tool I 've ever seen ! Useful for cutting twigs for marshmellow/hotdog cooking sticks , cutting cardboard.Highly recommended !	1
Great selection of tools that are sure to get you through everything from daily life to deep in a jungle survival .	1
My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer , you know the bulky model that had everything , and I love it , unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it , I was devestated , and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one , undertandably . Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK , this time its the Fieldmaster , I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy , the quality is still great , the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife ! .	1
Victorinox swiss army makes high quality knifes . I feel the fieldmaster model is the one with the best combination of tools . It is an every day care . I always have it in my pocket , and use it several times a day . I would not want to be with out it .	1
I buy this knife as a gift for my mom , she loves it . It is solid , handy and looks like good quality and will last long .	1
Needed a knife for my cub scout and after looking at the cub scout version of the swiss army knife decided on this one instead . Much better value , probably because it does n't have to have the scout logo upcharge on it . Wanted a knife without a corkscrew on it ( why bother for an 8 year old ! ) and this one fit the bill . He is delighted and I liked it so much I bought a second for my girl scout . Versatile and excellent quality . Not as heavy-duty as my leatherman but a great choice for a pocketnife .	1
The fieldmaster by Victorinox has all the blades I want in a knife and the quality one would expect from Victorinox . For those who do not know what the hook on the bottom is for ... it is for carrying a load with a cord handle so the cord wo n't cut into your hand , or grabbing the wire handle of a hot pot off a fire without burning yourself . This knife makes the crossover from woods to urban environment .	1
If you a guy that is handy and always working on something , or fixing something around the house you need one of these in your pocket . I am never without one . Like the old saying if I am wearing pants , they have a knife in the pocket , and this is my knife of choice .	1
Well , there is no much to say about this knife . Its robust , its reliable and its well known to everyone ) ) ) )	1
I 've had this exact knife ( ok , I think the hook is new ) for 30 years now -- and it 's still my goto pocketknife . In my opinion , this is the perfect mix of pocketknife tools . I 've used each of them many many times , on backpacking trips , around the house , car , everywhere . I had this long before leathermen became popular , and frankly , I never remember a time I wanted pliers while camping , so I 'd still pack this first today . Victorinox blades are outstanding , razor sharp and hard to dull . The saw can cut any branch up to 2 '' thick easily . The scissors are essential for a million things , and like the knives super sharp . The can opener can really open any can you need , albeit slowly . Of course , the bottle opener and screw drivers work well ( not so hard with those , eh ? ) The tweezers are essential for splinters . The toothpick is perfect when you need it ( and I 've actually never broken even a toothpick with all the many ones I own ) . The awl/knife is odd , never think you need one , but somehow keep using it . Long ago the classic swiss army pocket knife was this except with a corkscrew v. a phillips head ... we 'd go pretty far outta our way to find this one instead , because no one carried too many wine bottles while backpacking . Now I 've got the corkscrew one as well for city life . These days they have plenty of larger knives , but I 'm not sold on carrying one more thing than is on this knife . In short , when I 'm looking for the best single tool to have on me , this Fieldmaster is time tested perfection .	1
This one has the perfect set of tools , in my opinion . The scissors , most people will want . The Victorinox saw is outstanding . Be careful , as it will make quick work of your fingers ; it is very sharp and cuts aggressively . It is also good that the can opener and bottle opener are separate tools . The Victorinox can opener works wonderfully . Also , the can opener has a handy little screwdriver tip which can be used as a Philips screwdriver sometimes . The reamer is a lot more handy than you would think , though not as a reamer . I use it to change watch bands , as the sharp tip reaches in and releases the spring bars without too much fuss . The most used tool for me though is the large screwdriver tip on the bottle opener . The one disadvantage with this one is that it is starting to get a bit thick to carry in your pocket . A belt sheath would be more appropriate , if you can pull that off without feeling too geeky . ( Personally , I do n't care , hehehe )	1
The knife has a good selection of tools and I do n't think that it is too big to carry in your pocket . I look forward to carrying this for many years . I think that it will handle most situations . If size is an issue for you but you want a lot of functionality for the size , I would suggest considering a Leatherman Micra .	1
It is a tool that works.. I have several models of these knives.. I use them a lot , they are a tool that works.. Never worn one out yet , so who knows how long they will last ... I have the smallest one and the largest one , plus several in between . I like them .	1
I somehow always manage to lose my swiss army knives , probably because i 'm always using them because they are so useful . This knife came with great tools , and had the perfect size . But of course i lost it like every other swiss army knife i 've ever owned .	1
I picked this multitool because it has the best combination of features for me : I really like having a saw , phillips head and scissors . All of the tools are well designed . The saw cuts aggressively in both directions and all of the blades came paper slicing sharp and are easy to restore . It is also surprisingly lightweight for its size ; unlike Leathermans which are also great but for different reasons . If I had any complaints it would be that some of the tools are slightly difficult to access ( particularly the hook - which I do n't use anyways ) and I think that there is space for one more tool on the bottom .	1
I was given one of these trailers by my son and daughter-in-law this past Christmas . Our grandson is now old enough so I took him for a little ride yesterday , he loved it ! Yes , I 'm sure you can spend a lot more money and get a better one , but this works just fine . Easy to put together , easy to attach to my bike ( I attached it to an old mtn bike instead of my road bike ) attaches very easy and seems very secure.Pulls easily enough and holds Will in place ... what more can you ask for for this price ?	1
PROS : Light , easy and very quick to get attached and ready to ride ! Easy access to storage area and opening and closing cover.CONS : My only complaint is the restraint system . It feels kid of cheap and looks uncomfortable for the kids riding . Straps need improvement.Overall I am glad about this purchase . Recommended .	1
I was concerned about quality with the price so low but this is very well built and works as advertised . Highly recommend .	1
We got this to use as both a bike carrier and a double stroller . Putting it together was SUPER EASY since it comes mostly assembled . It is bit tight for 2 kids though , a 4 year old and 2 year old . Because the seat is not firm they tend to slide together and then fight because they are pushed up against each other . It attaches easily to a bike but be warned there is alot of drag almost like pulling a parachute . I am guessing every carrier would have this issue though . As a stoller it is very easy to manuever and push . There is some storage behind the seat and that adds to its convenience .	1
I 've got two little guys under four years old , and I pull one or the other , sometimes BOTH in this trailer . It works.The GOOD parts : It folds up FLAT and fits in my hatchback . It is EASY to fold up or reassemble ( about two minutes ) . The fabric is more durable than I expected . It pulls easily -- on flats or downhills , I barely notice it at all . On uphills ... well , it 's extra weight , and that means more work , but I ca n't blame that on the trailer ! The trailer itself is reasonably light and it does n't have much rolling-resistance . It 's stable -- even when my bike fell over , the trailer stayed upright ! It has a `` trunk '' - a storage area behind the kids ' seat , for lunch , jackets , whatever - I 'd like to try it for camping sometime ! AND , with the front wheel and push handle , it doubles as a double-stroller ! Very convenient ! The BAD parts : The snaps rusted . Even with the windscreen closed , it still gets full of sand and `` road grit '' , which means the little guys get some of that , too . When you roll up the screens , it needs some velcro to hold them in place , because the elastic does n't do it . The two boys are side-by-side with no separation , so they can push and shove each other . The tires are difficult to inflate . The front wheel does n't turn ( steer ) smoothly.The bottom line is that you ca n't beat this trailer in this price range . Sure , there are better , but they cost WAY more .	1
[ update 10/24/2008 ] My daughter is now four - we still use the trailer for long rides and she still loves it . The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well. -- -- The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike . The ride is pleasant ( meaning very smooth ) for both the parent and child . Like others have mentioned , the toddler loves their personal space . Plenty of `` whees '' when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase .	1
I was scared off from the XAVT , the big brother to this XLT , by all the people saying that it was too big to carry and use . So , I got the XLT instead.Well , this XLT is NOT the size of a pack of cigarettes , it is NOT almost one pound of stainless steel in weight ( it 's only 54 % of one pound , actually ) , and it will not pull your pants down carrying it . Hyperbole by others can mislead the investigating buyer . I 'll shoot you some facts and ways to think about things.The XLT is certainly not too big or heavy to carry -- and now I question whether the XAVT would have been too big ; perhaps I should have sprang for it . I may pick that one up in the future if I see it on sale ( currently it 's 40 % more expensive than the XLT ) . The cost per tool on the XLT is about four bucks per tool , and on the XAVT is about four and a half buck per tool ( divide number tools from price ) . So , something to consider.Victorinox Swiss Army SwissChamp XAVTThe XAVT is more of a collector 's knife , and one might be paying for the display box , but it has many useful functions this XLT does not : more sizes of bits , not one but two magnifying glasses at 5x and 8x magnification ( and designed to be used together to get 13x magnification ! ) , clock , thermometer , etc . Conversely , it also has some redundancy ( two exact same package hooks and two screwdrivers on the XAVT -- see other reviews ) and I wonder if Victorinox counts those twice to get 80 tools on the XVAT . The XLT has no truly redundant tools , but it does have similar tools such as the thick ( i.e . takes up a lot of space on the handle that could be used for another tool ) stand alone Phillips screwdriver , which is almost the same ( not quite , but so close as to be essentially the same purpose ) as the regular Phillips screwdriver on the bit set.Some of the tools are fairly useless , such as the pharmacist spatula . Some stir their coffee with it , one guy uses it as a mirror ( why ? the knife blade is a large high polished mirror , the spatula is matte ) . Huh ! ? Other tools would be better , certainly . Heck , give me the other magnifying glass , Victorinox ! Many reviews on the build and quality of Victorinox , and I agree . Most of you already have another Victorinox knife , I 'd assume . I will try to stick to a few things you may not know about this model XLT specifically.Weight : 8.75 ounces on my scale . Size : 3.5 inches long . 1 inch thick if you include the closed sticking out of the tools . And most importantly , the width ( from side-to-side ) : 1 5/8 inches.This XLT , by Victorinox 's counting ( and a nice one page guide comes in the knife box ) , has 50 uses/tools . I find the Victorinox counting of uses to be accurate , but quite generous . Example : the little round keychain ring on the end of each Victorinox knife -- -that 's one of the fifty tools ! Another example : the bit driver is useful , and it comes with the black bits of various sizes , lovely . See the tiny black plastic piece that you move up to take out the bits ? That 's in and of itself one of the fifty tools ! Yes , it 's called the `` case '' for the bits . Please ! The chisel is facing the wrong way for the ergonomics of the knife handle ( you 'll see when you get it ) for proper use on wood ( the thick knife handle would be against the wood ) . Victorinox , please just turn it around and cut the thumb groove on the other side.I purchased the Victorinox case for this knife , still to arrive , but had I waited , I 'd not get it now . If I put a long Paracord lanyard on the key ring , I can have this at the bottom of my cargo pants pocket with the lanyard knot hanging out , I just grab and pull this out easily and quickly.Anyone on the fence about this and the XAVT , do n't be scared of the other knife . It has some pros and cons , and I have never owned it but presented some ideas about it above . For those of us that carry an EDC medium to large blade folding knife already ( approx 5-7 ounces ) , this XLT is no biggie . And you get a lot more tools ounce for ounce , so I like that ( but still carry an EDC blade like the ZT0350Zero Tolerance ZT0350TS G10 Handle with Speed Safe and Tiger Stripe Blade ( Non-serrated ) .Cell phone ( 4 ounce ) . Car keys ( 2-3 ounces ) . Put in one pocket as you carry these daily anyhow.XLT ( 8.75 ounces ) in the other pocket . Nice overall weight distribution.So , this knife is far from massive . It 's compact and tough and well made . It 's less weight than most Leatehrman type tools . I do carry , especially since it clips to my belt loop on pants directly , the awesome SkeletoolLeatherman 830850 Skeletool CX Multitoolfor a quick carry . It 's something to consider against any Swiss Army Knife depending on your use needs ; I mention it here so that you can check it out , too . I love my Skeletool , also.Cheers and happy Swiss knifing .	1
This is my second XLT and for two very good reasons - Quality and Functionality . I own several other `` MultiTools '' , including ( but not limited to ) Victorinox . For my various uses , this seems to be the best of the best . It is NOT oversized or bulky to carry , yet it has every basic function that a camper/outdoors person , hobbyist , or do-it- yourselfer might need . I was so impressed with the first XLT that the second one is going into my RV ( a mini-motorhome ) . As other reviewers have pointed out , there are many less and more expensive knives of this type on the market today , but once again , you get what you pay for . It is my belief that no matter how fancy an item like this might be , it is totally useless if it does not do the job that it was designed for . By the same token , a cheap knife often results in failure during use AND subsequent personal injury . The XLT might be referred to as a `` knife '' , but it truly is so much more . Well worth the money . One note : Buy the carry case/sheath also ; it adds to the convenience in every day use .	1
I have about a dozen Swiss army knives both Wenger and Victornox , This knife has all the best features and has a wonderful fit and finish ! Outstanding !	1
I collect SAKS . Seems like I can never find the right combination that I would create if I were were the designer . But this one pretty much does . I carried a Tinker for many years . It performs most of the tasks people require on a daily basis . And it is comfortable to carry and light weight . Then you get the other Tinker models . I look at it as `` Mission Creep ! '' The more un-necessary tools you have , the more uses and tasks you create as an excuse to use them and buy bigger and fancier knives ! I recently bought the massive and heavy knife which came with an elegant leather covered box . It has every tool SAK makes . The problem with the knife is there are several duplicate tools added for `` fluff '' just to make it more `` impressive '' and cost more . And for EDC it is too heavy , too massive even with the belt case.I love the `` Champ '' model and would normally be satisfied with that model . It has more than enough tools for almost any contingency . It is also very thick and heavy for EDC . Still , it was missing something -- more `` screwdrivers ? ! '' Then , I saw the XLT Champ model ! It has the driver bits I find use for as well as the other tools.So , having said all that , the knife borders on being too heavy and bulky . But it is doable for EDC.What I would eliminate , thus reducing size and weight , would be the spatula , fish scaler , electrician 's knife and hook . These are so seldom used if at all that it insults one 's intelligence that a fine company like Victorinox would add them ! A spatula ? For what ? ! Cutting your cocain ? ? Use the knife blade . If you plan to fish you will have a scaler in your tackle box . Use the knife blade to strip wire , etc.In spite of what I would change , for now , I would still buy this knife again . It is worth it ! But you have to get used to its bulk and weight . I suspect that I will have to carry it in a belt pouch tho . And the quality is unsurpassed !	1
First I 'm not a collector of Swiss Army Knives . But bought this and am impressed with the quality of all the tools . It is well thought out and has most everything you would want for smaller jobs requireing a handy multitool , removing a splinter ( first thing I used it for and it was nice to have ) to sewing leather . It is a bit large for pocket carry but could be in large pockets , I did get a belt case though . Although large I can use it and my hands are Medium to maybe large in size , but using two hands for somethings , most people could use it . I have 4-5 multitools and probably 250 sheath , belt , pocket knives , etc . some custom made but this little tool has impressed me . If you collect Swiss Knives ( tools ) or want it for jobs requireing small tools I think you will like it . The price here is good too .	1
Outstanding tool . It has pretty much any tool you could ever need . The only downside is its own size ( it can be a little to big to handle for certain tasks ) , but other than that it is an outstanding tool .	1
This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history . I just leave it on my belt and do n't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk . My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations , and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I 'm actually getting.It is very durable . I 've worn it every day for over a year with no problems . It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I 'm wearing it.In summary , the combination of durability , features , size , and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice .	1
It was very difficult to write a review for this product . On one hand , it performs well and is well worth its price . On the other hand , it has a cheap feel to it and it is a bit clumsy ( inconvenient ) to use . Bottom line : I wish I had paid the few extra dollars for the Omron HJ-112 , which probably would have met my expectations better .	1
I ( female ) bought one for myself and one for my mother . This pealess whistle is small and light weight , perfect to be added to my keyring . I tried it and found it loud enough.Hopefully I will never have to use it to get help or rouse attention . I just feel better having one with me .	1
noisemaking is always fun and this device is worth one or two whole days worth of fun . since it 's pealess it only makes one tone so it sounds official and real ( peas sound lame ) . it sounds like the whistles that referees use , which is also cool .	1
very loud very high pitch , pealess design . came with extra split ring . dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle . ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5,2012 : something interesting I wasnt aware , on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code , [ one blast : `` where are you ? `` , two blasts : `` come to me . `` , three blasts : `` I need help ! `` , if you hear any of these signals , respond with one blast . each blast should last 3 seconds . ] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box , may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing , if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code . I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack .	1
I have been very pleased with my purchase of the Fox 40 Classic whistle . I mainly use these whistles while hiking or camping in the outdoors . Some of the features I like about it are ... * 115 dB of sound- High pitched and designed to cut through other noises like crowds for coaches.Makes it seem very loud . * ABS plastic design- Free of Bisphenol A ( BPA ) . The ABS plastic has proven very strong even in cold conditions* Pealess- No cork pea to collect moisture and germs . Does not lock up with excessive moisture . Makes cleaning easy . * Easy to clean- The whistle can be used in water etc , and it clears easily . Easy to rinse out and clean with some vinager and water or some anti-septic mouthwash . Especially useful after a camping trip with kids . * Variety of colors- You can find these whistles in just about every color , and even with favorite sport logos . I use the orange one most for visiblity purposes . But I also have a `` gold '' one which is actually tan . * Economical- The price point on these whistles allows me to have a few extras on lanyards around for each kid in the campsite . They are taught not to abuse them , and to blow them in three bursts if they should somehow get lost.A great whistle for search and rescue work , lifguards , coaches , hunters and hikers . Very versatile and strong . For everyday carry I would also recommendMicro WhistleorUltimate Survival Jetscream Whistle Ultimate Survivaldue to their flat designs and smaller profile . The Fox 40 classic is a great standard whistle meeting most needs .	1
As a basketball referee there is no substitute for the Fox 40 Classic . I especially prefer the cushioned whistles for everyday use . I bought this to have for Breast Cancer week or when I 'm doing girl 's games .	1
I 've been carrying a flat pea-less whistle for a few years . Never was really satisfied with it 's tone or volume even though it is Coast Guard approved . I bought this as a back-up but I like the tone and volume much better than the other one . This has been promoted to primary whistle .	1
This whistle is extremely loud and has the sound of a real professional sports whistle . The `` pea-less '' design is great because you can dip it into water and not have to shake it out for it to work . This makes it ideal for emergency situations and outdoor activities . The plastic is solid and it 's an all around great product .	1
I compared this to a standard whistle ( the ones with the & # 34 ; pea & # 34 ; inside ) . This is louder , so in an emergency , this can be heard from farther away . However , it takes a lot more air to blow it . Therefore , if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way , you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these , but also have the traditional ( easier to blow ) whistle in your pack or emergency bag . If you have the energy to blow this , do so , if you can only blow the other one , even though it is n't as loud , it may still save your life .	1
I used the Fox 40 Classic for many years as a lifeguard . You do need to be very & # 34 ; deliberate & # 34 ; when blowing the whistle , but once you get used to it , this should n't be an issue . If it 's any indication of how loud this whistle is , I actually made my own ears ring many times because I blew too hard . I could also hear a coworker 's whistle from almost a mile away over all the ambient noise . When I changed jobs and the lifeguards were given metal pea-type whistles to use ( those are a joke , by the way ) , I continued to use a very old , very chewed up Fox 40 . There 's never a & # 34 ; pea & # 34 ; getting stuck in the chamber , and no part of the whistle itself can rust like a metal whistle . Also - because of the plastic construction , you can run this thing through the dishwasher without a problem . And , if I 'm not mistaken , the Fox 40 will float if dropped in water . The only real 'con ' is that you can actually chew the end right off if you use it enough . Even though my waterfront days are ( mostly ) behind me , I 'm restocking my stash of Fox 40s for emergency use !	1
If you blow moderately hard or softly , you are going to be disappointed with the amount of sound this puts out . However , if you blow as hard as you can , you will find a marked increase in the volume and your ears will be ringing for a little while afterwards . Great , loud emergency whistle when used properly .	1
The Tee worked relatively well , managing perspiration and keeping body cool and & # 34 ; together & # 34 ; . Though it seemed easier to run / breath during running , the rest of the activities were neither hindered nor enhanced by the shirt ( shirt was used in a Spartan race ) .Overall , I was pleased with the product , though expected the compression to be a bit more than what was achieved by the Tee .	1
like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .	1
I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .	1
Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .	1
both love these shirts.. I get the grey ones for son and white for hubby . They keep the moisture off them when they work and play and a perfect everyday undershirt .	1
is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need	1
I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .	1
there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .	1
I 've been playing with these for years . Much easier to catch than a traditional frisbee , very good for kids learning frisbee and just plain fun , does n't hurt as much as a frisbee when it his you either .	1
Better than any frisbee type.More fun to throw and catch . Softer for dogs to catch . Holding up pretty well , couple little splits in the plastic but our dog is hard on eerything	1
Used this on the beach during spring break . Wow does this thing fly a long way . We had to be careful of throwing off target , cause it would either sail into the water ( does n't float ) or possibly hit sunbathers . If you can throw a disk accurately , this one is easy to get the hang of . Very cool .	1
This ring is a great alternative to a traditional frisbee . It 's easier to catch and travels even farther ! This pro ring is excellent for little kids too since they seem to have less trouble throwing it than with a regular frisbee .	1
Especially for the beach or windy days . The wind will carry this thing for seemingly miles . It 's amazing to watch as the wind will lift and lower it as it sails through the air . It 's can be a great dog retriever toy if your dog does n't chew his fetch toy . Since it sails so far , it will tire the dog quickly , however if he chews on it much , it wo n't sale much at all .	1
The ultimate necessity on the beach these are fun and they makes You feel Really Strong and Focused ... They go very far , they are fun , they are easy to catch ... . Classic !	1
These things are a blast . Even people who do n't throw traditional Frisbees well will have fun with a little practice . It aerodynamic profile allows this ring to maintain lift for quite a long distance.Start with short distances . You 'll be surprises how easily you can overshoot your target by 100-200 feet.Store in a place the will be perfectly flat , it can deform easily even just leaning it against something vertically for too long.Great for wide open flat fields . Have fun !	1
I ca n't get over how far it goes ! No issues thus far and it works properly . Kids are not too interested in it but the oldest is 6 so I am a little ahead of the curve !	1
We , the humans in this family , find these to be the best flying frisbees we 've ever used . Really really nice . They throw well and sail far . Unfortunately , the smaller sized one is also our dog 's favorite-in-the-whole-world frisbee , even though she has many different frisbees , especially dog specific ones . But none even come close to the Aerobie in her opinion . She LOVES it and goes bonkers every time it comes out in the yard . She will chase it forever , until she literally drops . We have to have a little pool for her to jump in often , because she gets so overheated . It is definitely not made to hold up to dog teeth , and so we can not her alone with it for even a minute . We play frisbee with her until WE are tired of throwing , and then we immediately put it away where she can not get it . Even so , we still have to replace hers every couple of months . But she loves it SO much , we ca n't deprive her of one .	1
This Frisbee ring really does fly , you need to warn people about it because if it is thrown at the right angle and speed you may never see it again : )	1
Title says it all . Bought mine at Big 5 . I needed it right away so I didnt get a chance to check Amazon before I bought it . I payed $ 10 at Big 5 and was very surprised to see the same exact frisbee for a few bucks more here on Amazon .	1
This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides , like a taco . Hold it in place for a minute , and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim . The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car . For my littlest son , we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close . For bigger kids , they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees . And I guarantee you it will sail out of a normal suburban yard , so watch for cars , too .	1
If you like throwing a frisbee and want one that goes really far - this is it . Difficult to control when thrown hard - it really takes off and sails quite a way . If you want to play catch in an area with trees or if you do n't want to run , then do n't get this ring . If you have a large open area ( a football or soccer field ) and want to throw its whole length , get this ring .	1
If you are looking for a long distance frisbee , this is the one you should get ! This frisbee flies very far . The way you flick your wrist can change how much the firsbee will curve . I recommend throwing with only 50 % of your full effort , otherwise this ring will glide for a very long distance .	1
To classify this as a frisbee does it a disservice and is misleading . This is a whole new device that uses similar throwing techniques but the experience is completely different.I was never much of a frisbee thrower , they would always catch a wind and veer in different directions , the lip was weird to let go of at the right time , I could go on and on . I know some folks are great at frisbee , but not me.There are those feel that if a sport or activity is not difficult then it 's not rewarding . Stay away from this if that 's your motto , this is easy.This device has single-handedly made every frisbee ever made obsolete recycle material . Instead of working against you , it works in your favor.The first time I threw it the Pro 13 flew across 2 adjacent baseball fields behind my house and would 've continued were it not for a fence.You have to learn to take it easy and forget everything you 've learned throwing a frisbee . Do n't throw it too hard or you might not get it back.I 'm ordering 2 more right now because my 20 yr old son was by today so he has to have one and I need a backup . My 6 and 7 yr old son and daughter caught on pretty quick also.The frisbee has evolved .	1
Be careful with this thing , it flies really far . You need a big area when you play catch with this . The ring is well built and will last for quite a while . In my opinion this is better than a Frisbee because it flies further and is easier to throw . I 'd highly recommend this product .	1
The Aerobie Pro Ring is a fun disc . It generally flies very straight and very true if you throw it correctly . Throwing it correctly is not hard.It also flies FAR . So , make sure you have ample room , such as a field . We tried playing with one near our house on a 1 acre lot and it got stuck on the roof quickly.Later , I took my 10-14 year old kids to a football field to throw it , and we were regularly getting 50 yards on modestly powered throws . An adult throwing the ring with full effort can easily achieve 70-100 yards of distance.Also , chasing the disc while it 's flying towards you provides good exercise.This disc makes `` frisbees '' fun again ! Buy one ! Find a field ! And , have fun !	1
I was worried , even after reading positive reviews , that this was going to be some gimmicky product that would n't last . But I 'm happy to report that those were unfounded fears . This thing is very easy to use , flies much farther than a frisbee ever has for me , offers a great deal more control , does n't lose course as much due to wind resistance , is durable , and seems much safer than a frisbee . I say safer , because the covering of the ring itself is a very soft rubber . If you accidentally hit someone with a frisbee , there is danger of bruising , etc . But I do n't see that happening here . Catching is never painful ; even when your throwing partner exerts a little too much force . If there is bad to be found here , I simply have not spotted it . So purchase with confidence .	1
This is the easiest disc to throw and it goes super far and I love it . Further , I use it for playing with my Golden Retriever . First it goes super far and when it runs out of steam it floats gently to the ground and my dog can easily grab it in flight . While it 's not designed for dogs it 's made of a material that 's easy for them to catch . If your dog is a super chewer this probably is n't the one for you ; my guy does chew stuff up but only if I leave it with him . He retrieves it and brings it back and gives it to me and we love using it . I especially love how he flips it over his head so it 's both in his mouth and around his head as he runs back with it !	1
These things are really fun and easy to get thru the air . I am totally satisfied . Kids just love them .	1
it arrived fast . I could n't wait to give it a try and it sure did n't disappoint . great product and me and my friends love it .	1
I have used and collected a number of knives over the years . I have to admit I am Totally Brutal to my knives and I find out quick if a knife is well made or not.In my honest opinion My SOG knives especially my Flash II knife is a great knife to have ! These knives are well made and well designed with a great life time guarantee , Not too many knife companies give you a lifetime gaurantee and shapening too ! No other knife company besides Cold Steel will give you more Bang For The Buck ! I 've Never Ever had a problem with any of my SOG knives and I 'm sure you will find the same true too .	1
This SOG `` Flash II '' pocket knife is an excellent `` every day '' carry knife . While I personally prefer theGerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless Steel Fine Edge Knife , my son did not due to the weight so we found someone that was willing to trade the SOG for the Gerber . Here are my observations : Pros : + Quality ; this is a well made knife that will hold up to daily use quite well+ Speed ; opens one-handed quite quickly+ Blade ; comes razor sharp and holds an edge quite well+ Pock Clip ; very sturdy , no worries at+ Positive Locks ; this locks open/closed with a sliding buttonMisc : * Weight ; this a very light knife compared to my other pocketknives , I prefer a little more heft but ( as noted above ) my son does n't , so this is a matter of personal preferenceAn all around good knife at a reasonable price ! Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
I work at Dicks sporting goods and i deal with these knifes , kershaws , gerbers , and many other knifes daily . I always pick the SOG 's i love the feel , texture , strength , and looks . You cant beat these knife for the price . I EDC mine .	1
Background : The Spyderco Tenacious and the SOG Flash II are popular choices and because I have both in half serrated , and they are in the same price range , I compare them both here . The flash II is more popular in stores and I think Wal-Mart even sell them.I have had and still have several Flash II 's and one Spyderco Tenacious . I have carried both as EDC for extended periods in tough use , so thought I would add my experience with them . I currently carry the flash II and a SAK , but carried the Tenacious and SAK for about a year and still have it and prefer it in the woods . I have carried Benchmade 's , but they are a little expensive and I fear loosing one . I fly the airlines a lot on spur of the moment notice and have given several knives including at least two Flash 's to TSA having no time to go back and store/ship it or something . I gave one to some Mexicans doing drywall work in the terminal in front of TSA screening rather then give it to TSA . I try to keep a knife in my desk , boat , backpack , and a couple of cars . So more expensive knives have n't been indicated for me.I carry a folder clipped inside the pocket ( clip outside ) , with the point down , weak hand side.Spyderco Tenacious : Pros : Solid construction . Feels better then the Flash in use ( in the hand ) . It has Stainless Steel liners under the G10 scales . It is more conventional and probably stronger then the Flash.Good blade steel . Better then the Flash II IMO . The 8Cr13MoV sounds better when sharpening too . Ha . But , that may be due to the heaver construction of the whole knife , less dampening due to the aluminum sides under the G10 , and the thinner blade near the edge ( flat ground ) . So even though the edge is thinner , and I have put a finer angle edge on it , the Tenacious holds an edge better.Blade shape - really nice for a wide variety of tasks with a wide leaf shape . Leaves plenty of room to get your thumb against the spider hole to open the knife.Good lock up . I do n't like liner locks much , but it locks solidly and secure.Size of the Blade . I like this size knife for EDC.Easy enough to open with either hand.The belt clip is more durable and versatile then the Flash . The Flash clip breaks at one of the multiple 90 bends . The Tenacious clip is lower profile , stronger , grips better in a pocket , and can be mounted up , down , left and right.Cons : Difficulty closing with one hand : I am not a big fan of liner locks , but I like them much better then spring detent locks like old school pocket knives . I pretty much cut a thumb pad off once with a Tenacious so maybe some of it is psychological . You can get your thumb caught and sliced in the blade trying to close it with one hand . Just pushing the liner lock in will will drop the blade against your thumb if you hold it in the wrong position . Not a problem with two hands using the other one to control the blade closing , but with a bolt lock on the side you can close it with one hand and never need to get your finger/thumb under where the blade goes . This does n't happen with a assisted opening knife as the blade is always trying to open until almost closed.Heavy ( this is not a big thing for me , but it is noticeably heaver then a flash due to partial aluminum sides under the G10 ) .Made in China . But , quality and steel is very good in the case of this knife , so Made in China '' is more about ethics and politics then quality in this case.SOG Flash IIPros : Assisted opening . Get it past 5 or 10 with light pressure on the thumb and it snaps open . Great one handed operation , even if injured . A little more wow , or cool , factor then the Tenacious.Light weight . Feels quite a bit lighter then the Spyderco . Perhaps even less then substantial ( personal preference ) . The flash is all plastic actually glass-reinforced nylon ( GRN ) . It has some kind of metal bushing between the blade and ( GRN ) sides.Size of the Blade . I like this size knife for EDC.Lock up is solid , as far as staying open/not closing . There is a little slop though when open in both directions . I have never tried to tighten it up . I have never worried about it closing on me in use.Safety . You can lock it so it wont open in your pocket.Easy to sharpen.Made in USACon 's : Slop when open . Not bad , but not as tight as the Tenacious.Safety - I have had it come open in my pocket a couple of times in active situations . It was n't locked when this happened . Pretty scary . I knew it was open , or partially open ; in one case when I reached in my pocket and cut a fingers , and two other times when I felt the point sticking into the front of my hip . In the later two I stopped moving and then moved real slowly until I got it folded back up and under control . Front pocket , bad place for an open knife . For some reason a Benchmade Barrage assisted open has never come open in my pocket ( even unlocked ) . Of course the Benchmade is a great knife , but at more then twice the cost . I think the flash lacks a tendency to stay closed . Better spring assisted knives seem to have more force toward closed until you pass the point where it springs toward open . It 's not like the safety is a plus , so much as it is just plain needed , because of the tenancy to come open if the thumb nut is bumped in the pocket . However , the safety will come off , or turn on , in pocket . This further aggravates the above problem.Steel is softer then Tenacious and does n't hold an edge nearly as well . Easy to ding and dull the edge . Supposed to be AUS-8 , 56-58 Rockwell ( same hardness as Tenacious 's Chinese 8Cr13MoV , but I perceive all three Flashes to be softer than and not hold an edge as well as the Tenacious based on use and response when sharpening ) .I have broken 2 belt clips . SOG replaced them for free though . There is a place on there web sight for this.Belt clip can be mounted for left or right but not up or down . It only mounts for point down ( that is it will be point down if opened ) .Fairly complicated to disassemble if needed to clean . Goes with the territory for an assisted.The glass-reinforced nylon ( GRN ) frame may feel cheap to some . It does n't have any metal liners , but is very strong and works well.Summary : I like both knives for different reasons.I give the edge to the Tenacious for the Blade design & hardness , build construction , and belt clip . Opening is good and easy but requires moving the blade all the way open , or a strong flip on a well broken in knife.The Flash II is lighter ( may be good or bad ) . I like the bolt action lock better , mainly for ease of closing with one hand , and the spring assist opening it great . The flash has more pzazz.Both knives are about the same price $ 30 to $ 45 depending on options and seller at the time of this post , with the Spyderco starting on the lower end of the overlap price range and the Flash topping out the range.A cross between these with the Spyderco blade design and steel , assisted opening and an axis type lock like the Flash , would be real cool . Better then either one IMO . My Benchmade Barrage is the best of both worlds or better , and I like it better ( who would n't ) , but too expensive for EDC for me.Conclusion : Even though this is my EDC knife , I have to say the Spyderco Tenacious may be the more practical and possibly a better choice for most applications . It has better steel , seems to be stronger , better blade shape , etc . I still carry the flash because of the assist , weight , and the safety issues . It 's almost like it 's not there.Best choice is to get them both.Hope this helps someone decide .	1
I already own one of these as an EDC knife and that is why I have purchased more . This knife is quite sharp out of the box and it opens quickly . I like the `` safety '' feature that locks the blade so that it does n't open accidentally . The best feature for me is the low profile clip that allows the knife to be carried but not seen . It is elevated a bit off the end of the knife so that no part of the knife shows outside your pocket . All that is visible is the clip . Most knifes have a small portion of the knife end that sticks out of the pocket . With this style of knife , you ca n't see any of the knife outside the pocket . This makes this a discreet EDC knife that is also functional and of an excellent quality.The handle is quite sturdy and has textured feel that increases the grip . The partially serrated blade is quite helpful in getting through boxes , rope , plastic , etc . Overall this is a lightweight and handy knife that is worth the price and superb for EDC . If it is stiff or does n't open the way you like , just adjust the end screw and lubricate it with a drop of oil . I have also used WD-40 on this style of knife and it does wonders cleaning it and making it look brand new again .	1
I have been using Myerco folding knives for a lot of years now , but after using this knife for the last month of so , I have to say , it is every bit as good if not better than the Myerco Speedster.While the Myercos are easy to open with one had , the spring loaded blade in the SOG makes it even easier to open.Great knife , well made . You will not be disappointed.Also , the SOG has a metal pocket clip , while the Myerco is some kind of composite . I have broken one of the Myerco pocket clips but the SOG clip looks to be very strong .	1
If you are looking for an overall top quality knife with fast opening function and multipurpose blade you have found it in this knife ! This knife also provides a very functional safety blade lock when closed and when open for use.Use can use it for everything from a good fishing knife to hunting and survival knife.The serration in the front part of the blade enhances the cutting action of the knife for rope , fabric , wood , and just about everything else !	1
I bought this USA made SOG at Lowe 's for 49 bucks on a total impulse buy . I wanted and could have got it about $ 10 cheaper with the plain blade ( which I much prefer ) on amazon but I was itching to buy a new knife ( ever happen to you ? ) so i bought this one with the serrated blade.The knife came in a clampack/lockbar combo that was unpleasantly tedious to remove the knife Ifrom but well protected from damage of any kind . The fact that a lot of cheap chinese made knives come wrapped in tissue and in nice boxes and a knife like this does n't really chaps my arse but it is what it is.At first feel this knife can come across `` plasticky '' due to the handle design and material used but that quickly goes out the window after carrying and using this knife for awhile . It is textured but I would not call it grippy although the shape of the handle does feel solid and secure in my large hands . A weak attempt at jimping on the top and choil area of the handle is appreciated but disappointing . The handle is liner-less to reduce weight but this knife is strong and rigid . This knife is light for its size making it great for edc purposes . The pocket clip designs on these SOG 's is the best in my opinion as the knives totally disappear into your pocket.The quality blade is razor sharp out of the package on mine and is a decent steel ( AUS 8 or equivalent I believe ) . I do n't like serrations myself but these did make short work out of rope and cord . The blade is beautiful and the SOG Flash II logo looks cool on the blade but the patent # on the other side is kind of lame . This is a USA made knife as is my SOG Trident but it is displayed nowhere on the knives themselves which really steams my clams if you know what I mean . The thumbstuds are of good design and are not too smooth nor too rough and a slight push causes the blade to really fly open.The action on this knife is awesome and fun to deploy repeatedly . Zero blade play in this example but after about 200-300 openings and closings it developed slight left to right but very slight so a minor adjustment to the pivot screw and it is back to being solid and fast . I love the sound it makes as it locks up ! The arc lock is simple and safe and grows on you after awhile . The safety lock is a cool idea but as most have stated it can be tedious after repeated usage . Even unlocked I do not fear it opening in my pocket on accident.Overall this knife is the one if you have medium to large hands because for me the Flash I is just too small . The value , quality and fun factor are hard to beat . I have 3 SOG knives and love them all .	1
So I 'll throw my review out here . I 've been carrying the knife for a few months now , and I 'm very happy with it . I 've had the typical issues that seem to crop up with this knife . The belt clip can get a little loose and it does crack the handle , but I tightened it up and stopped carrying it in my pocket ( it rides in my Maxpedition Jumbo ) . I also had some sideways play in the blade and again tightening the thing worked well.The blade deploys quickly , but you need to `` follow through '' . Light pressure on the lug will result in the blade not opening all the way and not locking into place . It 's sharp and holds an edge reasonably well , the safety is a nice `` peace of mind '' feature , but is probably not strictly necessary.One thing to be mindful of is that if you pull this knife out and flip it open , it 's large enough that it 'll flip some people out . I 've had a few instances in which people have given me sideways glances when I use it to open boxes , etc . If you find this to be an issue for you consider the Flash I or a non-assisted blade.I am enjoying the knife and it has served to interest me in other SOG products so , that 's either an endorsement or a warning depending on the size of your pocketbook , I guess.Good Knife , Good Price , very useful .	1
All around this is a fantastic EDC knife ( not the fan of serrations but it was cheap enough at retail that it did n't matter for me ) . Knife is aus 8 which is decent steel , factory sharp , fairly thick steel.Pros : Steel is good quality for this price point of knife . Much more durable ( as far as holding an edge ) than similar chinese kershaw 8cr13mov . This is n't a chinese knife but it 's an `` assembled '' in the US . Based on the steel my guess is this is primarily taiwan ( for the steel ) and/or chinese for the rest . Chinese knives are usually 8cr13 or 8cr14 that 's why I say this . Taiwan metal working is actually pretty good when it comes to tools nowadays ( about 90 % of professional American metal work with similar materials ) so there 's no real problem with it.Safety is great , works , and you will use it because of the action.Handle is well designed for non-optimal condition use ( i.e . grease , soil , water , etc ) .Cons : Clip design is n't great for removing the knife from a pocket ( have to grip the knife oddly to remove it ) .The `` assisted '' action of the knife is way too fast for this type of knife . I 'm not saying that it 's dangerous but it has the potential to be if you 're not paying attention.Blade lock is a bit goofy , it does n't really lock in place when the blade is deployed.Altogether for the money I paid ( 20 bucks ) , this is a great knife . Though the design does n't match the proposed function . This is supposed to be a general use ( actually `` contractor grade '' from the package ) knife and it 's a bit too pseudo-tactical for my tastes . I 'd still give it 4.5 stars because it 's well made , lifetime warranty , and the price was right . For this price range ( 20-40 ) you wo n't be able to do any better and this is a full featured knife in my opinion .	1
The action is everything I could ask for . It is actuated by nudging the thumb knobs on either side of blade and is truly easy opening w/either hand . And , this is just me , I do n't see a need for the locking switch to keep the knife from opening in your pocket , although I do understand why one would n't want it to open there . Guess it 's better to have & not need ... I wish the handle material Zytel , could have been a little fatter , softer , to me , it feels a little harsh-sharp , especially on the `` finger '' side . But I 'll get over it . The blade is sharp out of the box . This is going to be a joy for EDC . It 's going to be tough to find a knife to beat it .	1
Never carried a knife before , now I feel lost without it.The only thing I would change is if the scale ( size ) was just a little smaller.Love the assist opening.Safety at times requires an extra push to go off . ( two clicks ) - almost like it is getting hung up on something.Knife does get dull quickly , but that could be because I use it every day .	1
This knive is especially handy when you only have one hand available to open it . It 's build well , sharp , and has an effective safety .	1
This is my first ( and right now only ) SOG knife . I have several assisted open folders ( mostly Kershaw ) and I had heard and read good things about SOG knives , so I decided to make this my first SOG knife - I have n't been disappointed.First , my EDC is the Kershaw Blur without the serrated edge . The Blur is my favorite knife and I consider it the best value of any knife I own . This knife compares favorably to the Blur . I still prefer the Kershaw Blur , but both knives are excellent choices and represent great value . Many of my comments will compare / contrast this knife to the Blur.Pros : Assisted open is very good - every bit as good as the Blur.Locking mechanism in the handle to prevent the blade from being opened if engaged . At first I did n't like this feature , but I think it is probably a good feature for many people.Good blade . The blade came extremely sharp and it is pretty easy to sharpen.Solidly built . The locking mechanism is good and the blade does n't have any extra side to side play when blade is extended.The clip works well . Some folder 's clips are too tight , but I like this clip . It is easy to slide over my pocket edge and it keeps the knife secure . The clip is actually better than the Blur's.I like the grip . Good shape and does n't slip in your hand.Not too heavy.Cons : Closing the knife is a little more difficult than my Kershaws . There seems to be more resistance after the blade is halfway closed . Just not as smooth closing as I 'd likeThe blade is good - very sharp and solid - but the Blur 's blade is a little sturdier IMO.Summary : This is really a good knife and , at the Amazon price , a great value . I would recommend the SOG FSA-98 Flash II to anyone looking for an EDC in this price range .	1
What can I say Love IT . forth one i have purchased buy one every year I use it so often I wear it out . Sharp as hell and sturdey	1
I found an SOG flash 2 in the road last summer when I was bike riding , It had been ran over by several cars and was still in good condition . The Flash series of SOG knives really are great , they flick open with ease , and are very small . It is a great folder . Only two things about this knife I dont like which are the slight steep pricing , and the handle quality . Overall an excellent folder .	1
I find some of the top reviews extreamly question.There is no way this blade will handle cutting through a oil drum , it will not cut wire unless its very thin . I would be weary of really prying wit it , its a thin blade.I have the orignal seki Japan seal pup . And i know plenty of guys who have deployed with it.Its easy to sharpen , holds an edge . It will handle any lite to medium task you throw at it.The new nylon sheath is crap , get a kydex . The knife is affordble , replaceable . And wont break the bank . Its a quialty knife but has its limitations .	1
Excellent knife ; sheath is above average . Blade arrived very sharp . Used it last night to split whole chickens in half for the BBQ grill . Sliced right thru them like warm butter . Great product , Great price . Thanks !	1
I bought this one for my daughter who is now in R.O.T.C . My own is the knife I have with me at all times . For more about the knife , see the review from my first purchase . Like the tactical sheathw ith this one It 's 20+ dollars if bought seperately .	1
This scaled down version is as perfect as its big brother . The Pup is the perfect size for my wife . Attach a paracord lanyard , and you are set .	1
Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it 's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife . It is a whole different type of tool . The Becker is massive , burly , tough , heavy duty and heavy . The SOG is light , nimble , and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade . I just did n't care for the feel of it in my hand and I do n't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker . It 's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying . Nice knife , just not what I needed .	1
Long story short , it 's an excellent knife . But the kydex sheath is lousy . I 'd recommend the nylon sheath with the kydex insert . Much better , and MOLLE compatible. [ ... ]	1
The knife helped out on my needs . Very durable , awesome price . The metal is good also . I could n't beat the price anywhere else . I use this knife daily and it has not failed me yet	1
Well , saved $ 10 from other places by getting it here and totally love this buy ! Great quality , toatally sharp ( including tip ) and perfect size . I 've always wanted one of these knives and am glad I bought it . g-	1
I was on the fence between this and a few others , but once I spoke with a couple real war veterans I was sold . The blade arrived RAZOR sharp out of the box . The grip is very comfortable and the weight is excellent . It comes with a nylon sheath that works great , and has an extra pocket for a multi tool or possibly a magnesium striker . The vet 's I spoke with only retired their knives only after the grip wore out , which was after almost a decade of use . Great Knife !	1
Solid well made knife . Well worth the money you spend . Great sheath that comes with it and its made of REAL STEEL !	1
pesonally i 've owned many knives , some better and many worse ones.for the money sog is supplying a great product , they do n't do it in the USA but they are doing it.this one is not so long as to make your arm tired , nor too short to accomodate any needs.a good hard use knife , i 'm thinking of my two sons for Christmas .	1
The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol . This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster . Held its edge , the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy . The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap . Chunks got torn out of it . The blade finish also wears off . I ended up engraving mine a bit so it did n't look like everyone else 's knife . Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally . I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one . Great buy and if you do n't have a need for an M9 bayonet , this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments .	1
I ordered a Seal Pup Elite , and was sent the regular Seal Pup instead . The company just refunded the difference , so I called it a wash.The Seal Pup is a good knife . Though I have not thoroughly abused mine , I can say that it feels solid . It is also , quite literally , sharp enough to shave with right out of the box . I actually tried it , and it works.The sheath is sturdy , and works reasonably well with a MOLLE vest or pack , but the loops are a bit too tight , making it difficult to weave . They are also oddly spaced , so the sheath does n't mount tightly , but slides a bit . The pouch on the front of the sheath is large enough to comfortably accommodate a Victorinox Rucksack lockblade knife . It 's a good sized pouch.===Update : I have been using this as my primary outdoors knife for some time now , and I really have no complaints . I 've used it for everything from cutting cord to batoning firewood . I even used it to hack through light brush on one occasion . The blade retains an edge well , and I have no questions about the structural integrity of the knife overall . It 's light , and just the right size for an all-around utility knife . The partly serrated blade makes the piece especially versatile . The sheath is holding up very well , and I typically keep fire-making materials in the pouch . I ca n't say that I 've extensively tested every offering at the $ 50- $ 60 price point , but I can say that I 'm pleased with the purchase and am more than comfortable heading off the trail with the SEAL Pup.===	1
I picked up one of these knives as a work knife for my hunting lease . I used it all this past season and was impressed . Very sharp , and so light it almost feels like a toy . It cut burlap , canvas , camo netting , 550 cord and other assorted rope effortlessly . It would n't be appropriate for chopping ( too light ) , but it 's definitely a cutter . It would be great as a tackle box knife and I 'm sure it would be satisfactory for self defense if necessary . A few minor criticisms : the serrated edge portion of the blade is so small its essentially worthless . I 'm not a fan of serrated edges on knives to begin with ; if I had it to do over again I 'd buy the plain blade . My other criticism is that the sheath feels flimsy , I would much prefer kydex or even leather . This would be an ideal fixed blade knife for kids or adults with smaller hands . I 'm becoming more of a SOG fan than I ever expected to be . I prefer a heavier knife and bought a SOG Super Bowie 2.0 ( fabulous blade ! ) . All in all , a great knife for the price . I would recommend it .	1
This is a lot of knife for under $ 50 . The blade is thick and feels very strong . The blade comes extremely sharp right out of the box . I gently ran it on my arm and all the hair fell right off ! The handle is a little small and for those with large hands , it may be too small but I did n't have any problems with it . The nylon sheath is very nice and has a plastic insert inside for the blade so that the blade wo n't cut the nylon sheath when inserting or removing . The blade is made in Taiwan ... I felt I made a good purchase !	1
... but I love having quality gear . I do n't use this knife to fix tanks or fight for our country- but you could n't ask for a better camping/survival knife , even just for a regular joe . The craftsmanship and quality of this knife is apparent from the moment you open the box . I am among those who actually enjoys the nylon sheath , and I especially like the multi-tool pouch in which I can store my SOG PowerAssist . If my multi-tool is elsewhere it 's a great place for a sharpener or other supplies.Big thumbs up to SOG !	1
The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box . My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife , and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt . The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it ( the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch ) is n't really that great in my opinion . It 's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there , but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it , so to each their own.That said , I have no qualms about my purchase and it 's a solid , well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time .	1
I have the KA-BAR Short Fighting/Utility , the Bear Grylls Ultimate Knife , Buck 119 Special , my Dad 's Schrade-Walden H-15 that he carried through 2 tours in Vietnam , and some other similar knives around the same price range.I have to say in this price range , this knife seems to have the best fit and finish , the sharpest out-of-the-box blade , and is also the lightest . I think the sheath is way better than any of the aforementioned knives as well.The Bear Grylls has some cool features ( like the fire steel , whistle , and sharpener ) , but you can probably fit at least 2 of those items in the SOG 's front pouch , and wear a better whistle on a cord around your neck , and it does n't seem as well made as the SOG Seal Pup.The very light weight of this knife is also a big plus for those long hikes ! I have n't abused this particular knife yet , but it seems as if it would hold up admirably due to its simple construction , and I like AUS-8 steel a lot.My backup knife for my `` Bug Out Bag '' is another high value knife , the Morakniv Companion MG. You can get them in 1095 Carbon steel or 12c27 Sandvik Stainless steel , and either one is great . Very inexpensive and also very high quality , I ca n't recommend them enough.Anyway , I LOVE this knife , and I 'm sure you will too at this price point ! You 'll notice some bad reviews on the sheath - however take note of how old the reviews are , they are from the first version of this knife which had an overly long choil and less of a cutting edge due to more serrations , and apparently a weird sheath . SOG has fixed these issues and it is a much better knife as a result .	1
I paid 55 for it , and i 'm fine with it . I think cold steel does better with AUS8 steel , but the knife is okay . It has rusted a bit , and does n't hold an edge as well as my other aus 8 knives , but it is solid , cool looking , and stays sharp enough for long enough . I probably would n't buy it again as I feel I could do better for the money , but this is ONE of the better options for this type of knife .	1
I am very happy to buy this beautiful & sharp knife with the super price . Thank you very much .	1
I am a fan of the Marine Corps K-bar and have used one for over 35 years . I believe that the K-bar is one of the best functional knives I have ever owned , so for me to be surprised with this SOG is amazing . It was razor sharp out of the box . The handle is easy to use with gloves on in the cold , and the handle is not hard to use without gloves , the non slop surface provides for an excellent grip even when wet . This is a very functional knife and if I lived in an area where it was moist or constantly wet and rainy there is no doubt that this knife would be my first choice to carry . I bought the knife as a backup but and am not disappointed with it . I would recommend the SOG to a friend . This knife will replace the K-bar for fishing around the lake and from the boat because I can use a lanyard with it to prevent loss of the knife in the water . I like the nylon sheath because it will dry quickly if wet . the only negative that I have found is the velcro knife retainer on the sheath . This should be a snap in my opinion because it is less noisy . I will use it for hunting in the Fall but do not expect any problems.Overall I believe the knife is a good value and will serve me well in the field . It is nice to find quality and value in the same package .	1
This item is amazing ! Feels sturdy as can be in hand ! Exactly as I thought it would be.The order was placed and received very , very , fast !	1
I gave it 4 stars because really for recreational scuba diving IMO , a 7inch blade is too long . The Shorter `` SEAL Pup '' is a better knife . That said , this is a pretty tough knife . Not as strong as the Strider WB or TAC 10/11 , but still strong enough for recreational scuba divers . Those other knives are also way more expensive , like 3x this one . The sheath which is n't pictured here is very high tech . It holds the knife firmly , has lots of straps and loops for almost any carry position . So a better choice than those cheapy but flashy dive knives from US Divers .	1
How can a USA Seal Team knife be made in Tawain ? Do n't buy this knife . BUY A COLD STEEL GI OR LEATHERNECK KNIFE INSTEAD they are less price , made in USA and exceed the quality of this blade by lightyears . Its all advertising Crap . Every SEAL carries weapons of their choice ! SEALS are not issued weapons , they chooze their own weapons they pick !	1
Amazon shipped super fast ... yay ! I got this recently and it is really a super solid sexy knife . Pulled it out of the box and shaved my arm hair right off ... so ya ... pretty sharp edge from factory . It looks sleek & stealthyThis will be one of my camping knives . I go camping around lakes and beachs so getting it wet and working fish , battoning wood and such with this knife will not been an issue . Well balanced knife ... feels natural in my hands ... will take a pounding and keeps on ticking.Love the sheath ... well made and I like that side pocket to store my firesteel and a mini knife sharpener.SOG ... what more can I expect	1
I think this is a very nice knife of high quality . I think that the handle could be much more form fitting to your grip .	1
One fixed-blade knife I own I have carried through woods and hills for about 700 miles . ( I kept track . ) I travel as light as I can and every ounce counts . Any other fixed-blade must deliver a lot a performance for its weight before I would even consider carrying it.I explain all this because the SOG Seal knife is one of the very few I would not hesitate to take with me on a long trip to the middle of nowhere.There are many reasons to buy a knife , I know , but performance is what I care about . How much muscle does it take to get a fixed-blade to cut , chop , slice and split ? The SOG requires less effort to use than most other fixed blades I own , and the ones that can match it are heavier . Among blades of this length , the SOG Seal is the champ . None perform better.I attribute this largely to its thick-spined hollow-ground cross section . Compared to many knives , the SOG 's edge is thinner . If you want a knife to sink into something , thinner goes in easier than thicker . If I had to pry apart masonry and steel doors after an apocalypse , maybe I 'd choose something else . In the woods , however , I know it wo n't fail.I guess it was sharp enough out of the box , but that 's something I never pay attention to because I will sharpen a knife the way I want it to be . With the SOG Seal 's blade , it was easy to do.I chose this over the Elite , btw , because this has no rasp on the back . On my Seal Pup Elite , that rasp is pretty much useless except on green wood . I assume the Seal Team Elite rasp is no different.Some might say the SOG Seal 's handle could be better , the cutting edge could be longer and a fine edge would be better than the serrations . All may be true , but none of those things diminish the exceptional amount of capability this knife offers .	1
Always wanted a Swiss Army Knife and now I have one ! did n't want anything too big nor too little ! Grew up watching McGyver on TV and always said I need one but never pulled the trigger to buy it . Searched many models on Amazon but felt this was the one that was calling to me ! Glad I picked this one because I love it !	1
This is a great pocket knife . It has very useful tools that could be used for a variety of tasks .	1
This classic knife is amazingly useful . The scissors are particularly handy , and I also find myself using the Phillips head screwdriver accessory all the time . I always have one of these stashed on my boat , and it sees hard use . Highly recommended . RJB .	1
For some reason this SAK is a real bargin . Basically a super tinker with the scale tool and about $ 7 cheaper . I doubt I 'll ever use this for fishing but the scale tool will be handy as a & # 34 ; pokey-type & # 34 ; tool . I 'll probably use mine to dig snow out of my cross country boot where the binding attaches . Plus the little silver fish looks classy .	1
Carry this little guy everyday . Used mostly for cutting up fruit for my lunches . Gets the job done very well . Easy to sharpen and easy to clean . Small size is barely noticed in my pocket . Very happy with this little guy .	1
Very simple yet elegant design . If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and wo n't weigh you down , then this is a great option . It has 1 full sized plain edge blade , and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick . Nor does it have a key ring attachment . This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit . It 's very streamlined and slim .	1
Great pocket knife . I find it useful to have a pocket knife around for many reasons . The most important is to open things that have packing tape that is almost bullet proof otherwise ...	1
I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking ( glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo ) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out ( maybe they will break in with time ) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position ; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind . I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well . Anyway , if you have good nails that should n't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for , and so far I have n't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we ( especially my daughter ) like it a lot and we recommend it .	1
Personally I like the thinner , think it 's aluminium sided knife that 's the same model . Couple buck more but worth it . It was though shipped quickly and well packed .	1
Top quality and US made . Who could ask for more ? This is a highly recommended item for anyone who wants a durable set .	1
Overall a sturdy set of horseshoes . They have rusted a bit over time , I suppose I should bring them in . But all in all this is a great set of serious horseshoes for a recreational used .	1
Bought this set to replace a cheaper set of iron shoes that did n't last a full day before a shoe split in half . The shoes are well balanced and the shape made for more ringers in my opinion . Would definitely recommend the set to anybody looking for a nice upgrade from the cheaper iron sets common in the big box stores .	1
My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad , so I was n't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard . I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one . It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order , but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks . They are quality , well-constructed and Made in the USA . They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game . The paint has chipped some but that has n't bothered me since it does n't interfere in playing the game . I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games .	1
This Horseshoe set is heavy duty . After getting the stakes pounded into the ground my cousin and I played horseshoes for hours . I live in the desert so the shoes took quite a lot of abuse , hitting rocks on the ground , and they did n't miss a beat . This set is great .	1
They work flawlessly especially for crepes and Swedish pancakes . They hold heat well and once you get it to temp you do n't have to continuously adjust the temp gauge . Nothing stuck , even on the first cook . Looks great and its easy to clean . slowly getting rid of teflon coated pans for all cast iron and iron pans .	1
Great product	1
This griddle is just plain awesome . My only complaint is that the burners on my stove are n't large enough to heat it properly . However , since it 's cast iron , that simply means that I need to give it a few extra minutes of heating time . And it does heat uniformly given that few extra minutes even though my burners are at fault.That was my biggest reason why I desired a cast iron skillet in the first place . Because the metal one I have just did n't retain heat . It did n't matter how long I left it on the burner , the edges would not heat up.But cast iron has nice heat convection properties which means that I can make uniform pancakes every time.Ideally , even if only cooking three pancakes on this griddle , they will come out quite small . If you want the restaurant style flapjacks , you 'll need a bigger pan . But this is perfect for myself or even if serving a guest .	1
This is a great Griddle - makes cooking up single servings of pancakes , bacon , eggs , whatever a snap when it 's not enough cooking for the big griddle - love that cast iron ! ~:0 )	1
I did n't give it a 5 star only because , when it got here it was already rusting , and not pre seasoned . Still love the pan . Pancakes are simply the best on a flat cast iron pan .	1
Lodge continues to put out excellent products . This griddle heats evenly without hotspots . Great for sandwiches or pancakes . Bacon has been fixed in mine but grease has to be watched carefully to keep it from overflowing . I would recommend this griddle to anyone who wants to have a great way to fix great food .	1
Heats evenly . Can get 4 small pancakes on the griddle at once . They turned out beautifully . It is heavy but I would buy again .	1
We just got this used from my father in law . We cooked bacon and eggs over easy and the eggs came out like they were cooked on a non-stick surface . I love cast iron . Once you learn the basics , you 'll never go back to non-stick . This will last forever ( and I 'm talking 100 's of years ) .	1
I got this for a pancake pan and it works great for that , however it also works great for anything you need to turn like grilled cheese sandwiches or one-eyed jacks . It heats very evenly on a gas stove and is easy to clean .	1
The griddle arrived quickly and in good shape . The seasoning is just right , being ready for use immediately . If you are not accustomed to using cast iron , it takes a while to learn how to use it correctly . If you use electric burners , be sure to warm the griddle slowly and never use a high setting . I love how the griddle cooks evenly on its entire surface . I use very little oil , due the seasoning being naturally nonstick , and it will only get better with time .	1
I bought this amazing griddle from Target after reading the reviews on amazon . Got it for only 15 $ at Target . I used it make dosa 's ( rice and lentil pancakes ) and they turned out great . The taste was different and good as compared to dosa that I made on non-stick griddle . A great buy indeed !	1
I got mine at Target since I wanted one right away ( and for a couple bucks less than the current price here , it turned out ) . Interestingly , the Target in my yuppie college town did n't carry them , but the one in a nearby smaller town with a higher Hispanic population did.I was tired of replacing $ 30 brand-name Teflon-coated griddles every few years when they warped and the coating became funky . This Lodge Logic griddle works great , and I expect my heirs can have it when I 'm gone , as it surely wo n't wear out ! My one wish would be for a 12 '' model - I can make four pancakes on this one but they have to be smallish.As many have noted , the surface is not glass smooth , but smooth enough to work fine , and the seasoning was good out of the box . I 've made pancakes several times , grilled cheese sandwiches , browned tortillas for quesadillas and cooked meat , with very minor to no sticking . I give a one second spray with Pam before use , wash with very slightly soapy water when done , and air dry . I 've reseasoned once.I honestly wonder what 's up with all the negative reviews . I do n't know if people do n't understand cast iron or if there are some bad ones getting into the retail stream - possibly some of both . But my experience has been good .	1
This is great for baking it just takes some getting used to . Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot . Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles ( it only costs 5 to 10x as much ) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they did n't read the care instructions . But to be fair Lodge does n't say that you really need to boil water in the pan and then wpie with oil and heat before using . The pre-seasoning only shortens the seasoning process , it DOES NOT REPLACE SEASONING !	1
As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface . I have managed to find a number of these but can not locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface . That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand . However , this round griddle has worked very nicely . I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault . The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for . This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes .	1
If I 'm making corn tortillas , this is what I use to cook them . I use it in conjunction with my Cucina Pro . I also use this to heat my flour tortillas . If you keep it lightly oiled , ( just a swipe with an oiled paper towel ) , it will last several lifetimes .	1
I love love love this thing . My wife bought this for me as a gift , and I use it religiously . It 's great for making pancakes as well as warming up tortilla shells . That 's all I 've used it for but that 's all I really need it for .	1
I love this ! I 've never had an actual griddle before , and I love using this so much . I make pancakes way more than I used to now that I have this griddle to use . Have n't really made anything else on it , but I 'm sure it would make a good omelette too.Great purchase .	1
I bought two pieces of Logic cast-iron cookware for my wife as she had been talking about getting them for quite a while . Based on the reviews and the price I thought it 'd be hard to go wrong.Initially , even though we closely followed the instructions ( no soap , oil after every use , etc ) we found food stuck to the iron very , very easily . In fact , the first couple times we used them we nearly gave up because they were so difficult to cook with and clean . For example , we fried a couple of eggs and about half of the eggs remained glued to the cooking surface.We decided to buy a can of PAM non-stick spray and that helped A LOT . Even though we continue to keep them well-oiled while they are in the cabinet and clean with a 3M abrasive pad , we now use PAM before we cook and we 've had much better luck.The best thing I can tell about cast-iron is the heat conductivity and evenness . They get hot very quickly and hold heat for a long time . And for the price they are a steal . But you really got ta be patient the first few times you use them and I *highly* recommend a non-stick spray . It makes cooking and clean-up so much easier !	1
I got this because it was cheap and because our pans have all warped over time . This pan is made of very heavy durable metal . I do n't think it will ever warp considering it weights near 10 pounds . Anyways , this is a fantastic grill . Just made an egg on it and it cooked in like 4 minutes . With our warped pans , it took like 15 minutes after fidgeting the pan around on the stove level to make it level with the grill . In other words , this pan is excellent and should never warp on you . It fits our stove perfectly and I am glad I found one this cheap .	1
heavy cast iron comal . I have had this one for 2+ years now and it 's still going strong . nothing special about it , just a standard cast iron comal . keep is seasoned and it should theoretically last forever .	1
This is a terrific size . I use it on my glass-top stove and the heat distribution is good . It is big enough to cook a wide variety of items -- my most frequent are eggs , grilled veggies , and French toast . The seaoning it comes with is a good start but not nearly enough . I 've baked it several times with coconut oil ( we 're vegetarian , so no bacon or hamburger for us ) which has helped , but it still is n't quite where I 'd like it to be . It will get there , though.I like that the handle does n't get too hot at med-high temp , and I can still lift the pan off the burner without needing a mitt . At high temp though , do n't forget that mitt.When I clean , I wait until it 's a little warm , then scrape them pan off with a Pampered chef nylon scraper It works great to get the rounded bits around the edges , then you can turn the scraper over and use the squared-off end for tougher spots on the pan . After I rinse all that off , I use a Cell-O type scrubber to get the rest off . Another quick rinse , a dry with a towel , and it 's clean . I give it a little spritz of oil and rub with a paper towel , and it 's ready to go for next time . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this versatile pan . Hard to imagine I 've spent so many years paying big bucks for nonstick that only lasts a couple years when this will last forever and is healthier .	1
My mother always cooked in iron skillets and the food was wonderful . I had never had one myself . After reading some articles about it being a good thing I went for it . I love that it is made in the USA ! Lodge Logic is proud too they have a special tag on the handle makes you feel good you bought American . Well for the skillet.It comes pre-seasoned . I rinsed in in hot water to clean it as you are not to use soap . I made french toast in it this morning and it did stick in spite of the fact I had butter in the griddle . It was not ruined though . I used a metal spatula and it turned okay . The difference came it the taste . It was better . Who knew ? The clean up was easy I scraped it with the spatula under hot water dried immediately and put a light coat of oil on it while still warm . It stays warm a long time . I can remember my Mom making one skillet dinners and sitting the skillet on the table and it was hot for seconds.I am happy with the purchase , I must admit I am spoiled my nonstick but I will adjust as it does taste much better .	1
Okay , the 1 stars , are NON cast iron people , for sure.the 5 stars are vets ... .. That 's obvious . First things first , PLEASE RE-SEASON this out of the box , it 's very lightly , done , so bake it , as our mom and grandma 's did , then let dry , then use ( I suggest using a oil , with a high smoke tolerance , like peanut oil ) . After , each use , please wipe clean , and DO NOT IMMERSE , in water . These will rust out instantly . The lodge of today , is a little less IRON CLAD , than the pans made 20 years ago and longer.The size is NOT 10.5. the lip and rimming and handle are in the measurements , I will say this has a 8.25 inch cooking surface , which is great for pancakes , and 4 or 5 eggs , or 2 egg omlettes.Keep in mind , you are cooking from center out , so it will be cooler on the edges , with a gas stove , or something without a heat diffuser.are these 2nd hand ? I do n't think so , the ones in lodge stores , are LODGE PRO , which are like our parents , and grandparents . So it is reflected in the prices.For every day home use , with proper care and instruction , this will last 30 years or more . If you can find a LODGE OUTLET , store , then shop there . It 's about $ 10 bucks for this pan.Again , great for camping or home use , the weight is acceptable , not a ton , but can be portable.It 's lodge , and there are better AMERICAN brands , that are more like the one 's we had as kids ( and yes , they cost more ) . LODGE , is not what it used to be , but better than most products , 15x the price .	1
This is a must-have for pancakes . Heats very evenly , and with a little oil is non-stick ! My pancakes look beautiful and have that perfect coloring and doneness.Well worth the money ! Surprise your special person with pancakes on Sundays !	1
I have used this griddle on the stove , in the oven , and on the grill . The seasoning it came with was adequate enough for me to get started cooking right away . I am a novice at cast iron cooking but have been studying up on the best techniques to try and avoid some of the horror stories of other first time users . The first items I cooked were some hamburgers and had no problem with sticking . After several more meals ( one including a couple of strips of bacon ) I attempted an egg . I had no problem with the egg sticking and as always cleanup was a breeze . As long as you take proper care of this griddle I see no reason why it should n't last a life time with little to no sticking . On a side note , my wife has said that I have made the best tasting hamburgers and steaks while using this griddle .	1
I seasoned it a bit more before I used it the first time , but it is probably good to go out of the box . Made in the USA , and darn good quality . I doubt I 'll ever have to buy another one .	1
There are already plenty of reviews for this pan , so I wo n't waste your time with details or amusing anecdotes.Let me just say that I 've owned this pan for 15 years . I have used it 2-4 times per week during those years , mostly for tortillas , but also quesadillas , grilled cheese and other sandwiches . There is no better pan for those purposes . It is in better condition than ever and I fully expect to own it for the rest of my life .	1
Lodge Logic L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned Round Griddle , 10.5-inch works wonderful no sticking nice golden brown pancakesAny more new cast iron products that I buy will be LODGE MADE IN USA , no china junk	1
An excellent cast iron griddle at a great price ( although I would have liked one a couple of inches bigger ) . Very happy with this purchase and highly recommended .	1
My wife and I love it . Good for pancakes . No losers here . Get this pan . Keep it oiled up . Enjoy .	1
I bought the griddle to use on my new induction cooker as an interface plate - in other words I put the griddle on the induction cooker first , then put a regular pan on top of It to heat . This allows me to use my existing 'cheap ' pans with my induction cooker until I can gradually replace them with steel bottomed pans.The griddle works way better than I expected . There is no significant difference between heating a pan of water placed on the griddle as heating water in an induction ready pan ( I only have 2 of induction pans at the moment ) . A cup of water boiled in 45 seconds in an induction ready pan ( amazing ) and about 20 seconds longer with the griddle in between . I can deal with that ! It 's a shame that induction cooker manufacturers do n't sell 'affordable ' interface plates - I 've seen them online for $ 80- $ 100+ ! ! ! ! This method works for me and cost less than $ 15 !	1
Extremely useful especially with my induction cooktop . Those will not work with aluminum or ceramic pots or pans and the Lodge pans are quite heavy . But by putting this griddle on the induction cooktop I can use my lightweight aluminum pans and ceramics too . True , I lose a bit of heat efficiency but not enough to make a difference . The low lip on this griddle lets me use my pans with handles easily . I have larger Lodge cast iron pans that will not let me do this . So for use with induction cooktop this works great for me .	1
I do a lot of cooking with cast iron . In the kitchen . On the grill . In the fire pit . And especially camping . I have 4 dutch ovens , and a multitude of 12 and 10 inch skillets . But I did n't have any flat ones . Did I need this piece ? Did it meet a need none of my others were meeting ? No . But I thought for the price , why not add it to the collection . I wish I did sooner . The pre-seasoning on it is excellent . It worked like a champ from the get go . And unlike a lot of other 'pre-seasoned- pieces I have bought , there was zero sticking and it cleaned up with a rinse of water and a dry towel . Boom , done.Eggs , any style , have cooked perfectly with zero sticking . Bacon , steak , chicken , etc ... have all come out great . I love this piece .	1
I have discovered , through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan , that I am crepe-handicapped . I tried , I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail . Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently . I do love this pan though . It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook . This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with . No hot spots , no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter . If you are not crepe-challenged ( as I am ) I highly recommend this pan . You can not go wrong with lodge .	1
I love cast iron for cooking . This one is great for things that have to be turned once or twice , like pancakes or grilled cheese sandwiches . It will even hold a few scrambled eggs without spilling . It 's pre-seasoned and made in the U.S.A. Gon na get another just for the camper !	1
Cast Iron is making a comeback ! It 's healthier than non-stick , cheaper , lasts forever , retains heat like a champ , and there 's just something cool about how rustic it is.This pan has low sides , so it 's great for anything that wo n't spill over the sides -- especially if you 're going to lift it with a spatula . It 's the perfect size for personal home made pizza , great for pancakes , and anything you 'd use a griddle for.There is simply nothing better for warming or toasting tortillas or making grilled cheese.Clean up is a breeze - just throw some salt on and wipe it with a paper towel . If you really need to rinse stuff out of one of your cast iron pans -- you can use water , then just throw it back on the burner to let the residual heat dry it off.Every guy needs one of these and a 10 inch lodge skillet . You 'll want to cook your veggies , steaks or eggs in the skillet then use the two together as a grilled sandwich press .	1
The cast iron griddle , heavy and nice is very good . Tried making pancakes , and Indian crepes . ( dosa , adai ) . It comes out crisp and tasty . I am using on glass stovetops and no issues . The handle becomes very hot and you have to be extremely careful not to lift after cooking . Should leave for 30 min or use kitchen towels to lift and keep it aside . I have loaded couple of pictures with dosa making on them in the picture section of the product .	1
We have several cast iron skillets , etc . We absolutely love them and make cooking so much better . I highly recommend for any cooking options . I have made small pizzas on this and love it.. Nice thin crust !	1
Cheap and relatively light for cast iron ( relatively ! ) , it 's not the greatest , but it works . You do have to keep it seasoned , of course . We use it occasionally at our cabin , and it 's fine for once-in-a-while use - blackening trout or salmon , for example .	1
I use this for camping . Cast iron ca n't be beat for durability . Just follow directions for the care of it and you 'll never have a problem .	1
I like it the price was ok and it is very very sturdy . Easy to cook on and is non stick when seasoned	1
BEST EGGS . BEST PANCAKES . I 'm a super picky eater , but this cooks stuff perfectly ! ! ! My wife loves it b/c I 'm gobbling everything that touches it . This is great for actually flipping an egg without scraping the crap out of it	1
I am working on getting my kitchen equipped properly and this makes a fine addition . I had no doubt it would arrive undamaged , ( it is cast IRON after all ) and it did . It is just like the one my mom taught me to cook on . I could not be happier with it !	1
This is the best griddle for making pancakes and homemade tortillas . I love that the heat is even distributed and consistent .	1
This is a nice cast iron griddle . I mostly use it when making tortillas but have used it for a few other things as well . I make sure to clean it well and afterward dry it really well . I also take a paper towel and dip it in olive oil and wipe the griddle down with it after each use . I feel this has helped to keep it in great condition .	1
The edges of the handle are rough , which is only an issue when handling a cold pan . The rough edge might actually help to get a good grip with a potholder . Good ? Bad ? It is up in the air . But one star deducted nevertheless for less than smooth construction.Rating will be reduced to one star if my girlfriend tries to hit me with it . `` I 'm not upset with you , my darling ... ... ..just go to sleep ... ... .. ''	1
Griddle came yesterday and like all my cast iron I seasoned it . Washed with hot water , dryed it and put a light coating of veggie oil on the entire pan and baked in the oven upside down at 350 degrees for an hour . This extra step is worth it and as long as you do not use soap you do not need to do it again.Used the griddle today to make pancakes and it was completely non-stick . Not only is it healthier to cook with it browns the pancakes much better than a non-stick griddle . Cleanup was easy , just wiped with a paper towel . Lodge is the best !	1
This is a great pre-seasoned griddle , I make perfect pancakes and crepes everytime . I usually add a teaspoon of vegetable oil before cooking to keep the surface extra slick although I probably do n't need to . Making crepes is as easy as making soup from a can . Be aware that the handle gets hot so keep an oven mitt close by and follow the cleaning instructions , you do n't wash this with soap or stick it in the dishwasher . This is one of the few lifetime purchases you can get for under 20 bucks . So cheap I 'm going to buy another one .	1
After becoming pregnant , I 've tried to carry water with my everywhere and not in a plastic container ( due to chemicals , BPA , etc . ) This sig coated aluminum works great - it does n't have a taste and it cleans very easily with a bottle brush , and the lid with the hole is very very handy for toting around on my finger or carrying with one hand.I 've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now , but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle , which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of , but that would definitely have shattered by now . The little dents do n't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine . I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse , and this has never once leaked on me . It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too .	1
I didnt buy it for its trendy looks , altho it is nice looking . But I bought it for its ability to be recycled.Some say the paint chips if you drop it , thats true altho no big deal to me . I 'd rather have less paint from the getgo , on it as thats makes it even more eco-friendly.The bottle will `` sweat '' with ice cold water in it so could get things wet in your purse/ backpack etc.But the bottle itself does NOT leak.Also if you ride a bicycle with it , you have to stop & unscrew the cover to get a drink , not like the squeeze bottles in which you could continue to ride & drink .	1
I like this because it fits my cup holders well . I also do n't notice too much taste , although there is a slight metallic taste to the water . I dislike how the finish will chip off the bottom easily .	1
This is a very useful size . It holds one liter and I keep it in my car whenever I am out on the road on writing or photography assignments . It 's a good strong container with a nice finish .	1
The Sigg Traveler Classic Water Bottle ( 0.6-Liters , Dark Blue ) is a beautiful bottle . The color pops and the style is highly `` with it '' . I purchased this bottle thinking that it would be the perfect size for me , especially since it 's a little bigger than a normal plastic waterbottle , but I typically finish this off in three or four swigs . This is probably because the water seems so `` pure '' and clean.PROS : * Aesthetically pleasing* Lightweight* Easy open , close* Good Seal* Great for a portable ( short distance ) water bottle* Pure , clean tasting waterSlight CONS : * Easily dent-able ( take some extra care to not to drop or dent it ) * Slightly small if using to take out to the tennis courts or basketball courts . ( go with 1-liter instead ) * Can be hard to clean due to small opening ( use water only , and you 'll be fine without going with a hardcore cleaning ) .Overall , I highly recommend this bottle if you need one that 's portable , fashionable , and light weight . However keep it mind that the water taste so good , that you 'll drink it all down fast . ; )	1
*****This is an upscale designer water bottle , top of the line in every way . The designs of Sigg 's water bottles are gorgeous , from the plain , solid color bottles ( like this one ) , to others with intricate designs . I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns , even though I thought a permanent bottle like this would take more work to maintain . These do necessitate regular cleaning ( I clean mine every day ) , but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning less of a chore . Sort of like my rings , glasses , and watch , I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory , reminding me to drink more water , making a statement about my values , and expressing myself with a special design.Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality , made of light aluminum on the outside , slightly insulated , and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever , unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles . They are light , durable , and perfect for any activity . Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles , just like from the tap . They do dent if dropped on a hard surface at a particular angle , but Sigg fans ( including me ) view this as a type of `` seasoning '' , so that your bottle acquires character . The dents are on the outside layer of the bottle , not the inside layer and so do n't interfere with any functionality.Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops . This bottle has a screw top , which I prefer . I do n't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink . It is totally leak proof , which is important to me . The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabineer . If you ever lose the top , you can buy them separately.Sigg makes their personal water bottle in many sizes . I use the .6L size as my basic every day size , and keep it in my briefcase . It is a bit too large for my purse , although if you carry a tote it is an ideal size . It is also good for sports activities that require less water , like shorter walks . For my car and other uses I use the larger 1L size.This bottle may seem expensive , but it is so durable that you can plan on it lasting many years . I consider Sigg bottles both an accessory and an investment in my health , so they are well worth it value-wise for me.Note that Sigg water bottles should not be used to contain boiling water , as this will damage the outer coating . They also can not be left in the freezer , as it may crack . They can be used for carbonated beverages , if you leave about a half inch of room at the top.Highly recommended . *****	1
Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit . I bought these to replace them and I really like them . The fit is really nice and they are comfortable . The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges . I did n't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver . The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on . Perhaps putting some locktite might help there .	1
These are low-profile and work well . Not as well as a pair of non-electronic earpro , but still very well . The volume feature is nice and it does allow for normal or improved hearing when it 's not dampening sound.Some caveats:1 . The opening of the battery compartment was a bit difficult , but not insurmountably so . Best used with a tool , like a screwdriver.2 . Do remember to turn these off when not using them !	1
These earmuffs are amazing . The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob , when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to , they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable .	1
This muffs are great for the price.People complain about the muffs coming on when stored in range bag but as long as you store it good they wo n't come on.They fit nice and tight and keep load noise out but i can hold a conversation with anyone standing next to me and hear them just fine while wearing them .	1
Thank you for the nice ear protectors ! I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent.I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how.It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup.I like it 's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball .	1
As a firearms instructor and Chief Range Safety Officer , I literally live in my & # 34 ; muffs & # 34 ; .These are comfortable , light , provide long battery life and thinner than others - allows comfortable cheek weld .	1
These are great headsets for recreational shooting and the like . I purchased them primarily for recreation , but gave them a try at work . They fit well under a helmet , but I am still not quite sold on them for that purpose . They are low profile and fit under an ACH easily enough , but I believe they are best suited for recreational use.The batteries are a real pain to get to , but they seem to last a good while . I went through 3 full days worth of shooting with the volume turned all the way up , and they were still going strong when I was done . It is easy to forget to turn these guys off , so you have to be very deliberate about it . There is not automatic shut off as with other brands.They are comfortable . The headband is relatively low profile and if you 're not wearing a helmet . They are easily adjustable for different head sizes . They sound very good , and the wind does n't seem to affect them much . I do n't know if that would change if the little foam covers came off the mics though . Overall , they seem pretty tough.They sound good and speech is easy to understand while wearing them . When shooting , there is no noticeable mute on/off with the electronic sound attenuation ... it cuts off the sound and comes back so fast that it simply sounds like the shots are n't loud . When having a conversation , you ca n't even notice them in action . I 've used some others that had a very noticeable mute effect with slow reaction time ... very frustrating and distracting.Either way , after a couple months worth of use , they still work well and seem like a pretty solid product .	1
These are great for my recreational shooting . The volume level is perfect , and dampen noise perfectly when shooting . Also they are fairly comfortable for a day of shooting . Only gripe is no matter how often I check to make sure they 're off , I will go to use them and notice the were turned on and the batteries are dead . I have resorted to popping batteries out just to make sure .	1
must have electronic ears for hearing range instructions yet still protecting ears . I can turn the volume up to enhance my hearing even but the electronic automatic decibel filtering protects my ears great . once you use quality electronic ears you will wonder at why everyone does n't use them . solid investment	1
The only issue I had with these was that if I had my sunglasses on while shooting , the sides of my head would start to ache as these pushed the frame of the sunglasses into it . My friend has a pair of Oakley 's that are flat on the sides , rather than rounded like mine and he says he has no problems with it.Otherwise , these things are great . Crystal clear hearing , but blocks out anything dangerous . Would buy again .	1
I purchased this item for a friend of mine and as well as for myself and we both really enjoy them because they amplify the sounds that you hear around you except for loud noises such as gunshots . Its like wearing the regular type of ear muffs , but with the ability to hear and then some . We use them for hog hunting and these hearing protectors allow you to hear what is going on around you as well your conversations as if you we not wearing them at all.I am not sure why people complain about them being uncomfortable , but I wore them for over 5 hours and not a problem and they folded up nice and neat just like when they arrived.I would highly recommend them and they take a total of 4 AAA batteries two in each piece and you can control the volume individually . I would buy them again . They will not leave you a ringing sound such as wearing nothing at all .	1
These are great ... work well , fold up nicely to store in bag , and have a clean look to them . The volume control works great ... allows you to hear normal conversations but blocks out the loud noises you need to block . I 've used weekly for months now and am very pleased with them .	1
have not been able to test these at the shooting range but it appears that these will hold up fairly well . however i see only two cons1 . battery replacement is a major pain not a simple task and instructions are pretty pointless for it2 . the cushioning on the piece had torn slightly will trying to replace the batteries . pretty bummed but overall wont affect the performance	1
I 've had these about a year now and they 've worked great . I like to shoot and hunt a lot so good hearing protection was important to me . Its nice to be protected but still be able to hear instructions while at the range and hear my surroundings when I 'm out hunting . I keep them in the original packaging to keep them from turning on by in my range bag . The directions on how to change the batteries are clear and they 're not that hard to change out .	1
These 'ears ' are lightweight , thin ( but not too thin ) , and will be perfect at the range for just a few hours or a day of competition . I wish these were going to be mine ; but we bought them as a raffle item for our club . I just may have to get a pair for myself .	1
I am very much pleased with these muffs ! This year I had so much trouble hunting . I shoot a 7 mag , thats a loud mother but I always want to be able to hear . In the past I have kept my muffs pulled up above my ear slightly . Problem there is , it starts to hurt your ear , it bends the ear 's natural fold to where I can only hear whats directly beside me and you run the risk of scaring game when repositioning them . My fiance has sat with me to be extra eyes and ears and she wore no muffs , luckily I never took a shot.All those problems made me finally break down and say I 'm going a new route . I 'm so pleased with the 97044s . They look sleak , they feel sturdy and they fold up to a compact size . They fit comfortable and tight . The amplification of my hearing ability is awesome ! A real upper hand when hunting . Battery life seems to be decent too . I will agree with the review that said battery placement and changing is difficult and could have been better designed , but I 've got it down now , so no more problems there.As for the dB rating , I can believe it . When I first put them on , I did a series of hand claps and other noises in front of the mics . Cut right out just as promised . Confident with it I shot my 7 and my PLR-16 ( which is ungodly loud with a muzzle break ) and 100 % satisfaction . I 've seen some reviews saying that the 97044s did not work well , I 'm going to contribute it to maybe Peltor is n't consistant with product quality ? As for the delay time after the cut out , who cares ? I do n't take a shot and then carry on an important conversation immediately . There is a few seconds delay but I mean come on , for general usage , is that really a problem ? It does not bother me in the least bit.I 'm no expert on shooting muffs , but my range junkie buddies tell me there is a lot better quality protection out , but for the price these are outstanding muffs . Thats why I did n't rate them a full 5 stars , because they have been improved upon . But the quality I got for the price is unbeatable . I will be ordering more for family and friends before this year 's deer season .	1
I wore these for a week straight while teaching and they gave a flawless performance.These also have performed quite well while shooting rifle due to their low profile earpieces . I would highly recommend these over lower priced alternatives . Spend a little more on these , it will be worth it !	1
So far I am pleased with this product . They are comfortable and fit well . The mics work well and have decent sound quality .	1
Just received the unit and stepped out the door to visit the range . The headset is quite comfortable . I have found many other brands to be uncomfortable . Someone was shooting a 50bmg and my ears were protected . I wear hearing aids under the ear muffs and the protection was still excellent . The muff does push up somewhat when using a rifle , but not enough to move away from the ear . The attenuation is perfect , hardly noticing the drop in volume .	1
Not much to say about the 3M Peltor Tactical 6S Active Volume Hearing Protector . I have used them for years on and off the range.I have ordered three set 's and gave them to my 6 year old grandson , son in law and daughter . Just think if you loose your hearing you ca n't hear your family if they need HELP . It 's better to be safe than sorry .	1
What can I say , they work , they are comfortable and I would buy them again when I am in the market	1
Excellent hearing protection up to .50 cal BMG . These fit underneath your helmet for CMP shoots . They cycle between off and on quickly when firing and make it possible to hold a conversation on the range . I would recommend every Marine get a pair .	1
Excellent service . I have n't had a chance to try them while shooting/hunting yet . They have performed great so far just wearing them around the house . They surpress the least little loud/sharp noise . I do wish the volume would go a little higher/louder though . I believe they will work great for hunting/shooting .	1
I had to edit this because I gave it a 2 star rating.The compass is good but I would not suggest it for a beginner.It 's a bit hard to aim and that takes time but is excellent when plotting a map.With some practice it will work good as you get used to it.I looks better in real life but is not the pull out of your pocket and aim.I always tell people to get the Military style for aiming and taking readings and a cheaper flat Brunton for plotting on a map.For aiming this compass must be held 100 % or very close to levelThe picture looks much , much better.You have to remove the compass out of the black rubber base and there you find a mini instruction book.I purchased cheap survival kits from Amazon that has the clear base plate in the kit.I just came in from outdoors and I used a military set up to locate the North Star and the cheap compass that comes with a pocket survival kit was spot on with this high priced all plastic compass.The stiff plastic the compass comes in was just put inside one of those thin tear proof postal bags rather then a box , .The plastic that held the compass was split open on one side.This should have been placed in a sturdy small box.Save your money and get the $ 12,00 base plate type and the Military Sandy 183.Sighting with the mirror is a big jokeWilderness Elite Search & Rescue.Wilderness Survival Training.Severe Weather-Swift Water Pet Rescue ( 609 ) 638-1629	1
I got this compass because many on the net have referred this as the best compass on the market . I think this may be too much for most users but if you want the best this is it . Its a professional grade product with a lifetime warrantee so you cant really go wrong . Its a little bulkier than most other compasses I have used but it does have a nice rubber housing which doubles as a pencil eraser ( for erasing pencil marks on topo maps ) and a bunch of referenc cards housed behind the compass . This compass includes an inclinometer for measuring slope grades but I have not had the opportunity to use this feature . Good for orienteering , SAR work , professional pursuits ... .but might be overkill for general outdoor use .	1
The limited description of this compass did not do it justice . The main body of the compass is surrounded by a tough grey plastic that comprises the cover and the sighting reflector . I say reflector as this is really a reflecting tape and not a mirror of either plastic or glass . The tape used however is of fairly high quality and gives a very clear and flat reflection with no distortion . If the tape ever becomes damaged from use it should n't be too difficult to replace . My guess is that was why they chose this method , not to mention the obvious cost savings in production . The entire unit and cover seat firmly in a dense black rubber base . The base cushions the compass appropriately during hard use and has a location for the included lanyard . The compass comes with a full instruction booklet , but since that is difficult to bring along a miniature version of the booklet and other handy guide cards are seated under the compass for emergency use . The dial is quick and extremely accurate . The dial also appears to be fluid filled and my guess is it would be filled with mineral oil like high grade automotive gauges . This would be to minimize shock to the dial when dropped.This compass does more than simply point you in a straight line as others do . This is a full navigational instrument designed to be utilized with maps . My compass even came with a code for five free maps from National Geographic . There are a lot more features on this compass than I was expecting . There was a definite reason this was chosen by many other reviews online as the best hiking compass out there , and it does not disappoint . I can not wait to take this on my next trail adventure !	1
This compass is just what you need if you 're trying to navigate using maps . It 's well made and very reasonably priced.The compass is easy to read and is well damped by the liquid inside.This is n't the type of compass you 'd want to use for regular hiking , but it very well suited for use with maps and charts . Since it does n't fold , you 'd have a hard time putting it in your pocket.For normal hiking , I prefer a lensatic compass . It 's very easy to shoot a bearing to a landmark . Brunton makes a pretty decent unit .	1
Much bigger than I expected , but not too big , and seems good quality . I think this will last quite a while .	1
It works as anticipated . Good quality and no complaints about the precision . It arrived intact and I received it the same week I ordered it .	1
i had been using the junky compass i had when i was boy scout for the last 20 years . this was a great , cheap , high quality upgrade to add to my travel kit . i never travel without a compass and this one is really nice . it has adjustable declination , too , which is a nice touch .	1
This seems like a sturdy item , so we purchased it for our newest Boy Scout as part of his Christmas gift . It looks like just what he needs , and we anticipate many yeas of camping and hiking use from it . Will update our review as the item sees more use : o )	1
This is a good practical compass , about perfect for hiking . ( It comes with a lanyard , not shown . ) It 's a good value . jt/VT	1
When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones , I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations . Not a problem in my case , but thought you 'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family ( see my Listmania lists ) . I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles , but the compass is a little too wide to fit , so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway .	1
This an excellent , inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating . I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work , but I just use it in the car . It has good visibility , is lightweight , accurate , and best of all , does n't cost that much . It 's cheap enough so that if I lose it , I can buy another one , and it 's more than accurate enough for my needs . I like the green baseplate , which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it . The needle is quite responsive , and you do n't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses . All in all a good , decent quality , inexpensive compass .	1
This is a compass , not much to say about it . Its lightweight , works as advertised . I keep it in my backpack when I go hiking . Works well , does n't get stuck , easy to read . No complaints !	1
Good tool on the trail , gets the job done . Simple , lite , EZ to read , lanyard hole for neck carry.All you need in the wilderness with a good map .	1
This is the perfect baseball for having a baseball player sign . Autograph will not fade because of baseball aging . I use it for top stars	1
This was a Christmas gift for my grandson , he was very excited to receive his 1st official baseball . Could n't wait to start tossing it around .	1
This is a great ball that was used throughout the 2013 Major League Baseball season . Is nicely stitched and is nicely boxed .	1
It is what you would expect a official MLB Rawlings baseball . It comes in a cardboard box with a piece of tissue paper . The reason only 4 stars is one of the 2 balls i bought had a minor blemish right on the sweat spot . The spot was small enough and I was using the ball for a autograph right away so there was n't anytime to replace it.There is another option that comes in a acrylic display case that you can find for about the same price if you look around which will save you buying a separate display case later if you plan on displaying the ball.If your buying this for a autograph you ca n't get better than a ROMLB but if your getting something signed maybe plan ahead so you get a flawless ball or buy one in a display case from a store so you can see it before you buy .	1
The description was n't super clear as to whether or not this was the version with the case . I rolled the dice because I thought I had the right model number . Yup ! Came with the case ! Now both my boys have Mike Matheny 's autograph sealed in the case and on the trophy shelf !	1
Rawlings is probably the best name in baseballs and this one is a Major League . Cant do better !	1
Not sure what I can say other than it looks , smells and feels like a real baseball and my son loves it .	1
The Airzooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20 ' or so . We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit ! The Airzooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own , but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone ( young and old ) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up ( Note : No animals were harmed in the writing of this review : - ) Recommended !	1
I purchased one each for my niece and nephew . Almost ordered one for myself ! I recalled when I was a child , something like this was out there & I recall being amazed and in general having a fun time all around . Who can resist shooting the dog with a puff of air or even more nefarious escapades ; - ) ? ! ? Well , when I saw this , I decided that the younger generation should have some of the same fun , rather than just another video game ( how in the world do you lovingly torment your pet with one of those ? ? ) .Needless to say , the kids have had a BLAST ( pun intended ) . Smiles all around ! Issues include difficulty and frustration in assembly , large size ( yes , I understand the reasons/physics for the size ) , and durability over the long haul.Still , when the snow is freshly fallen and you send a blast of air at a pile between yourself and your unsuspecting friend or family member -- well what more needs to be said ? ? ! !	1
It 's fun for kids and adults who will let themselves be silly enough to use it . Makes a great gift for the little trouble maker in your life .	1
I bought one as a gift and the kids loved it.Instructions was n't that helpful in the beginning and I suggest that the parents should assemble it before giving it to the kids.It 's so fun , but the plastic sheet crumbled on the use , but so far so good it did n't break or anything.I Recommend it .	1
They love it and you cant hurt anything with it..but dont let them do it to the bird in the house..trust me on this one .	1
This thing is really pretty amazing . I took it to work and annoyed people with it all day . It will shoot an air-ball at least 20 feet or so . My son uses it until we make him quit shooting his sisters with it . The dog hates it . It has been pretty durable as we have had ours more than two years . The `` sights '' are decently accurate also if you use them correctly.I bought mine for $ 5.00 at a `` dollar '' type store . At $ 15.00-20.00 , I probably would not have bought it . But now that I have it , I would say I have gotten at least $ 50.00 worth of fun out of it.Anyway , it is really nifty how this thing can shoot a ball of air across a room .	1
Fun toy that takes some getting used to . Plan to spend some time chasing this thing before you get the hang of it . Make sure to use this in WIDE open areas and on grass , turf or other soft grounded areas . Asphalt and sidewalks will tear it up pretty quickly and the gashes/chips can effect the boomerangs desired flight trajectory . Other than that it 's a lot of fun to toss around . : - )	1
it took a little getting used to but it did start coming back . it has brief instructions on itself and more detailed ones on the packaging . it seems durable . it 's cheap . and it 's cool . it could be even better if you could choose colors and if it came with flashing LED lights . also , you will now hate trees , like a lot .	1
The instructions on this boomerang are so easy to follow that my 12 year-old daughter had it coming back by her third throw . Compared to all the other boomerangs I have seen , it is the best flying at a low price . It is very forgiving when thrown at angles causing it to dive . The instructions on all my wooden boomerangs warn that at a certain angle , they will climb to their last flight and dive to the ground causing them to break . This one has hit the ground like that with no damage . It is best to throw it in a big , wide open field , as it flies quite far with minimal effort , and as it is fairly soft , it may be best to avoid direct impact with surfaces hard , rough or sharp .	1
I did not expect a boomerang to be this shape . At first this toy can be frustrating to use because you have to figure out how to throw it properly . I highly recommend to use this toy in a large space because this thing flies up and around is a large loop . You may need to do some tweaking to the fins at the end to make the toy work properly .	1
I keep the aerobies in the trunk . Any time the weather is nice , my son and I will run out to the field and toss it around . He enjoys the boomerang the most . If u practice with different throwing angles it will come back to you , kinda sorta !	1
This things work well but you need a lot of room to get a full swing . Its takes a little practice to throw it correctly but once you get the technique down its a lot of fun . It travels a long distance so you 'll need a big open area to enjoy this little toy . Quality is good and it takes a hard crash well .	1
These are a lot of fun , but do take some practice . Unfortunately just as we were getting the hang of them my brother 's labs decided they were great chew toys ... ..so the product is good - the dogs - bad !	1
I was skeptical at first about this boomerang because I figured it would not work however , to my surprise it was very functional as a boomerang and is hours of fun waiting to happen . I would recommend this boomerang for all ages because after a little while of practice and tweaking the boomerang it turns into one of the most fun things to play with .	1
Beautiful Knife ! The craftmanship is excellent and the handles look Great ! You just ca n't go wrong with this knife or any of there knives for that matter !	1
Great tool , it has a lot of useful blades and tools , it has gotten me out of some trouble , the blades come supersharp right out the box , the corckscrew is a bit difficult to operate but you can youtube a how to video and you will learn how to use it properly , it goes with me everywhere I go .	1
I always been a long term fan of these knives . swiss makes great pocket knives..i love it this one has a nice tech cool look , great e.d.c knife .	1
For those who do n't know , Spartan is the old Officer 's and Sports knife , one of e very first products of Victorinox as Swiss Army supplier . After some years , the name has changed for Standard , and after some more time , Spartan.It is a serious knife , period . It is not a simple knife or a toy . It IS the Swiss Army Officer 's knife itself with implements that will be helpful in any time or situation . There are large blade , small blade , can opener , bottle opener , wire bender , 2 screwdrivers , reamer with sewing eye , corkscrew , keyring , pin , tweezers and toothpic . Tthat is enough to be used in daily basis , more than once.Other Victorinox models are more complete and more useful for specific situations , but Spartan is useful for ALL situations ! There are many facts about rescue , emergency , mechanics or homecare that Spartan saves the day.I have the Limited Edition ( curiously not for sale at Amazon ) that is numbered and with an exclusive fob.I am a fan of Victorinox Spartan ! I gave one to my son , and also for my boss . This is the must have and the price is more than good !	1
I have had many working knives over the last ~40yrs and this may be the best pocket knife I 've ever used . I keep returning to the Spartan after I loan them out , lose them , or drop them in a lake.It has all the essentials in a tidy , two-slot package.The blades can be kept sharp with minimal effort . Most SAKs ( including this one ) are slip-joints rather than locking blades so do exercise awareness , like you did when you got your Totin ' Chip . : - ) Best can opener , IMO , of any knife , and I have opened more than one or two bottles of vino in my time . The corkscrew also has other uses ; the tip is useful as a hook . Bottle opener ( `` cap lifter '' ) is very good and requires no fiddling or repositioning the way lesser ones do . The awl sees more use as a package slitter than awl in my use.If you decide to EDC a small SAK like this I recommend a lanyard that hangs out of your pocket ; it will make extraction easier and once out of the pocket it will be in a predictable position so you do n't have to hunt for the correct blade.BTW , if the functionality and value of this knife appeal to you but you need a fixed blade , check out the Mora knives from Sweden .	1
I use this if I travel mostly for the wine opener . Seriously if you want to open wine while traveling and its not a screw top why not have this on you . Also it does userfull stuff like cut things , screw 's things , punctures things with the awl and lastly manicures things . Its also inexpensive , highly corrosive resistant and RED . They come in two different models that either do/dont have a tooth pick , tweezers . I DONT have the tweezers on mine simply because you end up loosing them constantly and having that empty hole on the handle bugs me . SO i figured to go with out it .	1
I 've always loved carrying the Victorinox Spartan , and have done so since 1976 . It has the right mix of tools for almost any everyday need without being too fat or tool-rich to be unwieldy in the hand . The bottle opener and corkscrew , as you might imagine , make it a hit at parties.What I love about this one is the hardwood handle , which remarkably improves ones grip . It 's become my everyday pocketknife ( except at airports , of course ) , and I 'm pleased to carry it .	1
I bought my first Spartan in 1979 . I have been using it since then and love it . I also gave some as gifts to my brother and to friends . Not a single complaint . What I like most about it is that it has all the essentials - can opener , bottle opener , cork screw and screwdrivers . The tweezers and toothpick make it even more complete . It is not a multi-tool , but it is a compact , everyday handy tool , without frills.I finally had to buy a replacement because my daughter wanted one to go camping - except for a few scratches it looks as good as new and works like new.I Highly recommend it .	1
The Victorinox Spartan is today 's original Swiss officer 's knife , a reliable , lightweight and versatile everyday-carry tool . This model benefits from elegant hardwood scales that make it particularly attractive and a joy to use , since the wooden surfaces provide extra grip for delicate manoeuvres , like opening a bottle of your favourite swill . This is a high-quality knife that you may depend upon , and it is beautiful , too -- you will not regret the purchase .	1
This is my 3rd or 4th Spartan . It cuts , opens drinks , corks , screw drivers ... It remains flat in my pants pocket . It 's not particularly heavy for an everyday carry knife . The only thing that could make it a better knife for me , would be a single hand opening main knife blade . My other everyday carry knives open with a flick of my thumb , so when I go to open this , `` oh yeah ... 2 hands ... '' Other than that , I can not recommend this knife enough.I tend to buy the red one for loss prevention .	1
Bought these as a wedding gift to my groomsmen . Decided on the black over the traditional red . This is a timeless tool setup and can do almost anything imaginable . I know some knives include other tools like scissors , magnifying glasses , etc , but this setup will perform for almost every task , remain small enough to not be a bother in your pocket , and large enough that you wo n't misplace it.The black looks great with the stainless . So good , in fact , that I went back and purchased one for myself after the wedding . Makes a great groomsmen gift as the price is set perfectly to make this a cheap and awesome gift.I ca n't imagine a single complaint someone would have with one of these knives . Only recommendation I would give is purchasing the small screwdriver that fits in the corkscrew . For anyone with glasses , that thing comes in handy ! It 's also a great thing to have for others around you when someone 's set of glasses breaks and you do n't have a drug store or grocery store near by .	1
The Victorinox Spartan Swiss Army Knife ( SAK ) is an absolute classic knife . This SAK is also a great `` first knife '' for a young man to introduce him to the utility of a good knife that will last well into his adult life . Of course , it is also a good choice for a young lady . This well-made knife has 12 tools that function as designed . There is just something majestic about the red Swiss Army Knife . It gives the confidence of a utilitarian multi-functional knife that is made to last for years . If you ever received a SAK as a young man you know exactly what I mean.Pros : + Lifetime warranty+ Quality workmanship+ 12 useful tools+ Stainless steel and it is easy to care for the blades and tools+ Makes a great birthday or holiday gift+ Will last for years+ Easy to sharpen the blades+ Looks and feels great+ Simplistic yet eloquent+ Reasonably pricedCons : - Really ! The only con to this knife is not owning one . Even if you are a knife enthusiast with more knives than you could possibly use do not skip this knife as part of your collection.I highly recommend the Victorinox Spartan Swiss Army Knife . It is a great EDC knife , makes for an awesome gift , and it will last for years . You will not go wrong with this knife and you will not be disappointed .	1
Excellent pocket knife when you want more than just blades but not too much for the pocket . The very first Victorinox I bought was a Spartan in November 17 , 1987 and it did not have the toothpick or tweezers and I do not believe the reamer had a sewing eye either but I thought it was the greatest knife .	1
I 've been very happy with my purchase . My Koolatron kept drinks and snacks very cold with no problem . As other reviewers have already noted you need to power up the unit roughly 12 hours prior to loading it with items you want to keep it cold . This unit is not a refrigerator so if you pack it with items not chilled already in refrigerator then it will be a long time before things get cold.Whether my unit will be reliable long term I can not say but on my recent use I have used it four days straight without a problem .	1
I keep this cooler in the trunk of my Audi A4 , which is n't a very large trunk , and I use it primarily when I travel . I take it out and into the house when we need an extra cooler for parties with lots of guests . My wife thinks it & # 34 ; whines & # 34 ; but I think all coolers of this design do something like that and , after awhile , I do n't hear it . I take it into motel rooms with me when I travel and use the AC adapter , and it has operated flawlessly . It is designed to fit into small spaces , like the footwell in the back seat of a car , so it 's understandably a low volume cooler . I like that it has a carry handle . The lid has no lock ; it 's just gravity that holds it down , but I do n't find a problem with that . To my ear , it makes a whirring sound that you 'd expect from a small fan , and what matters is that the cooler keeps things delightfully cold and does n't take up too much room in the vehicle when I travel . I use it to sit on sometimes when car camping , but I would n't want to stand on it . It is what it looks like , and mine meets my expectations entirely .	1
Product seems well made and arrived in good order . The only thing that I have found bad about it is the fan makes some pretty loud noise . I think it may bother me when I have it in a motel room ( I also bought the AC adapter ) .I have some experience with this type cooler and the others I have used did not have as loud of fan.On the plus side : It fits where I wanted it behind my drivers seat , so my front seat passenger can reach back and open it easily . Quality feel to it and it is not too heavy.The instructions say only use in heat mode 'up to 45 minutes ' if that makes a difference to anyone .	1
I got this as a gift from my girlfriend and i could n't be happier with it.I 'm a OTR truck driver and I really appreciate being able to take food & drinks with me.What I really like about this cooler is the taller & skinny shape it is.It fits perfectly behind the seat or in the cubby holes that i have in the sleeper.It also is a 12v type model so I have my running throughout the day while i 'm driving.You can also reverse the plug setting and turn it into a food warmer which i have never used.Its nice to wake up in the morning and have some cold juice & yogurt.For lunch & dinner i can have my leftovers & frozen foods in it.I feel this a perfect size for a solo driver , as it serves me well.UPDATE 4/11= I 'm stilling enjoying having my cooler with me , its so nice to have milk & cookies at the end of the day.It keeps all my regular food cold too , like BBQ , wings , cheese , hotpockets , milk , pop , & juice.I have had this for 4 months now , and it works like a charm.If you do a lot of traveling or our a solo trucker , this is prefect for you .	1
I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked , as quiet as a whisper . The power consumption is reasonable . If battery drain is a concern , once the Koolatron is cold you can unplug it for a while and it will stay cool for quite some time.The only thing I had to watch out for was that it froze my soda pop because I used it in a cool environment when it should have been switched off . Only the things in the very bottom of the cooler froze . Everything else was just fine.The Koolatron is attractive with contemporary colors - white , beige , and grey . It 's slender rectangular profile is proportioned for pop or beer cans to fit perfectly . It 's a well thought out product worth what they are asking for it . Cool stuff.Overall , I am very happy with this purchase and am excited that I finally have a safe means for storing food in my camper van .	1
Arrived on time and as agreed . This is a sturdy and perfect solution for traveling with expensive equipment . Pluck foam was very easy to use & I added TSA locks for secure travel . I 'm very happy with this purchase . Bought this and a smaller one . Both are excellent .	1
Strong , large and quality . The handle is strong enough to pack it full of gold if you wanted.Great dark tone of black . Just ... ca n't get a better case	1
This is one tough case . Big enough for all my video stuff . Nice looking as well . It feels like it could fall out of an airplane and my gear would survive . I like that i can make the foam into whatever shape i need . Case latches are very good .	1
Got this case for a projector I received that did n't come with its own case . Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty . I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs . The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment . Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector , the cord and the remote . ( Useful tip - purchase a container of desiccant if you are going to store electronics or other sensitive equipment in this to absorb any moisture )	1
This little gem is amazing for putting a really fine edge on your blades . After you have worked with your stones and have your angles correct , this combo really makes the difference in the finished product ! A great addition to your shop or field sharpening routine .	1
Love this sharpener , I have yet to hone in my skills using it without guides to control my edge angle . But it works well , and I like the tuck away into handle feature.I would recommend this .	1
In a single stone sharpening a complete kit , I really like that it is compact and easy to carry what I do not like is its weight , to be as small heavy .	1
I have been sharpening my large and ever expanding collection of knives for over 30 years . if you have the skills to maintain an angle by hand while sharpening ( to insure that you do not bevel-out your edge ) then this is a fantastic all around knife sharpener at a great price ( The price is half that of a DMT dual sided diamond sharpener ) . It is my first choice to use as a quick `` medium-ish '' grit sharpener among over a dozen of portable knife sharpeners which I own.if you ca n't properly maintain an angle when sharpening ( no shame , it 's takes a lot of practice ! ) , but still need a portable/field sharpener , a simple Smith or Lansky `` keychain '' solution ( Smith 2-Step or Lansky Quick Fix ) sharpeners will do you pretty well , so long as you are conservative with the Carbide use . If you have the skills to hand hone , but are looking to shave a few ounces over the DCS4 , or need a courser or smoother combo option , then the DMT Dual sided are a nice way to go , if you can afford them . ( though they do n't feel quite as solid as the Smith DCS4 due to the Smith 's larger diameter handle ) .Considering it 's value , for the tool bag or bug-out bag , the DCS4 is a great `` one sharpener '' solution .	1
I just love this thing . It sharpens my broadheads , hunting knives , kitchen knives , snowboard edges , axe head , pruning shears , kitchen scissors , etc ... etc ... etc ... I 'm really glad I have it and IT JUST WORKS . All my blades are razor sharp now .	1
It sharpens knives , nuff said ! Nice and compact sharpening surface fits into handle , light weight you get what you paid for . Though I do n't recomend sharpening your knives/blades while drunk you may scratch up your blades lol like I did to one of my knives .	1
It 's lightweight , very handy , packs away quite easily and is easy to hold while sharpening . I highly recommend this sharpener .	1
Very packable and actually sharpens quite well . Mostly use the coarse side but a few passes with the fine side will bring a mirror edge . Not a fisherman so ca n't say anything about the fishhook slot . Does require some cleaning afterwords of metal dust shavings . A great buy especially for the backpacker .	1
This sharpener is a pocket version of a boxed unit I keep in my shop . The handle reverses to enclose the dual sharpening surfaces , making it a compact package to carry in your field back , if not in your pocket , as it is a little heavy to cart around in your pocket , in case you are bored and want to sharpen your knife . But as an addition to your kit , it is ideal , and will keep or restore your knife 's edge quickly and effective Contrary to description , it is 9 inches open and 6 inches closed .	1
This is a great little sharpener . It keeps my knives shaving sharp . It 's still better to use a strop after to clean up whatever burr you have left . I would recommend it 100 %	1
This sharpener utilized Smith 's interrupted diamond surface that also incorporates a small area of continuous diamond surface for sharpening pointed tools as well as a groove for sharpening fish hooks . This sharpener is also double-sided , and both sides utilize all of the features mentioned above.The yellow Coarse side is 325 grit , and the orange Fine side is 750 grit . The diamond portion of the sharpener pulls out of the handle and can be flipped around to stow nice and neatly in the handle when not in use.I 've personally found that this sharpener is a little on the heavy side , especially when compared with it 's direct competition such as the DMT dual-sided diafold sharpener . The DMT feels as though it 's nearly half the weight of this Smith 's sharpener , however the DMT is nearly double the cost of the Smith 's and does not feature an uninterrupted diamond area , or a fish hook sharpening groove . For the price , I do n't mind carting a little extra weight.The handle of this sharpener features rubber areas for increased traction to aid in keeping a secure grip while sharpening with wet hands . The bottom of the handle also features some drainage ports to allow any water to escape if the sharpener were to be submerged in water . I would still however recommend to always dry the diamond surface of the sharpener before storing it.Performance wise , this sharpener has done really well . It is more than capable of putting a nice serviceable edge on any blade . The diamonds cut quite fast and I really enjoy how durable to sharpener feels . I really do n't have to worry about breaking this sharpener when stowing it in my hiking pack . For around $ 15 , I think this is an excellent buy .	1
We use it for our camping knives ... a long blade machete and a 4.5 & # 34 ; fixed blade knife . It keeps them nice and sharp . I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle , therefore saving space ... perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives , I know that it 's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right . I wish this stone came with thorough instructions , but it does n't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you 're doing it right !	1
Sharpener worked on all my knives and even on a cleaver . This is my second purchase of this item . Sharpener always ends up hiding in my son 's tackle box . Handy to have in backpack too . Definitely would buy again .	1
The product is exactly as described . The combination of the two grits , groove for tip sharpening , color coding , plastic/rubber construction , locking sheath , etc make this a very convenient , portable and durable sharpening tool . Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough , do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time . Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance . The only `` problems '' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported . Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement .	1
Great product . Convenient to carry . Sharpenininig stones store in handle . It sharpens best with pocket knives . I definitely recommend this product .	1
I got this after seeing the gent that runs Bushcraft on fire over at youtoob has in one of his kits . Awesome , super light and rugged cleaned up my ninjato in a heartbeat ! GET ONE perfect for a survival/bushcraft/hunters/but out pack/ bag/ kit .	1
Works great for quick sharpening of small tools like gardening shears and pruners . Also great on tools that do n't require a keen edge like a machete or axe . If you have something that needs to remove a lot of metal though , I would opt for something coarser and bigger like a DMT continuous diamond plate . Would n't use it on fine edges like good kitchen knives though . Plus the handle doubles as a cover which is great for when you want to carry it with you .	1
I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me . Long story short , after 3 minutes of careful swipes ( without water ) , my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles . I would n't shave my face with it yet but I 'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently do n't show it but it collapses down to half the size . The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle . I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase .	1
Excellent rasp for sharpening things like hoof nippers , bolt cutters , that kind of thing . A wider base on the rasp makes for much more precise sharpening edge of such things	1
This is a pretty good sharpener.Works great and does the job fast , sharpens all my different knifes and hatchet while out at camp .	1
I am by no means an expert knife sharpener . Although I am happy to say I have some very nice knives . I 've always felt a little stupid for not having the skill nor the equipment to properly sharpen my knives . I bought this stone and I have to say that it allows even a novice to do a fine job.In fact , I have nothing but good things to say about this stone set . I am SURE than an expert knife sharpener would have a different frame of reference but it allows me to put a razor-sharp edge on 154CM , 440 , S30V and M390 blades that I own . I 'm very happy with my purchase .	1
It 's good in a pinch and you can throw it just about anywhere and not worry about breaking it , but for a really sharp edge on the average knife that sees a lot of use you will want something better like a Spyderco triangle sharpmaker ( or probably any triangle sharpener ... I just happen to have the Spyderco ) or learn to use a nice Japanese water stone setup .	1
I think this is a useful and practical sharpener , but tends to be a jack of all trades : It offers flexibility but does n't do one thing exceedingly well . Here are some observations based on my experience : Pros : Combination of Coarseness : I like that this tool comes with both a coarse and fine stone . I have various knives and blades in various conditions : Sometimes a fine stone is just not enough to bring back a neglected edge to where it should be and I find the coarse stone is just what I need . While I think the descriptions are reasonably accurate , this stone does take a learning curve to master . Initially , both sides act coarser than they should be , as the diamonds break and wear to a more consistent surface . It will seem , then , that it quickly loses its effectiveness , when in reality it is just breaking in.Utility : On both sides of the stones , there is a flat patch for very small blades , which is nice . There is also a groove on both stones for sharpening points of , say , fish hooks or needles . I 'm not sure how often I 'll be sharpening my fish hooks , but it 's a thoughtful feature . The cover turns around to form a handle and , though made of plastic , it has held up well and does n't allow the stone to shift when sharpening . Unlike a more traditional stone meant to sit flat on a surface , this one is best held at an angle , keeping the tip held on a surface with the handle . This is how I 've been using it and find that works best for me . The relatively small size of this sharpener requires a different technique than having a large stone to work on , using both hands on the blade , when the stone sits on a flat surface . Overall , this stone is able to sharpen a broad range of edges , whether on knives , wood carving tools , etc.Effectiveness : I have found this stone to be effective sharpening a range of tools , from my high carbon kitchen knives , to my EDC folder , to my stainless multitool blades . It works , and I 've been happy with it.Cons : Size : I 'm not sure this is a con , but I find this tool somewhat awkward to use . Ideally , I prefer sharpening my tools , whatever they are , in the comfort of my shop , using both hands , on a large stone . With this , you just ca n't do that . Ah , you say , it 's not meant for that ! True ... but I find myself , more often than not , sharpening my knives back at home after backpacking or camping , rather than on site where I ca n't do as good a job at it . I like its versatility and I do think it works really well . It 's just that ... this usually is n't the one I reach for . Would I use this one when I 'm at home versus the larger stones on my bench ? No . Would I take this one backpacking ? No , because I 'd be going into the back country with sharp blades to begin with and I 'm certainly not going to carry something this heavy unless it 's essential . Would I keep it in my truck ? Mmmmm ... . maybe , but 9 out of 10 times I 'd be bringing my blades back home to sharpen anyway . Would I want this if I had to bug out due to zombie attack ? Well , of course I would ! ! ! But that has n't happened yet and I 'm starting to wonder if it will ... Other Thoughts : This is a good quality , multi-purpose , compact sharpener at a pretty decent value . There are plenty of purists out there who would howl at the thought of allowing their blades to touch anything but crazy-expensive exotic water stones . Whatever . Unless you 've just dropped your ( or your kid 's ) college tuition on a blade that will never , ever be used for fear of getting a nick on the edge , this sharpener will work just fine and will give you a decent-to-near-scalpel edge if you use it properly . ( with or without stropping for you edge geeks ) The question is , is this the right tool for you ? Personally , I find myself reaching for the stones that are dedicated to my bench top most often , and so this one ends up living in my camping gear . If you are short on space , though , or find yourself with a more portable lifestyle , this sharpener may be for you . Four stars for a quality sharpener at a great price .	1
i wanted a sharpner for the back pack , to always be able to resharpen knives in the woods , if needed when field dressing.the cover pulls off and attaches to the other end for a sturdy handle and works flawlessly.great egornomics.puts a good edge on the blades in field . cant ask for more .	1
with this sharpening stones I have sharpened all my knives it has not let me down . very happy with this purchase .	1
Price was good . Reviews excellent . Tired of using stone whetstones , file , and leather strap . Knew there had to be a quicker and easier way to have a working edge.Received this in the mail and sharpened the kitchen knives and scissors . Diamond has a hardness of 10 : hardest natural substance known to man . I drew the cutting edge away from me so that the diamond surface abraded the metal in the direction of the edge of the knife . My father used to do it the other way , but this seems to work better for me . The edge of the knife faces me and I pull the blade away from me and drag it across the diamond sharpening stone . The metal dust quickly fills the depressions . I gently tap the stone against a Bounty Towel and the dust is seen on the towel as a dark stain . Blade is sharp in under a minute . Takes up little room . I keep it in the kitchen .	1
A couple of reviews led me to believe that the stone was really small , and when my sharpening stone arrived it looked Huge compared to what I thought it was going to be . I also probably didnt read the entire description or it did not clearly state that it was coming with 2x stones in one . So When I opened the Sharpener I was Very Happy to see a Back to Back Huge Sharpener . I thought I was recieving a small sharpening stone that had somewhat mixed reviews , and then when I recieved my product , I was Very Happy to see the Back to Back Coarse and Fine Diamond Sharpening Stones that also clip into the partially rubber covered handle for easy sharpening and also protective storage . Again I was surprised to see that it is a wet or dry shrapening stone and I was really surprised to see how well water worked to help sharpen some of my blades . A couple of minutes with some of my knives and now they are razor sharp and ready for anything . I Was Very Happy that I made this purchase , and I will be buying more of these as backup sharpening stones ! ! !	1
Only one thing i dont like ; the stick doesnt fit as tight as should in handle . sharpens well AND it maintains , so far , the surface integrity . MANY so-called `` diamond hones '' do not maintain and in one or two sharpenings still work , but are nearly smooth making shapening take much longer . still , all in all a good buy and may buy another .	1
I got this for my bug out bag . I have tried it , and it works fine . The quality also seems good . Anyway , I like it for my emergency pack , so I would only use it away from home . And for that purpose this is excellent . The sharpening surfaces are well protected from damage by the casing .	1
Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage . I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping . It 's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone . It worked perfect , this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels , axes and machete 's than for a knife . I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work , its better for larger blades .	1
This is the perfect sharpener for home use . Like all tools , a working knowledge of how to sharpen a knife is essential . The course side of the sharpener will set the relief for the knife and the fine side sets the edge . I sharpened my paring knife and it shaves hair . Highly recommended .	1
I put this on a .22 pistol and was shooting static clays at 25+yds with no problems . I ca n't wait to use it for rabbit/squirrel hunting !	1
There are many cheap red dot sights out there , but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights . This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles . This little guy is light and compact yet very tough , and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings . Although it uses mounting rings , they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well . Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in . It is still as accurate as it was day one ! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong , AWESOME battery life . A+	1
I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy . The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets , but at 50 yards , you only need the 3 MOA dot . Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected , but then again , a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol . Do n't buy the cheesy $ 20 red dot . Save your dough and buy this quality product . Aimpoints are GREAT , but over rated . If you do n't mind the added weight , then this is a better buy .	1
I have one on my AR-15 flat-top.Very clear optics , I really like the different reticles which are very sharp , another very cool thing is the anti-parallax , even if your eye or head moves , the reticle maintains the POI . the battery life is also very good . Bushnell has a good name in the optics industry because they always stand behind all their products .	1
Bushnell Trophy 1 x 28 Red Dot Riflescope is a great addition to my rifle . It installed easily and was easy to sight in on target . A great addition to any rifle . Fast delivery too .	1
Well if the item worked perfectly , without a doubt it would get 5 stars , so without being able to experience a perfect product , I give 4 . The quality is very good . The polarized additional lens also is a nice touch . The 10 brightness setting work very well and the dot is easily visible in the brightest daylight . Mine however may have been tossed around a bit by the shipper because my dot looks like an exploding firework and the right side of the lens has an obtrusive Orange reflection or glare from the mal-aligned mirror inside . It might also just be a defective unit . I am pretty bummed that it is not in perfect shape , as I really like the sight . The glass is pretty clear and it also has a 1 '' extension tube for when the sun is going down . I have heard great things about Bushnell customer service so I will attempt to send it in for repair as the manual states lifetime warranty . My seller who was Earphones Plus , was excellent . The item arrived in a few days , and actually 5 days before the expected delivery . He was both cooperative and always responded to my emails to insure I got the product taken care of.Edit : Product was fixed and functions perfectly . Easy to zero , and holds zero very well . Happy as a pig in mud !	1
I liked my Bushnell Trophy 1x28 Red Dot Rifle scope so much that i bought another for my Remington 308.Very easy to sight in and i like the sun shield and 10 brightness settings.Good bang for the buck !	1
Having three safes full of rifles ... .I was giving this scope from my Grandson . I mounted it on my AK47 . Very surprised at the quality and extras this scope has . The filter works excellent in the bright sunlight . The rings are quality.Holds zero very well . Multiple dots to choose from and does not `` wash out '' in bright sunlight at all.I am very pleased with this scope .	1
for first looks n judgements its a pretty well built sight n is simply mean lookin , mounted it on my ak47 havent had a chance to shoot it n see how it holds zero , will update as soon as i put some rounds thro it	1
I was very surprized how nice a scope this was for the price paid . Amazon has the best prices on Bushnells on the market . I have it mounted on a Ruger 10/22 and its been through all kinds of weather and no problems so far .	1
Here is the scoop . I did a bunch of comparison research . I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation . I mounted it on my cetme rifle . It is tough as nails . Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting . The optics are clear and bright . Solid system . It does what it is suppose to do . Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket . Easily handles 308 load recoil . My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm . The bushnell was half that cost . I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table . This optic system does both very well .	1
For the average shooer using the average 22 rifle you ca n't find a better bargain.I would give it 5 stars but I reserve that for the more expensive scopes .	1
Had a bit of trouble getting a tall enough mount , but finally installed on my 10/22 Takedown . Great clear view and comfortable eyrelief .	1
the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great , but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well . It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification .	1
If you are on a budget , but do n't want to settle on quality , give one of these scopes a try . They are an excellent value for what the cost . I have them on everything from 22 's to 45-70 's and they work great . Nice clear reticles . Do n't let the low price fool ya , they 're good to go ! Also , made in Korea , not China junk .	1
I finally decided I needed a scope for my 22 rifle . I had a peep sight before . This one is the best of many I looked at . Easy to mount and sight . Clear instructions and clear view of targets . I am glad I got it . Great product for the price .	1
This is the third one of these exact scopes that I have purchased and currently use . I put this one on an AK47 , I already have one on an 1894 Marlin and one on an 1895G Marlin in .45-70 . This scope stands up to the recoil of 325 grain Hornady Lever Evolution rounds in .45-70 and the combination produces sub-minute angle groups at 100 yards .	1
This scope is great . i sighted it in very quickly the click adjusters are accurate , this went on my marlin 22 magnum and its perfect for it . when i went to sight in the sun was very bright and directly in my face the scope didnt pickup any of the glare the crosshairs are nice and thin , it comes only with scope covers . it works great when its basicly dark . you could probly see 100 yards at night under a full moon . it was better than my own eyesight . i woild recomend this to anyone .	1
Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 3-9x40 - purchased to go on a Henry .22 cal Mag with a see-thru mount . The optics are very clear from 3 - 9 power . The scope arrived very quickly from Viking Armory . I could n't be more happy and looking forward to trying it out on the range .	1
I give this bushnell scope a five star , because again bushnell has never let me down.The optics are very clear , easy to set , ( and once set you do n't have to keep changing them . ) Flat black , no glare , easy to set up , Instructions are foolproof . very easy to level reticle .	1
Bought this because all the guys at my hunting club raves about it . After purchasing , I 'm with them on the conversation . Great buy for a good price . If you ca n't afford Leupold , Nikon , etc ... you will not be disappointed with the dusk & dawn	1
This is the best scope iv ever had , I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger . It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective . It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition . I use it in PA for coyote , fox hunting at night . With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope . It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good . My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective . Wich his nikon does not offer . I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y , 1 grey fox from 125y , and a coon from 22y . I did miss another fox but it was my fault . Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping !	1
This was a great purchase over all . The scope was clear , packaged very well and it had the appearance of a much nicer scope for the price . This scope would fit any shooting requirement as long as you find the one that meets your shooting requirements ( mounting space , magnification , eye relief etc ) . Do your research and you will see people love these scopes and the brand is legit .	1
I should have gotten this scope years ago . I replaced my 3x9 and this thing is an awesome upgrade . Low light is great on this thing and the field of vision is excellent also . I would have expected to pay twice as much for this kind of quality . I have it on my 30.06and it think I 'll put one on my 270 .	1
have 40 rounds of 30-06 180 grain with this scope on . held zero and easily adjusted . cant beat it for the money	1
I have a Sportsman model that is just older than this model . Same specs . It is mounted to my GAMO Bull Whisper Extreme 1400 fps Pellet Rifle . The gun has broken , or otherwise proven to rough for 6 other scopes.The BUSHNELL costs more and is a little heavier , but it is well worth it , especially if you care about marksmanship .	1
took to bass pro free bore sight took to range nice and tightcons no additional markings for longer ranges however price point too good to pass	1
I 've got alot more expensive scopes laying around , but for some reason , this ended up on a little Remington 788 , and it 's NOT coming off . Clarity is on par with more expensive Bushnell glass , and after zero , I have n't had to mess with anything , and I 'm beyond confident when I shoot .	1
This is one fine scope in the $ 100 range . I installed it on my Mosin Nagant with a Rock Solid mount and it was very easy to sight in . The view is very clear and the adjustability make it great ! My Mosin kicks pretty good and no issue with any movements after sighting . I would highly suggest you buy this high quality scope if you are reading this .	1
I hav n't tried every scope , and certainly not the expensive ones . This scope does a fine job and does a very reasonable job in lower light conditions .	1
I own several of the Banner scopes and all have functioned as expected . There are better scopes out there that are clearer along the outer edges , and they are substantially more money . The Banner series gets the job done every time and they do so for far less outlay of cash ! I also have several Burris scopes for my longer range rifles , and do prefer them for anything over 300 yards , but for me it boils down to the Banner being the right tool for the shorter range cartridges job ! Bottom line is they are perfect for their intended purpose for me ! Be realistic in your expectations , and you will not be disappointed in this product !	1
Had this on my first AR-15 . Was able to hit targets out to 300yds with no problem and never lost zero through 1000 rounds . For under $ 100 they do not make scopes better than this . Bushnell makes great products . Skip the Barska 's and get a scope with the Bushnell name on it .	1
The Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn Multi-X Reticle Riflescope , 4-12x40 is an awesome scope and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good scope at a reasonable price .	1
nice scope for price . will you hit a target at 2 miles while crouched behind a rock on a mountain in your ghile suit . probably not . but at a 100 yards at the range or in the woods stalking your next meal it 's decent	1
The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view . At 18X you do n't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24 '' barrel . I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers : Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover # 17 Eyepiece ( Rear ) Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover # 47 Objective ( Front ) I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product .	1
I will start by saying that this is the third Banner line scope I have owned , and my 9th Bushnell scope . I have had excellent luck with their products , and this scope is a great example of why I will continue to use Bushnell optics . For the money , the Banner line offers good glass and coatings . I like them as much as many of my more expensive scopes . This model impresses me even more than the 6-24x40 Banner that I have on my Savage mk2 btv . The 6-24 is great , but at the higher powers in low light , the image becomes somewhat dim and eye position is very crucial . That does n't matter much on a bright day at the range , so it is fine for that rifle , but this 6-18x50 model is so much brighter at all magnification levels , and is much less picky about eye positioning at 18x . The image quality is very good , the coatings are good at controlling flare , and the magnification and parallax rings both turn smoothly enough . Everything about this scope seems too good to be true at this price . Basically , if you want a scope for long range precision shooting and the lighting may not always be the best , this may be your best choice if you are on a limited budget.The only things I do n't like , or think that a potential buyer should consider are : This scope is not very heavy for its size , but it is large , and may be too big to look appropriate on some rifles.The scope will require very high rings on most rifles so that the objective bell may clear the barrel . If your stock does not have a raised cheekpiece , you will have trouble getting a good cheek weld . If you have a straight-backed stock without a raised cheekpiece , you will want to either modify/replace your stock , or go with a scope with a 40mm objective . For a compact rifle with no cheekpad , I ca n't recommend anything more highly than the Super Banner 3.5-10x36mm scope . It is one of the most enjoyable and useful scopes I own , because it works equally well on a squirrel rifle , a target gun , or a deer rifle , and does n't add too much bulk or weight for the quality it delivers .	1
When I bought this I was expecting cheeapooo . Especially for the pricetag . I was mistaken ! Crystal clear upto 14x and only slight fuzz at 18x , holds zero on my 30-06 . LOVE IT ! BUY IT !	1
great product and fit gun nice and works great probley will order another one for my next build great product already have two	1
So far , so good . Had to replace the scope on my deer rifle and went with this scope . Very bright , crisp and clear glass for the money . Only reason I give it four stars is the location of the parallax adjustment . I want it to sit as low as possible on the rifle and I had to raise it slightly to be able to adjust parallax . Would prefer a turret adjustment for parallax .	1
For the money I spent on this I was not expecting much . I am surprised at the quality and clarity of this scope . You could spend 3 times as much money and not get a better scope .	1
If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308 , then this is your scope . I previously bought a Barska scope that shook to pieces after 12 shots . After 3 hours of shooting , and more than 60 rounds , I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards , and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $ 4,000 scope , bit it is not a 4k scope , and bottom line is , it worked fine for me . Two thumbs up For Bushnell .	1
This scope has a fantastic field of view with the 50mm and great magnification , the dusk til dawn is wonderfull . I had this scope for one season and had trouble getting a zero out of it , but was close and hunted it anyways , got a nice Doe . The next year with hours and hours of fine tuning i still couldnt reach zero and sent it back to Bushnell for service/repair . They charged me like $ 50 totall and sent it back to me , the sheet stated they had made corrections and the scope was now good . I remounted and again spent hours trying to get a good zero , i couldnt keep it tight . and at that point i started noticing that the turrets were `` grinding '' and one click sometimes felt like 3 clicks.. weird , and the focus sounded like it had sand in it when adjusting . I had enuff , i removed the scope and broke out my note pad , for every problem i wrote it down and taped it to the scope and mailed it in . I also made mention in the note of ALOT of wasted time and ammo , as well as one servicing being done already.. within about two weeks i got a new Bushnell box via UPS and inside was a brand new scope . The new scope has been very very good , i took another Doe durring muzzleloading season with it this year . My experience was with defective scope , and iffy repair service , then a new scope and all was better . Im glad Bushnell decided to send me a new scope as i had lost all faith in my first one . I own 3 Banners and One Elite.. if you can afford the elite , i highly recomend them.I hope you found my review helpfull in your decision .	1
Lets face it , its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle . I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great . I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope . For [ ... ] bucks , its a steal ! The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings . The scope is easy to sight in as well . You ca n't really use your fingers , but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it .	1
Bought this for a .22 lever action rifle and it fit perfectly . I had done some on-line research and this scope was the hands down favorite for rimfire riles . Fast delivery and well packaged .	1
Not wanting to spend a lot of money on a scope for my Browning BL-22 I bought this Bushnell scope in black for $ 47.95 from [ ... ] . I do n't have a lot of experience with scopes but I do know that I 'm very happy with this product , it 's easily worth the money that I paid for it , and I 'd buy it again . There 's no need to buy a more expensive scope than this . It 's solid but lightweight and the craftsmanship appears to be high quality . I 've never installed a scope before and my first attempt was too crooked which made sighting-in impossible . For my second attempt I had my wife steady things for me which helped a lot . What would have been better is to use a gun vise . I used the rings that came with the scope and they are fine although I 've seen other rings that might make installation a little easier . Once installed , sighting in was fast , simple and straigttforward . I shoot at a 50 yard range and with this scope it 's almost too easy . I 'm hitting bull 's eyes . Overall I 'd say you ca n't go wrong with this scope and I highly recommend it .	1
Mounted to a 20 year old Marlin 60 using the provided 3/8 '' dovetail mount with no issues although this set up looks like it could over tighten with a little too much force . Very easily sighted the scope to 50 yards and the gun was putting CCI high velocities in a tight group . Great scope for plinking or paper as visibility is clear and bright in the daylight . Everything was in focus , nice and crisp , no adjustment necessary . The crosshairs are easy to see and thin down near the intersection . I found the adjustable eyepiece helpful to set the distance from my eye in the shooters position . Comes with a clear and yellow protective cap system and you can shoot with out removing these which is a nice way of keeping the glass glean . Windage and elevation require a small screwdriver , but this is common . Setting these parameters was easy and the settings worked smoothly and yet felt solid . I found the 9x magnification to be sufficient at 75yards but lacking at 100yrds.Overall impression - excellent value for plinking or paper .	1
Really nice budget scope . The clamp part of the rings that go over the top did not line-up really well with the bottom mount so I dinged them 1 star . But , if you 're using your own rings like I am ( Aim Sports 1 - Inch Rings 3/8 - Inch Dovetail-High ( Small , Black ) AIM SPORTS , see my review ) , then 5 stars for the scope .	1
Put this scope on my Ruger 10/22 and did n't take long to & # 34 ; zero & # 34 ; at 30 yards . One NEGATIVE is the rings on this scope will need to be replaced with a quality set . The rings that came with this scope would not stay put on my 10/22 . Replace the rings and you will be fine .	1
Ordered for mount on a 22 like described . Scope is very nice with covers that have one end yellow and one end clear . Mounted on gun with no problem .	1
I put this scope on my Savage .17HMR . Had a little difficulty getting it idaled in , but once we got it there ... WOW ! ! ! ! it has held zero and is everything I need for some target shooting and plinking .	1
I bought this for my Marlin 336w 30/30 . Its a nice scope sans one caveat . I cant get the horizontal crosshair level . When you plumb the vertical the left side of the horizontal hair is crooked . Other than this issue the scope is awesome and it wont hurt anything , it just bugs me because im anal about that sort thing lol ! Its pretty clear.. You have a little fuzz around the edges about 7x-9x . Again not a big deal . I wanted a budget scope so its cool . Im gon na hunt with it this season and I may step up to a Nikon.Honestly its impossible to get a great scope under $ 200 . You have too many tradeoffs in quality below that price point . If you have a cheaper rifle or are under budget constraints this scope is hard to beat for the money . You will like it . I have no reservations that this scope will help put meat in the freezer . Update 6/22/13.. I finally got the crosshairs plumb and level . I fought it with a plumb bob for a while but I got it . I am satisfied . I think it was more scope mounts than scope . It was a pain in the butt to get right ! Im going to order one for my Marlin 1894 .44 mag for deer season in Indiana .	1
This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope . The scope came `` bore-sighted '' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards . The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so . I really like the 3-9x zoom capability , which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope , recommended ! CFH	1
If you are looking for a simple & # 34 ; Silver & # 34 ; scope with std crosshairs this is a good bet . it is fairly easy to sight and will get the job done in a pinch if you are on a budget .	1
My son and I bought this gun to go on our 50 cal muzzle-loaders . It is clear and I could not see distortions in the glass . After 15 or so shots out of each gun the scope held its position and it adjusted easily .	1
Not that many & # 34 ; silver/stainless steel/ss & # 34 ; scopes out there , so choices are limited . I never buy high-end scopes because I will break it within a couple of years because of rough usage and carlessness . So , this scope jumped out at me for the money and it proved to be a best buy & # 34 ; in my opinion . It was practically centered ( took 3 rounds to center ) , and after putting 500 rounds through the mini14 , it has n't drifted at all . I run a tactical training program so the 500 rounds were fired by five students at 100 rounds each , and carried through an obstacle course to boot . The rig took some falls and hits , but nothing has taken-out the scope yet . Also , I 've read that the min14 is particularly hard on scope reticles , so I use a Buffer Technologies Recoil Buffer ( also bought through Amazon ) , but I do n't really do n't know if that helps the & # 34 ; reticle problem & # 34 ; or not .	1
I bought this scope at WAL-MART and it works perfectly for my .22 and my airsoft rifles . I would highly reccomend this to any1 , and for the low price of $ 40 u cant beat the quality for the price .	1
Man I was really surprised how clear this scope is . I 've look through some scopes 3-5x more then this that where not nearly as clear . Sometimes you can get more then you pay for . I did see another tasco model in stock that was n't nearly as good so it maybe only some of them that are as good as the quality I got . It has my Savage 30-06 grouping quite well at 100 yards too . I feel like I got a $ 200+ scope with this .	1
I have had the 'matte black ' version of this scope for a few years , but never mounted it . Recently I pulled out my Marlin Model 883 .22 WMR rifle and found that with my bifocal eyeglasses I can see the front sight and target fine , but the rear sight is too much of a blur to use . I was afraid that this beautiful rifle would be useless to me , but then I remembered this scope . Common sense told me that since any scope is focusable I should be able to adjust this scope to my eyeglasses/eyesight . Since I need glasses to even see the target before sighting in on it , I adjusted the focus for a clear view when wearing glasses . WONDERFUL ! I can now shoot as well as when I was in my teens , although I just turned 62 ! The scope itself is very well made ; I think the quality is excellent considering the price.The view is bright and reasonably clear , with no internal debris on the lenses ( I say 'reasonably clear ' because it is certainly good enough for hunting/target shooting , but not quite as sharp as a higher priced scope or a good binocular ) .The adjustment caps and focusing ring are rubber sealed . Mine came with see-through lens caps , one is clear and the other has a yellow tint for cloudy conditions . I have not read reviews or descriptions mentioning the clear caps , so maybe they are no longer included . Also , mine does not have the cheap looking gold trim of this later model.The 30/30 reticle serves as a distance estimater . The 'thin ' center section of the crosshairs span 30 inches at 100 yards with the scope set at 4X , but of course the scope itself shows a much wider view . So , setting it to 8X produces 15 inch span of the thin section of the crosshairs at 100 yards , or at 50 yards with it set at 4X the span is 15 inches , etcetera , etcetera . But first you must know the approximate size of the grizzly , buck , doe , jackrabbit , prairie dog , etc , in inches ; then you can figure out how far away it is with this scope so you know how much to hold the crosshairs over the target for bullet drop . The best thing though is to learn to estimate distances by eye , rather than wasting time and possibly missing a shot trying to do the math in your head.Changing the magnification does not affect focus or parallax as it does on some other inexpensive scopes.I do remember that when I first got the scope and was looking through it that parallax needed to be adjusted slightly for 100 yards so the target would not seem to move in relation to the crosshairs when I moved my head a little from side to side . This required the front lens element to be screwed in or out , which then required refocus . Other reviewers make no mention of this , so it may have been just MY scope . I made the adjustments with the scope off the rifle , attached to a camera tripod with bungee cord , and got the adjustments as close to perfect as humanly possible I think , by focusing in on some small tree branch tips about 100 yards away . I like to set parallax and focus for 100 yards , even on my .22 rifles . That way parallax and focus will be spot on for distances from several yards out to infinity . Focus is accomplished by turning the rear ring , and magnification is changed by turning a ring marked 3X through 9X just forward of the focusing ring . Be aware that the front bezel and rear focusing ring/lock ring both have thin o-rings that sort of fit down into the threads , so they must be moved by fingernail or a small tool so as not to be damaged by the bezel or focusing ring/lock ring being screwed over them.Concerning the claim that this scope is fogproof : I do n't see how at this price ; this would require the scope to be nitrogen filled , and I see no claims of this in the description . I think you would have to spend more for this feature , BUT I WILL RESERVE FINAL JUDGEMENT ON THIS UNTIL I TAKE THE SCOPE OUT INTO TRULY COLD WEATHER . Back in my early teens I would hunt for several hours in snow up to my knees and temperatures below freezing ( Wisconsin ) and my non-nitrogen filled scopes always fogged up at some point . I finally resorted to removing the scopes and using iron sights . I did n't get any squirrels in those weather conditions , they were smarter than me , they stayed inside ! Based on my recent experiences , I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this reasonably high quality , low cost scope ! By the way , I see this scope is also sold on Amazon as 'Mauser ' , 'Mosin Nagant ' and other brands and includes the clear lens covers I mentioned as well as rings , a mounting rail , and lens cleaner . One of those packages might be a better value if you have a rifle that will accept that package.NOTE ! I have a couple other rifles and I can use their iron sights fine with my eyeglasses . The difference is that they have lower combs that allow me to bring my eye lower to line up the sights so that I use the upper part of my bifocals to see both iron sights and a distant target with no problem.ADDED 12/3/11 : It is below freezing tonight , so I decided to see how 'fogproof ' this scope is . I put it outside for 2 hours , then checked it . NO FOG . I then brought it in to the warm house and it IMMEDIATELY FOGGED UP on the outside and inside of the lenses . But less than 10 minutes later there was NO TRACE OF FOG . It seems to me that if it does not fog up OUTSIDE in the cold , where I will be using it , it is at least fog resistant , if not fog proof . But make your own conclusion .	1
Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple , rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight I have no worry about it moving . My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope . But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain .	1
These are great scopes for the price . This is my 5th World Class . I have many others but these are some of my favorites . I have had no issues with loose parts or any other defects . These are bright , clear , and great looking scopes . The 3-9x50 is my personal favorite .	1
There was a mistake in filling my order and I received the same scope in 3-9x40 instead . The seller offered me a partial refund if I would keep the scope I received , which is what I did after realizing that I really liked the wrong scope.I give this scope 5 stars while taking the price into account . I would not say that it comes close to a Leupold or Shepherd scope . But I would , however , put it up against a higher line Weaver or Nikon scope . Considering the price , that says a lot . This scope is very bright ... the amount of light that comes through is impressive . After playing with this scope on my AK-47 for a while , I used it to replace a Weaver K6 on my 30-06 . The difference in clarity and light gathering is huge . I have no issue at all in taking out a small animal like a rabbit at dusk at the 200 yard range . That 's overkill for a rabbit , but it would be easy to do with my rifle/scope combo.The scope seems well built . Caps over the adjustments are machined aluminum and not plastic . I clamped the scope rings down tight and have not crushed the tube , so it is sufficiently stout . It maintained zero even after my cased gun fell over onto the carpeted floor.When I made this purchase , I was n't able to shell out 5X this price for a scope , so I decided to see what I could do on the cheap . I am very happy that I got a scope of this quality at such a low price .	1
Excellent clarity and light collection . My only peeve is that it is not rubber armored and offered in black or flat dark earth color.Please Tasco put rubber armor on these scopes . Great reticule . Now I just have to get some mounts and dial it in . It 's a great spotting scope for now and worth the money just for that .	1
i looked and looked at this scope and compared different sites and found ol ' wally world regular price of 39.99. i then stopped by local gun shop and they had it on sell for 34. do your shopping around . the quality i pretty good , not greatest eye relief though . still that said for value it is a good deal for what i paid , wasnt high expectations but was pleased beyond those expectations	1
I have these scopes installed on all my .22 long rifles and .17 hmr rifles . They all habe held zero for several years with no adjustments .	1
This scope is a good value with features found in more expensive scopes . It is not the first World Class scope I have owned . I bought another for a good reason.The item was packaged well and arrived on time .	1
Great scope . It looks so elegant on my rifle . The quality is prety good for the price paid . The only thing is does not include rings . But i recomend this scope , is more than fine for 22 calibers . Shipping also was good and i got my item just i few days after i placed my order .	1
Good scope for .223 rifle . Keeps its zero , and is very easy to sight . I highly recommend this for the price . Good quality .	1
This is a very nice scope for the price . It is clear and has held zero , for less than $ 100 . What more would you want .	1
got this for my savage fvsr .22lr , first yess the poi changes with the zoom , but you can figure that out and hold over ... on mills to compensate for poi moving ... example-if u got zeroed at 9x and take it down to 6x same shott would be low , vise versa if you zeroed on 6x ... so with the scope holding off on mils still able to get decent 1.5 in groups at 150yrds with 22.lr and 3 $ ammo ! ! go to rimfirecentral.com to see many of the targets , yes the 9x is lil low on shooting 100yrd+ on paper but doable ... if they had a 500mm with 16x woulda been sweet	1
I have several other Tasco scopes . I am pleased with all of them . Lower price than many but for me they work just fine . This is mounted on a Mini 14 . No problems so far . I will update this if anything comes up .	1
Great scope for the money . If you want something good enough to hit deer at 250 yards this is good enough .	1
I actually bought this for my wife for doing archery . She wears it on a lanyard around her neck while she 's shooting as it is very light weight and provides a clearer image of the target downrange . She does n't even notice it is there while shooting .	1
It will get you close to yardage hunting if you sort of know the height of your target.The scale in the scope is based on a 6 foot pin height , so anything less ( like a three foot deer ) requires somequick conversions to get yardage .	1
I bought this cuz it was one of the least expensive , brand-name with full power 20x ... and free shipping.That said , I am very happy with the results . I can spot .223 holes in my paper targets at 300 yards . I can even see details of the moon . I can even read license plates from 8 city blocks away.The only caveat , you have to have great patience to carefully adjust the tripod knobs and acquire the target as it were . A more stable , heavier tripod is necessary in any case . The one supplied with it , well , just simply does n't cut it for anything other than seated bench shooting . If you 're out in the woods or backpacking , a full-size tripod would be infinitely better.The aluminum outer case is a great feature , certainly takes up space , but is great for shipping . It comes with a light zippered nylon pouch for carrying around . Bushnell could have done better at designing the front lens cap , which just snaps on by tension . The eyepiece cap actually screws on and is probably a little more secure.The optics themselves are marvelous , the housing is nicely rubberized ( but not `` STICKY '' such that it interferes or rubs too much on gear ) , it really is moisture-proof , and seems to be rugged . I would n't want to torture test it though.Very good buy .	1
I did n't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for . I shoot 100yds . with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good , I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds . and can still see my holes in targer , for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price . I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds . away 12 '' letters .	1
I do not own this particular model , but have recently , and not so recently , had the opportunity to use one ( borrowed ) under a variety of circumstances and activities . For the money , I have to say that this is a relatively good scope . The two areas I have primarily used this scope is in bird watching , i.e . shore birds , vultures and eagles . Secondly , I have used in on the pistol range as a spotter . In both cases it performed adequately to superb.Now I am not a technical person . For me , optical equipment either works or it does not work and I have no clue as to the technical in and outs of the instrument being used . I have little to no patience for equipment that does not function at the job I pay for ... not matter what the technical reason . From a practical standpoint though , there are some considerations.First : If you use this scope at the higher magnifications , then you must have a better tripod that comes with it . You need very solid support . There was no problem in this area when on the shooting range as the scope was mounted on a very substantial bench and sighed in on a specific target . The problem here , again at the higher magnifications , is the ability to quickly find your subject . This at times was difficult to do as the picture is quite small and the slightest movement was quite troublesome . the lower magnifications were great for scanning the shore line and river banks.Second : This scope can not be attached to a camera . For the money I suppose you can not expect everything , but the buyer should be aware of this.Third : I love the fact that there was absolutely no problem with `` steaming up . '' The scope is quite waterproof and if you are working a lake , stream or marsh you need not worry . The scope is very rugged.Fourth : I found the image quality , especially when you consider the price , to be amazingly good ; quite clear and this enables to get a very detailed view of your subject.Fifth : This optic does weigh around seven pounds which is lighter than some , but still and all if you are trekking a great distance , then seven pounds is seven pounds ... if you know what I mean.Sixth : The cases that come with the scope ... well , I have seen better , but there again , look at the price you are paying . The quality of the cases for me , are of little moment.Seventh : In an ideal situation I always recommend using a scope in the field before purchasing . I was lucky to be able to do this . Each person has their own needs and what works great for one person , might not be the best for another.Bottom line is that unless you are ultra serious about your hobby and/or want to impress those who are impressed by such things , i.e . expensive stuff , then I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this unit . Will I buy it ? Probably as I need another back-up scope and when I consider the price an then the quality I am getting for my dollar , this is attractive.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
Looked at Leupold , Nikon , and many other brands . This one came out the best in terms of value for price . I did not want to spend $ 400 to $ 1000 for a scope which I will use mostly at the range and for some viewing . I can see clearly at my paper targets at all yardages . I shoot .223 so the hold size is small . 50 , 100 and 200 yards is clear and easy to focus . At 300 yards I can clearly see the metal plates we shoot at at our rifle range . I used it for sight seeing and about 4 miles away I could see the large lettering on the side of the delivery van . At the same distance at night I could see the 1 foot lighted lettering on the side of the building . Good enough for target shooting for most yardages from 50 to 300 . I do n't shoot farther than 300 yards as our rifle range only goes that far . But Very Good for these ranges . Buy another tripod , more heavy duty . If you have the scope on the same bench as the bench you shoot on , it will move when you shoot . Get a good sturdy tripod .	1
THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL SCOPE . IT IS GREAT FOR SEARCHING FOR GAME AT A LONG DISTANCE . YOU MUST HOWEVER GET YOUR EYE VERY CLOSE TO THE EYEPIECE.IF NOT YOU WILL HAVE A VERY SMALL PICTURE . I HAVE TO REMOVE MY GLASSES . I LIKE THE SCOPE AND USE IT OFTEN . JOHN	1
I have used this scope for 3 years now . You get what you pay for and this is an excellent scope for the money , but the eye relief is not very good , but if that is not a problem for you , this will work . you can easily make out 22 caliber holes at 100 yards . You have to put your eye right up to the lense to see .	1
You can not go wrong with this . I use it for bird watching and even some star gazing . It is heavily constructed and easy to use . I would buy it again in a heartbeat .	1
good quality hat for a very good price ! This is certainly not of the quality of the form fitted hats for MLB but make no mistake for the amount of money it is very good ! ! I like the adjustable fit in the back as well ! ! ! Will recommend this hat and the seller was great ! Fast delivery . Thanks	1
This hat has worn great . I am very happy with this product . You get what you see . I would recommend this product !	1
like most other New Era ball caps , this is excellent . Unlike the fitted ones that may be too snug , this one is adjustable which is perfect for my oddly shaped head .	1
This purple Xertube offers extra-heavy resistance co -- with approximately 20 pounds -- and comes with a door attachment and exercise chart.However you can increase the by stepping closer to the handles . if you are going to do pull ups this is not going to add a lot of weight but just do the job of keeping you toned . this is a perfect band for someone who wants reasonable muscle tone and travels regularly.This band is perfect for those of you who do some recreational resistance or weight training and also travel regularly . Make sure that all instructions for use are followed . as the bands are quite heavy and can snap back and hurt you causing serious injury .	1
Resistance Bands are THE most versatile , flexible , and portable fitness equipment ever made ! You can do any exercise , anytime , and anywhere with them . I carry my babies wherever I go.I do them in classes , meetings , and movies.Resistance band s is the most economical resistant equipment out there , since you can just buy a light , medium , and heavy band for all your needs . Simply combine the bands together to create different variations of intensity ! Use the resistance bands with the stability ball , stability disc , and bosu balls for even greater workouts.Just make sure you check the anchor you are wrapping the resistance band around before you do the exercise . Once , I put the resistant band on a door knob , and it slipped out and almost took out my eye . Also , check to make sure there are no tears in your resistant band . Safety first.If you do n't feel the burn after 10 repetitions , you are doing the exercise wrong . In all exercises , it is the eccentric portion of the exercise that builds muscle . Do the exercise in a smooth , controlled fashion with a 3 concentric and 6 eccentric count . Squeeze at the peak of the motion to get that extra pump.As in all exercises , make sure to keep your wrists straight and check your posture with these seven vital points : feet hips-width apart and pointed straight ahead ; knees slightly bent ; pelvis at perfect middle , as if you are sitting at a bar stool ; stomach tight , but not flexed ; chest straight and aligned on top of ribs ; shoulders parallel to ribs ; and neck straight on top of body .	1
Nice item for people who either live in small apartments and ca n't make room for a lot of equipment , or just great for general fitness and health . I supplement my weight training with bands of this type because they tend to be safe and better for the joints .	1
Nice to be able to plug it into a door hinge so you do n't get snapped . good for arms and great with the different levels of resistance .	1
I 'm not always living in one place in a given time period so I bought this tube with Amazon Prime ( it 's amazing ) and now I have this wonder both at my family home and apartment ! It works great , does n't fail , and comes with a handy door piece ! Overall , the 150+ reviews should be enough evidence that this is a good piece of exercise equipment . I 'm just contributing to it .	1
Everything arrived as advertised . I unpackaged and started using this product immediately.USE : while using the product takes a little time to figure out , it is generally easy . follow the workout charts they give you . the door attachment is a cool addition and is also generally easy to use , also widens the range of workouts available from the product . this level of resistance is perfect for me being a larger male , on some exercises it is a little weak so make sure you can estimate your strength before ordering . the door attachment can be tricky to install . make sure the door is CLOSED when you install it , otherwise could result in a flying object to the face.PRODUCT : in reading the reviews , some people have had the product break on them within the first several uses . I havent noticed any indication of weakness , seems to be well constructed but i will be looking out for this . MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE DOOR ATTACHMENT PROPERLY , if you do , you should have no problem with it flying at you face.OVERALL : satisfied . when you dont have time to go to the gym to do 45 minutes of strength training , this is a great way to sneak in a few sets at home , while you travel , even at the office . its extremely portable , easy to setup , use and its cheap - the ultimate combination !	1
I really like these bands for travel workouts . They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout . It 's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents . For a thorough workout for each muscle group , it pays to get the extra heavy , heavy and medium bands . Honestly , it 's good for some muscle groups , like the triceps , biceps , shoulders and even the back . I have n't used the door attachment , but for the chest , good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road , wo n't they ? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber , you increase or decrease the resistance . Certainly worth the money , as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine .	1
I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts . The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out . The handles are not padded . Not a big deal.Secondly , this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using . The measurements are in the description . I thought the bands were a standard length so I did n't pay attention to the length . In order to use this band in my workouts , I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used . Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band .	1
I bought this product because I 'm lazy as hell . I was surprised how much u can get a good workout using the band	1
I needed something to add to my workout routine . The resistance bands are pretty versatile and seem to be of good quality .	1
This excellent exercise band provides steady , controlled resistance that demands correct form . Working with an exercise band allows the ability to exert the right resistance in the correct target area . After several years of hard use , the band ( blue = heavy weight ) continues to work perfectly . I also recommend the purple ( highest weight ) . These Xertube resistance bands are a vital supplement to free-weights , providing smooth , targeted isolation of muscles , highly recommended for adding effective versatility to your workouts .	1
It came really quick . It does n't deliver right to your door with a mailman . They put it in your mailbox ( that 's where I found mine ) . This is a great excersising tool to stay or on-the-go . It 's VERY durable and the blue resistance honestly , is n't that strong ( around a 10lb resistance if lifted singlely ) . So I recommend purple ones .	1
I rec 'd my item very timely , and in new condition.I 'm a very satisfied customer .	1
Bands are pretty strong and seem nice . Good band for the price . I just wish the handles were thicker and had a bit of padding on them .	1
I am not the strongest guy in the world but until I bought the ultra heavy cord all the bands I have used were more for stretching than an actual workout.This set is strong enough to carry on a trip and break a sweat.The muscle bound will not be impressed but as a light regular exerciser I am happy with the set .	1
These bands are great additional tools for home gyms or even commercial gyms . I loop them over the pull up bar to use them as cable machine type of workout . But it does n't have the constant resistance like the dumbbells or weights have . Use biceps curl as an example , when you pick up a 40lbs dumbbell from the rack . It gives you that 40 lbs resistance at the moment it lift off the rack , and continues to do so in any position of the exercise . VS these resistance bands have virtually no resistance at the starting position of biceps curl exercise . Its resistance increases as you raise the forearm and decreases as you lower the forearm back to the starting position . You do n't get the constant resistance as the weights give you . So if you 're serious about body building , then weights/dumbbells are a must and probably are more effective than these bands.Lastly , yes they are not heavy . I use 30-35 lbs dumbbell ( in each hand ) for biceps curl , it takes two purple bands to get close to that resistance ; but not a constant resistance . So I 'm going back to dumbbells for most of weight lifting workouts .	1
I 've been using these every other day since I got them and I could n't be happier . The grips are very comfortable and allow you to rotate them as you pull . I 've had no issues with damage and they can be used to work just about every muscle group in the body .	1
Terrific resistance band . This size is just right - not too light nor too heavy . This will last me a long time .	1
The band is long enough to be versatile and after & # 62 ; 1 year it is still holding up ( occasional use ) . I could use a band with more resistance though , it is n't & # 34 ; very heavy & # 34 ; to me but my girlfriend struggles with it .	1
This band is a good quality band . I have only used it for a couple weeks and it has held up nice . I prefer these plastic handles over the fatter cushioned ones . The door attachment it comes with is nice but I am not 100 percent at ease while using it because the ball stopper on the strap that 's supposed to keep it from snapping back at you should be bigger . Maybe its ok , but if you use it with a door that does not close solid then it might find its way in your face or back . Bottom line is just be smart about it . Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and will purchase another resistance soon .	1
A good source of resistance to be used in your work outs . Match the resistance to your requirements . Excellent item which is very portable and can travel with you which weights often would present a challenge to do so .	1
For the price offered , you would be hard pressed to get a better piece of home exercise equipment . Xertube bands simply work ; you can do 20+ different exercises with them just using the tube and a doorway . For toning arms , chest , and shoulders , these will get you great results . You can get several resistance levels for different purposes ; I use these for toning my forearms , and use the purple 'heavy ' version for doing curls , shoulders , and chest.At this price , you can not go wrong . I 'd suggest getting two resistance levels , or even three , so that you can tier your workouts according to what you want your end result to be . You can control resistance with each band , but a since resistance will only take you so far .	1
The price and functionality of this item are top notch . I highly recommend this for anyone looking to do strength training . The door jam feature seems rather poor , but I just use a pull up bar that I can screw out to expand in a strong door jam at different heights depending on the exercise .	1
I bought a couple of these to keep my shoulders in shape for baseball . They 're pretty tough and last a while . I 've had mine for over 2 years now and I use them at least 3 times a week . I also keep one in my baseball bag to warm up before throwing , so with the dust and abuse , it is still holding up fine . The door attachment can harm your wooden door if you place it wrong , however , I do n't even use it ; most of the time I just hook the handles together through a stable beam or something.Good for the money .	1
I 've tried multiple brands of resistance bands , and these have to be the best value . For less than $ 10 each , do n't pay more for overpriced competitors . Other brands have foam handles that can harden and/or deteriorate only after a few months of use ; these PVC handles lasts for years and years ( going on 2 years ) . The nylon handle strap design is very strong and durable , unlike the adjustable-type bands which can slip during use ( very unsafe ) . The door attachment is also very handy for incorporating more exercises and will not slip.I own a set of medium ( red ) , heavy ( blue ) , and very heavy ( purple ) and these replaced all my dumbbells . If you need more resistance , just loop/wrap/lengthen the band and the resistance is increased . Or even double the bands ( use two at a time- ca n't do that with other brands ) for max resistance . Progressive resistance is also something that you do n't get from dumbbells . Perfect for working out at home or with programs like P90x . I have also used these professionally in therapy/rehab . settings as well .	1
I bought these as a present for my brother a couple of years ago because his arms were looking a little girly . He still uses them to this day without any problems and is looking more ripped than ever .	1
Very easy to use . Comes with a booklet that shows you what exercises you can do . I thought it was great quality .	1
This works very well for me . Its great when traveling to maintain fitness since it weighs about a pound , and I use it as part of a weight and aerobic workout at home as well . It is a nice change of pace and allows you to do some expercises not easily done on equipment . As another reviewier rightly observed , its not a substitute for heavy weights to failure . Its a high rep toning device that will mininimize backsliding when you can not work out otherwise and add to a full workout with a little something different . For the price it certainly earns its keep .	1
Excellent product . Very heavy as described . Good grip too . I use these for exercising when I 'm mobile on my work . Make good hotel-home workouts.Only complaint I have is it has this very heavy rubber smell ( and if you touch any part of it you will smell like rubber for a couple of hours )	1
A very good product , is Inexpensive and I would buy again.A little cheaply made on the handles but it 's all good .	1
The Xertube purple ( very heavy ) resistance bands are perfect for their purpose . The purple band provides resistance equivalent to about 20 pounds . The great thing about this band and other bands in general is their versatility . They 're very light so you can take them just about anywhere , which makes them perfect travelling companions . They 're much more useful than weights ( not to mention cheaper ! ) . With the band , you can do regular curls just as you could with dumbbells , but the band helps you go beyond that ! With the band , you can take part in many various exercises that involve the core that are impossible to do with dumbbells . I 've always had a strong throwing arm , so it 's something I take pride in . Resistance bands like this one help me work on all my `` throwing '' muscles at one time ! Considering that the Xertube resistance band is cheap , lightweight , and versatile , it 's hard to see how you could possibly go wrong with it.There is one very minor thing that needs to be pointed out , and it 's that the door attachment will come flying at you if someone opens the door while you 're working out . You should probably notify everyone in your house that they should knock before coming in your room if they see the little black attachment by the hinges.After 6 months of pulling on it , and stepping on the band for specific positioning requirements , I 'm happy to say that it is still holding up very well . I highly recommend it and it is well worth the money . I just wish they made a band with a higher resistance !	1
This product works well . There are so many move you can do with this product . It is also pretty durable	1
I have had one of these for years . People give me grief when I take it on trips and then beg to borrow it . It is one of the best products I have ever purchased . Now that I have little kids they come back soaked and this device ( which now has hundreds of hours on it ) works great to dry everything out . I no longer bother packing backup gloves . I just use this to dry out whatever got wet . Kids like it when we warm the gloves before putting them on as well . I do use it for boots as well but they do n't require drying as much as the gloves . If it finally broke I would immediately purchase another .	1
I am always in the water either paddle boarding or SCUBA diving and I use this primarily for drying out my dive gloves which I use for paddle boarding in the cold . I thought I was being a little extravagant by buying a glove dryer but I find that I am using it constantly to dry out both my gloves and my dive boots . I live in the South where it is humid and things tend to take forever to dry out so this little dryer has been a very pleasant surprise for me .	1
One of the most useful pieces of equipment I have . Dries gloves , boots , running shoes , etc . Helps keep gear from smelling ...	1
I 've only had this for a couple fo weeks , but it works fine and is very useful . So far I have used it to dry out my hydration pack bladder -- works perfectly for that . I am going to use it for work gloves this spring as well . It is smaller than it appears in the photo -- it does not take up all that much room .	1
Easy setup , very effective . Anyone who boxes knows good maintenance of gloves is crucial if you do n't want hands that smell like a sewer after continuous use of sweaty gloves . This thing keeps them smelling like new.Just take one damp antibacterial wipe to the inside of the glove , wipe down the I side and outside then set the dryer to say 40mins heated and or gloves are set !	1
If you buy a set of four Q towers , these are already included . No need to buy them unless you want spares .	1
They are what you purchase . Good for the price if you want everything to match and not look cheap with a fake cover .	1
I got a set of rack poles from a friend who had bought a new SUV and needed longer poles . He had busted up the old end caps sliding up his kayaks on and off the car.So I bought these new end caps and now my rack looks brand new .	1
I bought the caps for my cargo bars not realizing they come in the Tower Kit . I agree with another reviewer they should come with the bars themselves . That said they are a perfect fit and will make great spares should they need to be replaced .	1
My wife is pretty damned picky , but she sure as hell LOVED these socks I bought her ... Because she walks around the house in SOX , I thought I 'd take a risk.Like I said , she loves 'em ! I bought some of the OTHER colors , too !	1
I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth . I bought some for that purpose , for power outages , cold Winter weather , etc. , and never have wanted any other kind since . They last for years and I wear them every day , Winter and Summer , usually without shoes since I work from home , sometimes with shoes on 3-mile walks . These are everything I want in a sock . I highly recommend them.Be careful to choose the right color .	1
I could n't be happier with this sock . It is just so comfortable and the quality is just so high . Never say no to this until you actually try it . It worths the full retail price . Now I know how socks should be made . I would highly recommend this .	1
Very cushy ... .very warm ... .feet stay dry ... .what 's not to like ? I wear these under my regular running shoes when the ground is dry and under hiking shoes/boots when there 's ice/snow ... .for such thick socks , they do n't seem to take up more room/make the shoes tight .	1
Finally her feet are n't cold ! I bought these as a gift , she was incredulous at first but after wearing them for a little while she loves them . Thank You !	1
I have thrown out all my old socks and replaced with these Thorlo women 's thick cushion hiking sock.I have a farm and am in boots all the time .	1
The wife went for an Mt Everest Base Camp trek , from Lukla to EBC and back to Lukla- 11 days . The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG ( about 17 lbs ) for the porters carry , therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul . She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths . These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect , and if you are 10+ then these may not be for you.All in all , she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes , unlike track/sports shoes , where ventilation could be in issue . Absolute recommended buy .	1
thorlo socks are wonderful , I own a lot of them . they last for yearsif taken care of , so I wash on permapress and hang to dry , just takes a night . BEST ADVICE , BUY AT LEAST TWO PAIRS AT TIME .	1
I 've had these for 2 years and have worn them hiking and walking all over the city again and again and again - they keep me warm and are still as good as new . I 'll definitely keep buying them .	1
I thought this product would be softer under foot , but it feels a bit rough . The color is good as it is impossible to find thicker blue socks . All in all this product is okay for me - might be better for you .	1
These are great . They fit well and feel awesome . Ca n't wait to hike in them . They have padding in all the right spots and should be perfect .	1
I usually just wear running socks , but decided to get these socks because we were going to be hiking in the mountains . I opted for Thorlo 's because I have had great luck with them in the past - these did not disappoint . They work great and feel great . Keep in mind that these are thicker socks , so if your shoes run on the smaller size , these may not work .	1
Very comfortable with good support and great colors . Wash and wear well and have already ordered a few more in pink !	1
I purchased this to replace a larger waist pack and this smaller one is just the right size for me . It can hold my iPhone which has a regular size case on it , a couple of keys that I need and still has room for a couple other small items such as a small energy bar ( if you need one ) , some cash or small ( very small ) wallet . I have another Nathan waist pack which can hold a water bottle for long runs but this one is great for 3-5 mile runs where I do n't necessary need to carry water all the time.It fits great and does not move around much at all . I have a 32 waist and I just take up the extra slack in the band by looping it back around through the holes a couple times so it does n't flop around - simple , easy , effective .	1
I agree with some of the other reviewers : the strap adjustment is not foolproof . Once it becomes undone , not easy to figure out how to rethread , unless you are a mountaineer or former scout . How about posting illustrated instructions on the Internet ? The tension and the webbed texture hold the belt to the buckle , but when the belt is undone and is not on you , it 's too easy for the belt to become undone from the belt . Should have added velcro or something.Otherwise , great size ( radio , wallet , blackberry and keys all fit in there ) , and nice idea to have mini pocket , MADE IN USA which is increasingly rare and nice Does not bounce around . The profile is so low that it looks OK when my tee shirt covers the belt .	1
I love this pack . For running , it is honestly a bit large . I have to strap it tight . Perhaps good for an inhaler ? But I can fit my camera into my new Fuel Belt so I do n't use this much for running anymore ... I do n't have much to carry . However , this is an awesome safety travel wallet . *Cue the odd looks* . When I went to Thailand and Peru , I first bought an around the neck wallet so that my things would be safe , but then I was worried about how completely obvious it was under my shirt and you could see it hanging around my neck . I looked like the idiot tourist . Then I remember this pack that I have . It fits my passport and cash and I strap it invisibly around my upper torso . It is comfortable enough to sleep in because it is soft and flexible , so when camping in the middle of Cuzco , I did n't have to worry about someone getting my stuff from my bag . It was right on me .	1
Keeps my house key and iphone in place and tight against the body while running , without being uncomfortable . Bon apetite !	1
Perfect . Fits my large phone with its large extended battery . Along with my wallet , house key , and some cash . I 'm also able to attach my tactical Recon 1 Tonto folder from Cold Steel to the side , very* securely . I 'm very pleased . I think I may start seeing if I can get away with carry my Roger LCP in this . It fits , and it 's comfortable . Why not.This thing is also water proof so if you are a woman who considers carrying concealed on the trails in case an attack happens , your gun will stay dry . Or phone ... .lol . it 's versatile ; )	1
It is okay , just not right for my needs when I am walking the dogs . It is not big enough for smart phone , keys and some treats and a couple of poop bags .	1
Simple fanny pack for running and biking . Soft neoprene waist strap is adjustable and seems snug along the waist and back . Contents seem fairly stable and do n't seem to flop around . Pretty good design . Fits iPhone , key , money . Can safety pin your race bib to the bottom of the pouch . Build quality decent for the price .	1
fits tight around the waist which keeps your stuff from moving around . I love this belt ! ! I use it for the gym and running .	1
My keys , ids & cards , and iphone fit great in here . Could probably put a gel pack or 2 in there as well . I like that it has 2 compartments so I can separate my keys or anything that might scratch the screen of my phone . However , it stays tight enough so I do n't feel the contents moving around enough for that to really happen , but just in case.Fit fine on me and my waist size is about 36 . The straps felt like they could easily go up to 42 '' waist and down into the 20 '' s too .	1
I run on the treadmill in the gym . I can fit my gym card , my iPhone ( I used this for tunes as I run ) and ear buds into this pack . I mainly use it to hold the iPhone while I run so that it does n't get knocked off the tray on the treadmill . Works perfect . I completely forget I even have a pack on . It does n't bind or bounce . I 'm so pleased ! 12/11/11 Update : A year and a half later , I still use this pack several times a week , both at the gym and running on the street . It it holding up with no issues . My only complaint is that if I 'm running a race and need a spot for my car keys , with my phone and ID in here , there is not a good way to carry my car keys with all the large fobs on them . I have to remove my car key from the door opener fob for it to fit with everything else in the pack .	1
I am using my phone to run Couch to K and needed a place to put it . This belt is just the right size and fits well . Holds my phone just fine with a bit of spare room for the house key . The belt was a little long for me at a 36 inch waist but it is easy to cut and melt the ends how ever long you need it .	1
While fanny packs are apparently now a fashion no-no , I still occasionally need to carry things with me when I am running . For example , I sometimes carry a phone when I am expecting an early morning call I need to take . For years , I had been using an old , small fanny-pack , but time had taken its toll . So I needed a replacement . I decided to try this pack , since it is supposed to be designed for running.After trying it , I found I liked it much more than the old pack . First , it & # 34 ; grips & # 34 ; onto its contents-so , for example , the phone does not bounce around so much . Second , it is compact and does not look like the old-style fanny pack . It also fits better and is less inclined to travel around my waist.As some reviewers have noted , the belt is a bit long . But , this can be rectified by a trim . I do understand why the belt is long-Americans have bigger waists these days , so products need to accommodate this expansion .	1
I 'm please with this product -- should make it easier to take small belonging when I go jogging .	1
I bought this for running daily , along with running 5ks . I put my phone , house key , and my inhaler in it . I have a moderately sized android phone with a rubber case.The waist pack does it 's just . However , make sure you tighten it so it is pretty snug , otherwise it will bounce and ride up.One problem I 've noticed when using this pack in hot , humid weather is that my phone sometimes overheats . So long as you 're not running in 90 degree weather , or maybe if your phone is a bit better than mine , it should n't end up being an issue.To deal with the extra straps , I wrapped hair ties around each side to keep the straps flat on band .	1
This running belt is awesome . Just enough stretch without too much . Great size and feel . Easy adjustment . Last `` forever '' ... If you are looking for the `` Ford Truck '' ( dependable , reliable , functional ) of running belts this is it . I 've bought fancier , and costlier , and they all take a back seat to this model . Made in the US , the last one I got . I have two 5K packs and two of an an older yet larger model called the 10K ( which sadly I do not see coming up on the latest search ) . The only problem I 've ever had with these is a slight tear in the neoprene after 11 years of running and washing machines . It was easily sewn . The only reason I needed a second was to leave it in the car when I forget the first one.You can shift it up , and it stays , you can wear it low and it stays . It is a shame the company has to make so many other models for the consumer culture . They nailed it with this design ! PS I did see someone complain that it was a little small for all their stuff . It can hold an iPod and flip phone , but its tight , If you want to bring a lot of stuff , see if you can find the NATHAN 10K running belt , you may luck out .	1
I have carried my essentials in this pack on 18-mile bike rides as well as in half-marathon races . It 's flat , light , comfortable . I can slide it around to the front easily ( if I wear it in back ) , and the tab on the zipper makes it easy to grab and open , as opposed to fumbling around to grab a black zipper pull that you ca n't see . I 'd definitely recommend this pack .	1
I am not a runner , I just walk . But I still need something to keep my essentials ; based on reviews I ordered this pack , expecting it to be somewhat bulgy and awkward . It exceeded my expectations in every way ! First of all , it does n't look or feel at all like a fanny pack , it 's slick and slim , can go beneath your shirt and you can barely feel it 's there . Second , it stretches and can accommodate quite an array of essentials : my smart phone , ear buds , bulky pack of keys , several cards , some tissues ... My waist is about 30 inches , so there was some extra length of strap ; I just reversed the straps and shortened them ( no need for thread and needle , I & # 34 ; sealed & # 34 ; the cut using a lighter ) and now it fits perfectly.As sleek as this pack is , it 's very good quality and sturdy , I expect it to last a very , very long time .	1
Perfect size for just the bare essentials : keys , phone , meds/supplements . Well constructed and fits comfortably and securely . Can wear it with the pouch resting against your abdomen or back ( very versatile ) . Quality seems to be pretty good .	1
I wanted to test this out before needing it . So I put a piece of scrap paper on the counter ( it just makes sparks , right ? ) , and depressed the flint rod fully.It blew sparks , glowing pieces , and turned several spots on the paper brown before I could pat them out . Glad the wife was n't home ! The BlastMatch is awesome !	1
I try to stay prepared . When I 'm going camping , I try to have a lighter along . Since I do n't smoke , I often forget to see if my lighter has fluid in it . Several times I 've arrived at my site , and found my lighter would n't light . I 've had fair luck with other flint and steel fire starters , but this is the best of the ones I 've tried . A major advantage in my opinion , is that it can be operated with one hand , which could be useful if you were injured . Another advantage is that you do n't need to use a knife , which always carries some risk of personal injury . This device also puts out more spark than I get with the other magnesium sparkers I 've tried.It does seem a little bit like a gadget , and is more likely to break than a bar of magnesium with a flint on one side . One the other hand , even if it broke ( and mine still works great after lighting a dozen or so fires ) , you would at worst have an overpriced `` normal '' sparker . If you 're worried about price , I think a $ 3 magnesium and flint bar is a better value . I keep a blast match in my emergency backpack ( bug out bag ) , and in my Camelback hydration day pack . In my glove box , my camping jacket , and a few other places , I have a cheap flint ( and sometimes even a working lighter ) . My friends that have seen me use the Blast Match are generally impressed , but none of them liked it enough to buy one . I liked mine enough that I bought a second one , but I figured a fire might be worth $ 40 to me some time . *edit*I addition to putting out enough sparks to light dry cotton or pulverized wood ; this actually gives off enough spark to light small chunks of a Duraflame log . I carry about an ounce cut off a waxy instant fire log , to use as tinder . A chunk of waxy wood the size of 4 stacked pennies , will burn for long enough , that you should be able to build a real fire around ( above ) it . The blast match seems to light just about anything you could light with a match ( assuming you can stab at the thing and not worry about knocking it over . ) You pretty much need to light some tinder , then build your fire over it . You ca n't ca n't build a pile of wood , and stick the flame in the way you could with a match .	1
This fire starter by UST is an absolute beast . The rod itself is about as thick and robust as firesteels come . This will make it last longer , providing you with more fires.The cool aspect and philosophy behind the blastmatch is it allows you to operate it one-handed . With this feature , you can use your hand to block out wind when starting a fire , if need be . Simply use your thumb to push down on the striker and abruptly push the spring loaded steel to generate extremely hot sparks . Do to the size of the rod , this thing SHOWERS sparks . The rod also rotates 360 degrees so it will wear down evenly and you wont have one side of the rod depleated over time.the plastic seems like it will hold up adequately over time . These were actually developed for Air Force fighter pilots so I imagine they went through some rigourous testing . The casing can also swivel over the top of the firesteel so it packs at a compact 4 inches.Great little piece of gear for any camper or someone putting together an emergency kit . However , always you make sure you have backup ways for fire . The blastmatch has mechanical parts which makes it prone to possible failures with use over time . But I have not experienced this issue or heard of it yet . But dont take the chance . i highly recommend this fire starter over the competition .	1
I have tried every alternate fire starter , and I find this one to be the best at getting the job done . Easy one hand operation , big sparks where you want em & not having to use a knife to scrape against . Seeing that you have to push down to operate this fire starter , its wise to find a small flat stone ( or keep one with you ) , so you have something to push down on ; and build your tinder around the stone . Another thing I found usefull is before use is pushing the scraper in lightly , just enough to make contact with the steel & scratch off the coating to save yourself time . Instead of a few strokes , you get sparks easily on first or second stroke . I would have given this fire starter 5 stars if the cap that holds it together in the closed position had some way of adding a way of being able to wear around the neck . It has a slot at the top , but not wide enough to put anything through that wo n't interfere with whilE this fire starter is in the open position .	1
I think it works better than firesteel but is more susceptible to mechanical malfunction . I have yet to have my wife try it out . I may switch the emergency firesteel in her car with this if it goes well . I 'm guessing it will.UPDATE : My wife tried it & got a fire going on her first strike ! What is critical to understand about this is she is not comfortable with fire and is not mechanically inclined . She likes this product better than firesteel and even better than matches . It is in her car and I trust it to save our lives.One complaint : You can not really open the device with one cover . The clip is way too tight .	1
This works great , if you understand how to use it . I thought it shot out sparks . I kept trying to push by hand and it barely worked . I read the directions but still was not 100 % clear . Then I finally figured out you shove the whole thing into the tinder and blasto . It works great !	1
I tried this product and it does what it suppose to . Just make sure you got hard surface and the right kind of tinder . It comes with only one . But not bad for the price . Another toy you might need to use some day , or not .	1
Once you get the hang of using these you 'll live them . I 've now purchase 3 , putting one in in each bugout bag as well as my primary camping backpack . These put out a large amount of very hot sparks & will ignite any dry tinder instantly . Excellent survival tool .	1
Took camping and son accidentally left outside with morning dew , they worked later that same day so I am very satisfied ty	1
They started my campfire just fine . Although it was damp and rainy the matches lit with no problems . Worth purchasing .	1
After buying the Camp Chef SG90 Deluxe steel fry griddle , it took me much longer than I thought to find the associated carrying bag . The item description did n't say what size griddle it fit and there was another review that said the bag did n't fit right . I have a the Camp Chef SG90 2-burner steel griddle and this bag fits it perfectly with enough extra space that it 'll fit thicker griddles too . After paying almost $ 90 for the griddle I ca n't see storing or transporting it without protecting it , and this bag does exactly that .	1
This bag seems very sturdy . It is made of heavy material . It is oversized for the Camp Chef CGG16 Cast Iron Griddle , which is what I bought to store in it . I like having a storage bag for the griddle because it keeps it separate from the rest of my camping gear .	1
My girl was tired from lugging the grates from her grill to the car in plastic bags . This very well constructed bag fits not only the grates , but other items as well . Great product and will probably outlast the grill .	1
This bag is made of durable canvas-like material and is definitely made to last . The dual zippers are a nice touch . Also has a small pocket on the outside . Perfect fit for the SG60 Camp Chef two-burner griddle .	1
It feels like heavy duty material.The griddle fits in it nicely.Using it to carry the griddle to camp	1
The one burner griddle fits perfectly in this well made bag . I imagine that if it hits enough objects the bag amy rip but it seems fairly stought . I keep my Camp Chef equipment in the basement storage of my RV so having everything in its own bag helps out a bunch . Good way to keep the dirt of the grill . Uncovered these griddles are magnets for dirt and dust . In the bag that is greatly reduced so less cleaning time when setting up the camp kitchen	1
Very nice bag to hold the camp chef grill . It is a bit bigger than the grill itself , which is unnecessary and awkward , but hey , better than being a bit small . Got to have it if you have the two burner grill ! You could include the grill cleaner and spatulas in the bag as well .	1
I do n't know how I would get around without this carry bag . The griddle weighs a ton . The griddle fits perfectly , easy to zip and carry .	1
Fits cast iron single burner griddle , good quality , nice logo , strong zipper , strong carry handle , good protection for your griddle .	1
This case is definitely needed for the griddle top ! The griddle is quite heavy and unweildly to carry . This case makes transporting the griddle top a breeze ! It also does a great job of protecting the griddle surface during storage and transport . The zipper is of very good quality . This is a serious value for the cost !	1
Overall I like this trailer jack . I love that it has a grease fitting . I just hope it lasts . My last one seized up , but it did not have the grease fitting . I just wish the hardware were a little easier to use and came with washers . The brackets are a pain to put on but well worth it . I would buy again .	1
This trailer tongue jack stand is very well made , it is strong , and easy to assemble . I am very sure there are others that may even be stronger and better made than this one ... ... However true that may be , for the money paid ( about $ 52 ) this one is VERY good . The wheel is strong , and it is wide enough to be pretty supportive in not toooo soft a dirt , sand , or mud . The trip lever to move it to the side for towing without having to crank it up is very well made too.If you use the ( good ) rule of thumb : when ever you buy equipment of any kind , the habit of rating things at 50 % ( = 600 lb . rating ) for a result of having zero failures in the future ; and that of using the 33 % down grade ( = 800 lb . rating ) for the only an occassional failure results you will do well every time.Now that I have this unit , have assembled and installed it , and now have used it ... .. absolutely : I would buy it again ! I rate it personally @ the 800 # level for my own light duty use type of service . All of this is why I gave it 5 stars.Do buy with confidence : between the great way Amazon treats it 's customers , and the quality of the unit , you can expect a good result in buying this jack stand.Enjoy !	1
I put this jack on my little 4'x8 ' utility trailer . It was easy to install . Everything works smooth and easy , including the way it folds back . I like everything about this jack .	1
these seem to be made very well . the added grease fitting makes it even better . i have several of these and all have performed as it should i will buy again when needed	1
This trailer jack is probably the best I have seen.. The swing swivel is great , like a trailer jack should be	1
This is well made . I have the camp chef explorer EX-60LW 2-burner cook system with the two side shelves and two pans stored in this bag and it works just great . Great for storage and portability transporting my stuff .	1
A little big for the stove I bought but its well made and easy to carry the stove in .	1
It fits the Camp Chef Explorer 2 Burner Propane Stove with room to spare . The bag is made of heavy material and keeps the stove away from the rest of my camping gear .	1
If you ever purchased a double burner , you know what a pain it is to haul around . Well , this well made and sturdy bag , sure helps when you are walking back and forth from the car to the beach/campsite . I would buy this again in a heartbeat . All my friends want one and the price on Amazon was once again , right on .	1
Fits like a glove and was easy to get on and off . We keep our Camp Chef Kitchen in the basement compartment of the RV and these bags help keep everything clean and organized . Love it	1
Well made heavy duty bag for your camp chef stove . It fits perfectly with room to spare for little things . I bought the stove for winter ice storm power outages and this bag will become the stove 's summer home .	1
This is great glove conditioner . I had a couple of old softball gloves that were a little dried out and I bought this to try and restore them . It worked great . Its a little messy in the application but once it soaks in overnight its like a new glove . It also contains lanolin . which in my opinion is far better than petroleum based products .	1
My glove is probably 20+ years old now , and it 's been sitting in the garage for the last 10+ . As my kids are getting old enough to play catch , I wanted to bring it back to a better state than those years had left it . This product did the trick . Leather is much softer and darker now , and the product did n't have any negative impact on the previous years of break-in work .	1
I got this to help keep my finger tab ( for archery ) in shape . After two applications , the leather looked great and this really restored it . While I could always replace my finger tab , I 've got my broken in and it shoots well , so I 'd rather take care of it ! Obviously , finger tabs only have a small amount of leather , so this will last me quite a while . I recommend this product and I hope this review helps .	1
i use this in combination with nokona nlt conditioner which may be over kill but the two together helped break in my nokona and have kept it looking that dark rich walnut color that they are known for . plus the combo has it holding up better than new	1
I bought this to help break-in and maintain my Wilson A2K mitt . Darkened the leather a bit , but overall is a must to keeping your mitt looking and feeling good .	1
I found this easy to work with and a good product . I used it to recondition and old pair of winter motorcycle gloves and it made them look like new .	1
I received this paste and went to work on my kids gloves . I conditioned 3 gloves and it took quite an elbow grease but the end result was great . Cleans and conditions great and make the gloves look like new .	1
This the best on the market and with lanolin not oil and one tub did 8 gloves and softened in a day new gloves and did a nice restore on an old one .	1
I broke in a few gloves last year using Glovolium and thought that product worked pretty well . My wife got a new glove a few weeks ago and I decided to give this a try instead . It is definitely a better product and softened the glove up very fast . I also tried it out on a glove that was looking kind of dried out and it made the leather feel like new again . Definitely recommend this product , it worked great .	1
Worked the leather on my glove for about a month and now using it to keep leather soft for storage .	1
I bought this conditioner to revitalize a baseball glove that has been sitting in my garage for at least 10 years . The conditioner is a paste like substance , about the consistency of shoe polish . I grabbed a rag and rubbed the conditioner into the glove . It took about 10 minutes and now my baseball glove looks like new and is very soft . A great product .	1
A good amount of glove conditioner in a can that 's easy to put into a baseball carry bag . You could likely break in 3-4 gloves with this or condition 1-2 gloves for an entire season .	1
These are supers Sturdy and well-built . And often have people coming up to me and asking me if they could try them out . I am a personal trainer and I am educated In many ways to tone and strength the abdominal and core muscles , and this has now become one of the pinnacle workouts that I use in my abdominal and core routine.I have had people that are 250 pounds strapped in holding them very securely , Great buy .	1
I have had these for over a year and they are still new looking . They fit well , you feel like youll slide out of them but you wont . I have fairly skinny legs too . Best abdominal workout you could ever ask for .	1
I only occasionally hand upside down which is why these are acceptable to me . I honestly would go for one of the nicer tables or the teeter boots if I were a more frequent inverter . These are solid and fine . I picked up for $ 60 or so on amazon warehouse . At that price , these are virtually the cheapest reasonable option to invert , and they really do get the job done .	1
If you 're looking for inversion boots ... these will do the job . not too bad at all . I have kinda skinny ankles , I think I put something around my ankles when I used them but whatever.I felt safe upside down ... .on my pullup bar .	1
These gravity boots have proven themselves to be well worth the price . Not only are they built well , but they are cheaper than the comp. ! I would not pass these up just becuase they look unworthy of your dollar .	1
i use them every day for handing upside down . they work better than the other boots i had and are much more comfortable . the foam is easily replaceable if you wear it out - but mine has n't worn out and i 've had these a long time .	1
I am a creature of the night . I hang from my ankles ... and do crunches.and decompress my spine after some abusive runs with all sorts of gear and weight on.and just like letting the blood flow to my headNot sure if the more expensive models allow for longer hang times , but these can start to pull on your ankles . I 'm about two bills and some change when I 'm lifting so it 's a bit of weight to put on one 's ankles . I can get about 5-10 min of hang time . I have noticed better hangs when I have the hooks *behind* my calves , but they can be worn both ways . There is some additional packing foam included ... keep it . I use it at times to supplement the padding on my ankle . I go barefoot as opposed to boots . I have big stocky calves from punishing runs and years of military hikes with more weight on my back than you want to think about . People with skinnier legs will want to wear boots with these . Recommend you have some ropes ( I use old Jujitsu belts from my lower ranks ) rigged up on both sides of a bar to help you pull back up if you spend too long inverted or your arms are shot from other workouts . Nothing worse than passing out upside-down when no one else is home and you 're too shot to get off the bar .	1
The relief i felt from the invesion was amazing , however , the boots do dig into your legs a bit . I found that wrapping a small towel around each leg helped .	1
This is my second pair of boots I have purchased . The first set last for about 4 years . This is n't for beginners . I strongly suggest when purchase and use this product have a spotter with you unless you already have a strong core . It is great for abdominal exercise or for spinal elongation to reduce stress , tension and nerve pinches .	1
Not much that I can say in a review for a weight tree . This thing does exactly what it 's supposed to . It 's sturdy , was n't too hard to put together , and holds a solid number of plates . The bars are a little close together so it can be difficult to maneuver too many larger plates , but for most collections it should be fine . The bottom peg is too cramped for anything larger than 2.5s or 3s in my experience , though some 5s may be small enough depending on the brand .	1
This is a must have item for a weight lifter that lift weights at home or have a little gym . It is well built and highly recommend this product . I see no cons in the item at all .	1
No problems with this rack and I have owned it for more than a year . It gets a lot of use and only shows signs of regular wear and tear .	1
I had four 45 's on one bottom side and two 35 's with 2 25 's directly above on the other side ( holds standard and Olympic ) . Very much held the weights with no issues or bending.Only problem- as drug weights across the bars they left a mark . Not sure if any long-term effects ( not made of metal so wo n't rust to my knowledge ) but something to note . Who cares about looks , anyway ?	1
really great way to keep all the free weights nice and neat and organized , very easy to assemble , great product i suggest to everyone	1
This barbell stand is built very well and does a great job of getting your barbell plates off the floor . The price is what attracted me to this product as other stands seem to be either over-priced or constructed of lower quality metals . Be sure to check the hole diameter of your existing plates to make certain that this product will be able to accept your plates .	1
I did a lot of research before I bought my next piece of exercise equipment , the rest are in my storage room collecting dust from boredum or just not being satisfied. # 1 . First I must address the SQUEAKING issue . I read online when you first assemble the unit , put Car grease inside the tubes that the AXLE rod goes through , trust me , do this now as you assemble and you wo n't have squeak problems , the Axle rod comes with a thin coating of oil and will quickly wear off , car grease is heavy duty and will do the job ! Ok the machine , its like walking on air ! Much better than walking in place or using a personal trampaline. # 2 . Many have said this machine gives you NO or Zero resistance and after you got better in shape that you quickly out grow the Edge.Here 's a VERY Easy way to fix that.A . Wlamrt and other stores sell Weights that go on to bar bells and dumb bells . The Gold 's Gym brand of weights have a larger hole in the center . BUY those ! Start off with two 5 lbs weights and slide them through the hand grip poles and let them rest on the machine bar ( same bar that has the digital counter ) .This will give you resistance , you can add more weights , I do n't say getting more and put on top of each other , but go buy the 10 lb 's weights.B . Another option is to take those Adjustable Wrist bands ( 2 and 5 lbs ... leg bands as high as 10 lbs ) and wrap those around the bottom legs of the machine in the front . They will give you outstanding resistance as well.Problem Solved ! C . This one is my personal favorite way to ADD RESISTANCE . Add 5 or 10 lb dumb-bells to the legs . You can clamp them on with simple automotive clamps , the dumb-bells will fit on super tight , no movement , no noise at all ! You will deff feel the added weight in the legs of the Gazelle ! You have a wide range of motion , you can put more force on your upper arms , grabbing up and down for a upper body workout , you can go fast , go slow , watch tv at a slow pace and get lost in a movie while getting your body moving ! I am that does almost Nothing for exercise , I walk my Dog but big whoop , I slow walk.I get very bored with exercising , I wanted something that seems fun , easy to do and gets my whole body working , this does that ! I have previously bought a exercise bike , weight bench and weights , an Eliptyical , row machine and a bike that doesnt move the arms , I have them all sitting collecting dust , this machine I can use , and feel it working my body.It also has a digital counter that shows distance , calories burnt , time on the unit and your current Speed.I must say also , the unit is made of good strong metal tubing , very well constructed , exspecially for a $ 100 dollar piece of equipment.If you already in good to great shape , this unit will not be for you , you 'll probably feel like your just bobbing in water rather than swiming ( to use an analogy ) .For those like me , a couch potato , a lazy bum , arm chair quarterback , good for nothing sleepyhead ... this is excerise machine is great !	1
The only reason I do not give five stars is because it is not silent but it is pretty quiet and for under $ 100 it 's one of the decade 's best bargains . First let me say that I am a 53 year old female and in fairly good shape . My main exercise is walking - I walk five miles at least four times a week ( also use my bike to run errands and shop ) . I wanted something to do on my no-walk days that would work different muscles . The Gazelle is fun and not difficult or unpleasant so of course I 'm thinking `` this ca n't be doing any good '' . No Pain No Gain right ? But walking does n't hurt and is enjoyable too and it does plenty of good so why ca n't the Gazelle be fun and still effective ? I do 30 - 40 minutes on the Gazelle about three times a week , sometimes to a TV program and sometimes to music . When working out to music the Gazelle is exceptionally accomodating in that you can adjust your pace and stride to match ANY tempo . You can really go at it on this thing or you can take it easy . I like being able to alter the intensity . The fact that it is pleasant and enjoyable is more important than you might think - the more fun it is the more apt you are to use it and I do n't care how expensive or `` efficient '' a piece of equipment is if you do n't enjoy using it eventually YOU WO N'T and how much good will it do then ? The Gazelle will be your buddy , not the enemy sitting there waiting to punish you . I have rigged mine up with padded cotton on the foot platforms and cotton socks pulled over the handles so that I can just get on barefoot with no preparation whatsoever and go . All I 'm in contact with is cotton which feels really good when you heat up . Hands up high on the handles and you are getting a good upper body workout , hands in the middle section and you are sharing the load between upper and lower body , hands low down and your legs are doing most of the work . As fun and easy as it is when I get off my legs are wobbly so I know for certain that I have been exerting myself . You can work out in many ways like others have said in their reviews - twisting , leaning forward or back , bending you knees , up on your toes , etc . I did n't get a video but lively music will spur you to move in new and creative ways if you get into it . It 's like dancing ! I did not bother with the electronic read-out thing - it looks pretty useless to me . The clicks and squeaks ( and yes I made sure all connections were tight ) are not that bad , you can still easily watch TV or listen to music . I have my TV watching/CD playing device right smack in front of my face when I am on the Gazelle , as close as it can be considering the forward swing of the pedals . The whole thing is a simple system of frame and swinging foot platforms suspended by cables - NO PISTONS TO HEAT UP AND LEAK . If there are animals in your house that do n't have enough sense to stay away from the Gazelle when you are using it ( you know the type ) you will want to put your Gazelle in a room or area that can be closed off . Frame tubing is fat and comes in a nice looking silvery gray finish . It 's not what would be considered compact so you will need plenty of floor space - at least 34 '' wide and 74 '' long to allow for full swing . One reviewer mentioned clips that would hold the foot platforms against the tubing when folding the Gazelle but I have yet to find those on mine , maybe I have a different model . Personally I am really glad that I do not have to fold and store mine , it 's heavy and big and I 'm certain I 'd never use it if I had to go through that much trouble . I highly recommend the Gazelle for people who have the space to keep it up and the time to use it for at least 30 minutes several times a week . I had knee pain from a step machine but I do not have knee pain from the Gazelle .	1
Since I work from home and long hours , I have a difficult time going to a gym or trying to fit exercise to my routine regularly . I have a Marcy recumbent Bike that I use when I want to watch TV and not be a Couch potato . It is great for that , but I needed something that would give me a more robust workout . I decided to try this because of its price and positive reviews . These are my thoughts on this : Pros:1 . Ease of assembly-It took me about 25 minutes to put this together , and most of that time was spent reading the assembly guide . There is not much too it . 4 bolts on the base , 2 on the axle , 4 for the handles and one for the Computer . That is it.2 . Quality - It is durable , and solid . It is not at all flimsy in anyway . I feel that they have made improvements to this model since it first came out 5 or 6 years ago.3 . Workout - This is the most important . It give a good aerobic and anaerobic work out . You just need to mix it up . Vary your routines . I could feel the burn after a 30 minute workout.4 . Space - It takes seconds to fold this flat , and against the wall . Like it was not even there.5 . Price - Do n't buy an expensive Elliptical until you have tried this . This is so inexpensive . Cheaper than a dinner for 2.6 . Quiet - It makes absolutely no noise . I did not have to do any oiling either.Cons:1 . Exercise video - I wish they would have included an exercise video with this . But I just went to Youtube and got ideas there.Summary : It gives me a great workout and is well designed . Best bang for the buck you will ever get on exercise equipment . I hope this review helped you , and stay fit .	1
It 's definitely not a robust workout , but it is what you make of it . If I lean forward a lot and lean back a lot , I can definitely work up a sweat . The first time I used it my legs were super sore ! I also love that I can fold it up and stick it in my closet . I do n't use it as often as I should , but that 's not the Gazelle 's fault ! : )	1
The Gazelle has its good and bad points . First , it is so easy to use ! Just hop on and glide ! Which brings me to another point , ohmygosh this is so easy on my knees and ankles . With the gazelle..you do n't have bouncing on your joints like regular cardio machines , treadmills , etc . GREAT plus in my opinion ! Also , it 's nice and quiet . I can watch tv while I use it , unlike a lot of workout machines.The only real negative is that it 's a wee bit easy to cheat on this , there is not as much effort to use this as there would be when you are chugging along on a treadmill or a rowing machine . It 's almost too easy.I love it . I recommend it !	1
It was not easy for me strength-wise to put this together but somehow , with a lot of swearing and grunting , I did it . I 've been using it daily for several weeks now and really enjoy it . I have it set up in front of my TV so the time flies while I 'm exercising . Some people have mentioned the noise . I heard an annoying clicking but just sprayed some WD40 into the cable assembly and it went away . I did n't bother installing the counter/timer because all I wanted was a countdown timer . I use one that easily attaches to the frame via a magnet ( Taylor digital timer ) .I put the Gazelle on a rug that 's on a wood floor . I noticed that it would move , getting closer and closer ( rug and all ) to furniture as I used it . I put one of those no-skid pads under the rug and that took care of the problem . No more creeping forward .	1
Like many 60+ year olds , I needed and wanted to exercise . I tried the gym and a personal trainer which was very effective , but too expensive for me to keep up when I retired . A friend had the Gazelle and she found it was the right kind of exercise for her . I tried her machine and liked it . I purchased the Gazelle from Amazon.The Gazelle came well packaged . The lubricated parts of the machine were well wrapped . My son-in-law put the Gazelle together for me . It is a little more complicated than I could handle . He used his own tools even though the set comes with everything you need . It took him about 30 mins to put this together . I watched the enclosed video , and I read the instructions.The Gazelle Edge info tells us this is the type of machine that provides a gliding motion that works the muscles of both the upper and lower body while burning calories and improving cardiovascular endurance . The machine is smooth and quiet - and stable . I found the machine provides a full-range of motion from a slow walk to a full run without sudden stops and without placing pressure on my joints . The low impact workout is ideal for me . I can choose to place my hands in a low , medium , or high grip to alter difficulty with different results for the upper body.The Gazelle has an easy-to-use and battery-operated 5-function workout computer . The Gazelle makers even provided the 2 AAA batteries needed . The computer gives us the speed , distance , time , and approximate calories burned . The machine folds up quickly into a flat position for easy storage - just snap the foot platforms onto the swing arms before sliding the frames together . And , it 's highly portable . You can store it under a bed , or standing in a closet . I leave mine upright in a space I made in my bedroom.The Gazelle is an exercise machine for all , the fluid motion makes it easy to use . I looked at the reviews of all the ellipticals and other machines , and the Gazelle had the most favorable reliability and satisfaction reviews . It is at a price that most everyone can afford . The Gazelle works the muscles of both the upper and lower body while burning calories and improving cardiovascular endurance . This is the kind of exercise machine I was looking for.Highly Recommended . prisrob 10-08-13-	1
I was very very skeptical upon reading reviews and the simple fact he markets this product on an infomercial ... however with my tax return I decided to go ahead and buy this basic 100 $ model . I got on it the first day after I put it together ... used it for 20 minutes that night then 10 the next morning . By the time I got off work that evening my calves were so incredibly sore ( and my calves were nothin to laugh at to begin with ( 18 inches , muscle not fat ) ... wow I love this thing ... I had to not do any on it for the next 3 days , I used it again last nite for 20 , then this morning for 30 ... I love this thing , it really works , plus I love if you bend forward from the ankles you can work on your upper body . I highly doubt this calorie counter is correct ( 260ish calories in a half hour ? ! ? ! ) However I never trust calorie counters on anything as none are acurate do to the simple fact people do burn amounts of energy a bit differently . I LOVE MY GAZELLE ! ! ! BUY ONE !	1
Mixed reviews on here . Myself I love it u can do so much more on it than you think . I 'm 50 , hate exercising but I love this machine . 30 minutes every other day , I 'm feeling good.Arrived in two days , I put it together myself , got my ass off the couch and I 'm exercising . Do n't let your bodies go to flab ladies , do it . Do something or just get old and fat and live with it , or get moving now	1
I have had this Gazelle for a long time and it sits permanently in my living room . I use it several times a week . I like it just as well or better than several other exercise items I have in my home.The reason I like it better ? I am a plus size senior gal with respiratory problems . The Gazelle is easy to step onto and off . It requires no effort other than remaining upright : ) Sometimes I just hold onto the crossbar ; other times I use the handlebars for a more aerobic exercise . A slow aerobic exercise , but I am moving ! Using the Gazelle does not hurt my knees or any joints for that matter.The machine just does not require any exertion to use ! And , it 's quiet and very sturdy . I never worry about losing my balance.It is capable of much more , but for me and what I need and what I am able to do , it works !	1
This is a good machine for people who have tendinosis or arthritis in the knee joint . Often , people with osteoarthritis are also overweight . Losing excess weight can really help with the pain and inflammation because the knee is a weight bearing joint . Even to begin to lose a few extra pounds ... takes pressure off the joint . To lose weight effectively , some regular exercise is needed . This machine allow you to get some cardio exercise without stressing the joint . Although , it is probably still a good ideal to ice the joint down after working out ... ice until numb if inflammation is a problem ... This machine does help tone biceps brachii , triceps , anterior deltoid , pectoralis major and the lateral fibers of trapezius , but it is definitely not the most effective choice to use . To achieve muscle tone and definition for those that have knee problems , it would be better to work those muscle while seated with free weight . This machine is excellent for the Gluts..all of those muscles . It has a much more effective action than the treadmill for the G-Max group because you can really extend the leg . Notice that Tony Little has a very nicely developed tush . One last note , it is still a good to flex the knee if you have arthritis , but you can do that seated because you have more leverage and control over your range of motion . It can be a real challenge to workout when you have knee pain , but this machine can help you do just that .	1
I bought this after researching the internet for a beginner 's fitness machine . I also wanted a low impact workout as I have a damaged knee which does n't allow me to jog or run under any stress . The Gazelle Edge does the job perfectly for those of us 40+ who have n't exercised for several years and need to get back into shape . Search for a bargain on the internet - I got mine for $ 70 including shipping . It was promptly delivered and was easy to assemble . In total there are 7 bolts that have to be undone ( one on the `` computer '' ) plus a couple of philips screws on the arm covers . You will need a screwdriver for the latter , although they are only a cosmetic fitting . The various shafts put together and the bolts re-fitted . All very easy and logical . In all it took about 25 minutes and the kit comes with 2 flat wrenches to achieve this.Others have written in great detail about the features of the machine , which I will not repeat . All I will say is that it does what it 's supposed to as far as I am concerned , and the price is excellent for this well made equipment . A 20 minute workout on this once of twice a day is easy to do and feels good too !	1
Great handle size not to big and not to small . The only complaint is on of the sides was not put in perfectly straight so there is a slight bend to the weight . But im a perfectionist and it rarely ecen bothers me	1
So I just received my dumbbells today , I ordered a pair of 30 's and 20 's to use with body beast . Like last time I immediately took out the scale and weighed my dumbells , I was really happy with the results , one dumbbell weighed exactly 31 lbs and the other weighed 30.6 lbs . My 20lb dumbbells were 20.4 lbs and 21.2 lbs . So for the price of these dumbbells the weights were pretty accurate . Remember you are NOT buying precision cast dumbbells with EXACT weights , you are getting approximate weights with precision cast your paying more money and for the average person at home its not really worth it . Another thing id like to mention is that CAP gets a lot of heat for being a `` cheap '' or `` pos '' fitness company but ive never had a problem with my cap dumbbells and weight plates and I do n't expect these to give me any trouble either . I DO NOT take care of my plates and dumbbells , I toss them around , drop them , leave em out in the sun/rain , and they stay in good condition ! sure they are chipped by now but I could n't care less about the paint chipping aslong as they do n't break . That 's all ive got for now but as with my other reviews I will keep updating this review to let you guys know how they hold up over time to hard use and abuse ! Thanks for reading !	1
These dumbbells are made extremely well and you get what you pay for but hese are some of the cheapest dumbbells out there and they work great . They 're not too large or cumbersome like some of the other dumbbells out there . The only thing you need to watch out for is that there is no rubber coating on these and they will scratch up the surface of your floor .	1
These weights are solidly built and are very useful . I currently use them for P90X . They are cheap and a great value .	1
The design of these dumbbells is nice and they work well BUT the one big flaw is that the handles are so thin . I 've seen many bodybuilders and athletes say that thick-handled dumbbells are much better for building arm size so I had to buy some Fat Gripz on here too to make these dumbbell handles much thicker . Worked like a charm and put some serious size on my arms . All in all , great product but adding Fat Gripz makes them much more effective IMO.Fat Gripz - The Ultimate Arm Builder	1
Bought 2x 25 pound and am satisfied with my purchase . I think I will be buying 30 or 35 next .	1
Not much to say , this is a dumbbell . Pretty much what it looks like . Does n't have any of the unnecessary padding or other stuff that comes on other dumbbells , just a solid piece of metal . Works great , it was exactly what I was looking for .	1
Its a 20 lb weight , just as I expected . If you 're using it for legs , it might be a good idea to look for one with fabric . I usually just wear pants to cover the area or wrap an ankle weight around the middle .	1
At my local Sports Authority store , I bought a pair of 35 lb dumbbells of this very brand . For the past two years these dumbbells have had great durability and coating does n't chip off easily.The handle has a grid pattern which provides decent grip . The handle also does not burn my hands.Expected performance and I 've no complaints whatsoever . Highly recommended	1
Great price and exactly as described . I am going to order a 15 lb set soon . I used these for high reps to stay toned and not so much for bulk . I have some 20 and 30 lb dumbbells that I also use for strength building and adding bulk to my arms and shoulders .	1
What is there to say ? Just like buying weights at a Sporting Goods Store , but cheaper . Have n't rusted yet so that 's good .	1
It 's a dumbbell so really there is n't much to say honestly . Solid , heavy . Only issue is the ones I got the silver on the dumbbell is somewhat cracked , but does n't affect the use .	1
Sometimes have trouble with the hex heads falling off ... good so far with this brand . Would recommend to anyone building a set .	1
There 's nothing much to these babies . They lift great though and work just like any other dumbbell . No fancy grips and just regular solid materials . If the grip is a problem then put on some & # 34 ; Fat-Gripz & # 34 ; which will make the grip larger and make you stronger too . Defiantly recommend these dumbbells .	1
Very good quality and comfortable to use . I Just hope it can be cheaper so that I can buy more heavy ones .	1
I have a whole set of these , from 10 pounders to 45 pounders . They are a great fitness aid , as they are immensely portable and can be used in any room of the house , while watching TV , or next to your computer desk . There are a wealth of exercises one can do with simple dumbells : curls , bent rowing , overhead extensions , etc . If you have a bench , there are even more . Believe it or not , a home body builder can get a pretty decent workout from a limited set of these dumbells . They are relatively cheap compared to other brands . I recommend them.Jim `` Konedog '' Koenig	1
It comes without surprise that neither FedEx nor UPS was too excited about delivering these dumbbells . I got the 60 pound hex dumbbells and they were delivered promptly . The quality on these seem fine . I have n't weighed them.NOTE : The packaging for both of the dumbbells was completely destroyed upon delivery . All the delivery driver had was the bare dumbbell and a shipping label in his hand indicating that it belonged to this address . The dumbbells arrived in excellent shape so no complaints on my end .	1
As mentioned already , expect the package to be destroyed when it gets to your door.Otherwise it is a heavy piece of metal that is durable and functions exactly as intended .	1
Great barbells for the money ! Sturdy , I love that they 're not neoprene coated so there 's nothing to get shredded , all around good product for the money .	1
These weights were shipped quickly and arrived in good order ( hard to damage solid iron ) .Weight seems to be correct . Size of weight is clearly marked.The handle is the wide , straight version . This type of handle can cause some issues for people brand new to them but that will go away with time and use . The grip seems to be well etched and works like it supposed to . Although , I would not expect the use of these weights with some type of oily/coated hands that may leave a reside . If you have never used these types of weights before then you should probably use a thin set of weight gloves so as to get some toughening of the hands at first.If you might be concerned about the length of the bar you do not need to be . All you should do is to center your hands and have enough of a grip to hold it there . If you do n't then I suggest you work your forearms harder ( rolling down the fingers and back up while forearm is supported only to the wrist thus , leaving the hand free to bend downward . This can be done both with the back of the hand pointing toward the floor and , though much harder , with the palm down . Work until failure ( past the burning ) for 4 or 5 sets utilizing only 60 - 90 seconds resting periods between sets . Anyway ... ) Hope this helped some . Just remember , these are n't `` show-off '' weights , they are working weights .	1
They 're dumbbells , so there really is n't much that can be said.But anyway , if you break your wrist and you have n't been able to do pushups because your wrist has n't become flexible enough yet to put your hands flat on the ground , you can use these dumbbells to hold on to and do pushups.So , see , they have multiple uses . But they really cost way , way too much for what they are .	1
its weight is on point , what else can i say besides that it does its job , grip could be better tho	1
So I needed a heavier set dumbbells for my home gym ( I 'm starting Body Beast ) . But I was dreading having to go to the store and tugging one all the way home its 60 lbs after all . Buts that 's where Amazon comes in . They shipped it to my front door for FREE ! !	1
This is a great dumbbell in several ways . One way is the rigid grip on the handle . The rigid & bumpy grip makes it difficult to drop unless you completely let go of it . Wearing gloves is recommended if you have soft or sensitive hands . The hexagon shape prevents rolling , so you can use these to perform pushups with . The coating holds up really well . Overrall , a great product . I highly recommend it .	1
These work great . They last and they are soft enough that they do n't hurt my dog 's mouth during a game of catch .	1
These socks are just as nice as anything that Smartwool puts out and costs less . I would definitely recommend them .	1
I normally would n't pay $ 15 or more for a pair of socks and I did n't in this case . These were on sale for around $ 10 a pair , and I bought three pair in gray and they have been well worth it.These socks offer superior cushioning in the areas that most typically take the greatest abuse . They do n't slip or shift as you wear them and they prevent chaffing and rubbing . The keep my feet warm and dry as they have superior wicking quality . I go for long walks in the woods near my house and my feet feel good afterward which I can only attribute to my hiking boots and these socks . I even poke around the house in these socks because they are comfortable and provide decent traction on hard wood floorsFor what it 's worth , I 've been wearing these for quite awhile now and they seem to be wearing better than my other socks . No piling or signs of thinning in spots such as the heels which usually go first . They wash up nicely and while not specifically listed as antimicrobial , these keep my feet dry and fresh smelling .	1
I 've worn ThorLos for years . They are my favorite sock for hiking , walking , working out or just wearing at home with fitness shoes . The elastic on top grips the instep and the arch . The ball of the foot and the heel are padded , the toe is sturdy . I 've actually never had a pair wear into holes . I love these .	1
I buy a bunch at a time , they last a year of hard wear . it helps not to throw them in the dryer .	1
People would not call fly casing & # 34 ; Easy. & # 34 ; Like golf , it 's a skill that one can spend a lifetime mastering . Some inexpensive all-in-one fly outfits use & # 34 ; level & # 34 ; taper line , meaning that it is the same thickness throughout . & # 34 ; Weight Forward & # 34 ; line like this is heavier at the front end than the back , which makes casting easier . I 've used & # 34 ; Double Taper & # 34 ; line in the past , which has weighted portions at both ends , allowing it to be reversed when worn , but I never seemed to get around to reversing it , and this tape seems to suit my casting needs better .	1
I 've been fly casting for 16 years now and it took about five years to master . I 've been using this line for several years and have found it very effective , slick , and easy to use . It should be cleaned often and between seasons , it should be stored on a coffee can or round item of similar size . Highly recommended ! Scientific Angler Air Cel Fly Line	1
Got this line because I purchased an inexpensive fly combo and did n't want to sink a bunch of money into the line . This line works well and have reeled in bass and other panfish on it.I recommend this line .	1
bought this fly line to go with my okuma fly reel . it is a great line and works well . why spend double ?	1
I use this on a rig for warm water bass and bluegill ( or whatever else may be biting ) . It 's held up well to a year of regular use . Low memory , casts smoothly , and a 40 foot cast is doable even for an amateur . It sometimes gets dragged through branches and rocks , but has not shown any signs of wear .	1
I wanted a light rig and line for pan fishing and this line fills the bill , I was n't sure about the color , but it has plenty of contrast and floats easily on the waters surface . Flows easily through my fingers and the line guides . The line picked up some pine tar from a pier I was fishing on and had sticky spots on it . However it self cleaned after about a dozen cast . I have worn out a leader from bad false casting and broken the leader line with a couple of snagged flies . However the Scientific Anglers Air Cel line is hanging tough and cast are getting easier and longer with each session , I give a lot of credit to the line , and recommend it !	1
Bought this to respool a couple of rods before a fishing trip to the shore , stren quality fishing line at a good price .	1
stren has always been my favorite fishing line because of the low memory and seems to be super tough . good stuff	1
This Stren High Impact fishing line held up well during a really good fishing trip ! It was easy to work with , and I would suggest it .	1
A well known make , good quality , if you need to fill lots of reels go for it , also a good price	1
I used this line to today it very strong I caught a 5ft catfish and this line did what it was suppose to do I m very satisfied highly recommend I had enough to put on three reel and still have some left over .	1
This is a great product . However , if you never installed lock cores before , then do not worry . It only takes you about mins tops to get use to this lock core system . It is fairly easy to install .	1
How would you like to park your car , unload your kayak , go out for a nice ride , then come back to head home only to realize you no longer have a rack . I did n't think so . It 's just common sense to protect your investment , you need these . For what they are , the price seems a bit much ... in all honesty the racks should just come WITH these . But they do n't . So buy them .	1
These core sets are incredibly useful for Yakima Roof Rack owners . They allow you to use one key for all your components . They are always easy to install and uninstall in the various Yakima components . I have one key that is the same for my four Yakima Q towers , my cargo box , snowboard rack , and bike rack.I would say buy atleast an 8 pack if you buy a Yakima towers rack . You need 4 right off the bat for the rack towers , and then you want several to be able to lock up snowboards or skis , bikes , and cargo box etc.Definitely recommend this to anyone buying a Yakima rack .	1
SKS lock cores were very easy to install with the 'core-key ' provided with all shipments . Nice having all locks alike/one key to do the job . Locks function smoothly and keep prying eyes from considering removing your racks . This is a recommended product to secure your rack and accessories .	1
I have many sets of these lock cores . I use them to lock my bars to my car and to lock my Yakima saddles to my trailer . The cores are easy to install , taking just minutes . It 's an inexpensive way to easily protect your equipment from the casual or opportunistic thief .	1
I 've had this product for almost eight years . I got the ten-pack . I used four on my Q-Towers that mount my bars and two on my cargo carrier . Remaining four are in reserve for future use.It is a convenience to be able to carry only one key for multiple locks.It is regrettable that in order to effectively use this system , you have to forecast how many lockable Yakima products are in your future and get at least that many cores ( again , I have four in reserve at the moment waiting to be installed in future Yakima products ) .I ca n't really say anything negative except that I wished that I did n't have to buy extras `` just in case '' .Beyond that , ca n't really complain.But it would be nice if I could somehow order additional ones keyed to my existing key ( i.e. , which would allow me to marginally add to my system , rather than having to buy a few spare ones up front ) .	1
The locks are effective for securing your yakima rooftop car rack . Easy to install . Easy to use . I would recommend this to a friend .	1
No issues at all . The install easily and quickly and lock securely . I like the keyed alike simplicity and the ability to easily order additional locks as needed	1
East to set , but a little expensive than I think.Anyhow , it keeps your stuff from robbery . So it is must have item for you .	1
'Lock Cores ' are a necessity for all Yakima ski racks , bike racks , etc . They come in groups of ( 2 ) two to ( 10 ) ten and they install with a breeze . You also get a key for each lock and a spare to take to the key-maker for the third . The one problem I have with Yakima is that they do NOT include these in their rack systems and they have to be purchased separately if you want to be sure your rack ( and skis or bike ) are not stolen . What you pay is monstrously expensive . But they have you by the cajunas , so you are stuck . In the long run , you really do need them to prevent against theft . They also are weather resistant , but I 'd recommend wiping them off after travel . You also can register them on-line or in the mail to get replacement keys if they get lost ( I wonder what that costs ? ) .	1
Added security to protect my surf racks . Bought the 8-pack because I have racks on 2 cars and love having one key fit them both . Stainless steel to protect from rust and they were easy to install in less than 5 minutes !	1
Work to secure the towers ..These should stop the casual theft but I think they would only be a minor inconvenience to the dedicated thief..Easy to install..easy to use.. but as with all Yakima accessories ... Way over priced..	1
These locks are expensive for what they are , but , if they prevent my rack from being stolen just once , they have paid for themselves.The product is as advertised .	1
It 's a must have when owning a car roof rack . When you mount your $ 2000+ bike on your roof and after spending $ 300+ on the roof rack alone . The last thing you need is someone stealing all of it , These locks just make it `` that '' much more difficult for a theif	1
These locks are tailored for the Yakima product line . You wo n't be able to save money by purchasing your own cores from Lowes or Home Depot ... I already tried . I spent about as much on my Yakima rack as I did on my Kayak , so these little locks were a no-brainer . I fully intend to protect that rack- its a good deal to buy them on Amazon as opposed to the store .	1
Cumplio con las expectativas que tenia . lo recomiendo 100 % , ideal para utilizar en la ciuadad . los materiales de buena calidad y el lente tiene buen angulo de vision	1
My boyfriend ordered one of these for his Globe bike and I tried it and love it . I just ordered two of these for my two bikes.What 's nice about this mirror is that you velcro it on to any handlebar . The mirror also swivels so that when you shift with the handlebar you can adjust it . Since my bikes are Trek automatics , I do n't have to use the handlebar to shift so I wo n't encounter this issue.The size of the mirror is sufficient enough to view behind you . I also like that you can constantly mount and unmount this mirror from your bike to prevent breakage during bike rack transport . The easy mount and unmount of the mirror puts it at greater risk of being stolen , however.Having a bike mirror is a safety issue and in my opinion this is a good buy especially because it 's so easy to mount and unmount .	1
I bought these looking for an extra pair of bike shorts for this coming season . I got on 3-4 long rides each week and just needed an extra pair without breaking my budget . These have really good padding and are quite comfortable . They do pull up really high , a little bit of a granny style , but my top usually covers it and it is better than being too low . I wish they had an xs , I am 5'0 & # 34 ; and about 110 lbs and I almost want the small to be a bit more snug , but I may just be used to my compression shorts . Overall I am pretty happy with the short .	1
This is coming from a non-cyclist ... they feel like I 'm wearing a diaper . Probably common for this type of design , and necessary . My tush is plenty cushy with these shorts .	1
I just starting riding and I love the fit and how it looks need to get more now thank you so much	1
I purchased these and the gel shorts thinking these would be my backups . However , I really perfer these over the gel pads . They are just a lot more comfortable and provide better padding while riding . Pleasently suprised !	1
i already have a 45 lb . plate at home but i swear these are heavier . they say 45 lb . on the side but they feel more like 55 or 60. do n't know why but i 'll take them .	1
Weights are in perfect condition and weigh exactly what they should . They fit my 2 & # 34 ; Olympic barbell . I definitely prefer the black and silver paint job over the plain gray plates I 've had in the past .	1
I have no scales so I 'm just gon na say it weigh 's 45LB 's .	1
I got on Amazon looking for a 5 lb weight . I was hoping for Prime , and here it was.This plate weighs 5 lbs . It is very good at it , and I think it will continue to weigh 5 lbs very well for a long time.I highly recommend this weight to anyone who is looking for something that weighs 5 lbs . Because that 's what it does . Not much else .	1
This weight plate came as described , fits perfectly onto my 2 '' barbell . I ordered 2 more of another weight just like these .	1
What you see is what you get . The only issue is that the paint seems to rub off easily , but I 'm not too worried about it . I did n't buy these because I thought they looked pretty . Cap is a good brand and this barbell weighed what it was supposed to weigh .	1
Not sure how you could have a bad plate . Fits my olympic bar . Does what its supposed to . Shipping was fast and I got them for a good price . Satisfied .	1
OK , so , it 's a barbell , what is there to review , but I just bought 1 of these for finger exercises and the lip around the edge of the barbell is a good distance to get the tips of my fingers under for that kind of lifting . It 's a good product . I 'm glad I bought it .	1
These are perfect for my needs - just need another set , and these were the cheapest I found both online and in local stores . It was hard to go wrong with these . I did not weigh them , but I 'm not a competitive lifter and do not care if it 's a pound +/-	1
Well made metal plates . Price is good . Got free shipping . They will last Forever.These are the plates I grew up on . They wo n't hurt the floor unless you drop them	1
I got these plates for just over one dollar per pound , which is about as good a price as I could find for weights of this quality . The ridge around the outside is easy to grip for loading/unloading or for finger/forearm exercises . The weight is within 0.1 pound of what 's expected . I will buy these again if I need more weight in the future !	1
I have two pairs of these shorts . They last forever . They are comfortable and look pretty decent too . It 's a good purchase .	1
I 'm not an experienced rider but when I put these on it really helped with some discomfort I was having . Great product .	1
Very good fillet glove for cleaning fish . I bought this from Amazon for $ 16 but found it chaeper at Academy for $ 12 . Chaeck around first but this was easy to get .	1
Does n't seem like it , but it really does stop knife blades . Light weight and comfortable . I 'm going to buy a second one.- Dave Powers	1
I wish i would have had this glove a week earlier when i cut my finger cleaning a fish . It works for cuts but may not stop a direct knife point straight in .	1
Great item . Had one for years and it has still not worn out , but it is getting a little smelly.It is very easy to use your hands with the glove on , yet feel safe handling fish with sharp gills , fins , teeth , and using that sharp filet knife . Also gives you a sure grip when handling slippery fish.Highly recommended .	1
This is one of my best investments , the amount of times this item saved me , probably saved me over $ 500 in medical supplies and maybe some hospital visits .	1
Grips fish well and works just as advertised . The glove is easy to clean . Just take note ... there is only one glove per package .	1
This glove is great . Made cleaning fish much better . no more sliding around and worrying about getting my hand cut with the knife or a fish 's fins . Great glove	1
glove did exactly what it was suppose to do , keep me from cutting my fingers.fit well , griped the fish well.only con would be , that i felt the weave in some places could of been tighter , thats why i gave it a 4.first glove i used and love it .	1
Try to cut my hand wind filet knife glove protected my hand . Do n't try this yourself at home just did it to see if the glove work	1
The glove construction appears as advertised , but do n't be thrown off by the picture as I was . This is only for 1 glove . Double the price if you want 2.***UPDATE***12-21-2012 . The picture has been updated since I purchased the glove . Good job Amazon !	1
Made of a combination of cotton and synthetic material with steel wire woven in ( Tuff-Knit ) . Correct sizing for a good fit . I have large hands ( can palm a basketball ) and the BPFGL was a comfortable tight fit after a little stretch . It is sold as ONE ambidextrous glove per package , same on both surfaces . Provides a good grasp of scaly/slippery fish while protecting fingers from sharp accidental knife slices or pricks from fish teeth or spines.Useful in the kitchen ( slicing , dicing and mandolin work ) , butcher work , sorting & handling sharp tools and handling garbage ( broken glass , shards , needles etc . ) - and any job with a risk of hand injury by sharp objects.Not recommended as a fishing glove - slippery surface is not ideal for a good grip on the rod ; rubberized gloves are preferred.Best method to clean : after use , soak in chlorine bleach then wash in warm soapy water and air dry . Alternatively , may be washed in dishwasher on low setting.I found the Rapala fillet glove to be very useful and have several for different jobs .	1
I bought this to take on vacation with me . I wanted the larger size , because I knew my girlfriend would inevitably want to join me , and I did n't trust a & # 34 ; single & # 34 ; hammock to support us both.To begin with , the hammock is very light and portable . It comes with two very nice long ropes which are sturdy and rough enough to attach securely to just about anything , without being scratchy or stiff . The stuff-sack/pocket is a nice feature , both for portability and practicality . It accommodates a water bottle comfortably.As for the hammock itself , the material is soft and does n't dig in or leave the awful lines that a netting type hammock does . There is a little bit of flex to it , more so with 2 people in it , but that 's not to say its stretchy or bouncy , just make sure that you mount it high enough to keep you butts off the ground.The benefit of the size , besides being able to accommodate 2 people in relative comfort is that it provides a wide variety of options for enjoying it . I 'm 6 feet tall , 180 pounds and I can lay comfortably lengthwise or width wise , or any sprawly variation thereof . Additionally , if it 's particularly windy or sunny , if you lay lengthwise , you can fold the outer portion of the hammock over on top of yourself , think of the pods that the blue people sleep in in the Avatar movie . This will effectively stop wind , cut the sun and keep you dry in a light rain . The best part was that using the hammock like this , I still had plenty of room to read without feeling claustrophobic . The only caveat I would offer here is that this will get warm , the hammock is quite good at trapping heat in this way , which may be a good or bad thing depending on the circumstances . In any event , if you get too hot , just open it up for a second and let in some fresh air . I will also say , that while the hammock is good at trapping heat in the airspace created , if you 're laying directly on the fabric , any decent breeze will be felt taking that warmth away ; something else to consider if you 're planning to use this in cooler weather . This could probably be solved by throwing a blanket or sleeping bag on first to provide some insulation . This cocoon configuration also works with two people in the hammock if you want a little more privacy . Just to be clear , this is n't bug proof , you 'll still need a net if that 's a concern.While I bought it primarily for it 's portability , I believe that it 's durable and comfortable enough for day to day use in the back yard or wherever you intend to set it up . I do n't think I would leave it out when I was n't using it , but that 's just taking good care of things.All in all , I 'm very happy with this . It 's portable , comfortable , and while I have n't had it for long enough to truly put it through its paces and say definitively that it 's durable , I do n't expect to have any problems with it .	1
This thing is big where it counts and compacts nicely . I am a college student and have this thing hanging in my dorm room , actually writing this review while sitting it it ! Very comfortable and breathable . I got this firstly because I wanted a lightweight alternative to a tent when backpacking and liked the idea of hammocking . The product did its job well , my friends in a tent were mad that they could hear me snoring after 5 minutes of laying in it while they were up for a while trying to get to sleep ! It compresses into a small pouch stitched onto the hammock ! The pouch is about 6 or so inches wide , 7 or 8 tall and gets like 3 inches thickness . The hammock itself is plenty long and surprisingly wide , very comfortable for me and some company ; ) . The price is great for this hammock , since it is so versatile , durable , and comfortable.If you are thinking about getting a hammock , get this one you will not be disappointed !	1
Honestly I 'm in love with this hammock , it 's lightweight and small , and SO comfy . I even prefer this one over the & # 34 ; nice & # 34 ; ones that have the wooden cross bar and stuff , or the ones with the woven cotton . The nylon totally conforms to your body and it 's just amazing . It really does hold 2 people without breaking too . As soon as mine breaks I 'm buying another , no question .	1
When I first got this hammock , I was having problems with shoulder squeeze . After some persistence , I figured out that this hammock NEEDS a structural ridgeline . I found through trial and error that 95 '' works best for me . This allows me to comfortably lay on a diagonal . And while not board flat , it is about as flat as your favorite comfy reclining easy chair , maybe even slightly flatter . And the 95 '' ridgeline eliminated the shoulder squeeze problem for me too.At first I thought this hammock was too big for me ( I am 5'10 '' , 240 lbs ) , so I ordered a single size from Grand Trunk . I still had a shoulder squeeze issue in that hammock , so I started looking into the problem more , and that is when I figured out the need for the ridgeline . Now I think the extra size makes it more comfortable than the single , and I prefer it.I also use the structural ridgeline to hang my ENO bug net from , and to clip my light and ridgeline organizer too , so it ended up being a very practical and functional addition that improved my hammock experience in several ways , including reduced setup time ( ridgeline stays attached to hammock , now I only have to hang for height of the hammock , the angle of the suspension is no longer a factor in the hang ) .I also had some problems early on with finding a good suspension system that would not stretch and leave me on the ground in the morning . I finally settled on Kammok Python Straps and 2 climbing carabiners in the ends of the hammock . I also wrote a review of the Python Straps and highly recommend them no matter what brand hammock you use.Hopefully some of these tips will help you enjoy your hammock a bit more .	1
The coolest part is the little bag is goes in is attached or part of the hammock so you never lose the bag and it gets really compact when you put it in there . I also purchased the tree straps which seem pretty necessary for full and easy use of this product but I love it so far ! Used it camping and was easy to set up and tear down with the tree straps which are sold separately for about $ 17 I believe .	1
I got mine today and was excited to try it out . I went out in my back yard , pulled it from the stuff sack and was left asking myself and promptly found that I was going to need to make a modification because 100 & # 34 ; ( inches ) of rope is nowhere near enough if you are using this hammock for hiking . I swapped the provided 100 & # 34 ; of rope with 23 ' paracord and stainless steel ring a per side . I am now ready to test it out and hopefully it will be good to go .	1
I am a backpacker and I have been using this hammack now for about two years . I weigh 210 lbs @ 5'10 '' height . My hammock still shows no signs of wear after at least 30 combined nights of use . With an insulating pad underneath you will master the cold weather . And for summer nights , there is no more comfortable alternative to this unit . They remain lofty and dry in all weather , with the added advantage of being up off the ground - a real plus when your fellows in tents are getting soaked by the rain . With a small effort you can string a 9X12 tarp just overhead and remain dry and happy on a damp and dreary night . Also they offer a great refuge for the weary hiker . And make a great place for a nap . I love this hammock and could n't be more pleased to own it .	1
I just love it . It works smooth and does what it is supposed to do . Fast , solid and light . Strongly would recommend it . DO BUY IT . If you buy one of these i do n't think you would need any of those expensive ones . What for ?	1
I purchased these too teach the kids how to use a spin reel and these are a solid choice for that purpose . They have a little lever that makes it easy for kids to click the bail over before casting . The would also serve as a decent back up reel in a pinch . They are what they are though , a basic cheap reel .	1
For the price , how can you beat this reel ? I fresh-water fish , and it 's all I needed . No complaints -- just glad it was offered on Prime shipping !	1
This seems to be a good reel . Light and durable . It goes good with my Eagle Claw telescopic rod with 10lb . test .	1
Already had the 2000 reel and wanted one a little smaller for my hiking trips . It works good and if it is anything like the other one I own . I am sure it will be just as relliable . Good deal . ! ! ! !	1
One ball bearing spinning rod . It is what it is . Initially works well , looks well made . See if it holds up . Only time will tell . I do n't maintain my reels very well . So I use them up ( 1 season ) and then I ditch them . For me this is what I do .	1
Good price , reliable product . Great gift in christmas . This rod work perfectly and is very easy to install and use .	1
I got this as a backup reel because my ancient Abu Garcia reel I have used forever is getting to be a little ragged . For $ 13 you can not go wrong at all with this reel . The weight is perfect , the reel is SMOOTH as can be , and I was able to use it with ease as a left handed caster . I put Cajun line on it and had no problems whatsoever . I like this reel so much , I might buy another one ! For such a low price , this is great quality !	1
this product is awsome . its worth the money . I had one before but some fish pulled it out of the boat and lost the reel and rod togather , i bought it again . if you are catching porgies , cocktail blues , or even medium size catfish , put 20lb braid or 15 pound ande line in it , and you are set to go .	1
This is not the best reel on the market . It is far from it . But for the price , it simply ca n't be beat . It seems to be the standard Shimano reel design only made with cheaper parts . It is mostly graphite , which feels more like hard plastic . And to top it off , it is usable in saltwater , although I have not personally tested it those conditions.If you have never fished before and are n't ready to make a large investment , this is the reel for you . If you are an experienced fisherman and need a lightweight or backup reel , you ca n't go wrong with this . It was less expensive than the Shimano FX which has an aluminum spool and a light counterweight , but this version has an interesting trigger for one handed casting that was pretty easy to figure out . I paid $ 11- $ 12 at the local Sport Chalet for the IX R1000 size and it has a nice fit and balance on my lightweight and med-light poles.I balked at this reel at first because I thought it was too cheap to be any good , but it is the perfect reel for your secondary or backup reel , but also suitable as your everyday go-to reel for those looking for a bargain .	1
Its got some weight to it , rated for salt , ok we will see ... Judging from experience it feels like a good one for 12 dollars.Only time tells on reels ... Two trips so far works ok..	1
The Shimano IX-2000 and IX-4000 are the best spinning reels I 've ever owned . I bought one of each about 6-years ago , figured for the price , I could n't go wrong ... hey , Shimano makes bicycle gears , so they got ta know what they are doing , right ? Well , as an old Shakespeare and Zebco guy , I figured if they were half as good , I 'd be fine with the product . Boy , was I surprised . The spinning action is super-smooth , like what you 'd expect in a $ 100 reel . I 've owned several Penn Senator spool reels , and the Shimano smoothness of action really does compare to the Penn Senator line . The drag is super smooth and adjusts infinitely , as well . The Shimano bearing and gearing ca n't be beat . I try to tell everyone I can , hey ... if you want a lightweight reel that can handle 10-12 pound test , fight a 5-pounder easy , then go with the Shimano IX-2000RC . If you are more into lunker catfish and need to go up to the 16-20 pound test , then you want the IX-4000 reel ... an almost exact copy of the 2000 , but bigger and beefier . I 've taken 25-pound rockfish with the IX-4000 easy ... and the gearing in both are just right for their design , so you do n't feel like you are cranking your guts out , or cranking forever to move it a foot , either.These are better than good , they are great reels folks . I like them so much , I just bought another IX-2000RC for a new pole I got . The older ones work like new still , too ... with thousands of casts on them now .	1
This little reel is great , Ive been fishing all my life and I tell you what this is the best deal on a shimano spinning reel ive ever seen .	1
This is not a high end reel by any means , but it serves my purpose to spool up some light line for occasional trout fishing . It is light , well balanced and has a nice smooth action typical of Shimano products .	1
I 've used the reel several times now and it really makes one-handed casting easy once you get the hang of it . It 's my & # 34 ; go to & # 34 ; reel . I caught a 5 foot hammerhead shark on it . I released the shark as I was in a 9 foot inflatable ! It did the job with 15 lb . braided Power Pro line . I love this reel !	1
This is a great , classic stick for the small stuff . It 's not too big for the small bluegill and it 's not too small for the largemouth . It 's a very versatile rod for people who do n't want 20 rods and reels for every presentation .	1
I love the action of this rod . I purchased it after reading an article in a magazine about bass fishing by a pro bass fisherman . The only other rod he recommended was over three times the cost .	1
Good solid rod with good action . Casts well . Handles fish on line with ease . Would recommend . Not to heavy to tire you from a long day fishing .	1
This seems to be heavier than some of the Shimano rods that I have purchased recently . I will probably use it more for bottom fishing and less for casting .	1
Not sure what the negative reviews are about regarding the cable being too tight -must be an older model because ours is made out of plastic and works exceptionally well . What we 've found to be especially useful regarding this tool is that it gives young players the confidence they need in hitting the ball . Once your child gets used to using this tool , the batting averages increase tremendously . It teaches the hand-eye coordination exceptionally well and they boys can hit this thing to their hearts ' content without ever chasing a ball or breaking a window . My only complaint is that I wish I would have found this thing sooner . It came highly recommended from the local sports authority shop , told me that it was their number one selling training item and they even recommended it over the two hundred dollar trainers.In addition , this item is good for all age groups , including adults . Great , great tool , highly recommend !	1
Great hitting tool for when you are not with your son . He jus t goes out and hits with this when I 'm not around..great eye hand coordination tool for hitting.used other one so much that my son hit cover off ball.but that 's using it for 3 years . I just recommend not to leave this outside in the environment so it lasts longer .	1
We have used this type product for years and it greatly improves timing and hand-eye coordination in a young child . It also helped work on his hitting strength .	1
Compact , light and reasonably priced . Been using this in salt water lagoon for last 2 weeks and it does an excellent job ! People mention it corrodes in salt water & # 8230 ; . so perhaps best to give it a wash , but for 25 bucks it 's a great product.Handy storage bag prevents mud and water getting all over the boat . Also has a sleeve to lock it open when in use or shut for storage , plus buoy and long rope .	1
Well constructed product . Easy to use . Useable right out of the package . Nice storage bag . Good size for packing in a canoe or kayak . Clip is good and strong .	1
Took this out to the St. Johns River in Central Florida and it held my pwc just fine against the current with two people on it . Would highly recommend to anybody doing some PWC fishing or on a small boat .	1
Cant complain it does what it is supposed to do and I just make sure to rinse it clean after each use .	1
I use this for my kayak . Easy to store and use . It 's a bit heavier than I need , but works great at keeping me from drifting .	1
this will help you stay in your favorite fishing hole . the buoy is a great help should you drop it or if it comes un-hooked . you could even mark a great fishing spot while you explore others .	1
I read all the reviews and was worried this would n't hold at my lake we go to . Where the jet skis are allowed there is a lot of wakes that pound the ski on the shore . After using this anchor I can park it anywhere . Sand - mud - gravel . It holds fast in everything . I have n't tried it in the ocean yet . Funny thing is I was going to buy another on for our second jet ski but I made a tether rope and tied the second jetski to the first . OMG it held them both fast . The current keeps them spaced so you do n't have to worry about them banging on each other . One anchor holds 2 jetskis . If that 's not a good test for this review nothing is . Make sure your tether is about 4 foot from the back of the first jet ski . You want to give them enough slack so they both can ride out swells . A++	1
I use these to hook my Kayak to the dock . The plastic hooks are very hard to open and close . I cut them off and attached carabiners in their place . Now it works great ! PROS : Length is enoughColor interestingLine floats yet is strongPrice goodCON : Hooks hard to use	1
This works exactly as it should ... definitely would buy another if I needed another . Thanks for making a quality product .	1
I use these for a slightly different purpose . They work very well as a kayak leash . I clip one of them on to the front handle and I can pull my kayak up river when it gets too shallow to paddle , before getting back in on the other side of the shoals . That way the kayak just follows behind and you do n't wear yourself out bending over to hold the handles . You also can stay more on the rocks while the boat glides around them . Sure , I could have made one out of a piece of rope , but two of them was cheap enough that it was n't worth it .	1
Good tie down for when you are at the dock putting the Sea Doo in the water . The clip is plastic , it is hard to un-clip . The rope is very flexible but can fray . I did break the plastic when I needed to use it as a tow rope pulling in a broken jet ski . Overall , it 's good for a quick tie to the dock when you need to go park the truck when your at the dock .	1
I do n't leave in my kayak with out it . great to secure what you carry so if you tip over you don ' t lose things and it is great for retrieving the kayak .	1
came quickly as expected , quality as expected also ! I live on the lake and this comes in handy when a friend brings over a boat or kayak	1
Had these for a year , they 're nylon so no wear and tear really . The clips are a bit hard to open , especially on the bow clip which is recessed in the hull a bit . One broke off and I replaced it with a metal clip which is a breeze to use compared to these clips . Overall , still a great purchase due to affordability and perfect size/length etc . for a seadoo/waverunner/jetski .	1
there great dock line for canoes small boat etc they work great and have never had one problem i recommend them	1
These are nice PWC dock lines or lines to just hang on to your Jetski ( PWC ) . I have not had any problem with the Hook breaking yet but if it does I have SS hooks that I will use . This is a decent inexpensive line for a Jetski ( PWC ) . I have a big 3 pass Seadoo and was easily able to attach the hook to the front bow eye . However , if you are worried about the hook breaking then probably best that you look for a dock line with a metal hook .	1
Like others have said , this is a good rope but the snap is hard to use . It works and is reliable , it 's just a bit hard to pry open . The rope is made of quality material and seems to be the best length for a multipurpose rope ( 7 feet ) .	1
It is a requirement that you carry certain items while boating . A whistle is one of them . You blow on the mouthpiece and it makes noise .	1
Very loud and carries a long way . In case of an emergency , my wife carries it with her in her purse . Did n't think a key chain would protect it from damage though .	1
I got this as a gift so I ca n't claim firsthand knowledge of its quality . But the person I gave it to said that she feels safer working a night shift with it clipped on her belt when she goes home . The whistle is loud and the clip allows the user to have it handy for possible emergencies .	1
I keep this whistle attached to my life vest just in case it 's ever needed . This is a must have safety item next to a pfd .	1
No ball inside to fail . I keep this in my hunting and survival pack , its works under all conditions and is quite loud .	1
A must have that I put on my life vest when kayaking . I like the long enough cord yet not too long incase I need to use it . Clips easily to the vest and a requirement in boats or kayaking .	1
In Maryland you are required to have a whistle on your life vest when kayaking . This was very easy to attach to life vest	1
I got one for my wife to use for emergencies . She works in nursing at a local hospital on the third shift and thought it would be a good alert single for her in the case of impending danger.I would recommend to others	1
Simple small and worked just fine . I liked it mainly because it had a clip and short cord which is perfect to clip on a life jacket .	1
Good price and very loud . Do n't recommend blowing it as loud as you can without hearing protection for the operator .	1
This Made in China whistle is loud , and floats . Not much more to add . As noted , the lanyard could be longer , but some paracord will fix that . The lanyard is crimped under the yellow float , so changing it out is probably too much trouble . We 'll see about durability .	1
This is a great lanyard ! I have two of them and I use them all the time.In Texas , like many states , you need a sound producing device on your vessel . This whistle works reliably even when wet and produces a very loud whistle sound.The lanyard is very durable too . Most jet skis have a plastic key that is required for the PWC to run and the key is pulled out to kill the engine when the rider falls off . I have my keys on this lanyard and it has held up to being pulled a number of times . The clip has never broken but if it did the lanyard has a float ! The other lanyard I use on my kayak life jacket.I found the length of the lanyard ideal for the jet ski but I tend to loop it a few times when I kayak because its a little long for that and gets tangled up.To recap its durable , floats , and whistle works great .	1
The first thing I noticed when holding the item was that the clip was fairly bulgy.I plan to use this as an emergency accessory on my life jacket when I go kayaking.As is , it 's not feasible to just clip the whistle to your life jacket , the lanyard is just too short.I stood up and had the whistle between my lips and let the lanyard drop below my chin.It only reaches the & # 34 ; V & # 34 ; between my collar bone.So strapping this directly to your life jacket , as is , would n't be ideal if you need to use in in an emergency.I will probably have to add another 6-10 & # 34 ; leash extension if I plan to clip this to a life jacket and have it readily available for use in an emergency . I tried to be fair in my rating , the item is still absolutely great , just the lanyard length needs to be worked out . Thus minus one star .	1
I have had these jugs in my family for ages . They keep the water cold and have never leaked . And they last near forever if you care for them . Highly recommended	1
Coghlan 's Tri-Pod Grill and Lantern Hanger is very nice for use over a fire or for just placing a lantern . Good quality and nice design .	1
Great item for fishing at night . I have n't used it as a grill yet , but it GREAT as a lantern stand without the grill piece . Works so well this is the second on I ordered . If I catch enough fish , maybe I 'll try the grill .	1
I have yet to use this with a fire underneath , but I did set it up in my living room to get a feel for it and I am fully satisfied . I put some weight on it to see how it would hold up , and it did n't have any problem supporting a heavy cast iron griddle with 2 pots and a pan all stacked on top of each other , so I have no doubt that this will work great in a camp setting .	1
As above , it works . No moving parts , its basic , and it does what the picture says it does . Not bad .	1
I just got my camp stove toaster the other day . It easily folds down and opens up . I ca n't wait to use it this summer .	1
This worked great and did not take very long . Stay with it or it will burn.Coghlan 's 504D Camp Stove Toaster	1
This toaster comes collapsed in a flat position . The metal rods that hold the toast fold out easily and hold each other in an open position . This is a very simple device . It is easy to use and easy to clean . Obviously it must be allowed to cool again before handling/cleaning . Does n't really get dirty anyway . Takes up very little space . In a way , it could be used as a survival type item for cooking small pieces of meat/fish over an open flame , if you could balance it on something . The clips that hold the bread remind me of larger versions of the fold out clips that hold pots and pans on emergency/survival/camping stoves ( the tiny ones that are pocket sized that screw onto propane tanks ) . They are a different conformation , because they are holding something at an angle instead of a pot on a horizontal surface , but just throwing the idea out there , because this collapses into such a flat item that it would be easy to carry in a pack . It sits stable on flat surfaces , the product is well made , not bent or chintzy . It 's one of those why-not type buys , because it 's cheap and unless it 's really mishandled , it 'll hold up over time . The packaging is thin cardboard , so the box arrived a little bent , did n't care , but might have cared if it were a gift item .	1
It toasts bread fine . If it is like the rest of the toasters that I have used over the years the base will begin to rust soon and it will need to be replaced in a few years . I guess if they made it rust proof , they would have to charge a lot more for the unit .	1
These have been around forever for camping , and before that it 's how housewives made toast over woodburning stoves at the turn of the century.Works well . Fun nostalgia item too . Sure you could toast bread over a stick , but my grandmother would have recognized these in a flash even though I 'm sure she never went camping ( they roughed it 24/7 , they did n't need to rough it for recreation ) .I love Coghlan 's . Another classic item . It works , too .	1
This was just what I needed to make my old Coleman lantern burn like new . After installing the new generator I could n't believe the difference it made in how the lantern burned . It was as bright as when it was new .	1
I found an old Coleman 220E lantern at a yard sale . Did n't work right off the bat so I replaced the mantles and the generator and now I have a working lantern . Install is pretty simple . You might be able to get away by just cleaning it but I decided to go the easy route and just change it . I plan on using it for a while so might as well invest in a new one .	1
it fits ... ..it works ... ... .perfect ! they ask for way too many words for some of these reviews ... . four more words required ... ..	1
Mine included all the parts of the generator you would expect to be there . The tip cleaner , spring and cardboard tube . The picture shows a white packaging ; mine was green and genuine Coleman . Put it in my lantern and it fired right up .	1
With exception to a very small dent in the attaching point , The generator has functioned flawlessly for several hours as I made sure this new one didnt leak or cause problems.100 % satisfied with this purchase .	1
Amazon is the easiest place to find parts for my old Coleman lantern . My gramps bought this in the mid sixties when I was a little boy and it still works to this day . Probally will outlast me too .	1
I like these rods so much , I have purchased four of them . I 've caught everything from Bream , very large Catfish and Carp with these rods . They have held up with an eight pound fish on the other end . Great product , in my opinion .	1
I needed a rod I could put under my car seat to be ready for any opportunity . My work keeps me so busy that I can not just plan to go fishing . I need to be ready at a moment 's notice . It feels right . The reel fits tight . I now have a combo for those panfish and small bass .	1
I am a bit surprised . i did n't think it would be as good as it is but I needed a collapsible rod for easy travel in my kayak . So far it works great ! ! My only complaint is that it does not have lined eyes , just bare steel . Regardless I have really enjoyed it and caught quite a few fish .	1
Nice ultralight action for backpacking , I keep it in the car with a small tackle box , just in case . I would have liked it to be slightly shorter in the grip and total overall length	1
This is just what my backpack needed . Lightweight , strong , compact , and shiny new . Love it . I threw a South Bend Microlight spinner on it and it 's a good combo for under $ 25 .	1
I purchased this fishing rod for my nephew as a gift . He has not had a chance to use it yet . I am sure he will like it and because it is from a reputable company I am sure it is a good product .	1
I bought this for backpacking and added a nice Pflueger ( 6 oz ) reel to it . It 's a great combo at 8.5 ounces total and I took it out to the lake about 3 times now and have landed about 10 trout with it.I 'd recommend this for backpacking and possibly a 'just in case ' item in the trunk of your car .	1
I bought this rod as a combo 6 or so years ago . I have caught a ton of trout in streams , rivers and even on the lake with it . It is not my primary rod when fishing a lake , but I do use it as a backup . Also caught smallmouth and bluegill out of ponds and local private areas . I sometimes keep it in my vehicle and it works great for that.It fits perfectly in the backpack with a small tackle set , and that is what I got it for . Have caught lots of trout on this rod , up to 4lbs no problems . It finally broke off the tip when I lent it to my brother , but his 4 year old is pretty hard on things and he did n't break it fishing , just around camp somehow . Still works , but without the end segment it is even stiffer than before ( see my Cons below ) . I feel I have gotten my money 's worth 2 or 3 times over.There are two cons I find to this rod:1 : It is not as flexible as standard rods . Do n't expect it to bend like a 4 ' Ugly stick . It simply wo n't . That 's not to say it is not flexible enough , it is , but it 's not the same . Once you are used to it there is no problem.2 : If you pull the extensions out too tight , they are a real pain to get it collapsed again . Just do n't pull it out more than needed to keep the rod from sliding back and you are good to go.Because of these two things I give it 4 stars , but it 's not that I feel it is a bad product , I just reserve 5 stars for truly flawless gear.Pretty much you either use this as the cheap option , or bring a rod protector for your nicer setup when hiking .	1
When you pay $ 15 for a fishing pole , you ca n't expect to get the performance of more expensive rods . This rod is actually pretty decent for a tiny when packed rod . slap on your little reel and flip some lures out in the back country for smaller fish . Do n't expect it to work for your Alaska trip unless you really know how to fight a fish and use light drag ( no not cross dressing ) . This is a great little packable rod .	1
I was going on a 3-day , ~30 mile hike that passed along some great trout streams . My fly fishing gear and spinning rods were too bulky to pack so I set out looking for a cheap alternative to get me through the weekend . I paired this rod with a small shimano reel and a small tackle box of trout magnets and flies . The rod collapses to about 1 ' in length and fit nicely in the outside pocket of my pack . As other reviewers said , be careful to not over extend the rod when taking it out . It can be difficult to collapse otherwise . The durability was great , it took some abuse on the trip from taking off my pack and forgetting it was in the front pocket . I was only catching trout 8-12 & # 34 ; with 3lb test so I did n't really max anything out.I considered a ton of different options for hiking rods , but for $ 11 you ca n't beat it . Remember , it does NOT come with a reel so you 'll want to pair it with something reasonable . Otherwise , great affordable option !	1
What can I say- have never been one to desire expensive saltwater rods- have owned and used hard many Shakespeare Ugly Sticks over the past 25 years- we use them fishing striped bass and blues off Cape Cod ... six of these rods- most this light weight model , sit in the Whaler on the mooring from late May to mid Septemer ... .most rods would corrode or fall apart , but the Ugly sticks take a lickin and keep on Tickin ... ..I have had these rods bent over from top to bottom on a 20 lb Striper on a light rod with no problems ... ..many rods just break ... .the only issues I ever have are a few knocked out or broken line guide insert- ( aluminum oxide ? ? ) ... I just replace them and move on ... ..I still keep some of these old rods , 20+ years old , and use them for the grandkids and folks new to fishing who seem to hit the center console when casting etc ... .Ca n't say enough good on these rods ... they are my best example of value in a world where the name is disappearing	1
I mistakenly left my fishing rod and reel at a campsite in Colorado . Since I live more than 1,000 miles away I asked the campground keepers to donate the equipment to a local youth group , and I proceeded to look for another rod and reel.This time I came up with the Shakespeare UGLY STICK , 7 ' medium . I paired it with a Pflueger President XT Spinning Reel and found them to be a great match.I am no `` expert '' so I really can not comment much on the differences ( if there are any ) in the `` pro '' rods as compared to the `` economy '' sticks . I easily rate this rod 5 stars because it does all I expect from it , and then breaks down into two pieces for transportation and storage . I could n't be happier , and it did n't cost me an arm and a leg , either .	1
This rod is stout enough to handle bigger fish , yet has a fast enough rod tip for sensitivity and for some great action even when playing 1 # panfish .	1
the medium action spinning fishing rods from ugly stick should not cost you more than 29.99.I believe they are the most sold line of rods in history . The 7 ft rod is an excellent rod for trolling , drifting , float fishing or bank fishing on the bottom for cat fish , carp , drum whatever . for constantly casting lures or other kinds of bait , stick with the 6-7 ft ugly stick lite models . there are many different models in Shakespear 's ugly stick line and I own several.I even have ugly stick rods that are not made any more . I own St croix , G loomis and other high end rods as well because the graphite rods are more sensitive and have a different action than fiberglass also much more expensive . I have caught hundreds of fish on my med action ugly sticks and have had it for over 20 years.I am not biased when it comes to rods so to me fiberglass rods are the way to go sometimes.I just want a rod to have a certain action and feel and I try to find a rod that comes closest to that regardless of the brand . I am much more particular when it comes to reels because that is the actual machine part of fishing . I have bought many brands but I now only stick to 1 when it comes to spinning reels . On the great lakes whether fishing for trout , salmon , walleye or whatever a majority of the charters use ugly stick rods for trolling . If you are going to use ugly stick rods for throwing lures the draw back is weight.You can not feel it when you are holding it , but after an hour or 2 you will compared to graphite rods.I believe there is a warranty on these rods but I have never had to return 1 .	1
I 've searched high and low for the best deal and Amazon has the best price compared to all the big box stores . Onto the review . The ugly stik is very sensitive and has lots of flex -- which i like compared to other brands that i 've previously purchased . Other than that it 's a great rod .	1
I like the 6 ' version but I think their longer models are really too heavy for most freshwater fishing , especially if you are casting lures . The rods are great for fishing from a rod holder as the flexible action allows fish to swallow the bait before they feel enough resistance to cause them to drop the bait . It depends on what type of fishing you use them for whether the weight matters . Durability and the ability to handle that unexpected large fish that takes your bait is good . If you are hard on equipment , Ugly Stiks are hard to beat . They will stand up to abuse that will trash fragile graphite rods . Graphite rods are strong on a fish and are light weight but they are fragile when it comes to banging them on rocks or against boat edges . Ugly Stiks can take that kind of rough or clumsy handling better . Good rods .	1
Have six of the Ugly Sticks . They about the best rod you cam buy for the money . Have a couple over 15 years old . Although the finish is about gone on them they still get the fish in the boat . The tip is a tad soft for long distance casting but they work just fine for most situations.. They are sensitive with a good backbone and hold up to abuse . Do n't care much for the reel holders on the newer rods . But , have n't lost a reel yet.Would recommend if you want a decent rod for little money .	1
This Baker fish mouth spreader fishing tool seems to be well made and will work nicely for the purpose I will be using it for .	1
Absolutely brilliant addition to a wide mouth stainless steel water bottle . Boil water without a stove easily and effortlessly . Highly recommended !	1
I bought the Baker Fish Mouth Spreader not to spread fish mouths but to use as a bail for my Guyot Design stainless steel water bottles . I use it to hang the bottles over the fire to boil water for cooking and sterilize for drinking . It 's not what it is intended for but it beats trying to engineer a bail . I recommend buying the product !	1
The 6 '' size is perfect for hanging typical steel water bottles over a fire . I 've used it successfully with both the Guyot and Klean Kanteen bottles.However , this exact item costs $ 1.99 at Cabelas ( IK-020936 ) . Not sure why the price is more than double here on Amazon .	1
Use this with my 40oz kleen kanteen to remove it from the fire . Works great as expected . Could also use it to hang it over a fire securely .	1
Nice line for fishing . Ordered for me and my sons tackle boxes . Ca n't wait to get out on the water !	1
This is a quality fishing line . I use it as tippet for my fly line and wind in on smaller spools for my lanyard . No need to buy expensice tippet .	1
I imagine this would be a very good fishing line . However , I did n't use it for fishing ... I used it to string heavy beads on . So , I feel confident in saying that it did n't break or stretch out of shape under those conditions .	1
You really ca n't go wrong with this brand . It is good line for a fair price . I have used several colors and sizes and have gotten a consistent product .	1
Caught many , many trout on this line . Went lake fishing with family and we were the only ones catching fish . We limited out quickly , We were bank fishing and there were boats surrounding us trying to get to our spot ; however , they still were not catching anything . I am 100 % that it was the 2lb leader we were using -- - INVISIBLE !	1
I use this as tippet material when fly fishing for bass and bream . It 's strong , does n't stretch a lot , and so far has proven to be pretty resistent to abraison from rubbing on rocks or limbs . It 's tough to break , even when I 'm trying . Bass and bluegill are not really line-shy , but on clear days in clear water , I like to be as covert as possible with my presentations , so this line works great for that . I also use Berkley XT in 6lb. , in the green color for stained water .	1
I got turned onto this line 5-6 years ago by one of my fly fishing buddies . He had been using the 4 lb . line as tippet material . I was using monofilament and was experiencing numerous snap-offs and and know failures to large trout . I bought my first spool of the Vanish line and witnessed my catch rates double , if not triple . Snap-offs and knot failures became nearly non-existent , and the number of takes I received increased dramatically due to this line 's underwater invisibility . It is more durable and lasts longer than any mono I 've previously used . I 've since taken to spooling all of my ice fishing rods with 4 lb . and 6 lb . Vanish . Fish can drag this line all over the holes edges without damaging it . Knot strength is ridiculous . I have n't had any problems with excessive memory and coiling , possibly because I 'm using the lighter test . It costs more than average mono but the benefits are worth it , IMO . I 'll never use mono again !	1
I am using this as leader material so far but I am tempted to use it on a reel and test the effectiveness on my next fishing trip .	1
Tied a bunch of different rigs with the line and it worked out great . Good product and never had a problem tying with the line .	1
Now I 'm just a beginner when it comes to doing stuff like spooling a reel . For the most part I think I did it right but there was one part during my spooling process where it seemed to start twisting on me . I flipped the line around and it seemed to start going on fine again . I went out and fished with my new line and only twice it happened , but my line got all twisted up tangled . Was n't bad , I just used my finger and put tension on the line and reeled it back up . Have n't had it happen since.I 'm sure I 'm just a noob at this stuff so I guess I just wanted to tell you my story . Other than that I am pleased with this product .	1
This clear line is very strong ( 60lb ) and winds without issue on to my reel . This heavy line is also useful for gardening and household applications where twine would be unsightly.Overall , this is very good line that easily fills my needs.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
I used this line on four salmon trips in September out of Westport , Wa . The charter skippers were great at finding salmon , and when I hooked fish , this line just did its job and never gave me a concern . I used the 20 lb . clear line . It easily handled the 8-12 lb . Coho we were lucky to find and catch . It 's rather nicely limp and smooth in the reel , and it cooperates when you tie knots . If you need monofilament , this is a good choice .	1
Put it on most of my reels . I like the way it performs . I have n't lost a fish as yet .	1
Good and reliable product . For the price , the product is great.I used it with a telescopic rod and it worked perfectly .	1
Good price and not bad easy beginner role of tring ... basic pound line for basic fishing works great and pretty strong and sturdy.. I fish a lot and I usually renew my string on my reels once a year and this what I use . all summer and spring	1
Trilene is a nice , hard nylon line that knots easily . It is rated well under its actual breaking strength , so long as you tie good knots .	1
Berkeley is on top of the game with this line the $ $ $ factor plus a very good line can not go wrong	1
I use Big Game on all my catfish poles for years and hands down its the best , the solar collector shows up great under my blacklight ! ! ! One note on this purchase , the title says custom spool but its the same spool you 'll get at the box stores .	1
I 've been using Berkley line for as long as I can remember . Its always held up well and the knots stay tied . Of course with large line like this Big Game version you 'll need to use a wire leader . Do n't blame the line if you do n't . As with all fishing line you 'll need to change it out once in a while , depending on how often you fish . It 's also a good idea to give it a good rinse with fresh water after each use . The green tint on this version is great for the Gulf of Mexico , making it totally invisible.Highly recommended .	1
I purchased this for my survival bag . You can fish with it and you can use it for basic cordage . Win Win	1
Has been using this mono line for about a year now . It does have some memory but cleaning with warm water after saltwater use improves the memory.I recently used this line to lift up my 30lb dumbbell at home to test the true lifting powers of this 30lb test line . It held up my 30lb dumbbell for length until I got tired of holing it up .	1
I love this stuff . It 's inexpensive and works great . It is one of the best deals you can get on monofilament line . Never have found anything wrong with the line ( nicks , etc ) . have switched all of my poles to this stuff exclusively , Using the 8 lb on my general fishing poles and the 12 lb in the darker green for my steelhead trolling pole . Would , and have , suggested this line to anyone who asks my opinion on what line to get .	1
Cheaper than at Wally World . Came to the door step . I bought the solar collector color . It 's a neon green , but almost disappears in the sunlight . I will purchase this item again ( maybe a different color ) when it 's time .	1
Big Game works well , has good knot strength , has low memory , behaves well during casts on baitcasting and spinning reels , has good abrasion resistence , and is very affordable . I have used 10 to 15 lb Big Game for freshwater school size striped bass and saltwater calico bass with no problems . I have also used 20 to 60 lb Big Game for multi-day Baja trips for tuna and yellowtail also with no problems . When you go on multi-day baja trips you end up spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on the trip , fish cleaning , tips , etc . Using Big Game line is a good way to get good quality line at an affordable price . There are lines out there that might be better and cost way more but also might have too much memory ( too stiff ) or perform strangely during casts ( i.e , Maxima , Izorline ) . Big Game is user friendly , likely wont let you down , and wont break the bank .	1
spooled up with this big game line and fished the jetties this summer with no problems , cast well and is very strong	1
I 'm only sparring 2-3 times a week but these leave my gloves with a nice wood chip smell and dry 'em out pretty well . They go all the way down the glove , not to the finger section though . And the glove dogs are also connected together kind of like a lanyard with hooks . So you can disconnect them from each other to keep them separate or leave them attached and hang your gloves up.A side note would be that you could probably make some homemade 'glove dogs ' simply by putting dried wood chips of your choosing into a pair of socks , tying the ends off , and putting those in your gloves . Although I have n't tried it personally I imagine it would work just as well.So yes it is a decent product but you could probably DIY if you wanted to .	1
Anyone that owns a pair of boxing gloves know that these are a necessity . If not , you 'll have stinky ass gloves within a couple of months , forcing you to buy new gloves OR be labled as the person with the stinky ass gloves .	1
Fits my XL hands and fingers just right . No problems here . I usually have problems with these type of things being too small for my hands .	1
The fit is perfect and I certainly can not wait to practice with it . I could not believe ethe great fit .	1
It 's nice , just a plain black archery glove . It will work well for my daughter , whom I bought this for.The only thing I wish is that they would put a sizing chart to these , because it 's kind of hard to tell when you ca n't try them on , because not all sizes are created equal .	1
I 'm new to archery and this product has vastly expanded the number of shots I can take . Prior to this my fingers would be raw and sore for a day or two after shooting . Now I can shoot daily . The package was shipped timely and well packaged .	1
She 's 10 yes old and she 's says fits great feels good works well . If they sucked she would have told me . So she 's says five stars ,	1
You know ... . I 'm not going to battle with the Knights of the Round Table , but being out there in the deep woods with Coyote , Bear , Fox , Mountain Lions , wild dogs , etc . etc . etc . ... ... .. I just feel better having TEN bolts with broadheads on them . : & # 62 ; ) THIS is the first hip quiver I have ever bought . It is designed well and the leg strap is a definite plus that I would not have thought about . I have put all carbon bolts in it with three blade broadheads and believe it is going to work really great . It stays out of the way when walking and I think it stays close enough to the body that it will not get hung up on a lot of stuff .	1
The arrows could have been put closer together to make a more compact quiver , but this thing is sturdy and holds arrows in better than any quiver I 've owned . I ca n't complain because it works so damn good . Buy it .	1
I have another hip quiver , and from the picture I thought this one would be identical to it . It is not . This one is larger and heavier . The clasp that secures the quiver to your belt has the rotating part on the inside next to your hip instead of on the outside where it would be out of the way . The quiver does appear to be well made and should last for many years.Update : My original review was only three stars ... however . I purchased this quiver to be used with crossbow bolts and after using it for awhile I have changed my rating from three stars to five . It is not only well made but the spacing and the rubber material used in making the bolt ( arrow ) keeper is superior to my other hip quiver . I used both hip quivers on a recent hunting trip and it performed very well ; so well in fact that i felt a need to update this review .	1
I love this hip quiver it does hold 6 bolts broad heads perfectly ; They 're easy to pull out , do n't make a lot of noise when you pull them out of the quiver . Nice and stealthy	1
I was having problems with old rest and the arrows kept popping off , this holds a lot better . Plus comes with silencer pads for the rest . But likes others said , takes a bit of tweaking .	1
It took some serious attention to tune this in just right but mounted it on my old York CNC-1 and absolutely love it . Some shooters do n't think they 're consistent enough for competitions and I beg to differ . At 40 yds , I can shoot a consistent sub 2 & # 34 ; group and usually win against guys with newer bows and all the fancy gadgetry they add to them . I very highly recommend this rest , in 9 months of hevy use it has yet to let me down .	1
This is a good solid product . The instructions are terrible so it takes longer to get it set how it should be but thats okay . Not top of the line but will do the job .	1
these things fly straight ! Thumped a doe at 40 yards . A 5-pack with field pionts for under $ 34.00 is a good deal , planning on buying several more packs , they hit like a bullet with 125 grain barnett mech . broadheads .	1
I absolutely LOVE these bolts . They fly straight and are very durable . I have bought these bolts more then once and i will KEEP buying them . Simply an amazing product .	1
Very happy with the group of 5 that I purchased . Just saving up to keep buying more . Takes a while , the things are crazy expensive but they are everywhere . Very happy with the purchase .	1
Awesome arrows from Barnett . Great price here on Amazon for them other places seller the 5 packs for much more . Great deal , great arrows ! These are made by Barnett , so they are half moon not flats . Already took two deer this year so far with these arrows .	1
I bought these when I bought my Barnett Wildcat crossbow . These are the exact same arrows that came with the crossbow . They have been shot hundreds of times and are holding up great . The points are staying on and they continue to fly straight . My son has a compound bow with a different brand of arrow and his tip insert keeps coming off of his arrows . These have been very durable .	1
These shoot well & I 'll buy more.My only question is , WHY do all the manufacturers make the shafts dark colors ? I 'd like hot pink b/c there 's nothing on the ground or in the woods that color.Seems to me if they were bright , they 'd be easier to find - or maybe the makers do n't want that !	1
I am very pleased with their flight out of the bow . They are very consistent out to 40 yards . I did not shoot th at a longer distance .	1
These were bought for my son and his new crossbow . They fly straight and he is happy and would purchase again .	1
Well these things are tough ! Hard to find in tall grass when you miss the target ! ( zeroing in the scope honestly ) These have been shot into my barn , the door , the fence , 2x4 's , the dirt , the swing set ... .after some work on getting some of them out , they still work like a charm and no damage ! !	1
They are very durable , even when ive have to pry them out of wood . Ive only broke one on a rock ( the tip came out , shaft was fine )	1
Do n't try shooting them over 70 yards when it 's windy or on concrete : ) I got these to replace my previous set after I went target practice on a windy day and decided to try them out to 70 yards . They were flying around like crazy after 60 yards . Up to 60 yards I can shoot bullseye all the time . When they hit the concrete base of the target they disintegrated like chopsticks . These have two layers of carbon fiber but also a few layers of fiberglass internally ... Overall they work fine for me but know their limitations . The fact I bought a second set means a lot .	1
This is the best deal , if you buy the bulk pack of 48 it cost you more . The bulk pack does n't come with any kind of tip costing a minimum of 50.00 bucks more to get field points plus you get two additional arrows when you by 10 5 packs . They balance out perfect with the 100 grain field points at 14 percent . Barnett recommends the X Blades 125 grain expanding broadheads . The combinations listed work just as they were designed to .	1
DANGEROUSLY FAST AND TRUE TO THE TARGET . STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW AND HAZARDOUS TO WILD GAME . WILL GET THE JOB DONE .	1
These shoot straight and true.I had good groupings at 20,30,40 , yards.I replaced the aluminum junk that came with the bow with these and i 'm pleased with the groupings .	1
I like these bolts ... they 're carbon fiber and match the ones that came with my crossbow ... I think I 'd have preferred more weight ( higher GPI ) , so I 'll probably look for some & # 34 ; pile driver & # 34 ; s for my crossbow ... but for now these work good .	1
I 'm not an archer but I use them on my cross bow ... They work great ! ! ! ! Just remember they will break if they hit concrete ... LOL	1
I purchased them for my crossbow . They seem very solid and flew well with the field points that came with them and the broadheads that I used too .	1
Definitely not a high-quality bold but good for the price . Some of the fletching was unevenly spaced which made for inconsistent grouping . Good for practice though ... value for the money	1
Granddaughters had gotten new bows and they both wanted all the accessories too . Many extra arrow is always a plus . Do not then have to spend time retrieving arrows from target and more time shooting .	1
Excellent price for an excellent product ... ca n't ask for more than that ! Superb craftmanship in a product designed to endure a lot of abuse .	1
I am shooting these into a Yellow Jacket target at 30 yards distance with a Barnett Wildcat with a red-dot scope ( came with the crossbow ) firing at 350 fps . The only reason I need to buy more of these is that they fly so consistently true that I need to replace them periodically because of damage inflicted by hitting them with other arrows . Not bragging , just commenting on the quality of the arrows ! BTW , you can not buy Barnett 4-arrow quick-detachable quivers without 4 arrows with it as part of the package .	1
I 'm no crossbow bolt expert ( yet ) , but these seemed to fly straight every time and do the job as advertised .	1
Very pleasing to the eyes as well as the touch . Fly straight and accurately . I lked them so much I had to buy more because I shot the fletches off of three of my bolts because they shot such tight groups .	1
Im new to archery and crossbows but Carbon arrows and Barnett seem like a good marriage to me ... they shoot strait and I have to be careful with my Jackal to not split one by hitting the same spot ! The two give me great confidence , so when I line up a deer I will know the arrow is going to hit where I aim .	1
Glad I bought these ! ! ! Great bolts ! The Barnett Jackal makes these babies scream . Sighting in my scope I lost one , then hunting I lost two so I am glad I got them . I will be coming back for more .	1
I like to use these arrows . They are recommended by the manufacturer of my cross bow and I have had no issues with them . They always fly straight and far . For the price it is a fair deal .	1
I love my Barnett crossbow and their arrows are fantastic ! They shoot straight and I can use the same arrow over and over . I missed my target once and the arrow went into a tree . I was able to retrieve it and still use it ! I love Barnett products ! ! !	1
Bought these carbon bolts to replace the cheaper aluminum bolts that came with my crossbow . They work as expected and are a much better product for your money .	1
ALREADY OWNED SEEVRAL OF THESE . HAD SUCH GOOD LUCK WITH THEM , I REQUEST MORE FOR CHRISTMAS , AND GOT THEM ... I HAVE SHOT THESE BOLTS MANY TIMES , VERY STRAIGHT SHOOTING	1
These crossbow bolts are terrific . I use these with myBarnett Wildcat C5 Black Crossbow Package ( Quiver , 3 - 20-Inch Arrows and Premium Red Dot Sight ) . I 'm partial to Barnett products but these really are great . You get 5 carbon bolts for a great price . The absolute bonus is that you get 5 included field tips for the bolts . Most other crossbow bolts do not include any field tips . This makes these carbon bolts a steal ! ! The construction of these are second to none . Not that you would want/need to but you could fire these bolts repeatedly at tree trunks without damaging or warping them.If you are looking for crossbow bolts , I would not hesitate to pull the trigger on these . You will NOT be disappointed.Also , if you care , the color of the fletchings is not what is in the picture . The picture shows the fletchings to be green and black . The actual color is yellow and orange . Obviously , not a deal breaker but I would have liked the green and black more .	1
TEST FIRED WITHOUT POINT HEAD ON AT 10 YDS AND IT WENT THROUGH A WOODEN FENCE ABOUT 6 INCHES WITHOUT DAMAGING THE BOLT OR FINS.THE FIELD HEAD WAS STILL ABLE TO SCREW BACK IN AND THE THREADS WERE NOT STRIPPED . IF FIELD POINT WAS ATTACHED THE BOLT WOULD HAVE GONE COMPLETELY THROUGH FENCE . ( ALL 20 INCHES OF BOLT )	1
Just as described . fly straight as an arrow . sturdy construction ... do n't waste your money at bass pro . get these instead	1
These bolts are a great value for the price . They work great with my son 's Inferno Fury crossbow ( 175 # pull ) . Much better than the bolts that came with the crossbow . Would buy again and recommend to friends .	1
I have been practicing with these bolts for several months now and have had only one lose its fletchings and that was because it went through a wood fence . None of the shafts have splintered or broken and all of the nocks are still good . Only one thing but its not a negative ; the Amazon picture shows the bolts with green and black fletchings and all I have received had red and orange fletchings . I like the Red and orange better because they are easier to spot in tall grass . Excellent bolts . Do n't pay more .	1
Great product at a very good price . The store had these same arrows at almost twice as much . Highly recommended .	1
I do n't know about you , but this is something I do n't want to compromise on . These come safely boxed . They are very good quality , balanced and strait . I intend to pick up a few more boxes as I go along and I recommend this item especially for Barnett crossbows , one of the best out there at a price you can afford .	1
I have a Barnett Panzer V Crossbow , and it came with shorter bolts and they were junk . I bought these for the length and the stability . They last for as many shots as you want , as long as you do n't hit a tree or plywood or somthing as solid as concrete . They fly well , and out perform the regular bolts that come with the crossbow . I would recommend using Grim Reaper Mechanical Broadhead with these , as I have had really good results with the combo . Animals do n't stand a chance , and it wastes almost no meat if placed well . Happy hunting .	1
This product is ver good . you can get a good shootout of every Arroew . Easy to load and easy to get outof target .	1
This is the only bolts I will shoot out of my Barnett Crossbow . They 're strong , and survive multiple shots . I have used one particular bolt over and over for target shooting and it continues to hold up . I will buy these again .	1
They fly perfectly . I ruined one with my second shot by hitting knock ... almost a Robin Hood . I now shoot single arrows at individual markings on the target because they grouped so well I had difficulty removing them from the target .	1
Nicely priced original arrows for my Barnett crossbow . They all fly true with no strays . It was a nice surprise to get field points with the arrows , my last few arrow purchases have been without field points .	1
Great Jig , Easy Setup and used it for my 3 vane arrow setup . Be sure your buying the correct setup however this is for STRAIGHT vanes .	1
This will be used when I have a place to set it up to make arrows in my own place	1
Straight forward , simple to use for what it is designed to do . My hats off to Bohning ! If you are thinking of fletching your own arrows buy it .	1
This is my first fletching jig . Very simple to use and sturdy . I like the magnet that allows you to align with the arrow . and as you push forward onto the shaft , it makes contact at the correct angle . I like that as you turn the dial , it stops at the correct degree for the 3 fletching arrow . But , there is also a tool to change to a 4 fletching shaft . Really nice unit .	1
The dial turns for perfect 3 part fletching gluing . It also includes a 4 fletching ring for the jib.It takes just a little eye-estimate effort in lining up the magnetic clip to your arrow shafts , but once it 's set , get your glue , timer , and vanes because you are about to do all your arrows.the great thing is that if you want to do the offset or spiral vanes , you just need to buy the clip for & # 34 ; right & # 34 ; of & # 34 ; left & # 34 ; and use the same jig.There are mounting holes in the base , so you can hard mount it through some wood onto a bench or just do what I do , place it on the coffee table as I watch TV . I compared my redone vanes to a & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; shop . Yeah , mine were cleaner , straighter , and overall better installed . The shop has stupid amounts of glue and some vanes were n't straight , well , I fixed those.very good product for the budget .	1
Needed an inexpensive quiver , which was up to the job of carrying a dozen or more arrows . This does that easily and has room to carry maybe a dozen more depending on size and type of arrows , mine are carbon 's . Length is great , and it seems sturdy enough for target archery . Belt clip worked well , even when hiking through an outdoor range . For the price and function , it 's great , would buy again without hesitation .	1
Simple product that did n't dent my wallet and does a great job . It is fully round so there is no flat back to stop movement , but nonetheless it 's a good product	1
Funny they call this a right handed quiver . I am left handed and it works fine for me . I would n't take this hunting , but it a big help when I am practicing in the back yard . It is a good buy and worth the money it cost . This came in a few days and it was packed right . I am pleased with this quiver .	1
This works best from the side -- -going to get another to use as a back quiver . Good quality though , and reasonably priced .	1
This little quiver makes it easy to carry up to 24 bolts with field points on them and about 6 if you have broad heads.The belt clip is fine if you want to use it that way but I attached a strap to mine to carry it on my side over my shoulder and I also inserted a piece of styro foam all the way to the bottom to protect the quiver from the points and broad heads.Over all a great product..	1
Basically , I got what I paid for here . The uses of this device are limited as it basically has one sound - something near what you 'd hear from a pet 's squeeky toy .	1
So far so good , I get the critters attention , and I am still working on the effects . Best place for testing how critters react is at boat landing where lots of animals are present .	1
I was in my yard and i was using it to call a squieral and i had 3 of them in my yard in 10 minutes Iwould recomend this to any hunter or boy/girl scout	1
I have n't gotten a chance to use this yet , but it is very versatile and am excited to get it out next fall for squirrel season !	1
I have used this product for a number of years . No , I am not being paid by the Fitzgeralds . I can honestly tell you that both my wife and I have had deer walk right under our stands and because we sat still , the deer were not alarmed . About five years ago , I was on stand cleaning one of my nocks . all of a sudden , this buck and doe burst through this hedgerow . They saw me standing up , and decided to venture over to see what was going on . Keep in mind , the buck was on his way to breed the doe . As they stood under my stand , they were both panting like dogs . One deer attempted to play a game with me . Since my back was turned to them , I have no idea if it was the buck or doe . The deer faked running away . I did n't move . After a couple of frustrating minutes on `` their part , '' the deer left . If it had not been for the deer dander , I would have been busted on the spot . You can keep all of the other stuff , you need to by some deer dander for this season !	1
Well , I have n't had anything bad happen while using deer dander . I also have n't had any deer come down my trail and lick anything I sprayed it on . I managed to harvest a doe while using this stuff . I also spray it around my game cam and the ideal spot I would want the photo taken . I had a doe that was pretty interested in the smell and I got some good pics of her . I have n't seen any bucks on cam or while in the woods this year while using it , I also have n't seen any when I was n't using it . Only time will tell how effective this is . For now , it 's getting 4 stars due to how outrageous it is priced . If by some miracle the deer come down my trail and lick where I spray it or do something astonishing , I 'll rate it up to five stars.If you 're not sure if it 's right for you , try the scent free approach or go natural with your scent ( anything that comes from deer ) . That 's what the majority of the `` old timers '' recommend . Good Luck .	1
good product . have had several deer follow my scent paths right up to the tree . best product i have used so far . price is expensive but shipping was very quick . i had a very curious little spiker sniffing exactly where i sprayed for about 20 mins trying to figure out this smell ! countless other doe 's came in and sniffed around all most every day i have used this	1
The Hunters Specialties cover scent wafers are about as easy and effective as a cover scent system can get . They tend to last longer than many that I 've tried over the years and recharge simply by closing them back in their case . The added benefit of not having to spray down and mess with liquid cover scent finds favor with me . Highly effective and economical . Would recommend them to anyone .	1
Quality product . I have been using this product for years , works perfectly.If you can satisfy a customer as fussy as I am , you have it made in the shade.I recommended it highly.AnthonyBurlington , MA	1
I have had deer within ten feet of me playing and never winded me . These have a very strong smell and last a rediculously long time . People around you will smell the fresh dirt smell . I wo n't go deer hunting without clipping one or two on ever again .	1
I always use these as a cover scent and also keep them in my hunting clothes storage containers and bags . I love the way they smell .	1
I use these in the storage bins with my hunting clothes . I also wear one when I am in the blind or stand . Earth scent is strong and really permeates the clothing . Does a nice job of covering up your scent .	1
I have used these on several outings this archery season , 3 from a tree stand and one in a ground blind . The wafers do a good job of covering my scent . The two deer that I shot did not even know I was there ... I will continue to use this product on future hunts .	1
I have been using these for years , I put them on my clothing and in my bag that I keep my hunting clothes in , they always smell like dirt ! ! ! ! ! ! You will not be dissappointed ! ! !	1
I have been using this for years and works well , good price is I picked up a few extras . Good cover scent	1
Great colors and easily applied . Have n't tried it out officially out in the woods but I can gaurantee it 'll do just fine .	1
I used this product while in the Army . It gets the job done , easy to clean off . Soap , rag , and Facial cleanser to really get the deep stuff off .	1
My little girl love playing with this and putting it on when we go hunting . BE WARNED it is very hard to remove .	1
Good stuff , a lil hard to wash off though but other then that it does what it is supposed too	1
Good stuff . Goes on easy , comes off easier . Many camo options available with the colors given . Going to pick up a couple more .	1
I like to be organized and this bat serves the purpose of keeping our baseball dugout clean and orderly . Easy to manage and clip to the fence ... ..the only complaint that I have is we have to stick the hand side down unlike what the picture shows . The barrells of our bats are to big to fit in like the picture shows . Its not a big deal because it allows the boys better see which bat to get . It does make the bag top heavy ... .meaning the bats kinda lean out of the pocket a bit . Overall a good product for the price , and keeps our bats organized .	1
Perfect for little league bats , but I have it on my garage wall and its not easy to put in the BBCOR bats .	1
I got two more of these and wish I had gotten three . it is good for the price and even holds 2 5/8 barrels	1
I coach Little League . There is no way I am spending $ 50 for a bat rack . The prices of bat racks are rediculous ! This bat rack is super nice and has a great price . Easy inspection for umpires to check bats before game start , all right there , and every kid has a stall for their bat . I borrowed an easton bat rack from the league last year because I didnt have my own . This is just as nice as the easton , infact almost exactly the same but doesnt have the labels ... .both double as a bat carrier when not hanging on the fence . I reccomend buy this and not the over priced bat racks . I am stoked about this purchase .	1
they work on limbs in a tree that you can not reach . it works great with 2 people better than one	1
Needed to top a tree about 30 feet up and about seven inches in diameter at the cut . Worked a little rough , but it worked . Could n't reach it any other way , even with a ladder and a pole saw . Glad I had this option .	1
I purchased this to cut down a limb I could not reach with the extension ladder . I had my doubts about how well the rope saw would work . However , once we go a steady and synchronized pulling action going , the saw cut right through the 6 inch diameter limb . I was very satisfied with the performance .	1
Our yard is filled with trees including many oaks . Living in Florida with a lot of hurricanes as well as almost daily afternoon thunderstorms means a constant onslaught of branches etc..of course , tree trimmers are not only expensive but it 's a hassle to verify they are `` legit '' and have insurance in place to reduce the potential for a major lawsuit when they are working on the property . We needed several low hanging branches plus several not so low - and rather larger ( 8 inch diameter ) - branches taken down for a quote of about $ 300 . Purchased this and used for first time this morning . The branches are down and saved about 90 percent off the cost and hassle of hiring a tree trimmer ... a bargain considering this is the first use . It 's taken about 4 hours but the first hour was the worst because we got it kinked like others mentioned . Once you figure it out - this works like a charm . The ring broke - it 's cheap and will need to be replaced - plus the ropes start getting to the hands after awhile - but all in all this was a superb deal . Also was able to take down several precarious branches that could not use a chainsaw with without severla man crew because of the branc going near vertical . Used this instead and was able to stand far out of the way while bringing down a sizeable branch.Money saving item - wish they put a bit more into the quality of the rope and accessories but is still a great buy ! PS - Despite giving this a four star rating , I 've actually purchased a second unit to use at a weekend cabin where we occassionally need to take care of a few odd limbs etc ... just wish they would put a bit more quality into the product . Still worth every penny ,	1
Most Complaints about this saw are from binding on the tree limb . I had that problem and oiled it before trying the next limb and it worked much better . If you buy it treat it like a chain saw , keep the chain oiled and it will likely help avoid a lot of the binding issues , though not all . The second aspect of this saw is to practice on low lying limbs which you can reach , before throwing it at the high ones . This will allow you to get a feel for the saw and learn the tricks of laying out the line , throwing the bag , attaching the handles , and actually sawing a limb while being safe about it . This sounds silly , but the chain tends to loop over itself and once it is swung over a limb it 's too late to fix that and you have to start over . Or taking off the bag and watching the line fly into the air..and you have to start over . Or learning how to twist the line to position the saw . Or learning the best angle to saw at . This tool takes some practice and a bit of skill . Do a few smaller limbs , watch them crash down , and you immediately have a better understanding of how you can kill yourself if you are not careful ! The saw seems to work best on smooth barked trees . Rough bark tends to bind in the early stages and that maybe what a lot of people have a problem with . I found smaller limbs easier to handle.This is a sub- $ 40 tool . You get what you pay for . The ropes are plastic and will do the job , but they showed wear after a few cuts . The chain is ok , but not as good a quality as a regular chain saw for a power model . The clip that holds the bag on is second rate . As another reviewer said , once you see the tool you find you could do the same thing for less money . Well ... . perhaps.I made a half dozen cuts and the tool saved me a few hundred bucks from the local Kine guys like `` cut da coconuts and climb the mango for trim . '' Plus I did n't have to worry about some yoyo dropping a tree on my garage . ( I could do that myself . ) If it never cuts anything again it has paid for itself many times over.So if you care for the chain , go slow , practice on lower limbs , develop some skill and knowledge of how to safely use this tool , and then cut even a few high limbs you will have saved money if not time . Do n't expect wonders from a $ 40 investment . But prudent use could easily save you 10 times your cost . Aloha .	1
Smile ? Yes , I bought this out of desperation but it works so well , and so easy that three of us working with it the first time all started smiling . I know none of us thought it would really work . Requires two people , but is fast and easy.The downside , some of the limbs we were trying to trim were about 30 ' up . It took a lot to finally get the weight bag over a limb . It 's harder than you might think . Then there 's the problem of getting the chain right side up . There 's a weight on the chain that 's supposed to make that automatic , but you 'll either have to be patient and try several times to get it right or add some weight to the bar.A large limb may work best with two cuts , but the chain does most of the work.Amazing and safer than climbing a tree . Very happy with this .	1
I use this on natural steel finishes , so I do not worry about if it will ruin finishes . Works well for my purposes .	1
does a very good job on everthing ive used it on so far , polishes well by hand , u need polish this stuff works	1
Excellent product to have around the house for polishing metal surfaces and other stuff . No toxic smell ! And even though I use gloves when I work with Flitz , it 's easy on the hands too ... .excellent on stainless steel !	1
This stuff is great for polishing up gun parts . So far I have use this to do custom trigger jobs on my own guns and also to clean the plastic covers on my headlights . That foggy hazing on my headlights is gone now .	1
I have also polished barrels and feed ramps . This does a great job , either applied by hand , or with a felt wheel on a Dremel .	1
ive been using flitz for many years now and i swear by it ! seriously dont think there is anything this stuff cant fix	1
No complaints . 5 stars for it works as described . I 've used it on modern stainless pistols but not blue . IMO , use this twice a year on firearms you use regularly and once a year for those safe queens .	1
Delivered on time as promised and I intend to get a lot of use out of the kit year after year .	1
This little kit saved me over 100 dollars for the first use ! some of the peices drip from when I filled it up with antifreeze but not bad enough to keep me from doing the job	1
not much else to say other than it floats well and is easily spotted . I use it for my anchor line on the kayak .	1
Kwik-Tek F-5R Float This stuff is very nice in the quality , color , and the price , recommend it to anybody who need it .	1
There is never a question where my anchor is underwater , no one will stub their toe or cut their foot ! My boat neighbors were envious so I got them all one , different colors of course : )	1
What can I say about a large float . It floats and it boobs . We use it on our anchor rope assembly on our motorized kayaks . It keeps our rope where we can see it .	1
This may be a small item but it sure is loud . The first time i used it i nearly blew my eardrums off . Since then I use ear protection and its still pretty loud . WOuld be great in any situation , i use it to pacify my neighbours dogs into quieting down when they bark incessantly for three or four hours from 1AM to 5AM .	1
Good Lawd -- - this is one LOUD horn ! Did n't have to use it for safety purposes : we took it camping and tried it out to be sure it worked.LOL , it worksDid I mention its loud ?	1
Very loud . Hurts your ears . I bought it to use if my dogs start looking like they are going to get in a fight and they stop immediately when I set it off .	1
It 's very loud . It has a higher tone than I expected . It only lasts about 5 seconds . I carry one for emergencies only . It can be used to get the attention of a kayak partner , etc.. It might also be used to distract a criminal . Pointed directly at someone at 10 feet or less , it can cause ear pain . I recommend buying a couple of refills .	1
I take this horn with me on hikes in the mountains known to have black bears and luckily I have not had to use this horn yet but I tried it at home and it is indeed very loud and I think that it will scare a bear away . Wish me luck ...	1
I bought this air horn for my survival kit . It is very loud , and efficient . But do n't let looks deceive you . This horn is very small . It also is very dangerous . Do not bring it around kids . It will cause hearing damage . When you sound the horn , make sure you hold it away from your face . If you hold it too close , it will hurt your ears . Also , do not hold it sideways or upside-down . Otherwise the juice that powers the horn will squirt out . Besides the safety issues I am pleased . Bottom line : If you can handle the proper safety measures and need this Item , buy it .	1
Wow , very loud and easy to use . Maybe too easy , as the button depresses very easily . Be careful of accidental discharge . Better than not working , eh ? It 's great for us , as we 've had near misses with loose dogs pretty often .	1
This is a super loud horn . I bought it to keep in my small boat . I need to tell you , though , that it is very small.This is only about five inches tall , including the horn . The can itself is only three inches tall and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter . The horn protrudes about 2 1/2 inches out . It easily fits in my tackle box , and I am considering buying a couple more of these for safety . I read recently that the one thing that scares a criminal away fastest is a loud horn . If you found yourself in a home invasion situation , or walked in on a burglar , even if you had a silent alarm system , it is going to take the police several minutes to get to you , and a lot can happen in those minutes . This is small enough to carry in a purse , or a pocket , or just to keep handy somewhere in your house . I can guarantee you that this horn will turn heads a lot faster than a whistle ! ! Whether you carry a weapon or not , you can use this to call attention to yourself and whomever is trying to commit a crime against you . It will be a shock to an assailant 's ears , and he might just decide you 're not worth messing with ! ! It 's also small enough to carry when hiking or camping . It is very light weight , and you could also use it as a backup horn for a larger boat that is already equipped with an electric horn . I can think of dozens of uses for this , so it will be money well spent , no matter what ! !	1
This is a great tool for boaters , or hikers ( if your lost in the woods ; scare away bears ) . Simply amazing blast of sound from this little can . Ladies ... carry it your purse scare away muggers . It 's an emergency tool for me ... regarding health issues . In the middle of the night , if you need help ... .just sound this little guy.Great value , well packed ... on time delivery !	1
This was purchased for use by the night watchman for the condominium where I live . We wanted something small enough to be carried around easily , but loud enough to wake us up in the event of fire or other emergency when going door to door is obviously not practical . This horn met both requirements.We have not needed it for an emergency yet , and hopefully never will , but we feel a little more secure because we now have emergency warning capability .	1
The boating laws here in Florida require you to have a horn on/in your boat when fishing or boating in saltwater . I bought this sound horn and keep it in a storage compartment on my boat . Great little horn .	1
Also every one should have one of these on their boats . You should check with your state laws and see if you are suppose to have one of these on board in your state . I know some states it is a law . Price , Amazon and Prime made this horn perfect . It is also VERY VERY VERY loud ! ! !	1
Must hold upright or you 'll get a farty air sound . I tie wrapped a belt clip for handy/quick access . The 1.5 oz is small enough it does n't get in the way clipped to the belt/pant/short . Used while boating , for road cycling to let cars know I 'm coming . I pedal on avg 19-23 MPH so peeps in cars do not expect a cyclist to come on to them that quickly ... DOES let them know to look ! Goes with me hiking too .	1
I got this horn for home protection , as I read where a guy interviewed several career burglars in prison and the thing that would drive them out of a house faster than an alarm or barking dog was a loud air horn . Think of it as a poor man 's portable active denial system . I was skeptical at first , but when I sounded this horn , I was convinced it would work . It is supper loud and completely annoying . For sure I am prepared to defend my home with more lethal force , but I wanted some non-lethal options as well . For those that are not comfortable with firearms in the house , this is a great alternative .	1
Small aerosol can , fits in your hand but it is LOUD ! Threading diameter looks like horn might fit on a regular sized freon type can also.Great attention getter , good for boating , camping , emergencies , travel ... Waking up teenagers ! ! haaa	1
I bought this for my sister that walks our dog late at night sometimes and the horn is very loud as I had her to test it . It does what it claims to do and the service was very fast delivery . I like that you can buy refills for the horn as I will making a purchase again from this seller A+ . Great price , fast delivery , and exceeds my expectations . Be sure to cover you own ears too .	1
As soon as I got it , I tested it out in the house and it was so loud , I felt bad for scaring my kids and hurting their ears . Only use outside . : )	1
All I can say is ... WOWSER ! Bought it as a potential bear deterrent ( along with some bear spray ) , but find it 's great sneaking up on the wife and blasting it behind her . Let me tell you ... this thing scares me , and I 'm the one knowing when the button is getting pushed ! Get this for your next practical joke war ... and make sure you have your ear plugs in !	1
Easy to install , fairly sturdy , and affordable . Took about 20 minutes to install both sides . I always worry when guiding my boat in that one of the posts will snap off . But so far , they have not . For the price , quality is good .	1
I purchased 303 because it was recommended for sun protection on the cordura seat covers I purchased for my truck . I had no idea that this would be used for so many purposes . I only ordered one bottle but will pick-up more . Brought a like new finish to the entire interior of my vehicle . Now to see what else I can use it on !	1
This stuff is always good for protecting vinyl or rubber products and is even better in this large size spray bottle .	1
I 've been using this product for 15 years and nothing has come close to beating it yet . It has never ruined anything I put it one . I use it on my car , boat , exterior plastics etc ... It wo n't keep a shine like armorall but it will keep it from the Sun . If your just looking for shine then this is n't the product . If you want to safeguard your car/boat and keep them around , this is it .	1
The satin finish and the in or out durability is long lasting.The plastic and rubber outside the vehicle never looked so good.Heck I even used it on the windows	1
Great product ... I use this on my powder coated roll up tonneau cover ... . I provides a UV resistant barrier and keeps the cover looking new ... . you must get all the product wiped off before it completely dries ... .	1
Eventually the Sun will dry out the plastics on your car no matter what you use . This will help prolong and protected from drying out of vinyl plastic . I have been using it twice a year for a year and really need more time for a full review .	1
If you want all the technical details , then search the internet for this stuff . If you just want something that you can clean your dash , your fake leather seats , your boat cover , your targa top , and my personal favorite : rubber automotive weatherstripping , then you want this product ! No shiny streaks like Armor All and it does n't leave a bad smell either . It is easy to apply and stays wet long enough to move around and get things clean and protected.I highly recommend this product for pretty much all of the uses that it is listed for . Car enthusiasts , this is a must have product ! !	1
So far seems to be working as advertised will update as needed used on my new truck cover which stays outside exposed to the elements so will see if product holds up .	1
I have been using 303 spray for a few years now to protect sun exposed plastics from UV fading and deterioration . 303 does better than expected for my purposes . My primary use is conditioning kayak surfaces that are exposed to direct sun for extended periods of time . 303 is very effective without question .	1
no complain so far . Did n't see much use since my cover is new . but definitely will use it to see long term effect .	1
This works really eel lot preserve the siding on a hot tub . It made the vinyl siding look like new and also protected it from the sun .	1
Best protectant available . I 'm not sure what else to say . I 've been using this for years , and this was my 5th gallon purchased .	1
Purchased this for auto clearcoat protection was was pleased at the performance . I have also used this on my vinyl window frames and on my leather couch with great results . I will purchase again .	1
I have used this product for over 10 years on my cars . I have a 2003 Mazda who 's interior vinyl looks like new thanks to this product . It also works great on tires , providing a nice black finish and maintaining U/V protection .	1
Long lasting protection without artificial looking glossiness ! I do n't know why I have n't heard about this sooner . Dries to a natural finish . I normally abhor using treatments on interior panels ( after all , who wants a glossy dashboard ? ) but this stuff just works.. I used on my dash and door panels in my BMW and now those pieces look like they just rolled off the assembly line .	1
Been using Aerospace 303 for years . This is an outstanding product . It is a bit pricey but worth it . A bottle goes a long way.I used to use Armor All but this stuff beats Armor All hands down.Armor All leaves a greasy ( which likely comes from silicone additives ) feel to surfaces . It also does not last very long.Aerospace is not greasy and seems to last much longer after it is applied.Used it on my cars , motorcycle , sports gear , tools and equipment . Good for dozens of things ... .	1
Great for kayaks and canoes , but is especially nice for the car/truck dash . I do n't know if the SPF is really significant but it is a much nicer product than Armor All for dash 's as it is not so reflective . Works great for my stuff ! !	1
I bought this for my Kayak . Then started using on my cars instead of Armor All . I like this much more.Applies easily , not sticky and not glossy . I like that . It makes plastic and rubber look brand new .	1
I use this product a lot with our cars , mainly for cleaning up tough stains/dirt spots as well as protectant on the car 's interior plastic surfaces . Also occasionally use it on the leather seats , though I have other , dedicated products for that . I 've used it to keep the rubber weather stripping on doors clean and supple , and also as tire black ! Great product !	1
I use 303 Protectant to clean and protect the plastic windows on my boat . It works well , cleaning off the crud and leaving a nice shine that last longer than anything else I have used . Streaks just a little . I would buy this again .	1
I used this to help keep the shine and weatherproofing capability on my Softopper and it has done well . I had used Meguirs vinyl protectant before and this stuff knocks it out of the water . It does n't leave a greasy residue and I felt that it did a better job of keeping the top water resistant .	1
Product goes far and beyond the intended purpose , work like magic . Will buy again for all types of use daily .	1
My two seater convertible is subjected to the indignity of being left outside , exposed to the elements in South Florida due to the lack of a garage . Especially in our rainy season , we receive torrential downpours daily . This 303 Protectant is almost miraculous at it 's ability to bead up those downpours as if they never happened ! A few common sense suggestions if you 're using it for the first time ... .make sure to thoroughly clean your surface first or you 'll just trap contaminants and acids . It 's better to apply several light coats than to try to drench the canvas . Allow to dry completely before reapplying . Take the extra time to tape off painted areas or at least apply cautiously . Give extra attention to seams and sewn junctions . I 've tried numerous products over the year sand this it by far the most effective . ( Six hundred 5 star reviews should say something ! )	1
I bought this to use as a tire dressing for my vehicles after reading a lot of reviews on Amazon and around the web . The product absolutely lives up to the hype ! It makes the tire a deep black color , but it does n't look wet like some of the other products . I actually like this because it makes the tire look more natural , almost brand new . I follow the instructions and spray on the tires and then wipe off after 5 minutes . Highly recommend !	1
Boating days turned me on to this product . Any vinyl that has regular sun exposure should be treated - if you want it to last .	1
Found this to be an excellent product for the hull of my polyethylene kayak . It also works very well on the slides of my kayak rooftop loader . It does make a very slick surface.A note of caution here is that when I sprayed it on the surface of the kayak I did it in the garage . The over-spray also made the garage floor pretty slick . It takes some strong detergent to remove any over-spray .	1
Saw this referenced on another site and it really is good stuff . My spa cover had been somewhat neglected for over a year and as soon as I cleaned it and applied Aerospace to it , it looked like new .	1
Keeps my the seats in my boat looking great , season after season , and does n't leave behind a greasy residue that some products do .	1
After reading a bunch of reviews of 303 protectant , I decided it was time to replace my old Armor-All . The two seem about the same on application , though I found the Armor-All to leave a slipperier finish when dry . The 303 does benefit from a buffing when dry , to get any excess off , but it 's a fast process . I 've read that the 303 is better for plastics , and wo n't dry them out through plasticizer migration , so I hope that 's true .	1
Expensive , but worth it . I use 303 on so many different products , car dashboards , rubber moldings , kayaks and the list goes on . A little goes a long way . I have also bought the gallon jug , it 's a better value and then just refill the smaller 303 containers . It does a great job of protecting your valuable gear .	1
Seems that it will do the job - not greasy like the & # 34 ; xxx-all & # 34 ; product . A bit streaky , even though I wiped it dry as directed .	1
best product on the market for leather seats and soft tops . I will never use any thing else . Love this product	1
I 've been purchasing this product over the course of a decade and still love it . It 's similar to ArmorAll but does n't leave a thick , oily residue . I mostly use this when detailing cars since it literally brings a nice , like-new sheen to interior plastics ( particually dashboards and interior plastic door panels ) . On occasion , it can smell like REALLY bad B.O . ( body odor ) but its because the product has sat too long . I recommend buying small bottles if you wo n't use a lot of it in a year or two time unless you do n't mind the smell .	1
I use this product on everything . Car , truck , RV , even the metal roof on our cabin . Best thing out there no need for auto wax .	1
If you are looking to keep your plastics/vinyl clean and shiny , than this is your product . I like the matte look better and ended up searching elsewhere .	1
Restores abused plastic and power coated surfaces very nicely but still too early for me to tell how it performs long term . So far I am very happy .	1
I goog-ed and found this is it for the job . It protects . It is decent affordable . It will last a while . Boaters , Jeepers , get some . Take the mild hit on price .	1
I do n't know what is in this stuff , but it works . I love the non-greasy low sheen apperance it gives to everything it is protecting . The jury is out on long-time protection , but it has not let me down yet . I am already happy with the product since it is not a dust magnet like cheaper protectant ( i.e . armor all , son-of-agun ) . Would purchase again .	1
I have used this product on my kayaks for the last couple of years and have been very satisfied , so when I located this on Amazon for a fraction of the price of retail stores I jumped on it . After cleaning My kayaks I apply the 303 protectant , they look new again but better than that the protectant leaves a hard shell coating allowing the kayak to glide through the water with ease.I have also used this product in my cars on the dash and tires , it protects the dash and tires from drying out and cracking and gives a nice look clean look .	1
Been using this product for over a year on the fender flares on my jeep and the inside too . It really works ... much better than other products . Best price I found is here at amazon .	1
It seems to be keeping the latex supple and not dried out . Exactly what you would expect it to do .	1
Been using other products and had to give 303 a try and I 'm glad I did . I also like that it is not as shiny as many other products . Also like that it knocked down the dashboard reflections against my windshield when conditions caused it to happen . Once I get low , I 'm buying 303 next time by the gallon now that I have tried it .	1
I bought it ; I use it ; I BELIEVE it works . UV degradation is something that is hard to detect in more finite time frames , so as a matter of faith or superstition , I 'll accept this is good stuff . I use it on composite kayaks as well as plastic and rubber car parts.It does make plastics and rubber look good . It also occasionally makes them really slippery . As an aesthetic product or a pseudo lubricant , it 's obviously working .	1
This product has worked well to protect the dash and hard plastics from drying out in the sun and heat .	1
I prefer this plastic/rubber spray over Armor All . It 's not as shiny or as greasy . Using it on tires leaves them with a less wet looking shine that lasts longer .	1
Nice stuff . Easy to apply and buff out . Beautiful matte finish where you want it , shiny where you want that . I prefer it to TCG Hypercoat G6 .	1
I have a Chevy Avalanche with lots of black ( or at least it was black ) body trim . I got lazy and let the Southern California sun bake it wayyyy too long . I did a lot of web searches and found that this & # 34 ; 303 & # 34 ; is very very highly rated , and loved by boat owners . Boats endure some of the most harsh environments imaginable , so I decided to give it a try.It has the consistency of `` Armor *** & # 34 ; but is way different in its ingredients and performance . It contains UV protectors ( sun-screen ) plus penetrating polymers to actually restore some of the plastics structure . This stuff is much more color restorative than any others I have tried , and it brought the dark black back to my trim ! Here is what else I found out during my searches : ... .A problem with the neoprene material used in the Typhoon Lagoon inflatable boats at Walt Disney World was solved by treating them with 303 Aerospace Protectant ... . Fleetwood , Winnebago , Thor , and other leaders in the motorhome and travel trailer industry specify 303 Aerospace Protectant , and will actually advise customers against other brands ... Design Automotive Group , the leader in tonneau covers , only recommends 303 Aerospace Protectant for their vinyl treatment ... AMCO , the largest manufacturer of convertible tops , has recommended 303 Aerospace Protectant for over 20 years ... and the accolades go on and on ... Very highly recommended ...	1
Living in the southwestern United States , sun damage is a big problem . This is a good way to protect your stuff from UV damage .	1
Not finding much difference between this and Armor All . Tested it side-by-side on a pair of boots and tires on the left side of my car versus the right side of the car . Both lasted the same length of time before it had to be reapplied.Recommended ? If you 're looking for a miracle , look elsewhere . This does the same job as Armor All in my testing .	1
Does exactly what it says . Easy to apply and wipe dry . Made my Old Town Royalex canoe look great . Great for all plastics , rubbers , vinyls , etc .	1
I use this on my JEEP soft-top which I use off-road alot . Really protects from mud staining and keeps it looking like new .	1
i absolutely love this stuff . it is perfect for keeping my car looking shiny and new . i will absolutely buy more .	1
This stuff is great.I have been using Mother 's , `` Back to Black '' and was not happy with application and overall results . Mother 's works but one has to apply a lot of it to get where one wants to go : `` Back to Black . `` This stuff ( 303 Protectant ) works a treat . One sprays it onto a folded up washcloth and wipes 303 Protectant onto what ever it is the user wants to treat . I treated the step-side rocker panel tread pads first cause due to the grooves , there 's a lot of spray used and then used the mopped up excess to do door handles and mirrors . If applying product in this fashion , there 's little to no waste.Through experience , I found that Mother 's , `` Back to Black '' bleeds onto the car 's finish . I just received this product and have n't washed the car to see if there 's any bleeding problems . If there is , the wife will immediately let me know as it 's her car being detailed . At first blush , this is an excellent product , provides immediate feedback ( makes things look great ) and at a delivered price I find competitive with local auto parts stores which sell Mother 's , `` Back to Black . `` If over the next few car washes , anything is found that should be added to this review , I 'll come back and amend the above review with additional user based information.Addendum : 27May13 : We have washed the vehicle three times.I used this product on the back step panel of a 2000 , Dodge , Durango . All the rest of the black on the car came out great but two locations . The piece of rubber at the top of the windshield , due to buffing compound impregnation and the back step panel , due to thirteen years of weathering.The solution to correcting the problem was to wipe the locations down with `` 303 Aerospace Protectant '' which was sprayed onto a terry cloth sized wash cloth , soak and clean the offending molding . After allowing time for drying and buffing with micro fiber cloth , liberally apply Mother 's `` Back to Black '' , massage into the finish , allow to dry , buff and then reapply `` 303 Aerospace Protectant . `` That did the trick of maintaining the expected , when absorbed and dry , fresh , black look we strive for when using products of this kind.Eventually , I see our windshield and trim being replaced so as after thirteen years of use , will give this location on the vehicle a fresh start . ( We 're maintaining a thirteen year old vehicle and the alternative is to spend a boatload replacing the vehicle with used or new or , by comparison , spending a little to upgrade and maintain what we have . ) Hope the above tip helps in your efforts to restore and maintain your car 's appearance .	1
UV protection . Wo n't dry materials out . Does n't leave a heavy gloss residue . Does n't stink.It 's expensive and hard to find , pretty much have to order it online . But you wo n't find a better overall product unless you like greasy/glossy protectants or heavy scents.If you just want something that works and leaves as little evidence as possible that it is doing so , this is your stuff .	1
Any place you have plastic that bakes in the sun , you need this . Dashboards , bumpers , dinghies , gaskets and tires all benefit from slathering on 303 . On most of the exterior gaskets on my 8 ton M35A3 I slather silicone on them . But use 303 on the six tires that now cost $ 1800 apiece and weigh about 300 lbs with wheels and run flats . They dont get used much , and baking these in the sun is the fastest way to decompose them . Keeps the Michelin rubber nice and soft ... and no cracks .	1
not as & # 34 ; greasy & # 34 ; as a**** a** . goes on well . seems to resist accumulation of dust on my dash . a good product .	1
Well I have not used it yet , but I did buy it and I expect it to be as good as the reviews . It 's a great price for 32 whole ounces !	1
Wow , this stuff is great ! Spray it on , wipe it off , quick buff after and the car surface ends up very shiny and slick . I used it on my windows too and nothing sticks to them ! No bird droppings , sap-Nadda ! I also used it on the interior ( not the seats ) and it cleared all the marks off my door and dash . Definitely a good product .	1
Love this product , gives plastics a nice dull shine . Not like Armor All which in my opinion is way too shiny and can obscure vision when the light hits the dash at the wrong angle . Not too greasy .	1
I use this on my grill cover , hot tub cover and black trim on my car . Darkens the black plastic trim on my car and lasts for weeks between applications . Prevents fading on my grill and hot tub covers . Great product .	1
I bought a used 99 Bayliner with white seats , and I was looking to clean the seats , plastic , rubber , fiberglass , everything . I ordered this product and Meguiar 's Boat/RV Vinyl & Rubber Cleaner at the same time , so I could try out both of them . 30313 Aerospace Protectant is way , way better to clean the vinyl seats . Unbelievable actually.The seats had some tough spots , and I had to scrub them a bit . But it was n't much work at all . The seats look great now . It took away grime and dirt off the rubber by simply spraying it on those areas , did n't even have to scrub , just wiped it off . The rubber looks almost new . The plastic had areas with stains and streaks , did n't even have to scrub , just wiped it off . The plastic looks almost new . I sprayed down the hull , and it is supposed to be a great UV protectant.The protectant in this cleaner is supposed to be top-notch , so I 'll see how that goes . I tossed the Meguiar 's cleaner . I would buy 30313 Aerospace Protectant over anything .	1
After reading some good reviews on a car forum I bought this for my Mercedes that had MB-Text seats . Its basically mercedes version of Vinyl seats . I spray this on my seats and wipe it off to keep them looking new . This does not make it glossy ( Shiny ) . It gives it a nice crisp clean look . I also use it on my dash and every part of the interior except the glass and lcd screens . Highly reccommend for any car owners . The price is reasonable .	1
This is a great vinyl treatment , much better than Armorall in terms of protection ad longevity . Use it on hot tub cover , car interior , tires , exterior black plastic trim , etc . The description on the 32 oz says Refill but it is a squirt bottle .	1
I have used this for years on my boat upholstery . I wipe down the seats and cushions daily in the hot sun . The vinyl on my 2002 boat looks like new still .	1
I have some cotton outerwear and 303 Fabric Guard works better than anything else to make them durably water repellent .	1
There are lots of fabric water repellants on the market but I have had the best results with this one . My biggest challenge for all water repellants is my tan canvas top on my Mazda Miata . Besides making it water repellant , it makes it easy to wipe dirt off . Now , I have to qualify that any detergent - especially Dawn dish detergent - will suck this right out of the fabric . For this reason , when I wash the Miata , I only rinse the top . But for repelling rain , fog , dust and other general light dirt , 303 High Tech fabric Guard is my favorite . Before I apply it to my top , I wet my top and then `` shampoo '' it with a soft bristle shoe brush and work up a lather . Then I rinse and repeat until the top is clean . I let it dry completely before spraying on . The great thing about this stuff is that overspray onto paint or glass just wipes off with a paper or microfiber towel . I let the top dry and I 'm good for at least several months to a year . I also use this stuff on leather jackets , suede/nubuck shoes , or any other leather or fabric . It looks dark when first applied but dries to an invisible coat . I highly recommend it - which is why I order it in quantity , usually the 32 oz . bottles .	1
We use this product on all of our boat canvas ( which is Sunbrella ) , and when applied properly , it 's amazing . It is important to clean the cloth well and let it dry thoroughly first . We wash small items in the washing machine on delicate with Ivory detergent ; for larger items , we use the 303 Products Fabric Cleaner . We have found that the key to good waterproofing is to actually follow the directions and let the cloth bake in the sun after spraying on the repellant . What I love is that the water beads on the cloth as if it was waxed , yet the cloth retains its flexible hand . This product does not stiffen or whiten the cloth .	1
I bought this 303 fabric guard and water repellent to use on a boat cover that spends a lot of time exposed to the elements and it works very good .	1
This is one of the best car interior/fabric protection sprays made , period ! ! Go to their web-site and read about the product . It is not merely & # 34 ; Scotchguard & # 34 ; . I purchased this product several years ago when the local Honda dealer wanted to charge me $ 300+ for the factory & # 34 ; fabric protection & # 34 ; for our new vehicle ; I thought I could do just as well on my own , and certainly cheaper . So I researched products and found this one . I treated the vehicle when everything was brand new , as instructed . Over the years we got some grimy things on the car seats of that vehicle , and nothing ever penetrated into the fabric to the point where it would n't come out . I have two dogs and sometimes they would drag in mud ( and worse ) onto the car seats . Every bit of dirt that ever got on the seats and ceiling panel for that matter always came out . I never got anything horrible on the seats ( engine oil , ink , etc . ) so I ca n't attest to how this produce would handle things like that . I have since they used this product for shoes , indoor and outdoor seat cushions and lounge chair covers , etc . Works well for a variety of applications .	1
Great product used it to re surface my entire back awning , which is made of sumbrella fabric . Used a nice clean roller and covered the entire patio with this one gallon .	1
Works and applies exceptionally well	1
this stuff is awesome . i wish I knew about it years ago . I have tried all kinds of stuff on my 1998 Mitsubishi eclipse convertible top that leaks horribly . Seriously the leaking was so bad that one of the motors for the convertible rusted and seized up , the radio stopped working and the alarm was a little haywire . Granted the car was 10 years old , but I sprayed this stuff on and no more leaks . The water used to seep in through the roof and pool in the arms that hold the roof up . When you would drive and brake the water would slosh and splash on me . Covered the top with this stuff ( did n't even use the whole spray bottle ) and the car completely stopped leaking . I 've since sold the car cause the damage was done , but now I use this stuff on my tent , my softopper for my truck and anything else I can think of .	1
I used this on a polyester ( soft fabric ) inner shower curtain . It works . It does not discolor the fabric . Is it permanent ? No . What else can I say ? Follow the directions carefully . Best use is on jackets , sofas , patio furniture and umbrellas . Too much constant water will defeat this . It is not some magic oil that will seal a life raft . It just makes your stuff & # 34 ; mostly & # 34 ; waterproof for a while . I was hoping for better results but now that I know its limitations I am happy with it . Use it on things that get splashed with water and you will be amazed ; use it on things that get soaked and you will be amazed and then disappointed . It does n't smell very much either . Best to do it out doors .	1
I just renewed the waterproofing on the awnings of our RV with this product . Last time was 8 years ago and we use our RV up to 8 months a year . I also use this product to waterproof our kayaking and outdoor gear .	1
I have a Classics Accessories boat cover that I bought from Amazon back in 2010 that is still in excellent condition . Unfortunately , its ability to repel water is no longer all it could be . Doing a little research , I came upon this product courtesy of the Sumbrella folks and thought I 'd give it a try.There are basically two steps and you need at least one day when it is n't going to rain to get the full benefit . First , you clean your cover with 303 Products Fabric and Vinyl Cleaner . I bought the 32 oz size and hardly used any of it . A little goes a long way . I just wet down the cover on the boat with water , sprayed some cleaner on it , then scrubbed it with a soft boat brush on a pole . Hose it down well when you 're done and walk away . Come back tomorrow . If it rains , no big deal . It 's the application of the water repellent that requires 12 hours of sunshine ; not the cleaner.The next day , I sprayed down the boat cover with the 303 Products High Tech Fabric Guard with Water Repellent . I used one of those $ 15 pump up sprayers that you use to spray Round Up in your yard and it took the whole gallon to treat my boat cover ( which is on a 17 ' power boat ) . I walked away again . 12 hours later it was completely cured.This morning I stepped outside with a glass of water and threw it on the cover . The water blew off the cover like a hurricane was chasing it . Unbelievable ! Talk about hydrophobic ! I could not be more pleased.This is n't cheap but I ca n't see how anything else on the market could work better . It is incredibly effective . According to Sunbrella , I should be good for another three years , assuming the cover does n't just wear out first . It sits in the sun out in the driveway every day the boat is n't actually on the water .	1
Very happy with the performance so far , but I have not been using it very long so can not speak to the long term protection capabilities , but compared to other protectants it yields a nicer less oily and less glossy surface ( I consider this to be a good thing ) . Just be warned that it should be wiped off immediately , this is clearly stated on the packaging , but I failed to read it on first use .	1
This product ( High Tech Fabric Guard 30674 ) works great - 100 % of the water now beads up and my cloth top looks better than new ! ! ! My Situation : The very first time my brand new , light beige cloth convertible top got wet I realized it came from the car dealer and/or factory either untreated and/or seriously under treated because water just soaked right into the cloth as evidenced by the darker cloth color when wet.End Result : After applying two coats of this product 100 % of the water beaded-up and rolled right off the top . Nothing soaked in at all - zero wet spots on the cloth top . ( Since the top is a light beige color any wet spots would show up slightly darker in color . ) Any water that did n't roll off the top was absorbed using The Absorber 51149 sponge-cloth available on Amazon or at WalMart.Process:1 ) I gently cleaned my cloth convertible top using 303 Fabric Top Cleaner ( 303-30550 ) . To do this I first rinsed the top with fresh water , then sprayed the cleaner on & gently scrubbed using a very soft brush ( I used Star Brite Soft Yellow Wash Brush 040013 available on Amazon ) . A stiffer brush or too vigorous scrubbing could damage the fabric , scuffing the threads and creating a fuzzy look to the fabric . I cleaned the top in slightly overlapping areas about 18 & # 8221 ; x 18 & # 8221 ; .2 ) I rinsed the top and allowed it to dry thoroughly.3 ) Using a 2 & # 34 ; paint brush and small container of 303 High Tech Fabric Guard 30674 , I applied the Fabric Guard brushing it on in a manner similar to painting . By overlapping slightly I made certain I applied the product to every square inch of the top.4 ) I allowed the top to dry several hours and applied a second coat of Fabric Guard.Notes:1 ) When applying the clear Fabric Guard liquid with a 2 & # 34 ; paint brush it will start to have a slightly white/foamy appearance - this will go away completely and the product will dry clear.2 ) After each application I noticed a VERY slight , very fine clear crystalline residue on my cloth top . You had to look very closely to see it - it had just a little bit of sparkle to it in the sunlight . This brushed off quickly and easily & probably would have blown off the first time I drove the car.3 ) Some reviewers seem to have issues relating to getting the product on the car itself saying it was hard to remove . I didn & # 8217 ; t have this problem . The few times that I over-brushed or got small drops Fabric Guard on the car itself I simply gently wiped it with a soft paper towel and it did n't damage anything or leave any residual coating . It seemed to wipe off 100 % with a soft paper towel.4 ) READ THE LABEL ! ! ! The first paragraph covers some surfaces that you CAN NOT use this product on without causing damage . These include rubber , vinyl , clear vinyl , plastics , etc . Since the product 's Material Safety Data Sheet lists the contents as Petroleum Distillates , just a wild guess but prolonged contact with this product may have a solvent effect on materials such as vinyl or plastic.5 ) I would n't purchase 303 Fabric Cleaner again & # 8211 ; I think a bucket of hot water with a scant squirt of Dawn dish detergent would do just as good of a job . Of course , you will need to completely rinse the top and allow it dry thoroughly before applying 303 Fabric Guard.6 ) I have no idea how long my cloth top will remain water repellant after applying Fabric Guard . I plan on doing this process every 6 to 8 months or sooner if I notice any water being absorbed by the cloth top .	1
I use this on an expensive furniture set purchased from Costco . After applying the product we could see how easily water beads of the material and stains are easily removed from the cushion . Overall , very good product that we will continue to use . We did not see any discoloration .	1
303 makes top quality products . Cost a lot but you get value for your money . Water just beads up on what you treat it with .	1
I have used this on my boat cover all winter and now my grill cover , works well and easy to apply .	1
None of these products are cheap . That said , I applied this with a garden sprayer , and it went further than I expected , and has done a good job of conditioning and protecting the canvas it 's covering . Will buy again .	1
I applied this to a new boat cover to waterproof it using a hand spray pump . I think they key is really saturate the fabric with this product , allowing it to penetrate . The first rain has come , and the water is literally rolling off the cover in huge drops . Cover still looks perfectly dry . I have a 20 ' boat , and used almost the entire bottle to waterproof it , so it does take quite a bit.It 's expensive , but it has worked great for me so far so it 's been worth it .	1
Sprayed a 10x10 ft commercial umbrella ... . ( Sunbrella fabric ) with about 2/3rds of a gallon . I used a pump garden sprayer and used the `` '' FAN '' '' tipped nozzle.The product went on great and when it dried by the next day , it repelled the light rain shower like water off a ducks..ah ... er ... .back ... yeah , that 's it , like water off a ducks back .	1
Used this on my 06 Rag top ... Works great ... water just beads off . Seems to hold up well also . Great Product from a great company . 303	1
Sure , it is corded and you may have to use an extension cord , but it never runs out of juice and is pretty dang tough . Our last one just burned out after around ten+ years of hard service and thousands of fish , so I 'd say we got our money 's worth .	1
I have had it about 3 weeks and used it to clean several catches of perch and it worked like a champ . This is the first electric fillet knife I have ever used .	1
Does an adequate job . The only real complaint is the switch is touchy and I find it difficult to keep pressure on it in the right spot to avoid constant starting and stopping .	1
i finally got the just to use this product this past wknd.i researched tons of these products and decided on this knife . all i can say is wow . my son caught two cats about 5 pounds.i was done in seconds on the first fish with no messing up , lucky me.blades are super sharp , balance was good.people complained about the curly cord , but i used a small and light extention cord , and had no issues . it was only two fish , but i felt it was worth every penny . im the only one who cleans the cats and i was looking for a quicker way to fillet and i found it.i will get a better feel for the knife , when i catch more . i hope this helps .	1
I have n't used this for fish , but I have used it for cutting the Thanksgiving turkey , slicing beef for jerky , etc. , and I 'm very happy with the electric knife . The blade is sharp . Very happy with this purchase .	1
Got this to replace an electric knife that finally quit working . My son says it is a much better knife that the old one .	1
Did not purchase for headlights but to polish a acrylic aquarium after sanding . Pretty good stuff . aquarium looks new again .	1
no words honestly , works really great just maintain it after this to keep the lights looking good . And a small amount goes a long way so thats a plus too	1
After reading some of the negative reviews I think I understand what the problem is . If you purchased the product from Amazon you did n't have the benefit of reading the back label . The back label indicates which product to use for various oxidation levels.Light : PlastX cleaner and polishModerate : One step headlight restoration kitSevere : Heavy duty headlight restoration kitThe lenses on my 2007 Camry had a light haze forming . It was hazy enough to look bad but probably not enough to reduce night time light output . Most of the haze was from the top to the middle , probably because that 's where the sun hits the most . After reading about different products I decided to try the least expensive and easiest method first . I purchased PlastX and in about 20 minutes both lenses were clear again . I simply applied the product and rubbed it into the lens , and repeated in areas that required it . This product will not eliminate scratches or pitting . It will only eliminate a light haze . If you have anything more than a light haze you 'll probably need one of the wet sanding products and need to spend an hour or more on each lens to carefully remove the oxidation .	1
I literally went outside with 2 rags and a bottle of this stuff , and within 5 minutes both my headlights looked atleast 30 % clearer.It took nearly no effort at all , rub on , wipe off , and wow , the difference was noticeable instantly.I have 95 % of the bottle left too ... . I am going to use it on friends/family headlights and see what else I can use it on.But if you are looking to clean headlights , give this a shot before spending much more money . Ive seen restore kits and all that , but unless you think your headlights really need it , and your lights are in really really bad shape , this will probably work fine.My car is 9 years old , and this was the first time restoring the headlights , and I was almost amazed how this stuff gets all that blur right out and makes them look almost new again .	1
I think this product is amazing I used this on my 2000 Ford Explorer and wow what an amazing job it did to clean and brighten my lights Used on front and rear lights . Also used on my ATV lights and worked great on its lights too ! Very easy to use and immediate results ! Great product and price Try it !	1
I considered purchasing the pricier plastic lens polishing systems , which are offered , but decided to try this stuff since it was much cheaper and was highly recommended by others . I used it to polish the ten-year old headlight lenses on my van , which were very well scratched and oxidized so I could not see the lamps inside . But , after using this stuff with a regular shop rag , I was able to polish the lenses to where I could clearly see the lamps inside . Although , I was not able to get out the deeper scratches , It worked well enough for my purposes .	1
I needed it for a plastic windshield . I thinks this stuff works great for headlights , but leaves a milky coating on the plastic when the sun hits the windscreen just right . It is intended for headlight lenses so I ca n't fault the product ...	1
First of all , if you are thinking of using this to restore your old , hazy , yellow headlights , then just forget it . This product just does not have the abrasiveness to cut through the layers of oxidized plastic . I tried this and even after a full hour of working the headlight and I wound up with a very shiny , glimmering , yellow headlight.To correctly restore old , faded headlights , here are the steps you should follow : - Sand headlights with fine grit sandpaper ( 1000 grit or so ) - Polish headlights with a compound . Either a light rubbing compound or heavy polishing compound will work.- Polish headlights with a light polish to buff away any remaining scratches.While theoretically possible to do this work by hand , it is very strongly advised to use an orbital polisher instead . Your elbows will thank you.This product here is designed for step # 3 above . If you have very light oxidation or marks on your headlights , this should take care of it . However if the headlight is deeply discolored and heavily oxidized , other steps will be required for full restoration .	1
I used this on my truck which had very yellow headligts from being in the sun for over 10 years . I used a cordless drill with attachment and this polish and my headlights are now crystal clear . Very impressed and it took less than 10 minutes . I tried using this on the plastic covering over my speedometer and gauges etc but the results were less than favorable . This is probably because that plastic was flimsy and hart to push hard enough to get the polish to do its thing so most likely not the fault of the polish . It was just hard to get into that small space and really buff it out..	1
Like others have said , this product is not for heavy duty jobs . But for normal hazing over time , it gets the job done . My 2001 Accord became yellowish and hazy over the years and I was thinking about buying one of them complete restoration systems , but decided to try this first . I 'm glad I did.Cleaning both head lights on my Accord took approximately 35 minutes by hand . All I used was some paint tape , and some lint-free rags , ( microfiber ) . Best $ 5 I ever spent , and I barely used 1/8 of the bottle . I 'm sure those complete restoration systems will do a better job , but with it needing to grind down the top layer and stuff just leads to more user error . With this , you really ca n't mess up . Only drawback is that the results might not be as good . Just check the photos .	1
I used this on a 2004 Acura MDX that had some light to medium hazing and yellowing of the headlights . I applied the liquid with a damp sponge working in a circular motion and applying light pressure . I then let it sit for about 30-40 seconds . I also used a buffing pad ( Auto Zone , $ 6.00 ) and attached it to my cordless drill , talk about easy ! I repeated these steps 4 times and all I can say is WOW ! The lenses are now clear and haze free , may not be showroom new , but it 's darn close . I 'm definetly impressed with this product and the results .	1
I bough this to clean a plexi window on our golf cart which was a bit hazy looking . It takes some elbow grease but works well and cleaned up my window and made it clear again . I would imagine it would be great on headlights ( etc ) as well .	1
Finally got around to polishing the old , fogged up lenses on my 2005 ride with a 3M kit from amazon . But I did n't want to go to all that trouble and just conclude after using their rubbing compound ( which made a big difference after the 3000 grit polishing stage ) . So after researching for some sort of final polish that would also protect the lens , I decided meguiar 's was probably the amazon crowd favorite upon reading a bunch of reviews.I used the same sponge head adapted for application with drill that came with the 3M kit ( just wash/rinse well before using the meguiar product ) which made this final step rather quick and easy . The results were noticeably more clear and 'new looking ' afterwards , which is exactly what I was hoping for . There 's enough left over to do the job many times over.This product worked great , but I 've got nothing else to compare it with - and I do n't know how long the 'new look ' will last so I reserving a star . But I would certainly recommend it using the same process as I described above .	1
I had to grab one at the local store for $ 10 but for its size , I ca n't really complain . Not long ago I purchased 3M 's headlight polishing kit and ran out of the plastic polish compound . Literally a five minute job on my '02 Mazda hatchback.With that said , you only need a little bit . I usually rinse the headlight , put few drops and polish at slow speeds side to side . I only did it once and the headlight looks clear as a day . Granted , I can probably make it even more clear if I took the time and probably better to finish it off with plastic protector.This would be great for motorcycle visors and anything plastic really . For consistency , I recommend using a handheld polisher or drill attachment of some kind.I definitely noticed a difference in more light on the ground after cleaning with this polish !	1
I have a 2006 Honda Civic Coupe LX . My car sits in my driveway here in Hawaii and the lenses got so bad that people asked me what was wrong with them . For an '06 , it should n't be THAT cloudy . I 'm a waxaholic . I 'm sure the build up of wax , cleaners , combined with Hawaiian Sun oxidized the darn out of them . I tried a lens restorer I found on ebay for $ 5 and it worked somewhat , but not enough . I got Maguire 's Plastx and I could not believe how well it worked . I uploaded pictures on here so you could see the difference.It took multiple applications . I literally sat there with a stool and waxed on and waxed off for a good hour . After a lot of patience and elbow grease , the results were amazing . It even cleared up the damage my f & * ( ^ brother in law did . One day he thought he 'd try and fix it himself with sandpaper . UGH ! This product cleaned it up so good that unless you put your face right up to the lens , you ca n't really see the scratches.If you 're lenses are extremely cloudy like mine were ( or worse ) expect to put in some time and effort . I did , and it was worth it . It saved me $ 100 to have a professional detailer do it.P.S . I 'm in the process of selling the car . Before I found Maguire 's some guy tried to lowball me saying that the headlamps needed to be completely replaced which would cost over $ 500 in parts + labor costs = about $ 1000 . So , if he 's right , I just saved myself $ 1000 on the value of my car . Thanks MAGUIRE !	1
So it worked well for a couple weeks , but during a lunge workout , it snapped on me . I liked it and thought it was a great product until this happened . I noticed small rips on the band . This could have been the issue .	-1
I have several different bands and these are the least likable , they do not stretch enough and make it way to difficult to use	-1
As most exercise products , these were used a few times , and stored away in the bag for a few months . I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights , and the bands are starting to discolor and fade . Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening ...	-1
I wish I would have taken the warnings I read in some of the other reviews seriously ! I purchased these bands and loved them the first 2 times I used them . The handles make the bands very comfortable to hold . They seemed to be high quality . I am 5'3 '' and the stretch was plenty for me , though if you are tall I 'm not so sure this set of bands would work for you . After my first 2 uses I would have given these bands 5 out of 5 stars , but after today 's workout there 's no chance ! While I was using the yellow band the hardware snapped and hit my leg . Thankfully it hit our concrete garage floor before hitting my leg . I 've attached photos of the hardware issue -- as you can see one of the handles becomes disconnected even with the slightest amount of pull . It seems that the peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole.All in all I would say do n't waste your money ! I 'm going to cough up a little more money and buy actual dumbbells .	-1
I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon . On my first use , the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one . I will never buy anything with Outers written on it . I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit .	-1
My kit arrived with parts missing . Everything was in disarray , with just a few parts resting in their spots . After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs , I opted to send it back . The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap kit . I did n't even try to use it ... just packed it up and sent it back . What a disappointment .	-1
Piece of crap . The black push rod handle cracked in half the first time I used it and the copper bristles fall out of the pieces . Lots of sizes to use but what 's the point when they are all low quality garbage	-1
used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment . the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped . i 'm not one to apply heavy force on these , they 're just very soft/cheap . the brushes are decent enough . after spending cash on a nicer kit , i guess i learned my lesson . if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer .	-1
I have to laugh at this one . The cheesy picture behind the hole , the fake & # 34 ; traps & # 34 ; , the generally terrible build quality ... it 's so lame it is in fact kind of funny . But for 40 bucks the joke 's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball . For that it gets an extra star.I 'd give this four stars at 15 , and five at 10 . But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same , so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks , there 's always lots around . Or buy one here for far less than this . Or just use a glass on its side on the rug . But OMG , then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself ! One tip : put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll , makes it more fun too .	-1
Cheap product ! Within two days of use it started to loose air where I found a pin size hole and is now no longer useable . You could buy the same product ( also made in china ) at local stores for 1/4 the price . I would not recommend this product .	-1
This must be more ideal for a handgun . The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15 , Remington 12 gauge , nor my Reuger .22 . The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger , however , when I tried that , I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun . The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved . I should have returned it , but I was lazy .	-1
this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer . it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too . it is bulky and you 're better off getting a small lock box instead of this . it may sound good until you try in on and it does n't fit or barely fit , not to mention it may scratch up the gun . this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have . what 's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move . that would totally render this lock totally useless . it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it ! overrated lock .	-1
It did n't work on an AR -15 , AK 74 , or a Remington 870 shotgun . After I adjusted and squeezed the two pieces together as tight as I could , I could still provide enough force to twist the unite sideways and to engage the trigger . I was trying to save money , but you ca n't save money if it does n't work . The weakness is that it does n't have pins that surround the trigger AND the trigger guard . All it has is a single & # 34 ; rachet post & # 34 ; .Imagine having a single post in front of your trigger ( hopefully behind the trigger ) that is held secure only by the pressure of the two sides squeezing together . The unit works only if you can squeeze it tight enough around the grip or the slide to hold it in place . Weak ! ! ! The Pro Lok is an EXCELLENT lock ! ! ( But $ 34 ) It has lighting speed access , movable pins to get infront and BEHIND the trigger , it has a key if you want , and an extra enclosed chain if you want . That provides a rock solid hold on the trigger , and two other forms of backup if you want it . ( key and chain ) I am not sure why this lock has so many good reviews . It makes me feel like I am missing something here . If I am missing something , please leave a reply and I can change my review .	-1
I purchased two of these for my Glock and my AR . Neither one fits on securely due to the shape of the lock . I have tried to attach these to both my firearms in various ways to get a solid , secure hold and each time I am able to twist and move the lock enough to gain access to the trigger . I thought this product was exactly what I was looking for , but it does not serve its purpose	-1
Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However , on my two lever-action rifles , it 's not very effective -- probably no surprise , given the design . On an older Winchester 94 , I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together , with some effort . On a Winchester 9422 , it attaches itself to the trigger guard , and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used . The rifle can be loaded , cocked , and fired with the lock still in place .	-1
My husband bought this for our two year old son ... and it was just too big for him to use . So , we thought we 'd wait . We had it outside , under a tarp and within two months , it started to rust . Once it started , the rust could n't stop . So basically , a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler .	-1
I would never buy this trike again for a child . It tips VERY easily when the child 's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side . Enough said . Money wasted and damage done .	-1
4 month update ! well after about 4 month it has completely lost it 's sharpening ability . minding that i do a lot of cutting , and I used this on every knife around the house . However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer . all an all i 'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review : Sharpens the knives like never before ! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it ) . rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade . works very well on a variety of steel grades .	-1
Product arrived missing the Green 1200 grit stone . I only received the Red 600 grit , and Blue 325 grit stones . Although DMT makes a great product , I think these sharpening stones are too small and awkward for sharpening knives . I will stick with the Diafold sharpeners from DMT .	-1
So you gain a nice , checkered , flatter surface on your classic SD . You lose your toothpick and your tweezers . Sound like a good deal on a multi tool that is that thin and small to begin with ? Honest , I was about to order one . How cool would it be to have a larger Alox tool AND it 's little brother ? How cute would that be if they matched ? ! But , then I thought about how not having the extra few tools would stink , added to the fact that the classic SD is already super tiny to begin with . So tiny , it literally will disappear if misplaced.. It just did n't make any sense to me.My guess is that if you have an Alox style companion to this , you might want it . But I do , and I do n't want it for the reasons listed . It simply does n't add any value when you lose tools on an already super slim product . You 're paying more for less , essentially . I do n't like throwing money away , so I 'll stick with my classic SD cellidor scales for now . My honest opinion of course . Take with a grain of salt .	-1
ORIGINAL : It is like a Yellow Ferrari : ) The color in the picture is faithful to reality . All tool are excellent as expected but beware that this is very small knife . A true keyring thin short knife and micro scissors : ) UPDATE : After first use , I noticed that the keyring is at the wrong end of the knife and right end of the scissors . Maybe this knife in reality is a nail-clipper ( scissor to clip and file to smooth out and the knife is a novilty that goes with the name . I am updating my review to 1 just so they may listen otherwise the knife is worth 3.5 stars max 4.ACTIONI think we should all update our ratings to 1 for Victronix to listen up or as one of the reviewer said already that he has contacted them since 2o years ago but no one listen .	-1
Looked forward to replacing my Classic knife on my keychain because the scissor feature did not perform well . The two halves of the scissor bind and only open partially unless you manually assist it each stroke . So I ordered a new one . It arrived , incorrect style , quickly corrected by Amazon customer service . But the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment . The scissor feature on the new one is as bad as the old one . I have many Swiss Army knives and have previously believed their quality and customer service were first rate . I contacted SA and received a response stating they would look into my quality concern . A couple weeks went by and they replied that their scissor spring had not changed . Period . Hardly addresses the poor performance I reported to them . And the spring was never the problem anyway . The two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight.Bottom line ... Poor or deteriorating product quality and sadly poor customer service to match .	-1
I agree with all of the other reviewers here that say the key ring is at the wrong end of this & # 34 ; Knife & # 34 ; making the knife unusable while atached to your keys.The construction of everything Victorinox is first rate , no doubt , but I ca n't understand why these are made this way .	-1
Todays version of this knife does n't come even in thin plastic container-it comes in only thin paper box . The shiny handle material on mine was all scratched . The distributors of Swiss Army knife here in States got a bit cheap on its presentation of a fine knife . I remember when I bought Victorinox years ago and it was in a nice box inside of which was made in a special shape to accommodate shape of knife . Now they do n't include instruction manual , knife can be scratched , and it ( knife ) just dangles in thin paper box . Not a good present for someone indeed . But as tool it is quite good . If you want to give someone a present repackage it yourself . Again new knife came all scratched up , maybe manufacturer in Switzerland do n't know that American distributors just screwing up here . I hope for the sake of a good knife they will.Update : Retuned this one to Amazon for replacement . Got new one today . It looks the same-plastic handle all scratched up , wo n't return this one , but wo n't consider it as a present to someone either .	-1
There are a number of great credit card knives , ( so called because they are when folded the size of a credit card ) made by both S.O.G . which makes the `` Access card '' , and Spyderco which makes the `` Spydercard '' . The cost nearly is the same and the others have actual useful blades . This thing is cheap , cheap , cheap incomparison . Do yourself a favor and take a look at those others before buying this one .	-1
I am a big fan of the peppermint version of this line of soap , and the Hemp Tea Tree was as good in terms of functionality ... but it smelled very strong , and it had a vague aroma of gasoline , which I 'm not a fan of bathing myself in.I thought I was going crazy , but other people who used it said the same.weird . But if that 's what you 're into , you 'll love the soap .	-1
This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather . I never felt clean using this because it does n't lather . I would use some with a loofa , and I 'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session . I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash ! I 'm sure it was cleaning just fine , but I have oily skin and need the & # 34 ; reassurance & # 34 ; soap lather provides.Basically , if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap .	-1
the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans . Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle ? the thing creeped me out .	-1
Product is was too pricey . DO NOT USE ON YOUR HAIR ! It says you ca use it on hair and body but it dries and damages the hair . If you 've a sensitive sense of smell then you can smell the hemp in it . Gave it to a friend who seemed to like it . I will stick with Bath and Body Works ( - ;	-1
I 've used Thera-Band balls at the place where I got physical therapy and I know they are great quality . The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump , nor did it come with a plug . So basically it was unusable , as you ca n't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it 's inflated . Also , if you do n't get an adapter for a bicycle pump , you will need some sort of pump that can fit into the hole of this ball to inflate it.As much as I love the brand , I would recommend a different ball that comes as a kit with a hand pump , plug , etc . I ended up getting a GAIAM ball and have been very pleased .	-1
I 'm convinced that these mattresses have the wrong type of valve . It has a small nipple and after you inflate the mattress you push in on it to retract the valve back inside of the mattress . The valve is just like the valve is on a cheap beach ball.One other thing I did n't like was the size . The add say 's it 's 26.5 wide but when you blow it up it 's less which makes for too tiny of a mattress if you 're using it for sleep instead of a water floatation raft.I had bought several of these for camping and returned them all and replaced them with the same companies ( INTEX ) extra wide mattresses . The valves on the extra wide are totally different . They 're made with a hard vinyl valve that 's recessed into a hard vinyl pocket . The valve is made so when you put air in it wo n't come out . It has a stop on the inside if the valve that 's like a flap that closes when air starts to escape . To deflate you just unscrew the valve and it deflates in seconds.I would highly recommend ( anyone interested in a great quality mattress ) the INTEX extra wide . Only 6 dollars more .	-1
I thew this garbage away after spending only 1 night on it . Kept deflating and I had to wake up repeatedly to re-inflate it . Be careful - if you order one you might get a leaker and spend a miserable night on it .	-1
The light itself is so-so . The mount is cheap and poorly designed . I put one on my Stepdads bike it fell and broke on the 3rd week.Do n't buy it .	-1
Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo ( Whereas my front light was gray in hue , unlike the black/gray one you see here ) thinking it was a good buy , wrong ! This product is as shoddy as most `` BEll products '' are.The rear light went out first , then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i 've learned not to trust the viability of `` Bell products '' ever again.That 's why i 'm now a `` Cateye 's '' and `` Nite Ize '' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost .	-1
Bought two for the fam , used once , did n't hold air for more than a few hours then had only about half , which is where it stayed , and that was before ever , ever put any weight on them , in the middle of the day . And yes , I double-checked the plug . Also removed all rocks from the sandy tent pad , used a quality tent tarp underneath a quality tent , as well , though since had n't put any weight on either of them when they lost the air that should n't have mattered anyway.Did I love the carrying bags ? Oh yeah . Also loved the nice new ( to me ) plug system which made blowing it up and sealing quickly while still full of air very easy . Too bad the part that really matters - holding air - was so immensely inadequate . Returned them immediately after returning from camping trip , now have to go find something else after having shopped for this till thought would drop ... '' thanks '' Coleman ... arrgghh .	-1
I bought this mattress about 6 weeks ago , to replace an older model of Coleman Queen-Sized air mattress that lasted 2 years , before it started to leak.Within a week , this mattress developed a slow leak - had to pump it up about once a week - I thought , Well , that 's not too much trouble , but it certainly does n't match the quality of the older model.Then , a few days ago , it developed more ( or a larger ) leak ( s ) - now , it deflates in about 4 hours - pitiful . Someone said it came with patches - mine didn't.I suggest you buy something else - I am going to - do n't know which one yet.Buyer beware - the quality has went spiraling down , faster than the leak *__*	-1
The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad . Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize . The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft . The unit just does n't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose .	-1
It 's rechageable which means it is for convenience.Yes , it 's quite convenient and works well.However , it 's rechageable which means the battery wo n't last forever.After less than 50 times of recharging , it dies.I recommend 12V or 120v one if you can use power outlet at the site .	-1
While we love the goggles ( my boys are n't fans of the typical style ) and they are amazingly easy to put on , we had one pair crack in numerous places around the seal after just one season of use . We do not abuse them , so I do n't know how or why it occurred , but I did buy a pair to replace them . If the others crack I 'll update ! The sun-tinted goggles are perfect for my little guy with sun sensitive eyes . They fit my 4 year old ( first wore them at 3 ) and 6 year old both well , I just need to make sure they are sealed before they jump into the pool.Updating a few months later - the sun-tinted goggles only lasted 4 months of weekly ( twice a week in the summer ) . The last pair is barely hanging on and I 'm guessing they will likely last a few more swim lessons before they start allowing water in . The seal has cracked on each pair of goggles , and I treat them the exact same way that I treat my own swim goggles that I 've had for years.I do not recommend these goggles , I do n't think they are worth buying a new pair this often . I have n't read other people 's reviews lately , part of me wonders if there is something I 'm not doing that they need that my own goggles do n't ? If anyone has an idea , please let me know !	-1
This is a very small , not average sized Razor . I had bought one a few years ago for my daughter and she still rides & loves it . I bought this one for my 6 year old boy , thinking it was the same size . He ca n't even get both feet on the deck . I do not recommend this razor for anyone older than 4 .	-1
I dont know the condition the item was stored in , but I had serious emulsion problems . Parts of the images would not develop or would show up discolored . In the future I plan to purchase from a local reputable camera store	-1
It 's just not enough cushion for my poor tail bone ! Perhaps the thin layer of gel may be enough for people already accustomed to riding , but for those just getting into or ( like in my case ) back into the sport , I 'd suggest padded shorts instead . Those definitely eased the pain a lot more than the seat cover .	-1
I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly , it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat . It worked pretty well for a while , but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material . That was it , it was ruined . It lasted one season of riding . Felt good when it worked . It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat . After a good season of riding i did n't need it any more , the standard saddle is fine .	-1
I bought it not for softening my saddle . The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions . So I bought this product purely as a `` cover '' and I did n't make much research on this item , supposing that `` any will fit '' First of all , I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product . It is unreasonably heavy , very heavy . It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles , but its not the best idea . If you apply it on narrow saddle , than you cant fix this cover at all . It moves and slips all the time . Fixing strand is another bad idea . In fact , I ca n't find any positive point in this product thus I ca n't recommend it . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother 's house . It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical . There is very little resistance . It is squeeky . The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical . It take sup a lot of space . I found no value to it since it did n't get my heart rate up , it was n't working any muscles , and it did n't provide a core work out . Not sure what the purpose would be . I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot . So , I do n't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.On the positive side , all of the grandchildren love to swing on it and play on it . ( that probably is n't a positive for my mother though ) . The kids think it is fun .	-1
Setting up a new camping outfit , we got a new tent , air mattress , lantern and camping stove , all Coleman . The tent and air mattress : great ! The lantern : terrific ! The stove : not too good.We did not have the problem that many others seem to have had ; namely , an aluminum tray that catches and is not secured to the base properly . And , as with older models , the design is a winner -- adjustable wind flaps , and folding and carrying that are well-thought out ( as long as you are able to carry the portable propane tanks separately ) .BUT , the raison d'etre of a stove is ... . HEATING . You can not control the flame on this thing . No matter how precisely you adjust the flame , no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob , the flame immediately goes to high . It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob . This was okay when we wanted to boil water , but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant . This was true on both burners.Coleman should be ashamed . Is this the start of the demise of the Coleman reputation ? Surely the company knew about this before these went out to the public . I wo n't be so quick to assume a Coleman product is good quality anymore . Of all the things to get wrong ! You would n't think a stove 's heating capabilities would be considered optional by the manufacturer.I thought about exchanging this item , but the number of reviewers making the same complaint indicates a return is more in order . Our next stove will not be Coleman .	-1
As long as you do n't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit . You see , the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings . No problem if you 're trying to warm a kettle of water , a bigger problem if you 're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast . My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end ( as opposed to side by side with this one ) , and it worked great . You 're on the right track , but keep looking ... stay with propane , but away from this model . I 've seen others comment with this same concern , so it is a quality control/product issue . C'mon Coleman ... build it US , build it right .	-1
I have owned three of these stoves over the years . i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model . The windscreens are cheaply , made , fall off the stove which then doesnt support the rear screen . Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid . The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it .	-1
The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions , I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED . I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing . Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating . The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating . For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it . For more advanced boxers , spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight . Wraps are not flexible and too short . Bag gloves are unnecessary .	-1
Not worth the price I paid . I purchased 2 of these mats in search of the Everlast mats that are like the ones in my gym . These look the same but they are n't solid like the old ones . They are better than some of the cheaper versions but again , NOT worth the price . If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make , this mat is NOT it ! I guess they just do n't make them like the older version . The original Everlast mats were n't made of sponge . Do n't know what they were made of but they 're much better than these and yes , my ORIGINAL mats are still going strong . I 'm not sure these will last very long at all.You can see in the picture how the vinyl looks wrinkled . That 's because it is and it does n't fit tight like the original . $ [ .. ] would have been worth the price for the original but not for this one , definitely not the $ [ .. ] they are asking now !	-1
Does not fit well on a large adult male head . Perhaps my melon is too large but other goggles have fit well , these are too tight . If you have a medium to smaller size head these would likely perform just fine .	-1
This was a once great American iconic brand , and it was the best insulated bottle out there . Not anymore . Does not have the insulating properties that the older American made models have and the handles are spot welded and cheap . Do not buy .	-1
The original model i was looking for ( 24oz food jar ) was sold out everywhere , so i picked this one up . I was impressed by the labeling that promised to keep liquids hot for 24hrs.First thing i did was a temp test with boiling water . 8pm : preheat bottle and fill with boiling liquid . Sealed Securely . 8am next morning ( 12hrs in a typical work day ) : Water is room temperature . I might as well have left it in a plastic container . The packaging explicitly says it will keep liquids hot for 24hrs and cold for 32hrs . This seems to be false . I did several leak tests , did the test all over again , with the same result . Water is cold by the time i open the bottle 12 hours later.I did notice that this bottle becomes noticeably warm to the touch after being filled with the liquid . For an insulated bottle , it seems to be giving off a lot more heat than it should ... i dunno ... be insulating ? Any time you introduce cost-cutting into manufacturing ( such as outsourcing to china ) you probably lose out on some consistency , which is why a few customer here have reported duds . I am likely the recipient of a lemon . I cant say for sure that the claims Stanley-pmi makes are false , but in my experience there is a large gap between the quality Stanley advertises and what it delivers .	-1
I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA . I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is . While it may look like the old American made Stanley , it is just a veneer of it 's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk . I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation . Do n't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago .	-1
Complete junk . As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI , the people that bought Aladdin , really have no idea how to make things . Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly . PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place , but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price . Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty , I bought a vintage one off of ebay . The quality is night and day . The vintage stanleys were truly built to last . PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys , but they can not steal the quality of the original .	-1
Now some folks have a fit if you write a review and do n't own the product which has happened to me . However I feel the main value of reviews is to try and get an accurate sense of the quality , reliability and dependability of a product before you buy it . Cost is also a factor as is most important ; the product warranty and how the company handles it.This product is a classic example of something I would quickly purchase based on their prior reputation.I have a 38 year old stainless steel foam insulated vacuum bottle that needs replacement . I said to a friend in the ice shanty & # 34 ; It 's time for a new Stanley. & # 34 ; However after shopping here I will have to alter that statement.Almost 30 % of the reviews are 3 stars or less which means a lot of unhappy purchasers who thought they were buying traditional American quality and not new Chinese trash.Like any wise buyer I am willing to pay a little more for quality and reputation but no stupid enough to buy junk . Thanks for the great reviews . I will be doing one in the future on the Thermos I will buy .	-1
Bought this for my 6 year old nephew . He liked jumping on it but when he would jump on it the legs would slowly bend inward ( into storage position ) and have to be constantly re-positioned . Returned it .	-1
I bought these for a seven year old who is learning to skateboard . These are not a great fit ( much too big ) for his legs , and the plastic dome portion just slips around . He also has trouble putting these on himself and it takes me quite some time to help him .	-1
These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself . I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid 's sized , but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing . The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight , and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically . The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads ... except that they are even tighter than the knee pads ; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off ... I 'll probably never use the elbow pads again . The knee pads at least do an `` okay '' job at protecting my knees ( so long as they stay on ) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents . I 'll never be buying these again , nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children ... . ( in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them . )	-1
This chain and lock 's price is consistent with the level of security it provides , however , it is far too heavy.The only claims about the chain are that it is `` high tensile steel '' . However , tensile strength is not how bike chains are attacked . Tensile strength means pulling , and many hardware store chains provide good strength for hauling and securing things against that kind of resistance . However , cutting attacks involve shear and compression forces , and the properties of steel are quite different for resisting these kinds of forces . Many things with high tensile strength will cut like butter.Low security has its place , however , this lock is the right price , but it is far too heavy . One can get an equally low security cable lock which weighs far less and is more compact . Or one can get a higher security chain ( for medium security , I would recommendKryptonite Keeper Integrated Chain Bicycle Lock ) which has a chain designed to resist cutting attacks.This Mongoose chain is too easily cut , and provides very low security . It can be cut with bolt cutters one can conceal on one 's person , and as such , it provides no more security than a cheap cable lock in terms of how bike thieves actually operate.The padlock is of low quality as well , and the one I have is very difficult to close as the tolerances are horrible . It is a big padlock of very low quality , and the chain provides very little resistance against cutting attacks .	-1
DOE . Did not work out of the package . Tried the provided battery first , nothing . Bought another battery thinking it was probably just old , still did n't work . Never powered up . Never displayed anything . It was returned ( thank you for the great return policy Amazon ! )	-1
I bought this for my wife 's bike because I am very happy with a similar unit from Schwinn I bought for mine last year . Unfortunately on this one the latch that holds the head unit to the handlebar mount is very weak and the unit will come off all too easily . Sometimes it works loose while riding . Fortunately when that happens you will see the speedo stop working and you have time to get it secured before it drops off completely .	-1
It 's ok , it does the job , but the problem is that It does n't stay in it 's little clip very well . Many times I 've knocked it out and it fell off or I was riding along and it was n't logging the last ? ? ? miles ? Other than that it 's ok .	-1
I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I 've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me . Right out of the packaging , this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable , but it 's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I 'm riding on a layer of wood.Also , the product description says that it is designed for `` spin bikes '' and does n't say that it 's made only for Schwinn spin bikes , so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike . However , it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it , even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible . This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs , which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I 'll continue to use this since I ca n't return it since I 've used it a few times , but I 'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand .	-1
The first time I rode my bike with this seat cover in place , I was really pleased . It was nice and soft and the center cut-out made it much more comfortable than the flat seat pad I 'd been using before . But as soon as I got off my bike after that first ride , I saw little sticky white blobs all over the cover . The gel was leaking out through the fabric . At first I did n't think it was a big deal . I told myself that maybe there was just a little excess gel in there and the leaking would stop once the extra gel had been squeezed out . But no such luck . It kept on leaking little lumps of gel every time I rode.Then I realized that the gel was not only leaking out through the fabric , it was shifting into the center cut-out . I tried taking a heavy needle and thread and stitching around the edge of the cut-out in an effort to hold the gel in place , but it did n't work . It 's no longer shifting toward the center of the pad , but it 's shifting everywhere else in every direction , creating uncomfortable bumps and bulges . I 've barely had the seat cover a month , and it 's a bedraggled lumpy mess.So if you 're considering buying this , I have one word of advice : do n't .	-1
This would be a really good product if it fit the seat on my bike . After reading some of the other reviews , I had some doubt about purchasing this item . A lot of people were talking about outdoor bikes and spin bikes , and how the cover did not fit . I have a Schwinn Stationery bike , so I thought maybe it would fit because it was a different type of bike . Wrong answer , the width of the cover is not wide enough and the length is not long enough . I was very disappointed . I am just going to detach my seat and take it to a bike shop where I can purchase the right seat cover for it .	-1
When they arrived I took one look and was very disappointed . One of them had a broken globe , so I 'll have to resend it out for another one . These were supposed to be stocking stuffers , but I do n't give people stuff I do n't recommend myself . The ones I was sent were gold in color and they do n't even look like a & # 34 ; Coleman & # 34 ; lantern ( Like the one in the picture )	-1
Hard to beat the price but I did n't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing . I gave the watch away a day after I got it .	-1
You get what you pay for.I needed the strap for another watch . The watch was cheap enough to order . My strap broke on my other watch , so I ordered this to use the strap off of .	-1
The AirZooka may be a *little bit* of fun for a very young child , but overall it 's a pretty disappointing toy . I have to wonder if the people who seem to have had a great experience with this toy actually were able to purchase one pre-assembled . That 's because once all the pieces are together , this toy may hold the interest of some kids . But putting this toy together reveals how poorly designed and fragile it is . And personally I really did n't see the point once we did get it assembled.One of my nephews received a pair of these on Christmas Eve . Good thing he got a pair because only one survived . I , and several of my cousins , undertook the rather embarrassing endeavor of trying , and failing to correctly assemble these . It quickly turned into a joke along the lines of `` how many engineers does it take to assemble a simple children 's toy . `` The unit is made of three concentric rings , as you can see from the product picture , that must be extended before you can attach the handle and a sight . The two attachments are kind of shaped like christmas trees , but have some small tabs that are supposed to attach to the rings . These tabs are VERY fragile and be warned , if you break one of the 4 there is virutally no way to attach the handle . And without the handle , it 's impossible to use this toy for what it 's meant to be used . The three rings collapse into themselves if you try to just hold onto them and pull the air bag without the handle attached.Somehow we were able to at least get one of these put together . The pay-off was very anti-climactic for me . There 's a plastic bag inside the AirZooka that you can pull on and release to shoot a concentrated gust of air . I suppose if you caught somebody off guard it might be funny . But how long can that joke be re-used ? My nephew seemed to enjoy it OK , but after 15 minutes had moved on to his other toys . Considering three of us messed with this thing for 30 minutes to get it to work , the pay-off just did n't seem worth it . I also have to wonder how safe this toy is . If that rubber band were to break free , I could see the bag and pully being launched at somebody.I am surprised that others seemed to love this toy . To me , the poor quality was strike one . While some kids will find sneaking up on people with this to be fun for a little while , this also seems like a one-trick pony . For me that joke would get old fast.If you have n't removed yours from the box yet , exchange it for something else . And if you are considering this , I definitely do not recommend it at any price.Good luck .	-1
To be honest , I really wanted a Burley trailer for my kids and I do even more now after having dealt with the Quick N EZ trailer for a year . Our first trailer we got for $ 25 at a garage sale . It was also InStep but I do n't see that they make this style any longer . It had a hard plastic base as opposed to the canvas most ( if not all ) trailers are made of these days . My son would slip and slide all over . After just a few minutes of biking with no suspension and no seats , he 'd be slumped down with the straps around his neck.Needless to say , I was n't going to make him endure that any longer ! So we picked up the Quick and EZ for $ 80 . We were pleased with how easy it was to set up and how quickly it folded down , though it still was n't small enough to fit in the trunk of our Grand Prix . We now have a Sienna so it 's no longer an issue , but my son 's comfort was immediately a factor from the first time he was put in it . The hammock-style seat is straight up in the back , so when he falls asleep he just slumps over and looks very uncomfortable.Not only that , but the airflow inside the trailer is a HUGE concern for me . After 10 minutes of biking in 80ish degree weather , he is beet red and soaked in sweat . Now , he is not in direct sunlight so that 's not what 's heating him up . It 's that because the hammock seat is canvas and because the seat effectively goes from `` wall to wall '' inside the trailer , there is nowhere for the air to go , even though there is a vent in the back of the trailer . We started putting him in shorts and nothing else to try to keep him comfortable but he still gets extremely hot . How can I enjoy my ride when I know he is miserable ? And you can forget about putting two kids in this thing unless they 're very easy-going and do n't mind being squished together . When I was a daycare mom , I would regularly take my son and one of our daycare kids who was only 4 days younger than my son and about the same build , and the first few times they did nothing but fight ! Sure they were two 2-year-olds , but can you blame them ? The hammock seat forced them to lean into each other and make them even MORE hot ! Would you really enjoy riding in the car if you were pressed up against the person in the seat beside you the entire time ? Not likely ! Aside from that major complaint , I do have to complain that the small wheels and lack of suspension make for a very bumpy ride and I also feel bad subjecting my kids to that . Also , it would be nice if you could only partially lower the sun shade to keep your baby protected . When we 're going in the wrong direction , he always gets sun on his thighs and sometimes even his arms if the sun is high . We always put sunscreen on of course , but if I 'm going to expect him to sit in there while I bike for two hours , I 'd like to make sure he 's comfortable.So , all complaints aside , the trailer has one big plus . It 's price . You ca n't beat the price , but you get what you pay for . This summer I am seriously considering spending one of my bonus checks to get my son a wonderful Burley trailer . Yes , it 's $ 450 and probably not practical if you only bike once in a while , but seeing as we bike daily in warm weather and sometimes 2-3 times a day , I think the price is justified to make sure he enjoys it as much as I do . Burley trailers come with large wheels with suspension , a roll bar , PADDED BUCKET SEATS ! ! with mesh on the upper part to allow for good airflow , and padded seatbelts.Yep , definitely getting a Burley this year ! I 've waited long enough ! ; )	-1
I learned to cook on cast iron 50 years ago . What they sell now as cast iron is crap . Good cast iron cookware is surfaced on the inside bottom then seasoned so you have a flat surface . This junk they pass off now has all the grit of the sand mold left on the inside . You would need a heavy grinder to make this stuff useable.IT 'S TOTALLY WORTHLESS JUNK .	-1
SIGG fed on our fears of BPA and profited as we bought their BPA-laden bottles . Punish evil ; do n't buy their products !	-1
Sound quality was on par with my $ 29 Caldwell units , and those run about the same size overall . having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me , especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open . i never got the one side installed at all , so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options , and if they were n't on sale , it would be a shame to waste the money on them . Back to Amazon they go . Next guy gets 2 free batteries , I cant get the things out .	-1
Got these for my husband as he was looking to get a new ear protection for the range ... had lots of good and bad reviews but like most things its best to test it yourself.First impression WOW very compact and super sturdy ... instructions were a bit iffy on the battery needed . they could specify its needs AAA battery but other than that its great . Tested it out real fast in the garage banging a hammer against metal and it was great . Tested speech which had no problems at all . Highly would recommend this to anyone.Now the bad parts . Took them to an indoor range wearing them outside the shooting area sounded great , walked in and hear a BANG from a 9mm was like umm ok . Kept walking towards the lane and hear another .40cal go off had ringing in my ears . Right away I got out went grabbing regular nr25 slim protectors and it was a major difference . You must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful . Also no light for on and off light.Buy something else . Only reason it got 2stars for quality of build .	-1
A piece of junk . Low noise rating and poor quality amplified audio . This must be a made in China . Hard to replace batteries . Not well constructed . Would not recommend .	-1
This is the third pair I have had . The first was wonderful , lasted 3 years and you could hear a fly at 50 feet . The second pair lasted about 8 months , and the audio was much less than the first . The right ear unit stopped working . Third pair is junk . The volume reduced after a couple of weeks and the right ear quit after 6 months . Buy the Howard Leigh . They are going on two years now .	-1
Update 1/8/13- Now having these for 2 1/2 years , I am downgrading this recommendation even more . It is incredibly frustrating that they can not do the basics such as having some kind of indicator showing when the device is on or off . Even without that , it should have a marking on the earphones indicating on/off . Lazy design , lazy engineering , lazy thinking . They really do n't deserve your hard-earned money ! I rated these earphones as `` okay '' but not great . At the gun range , they definitely keep the sound down , but it 's the little things that it 's missing . For example:1 . It should have an LED indicator telling you if the earpiece is on or not . That 's annoying and can drain your batteries if you 're not careful , especially , since each ear turns on and off . In addition , it should at least give you an on/off indicator , even it it 's not an LED ! 2 . The overall hearing protector should have an adjustable head band . Not all head sizes are the same . I have an XL head and this barely covered my ears.3 . Installing the batteries is a major headache , that they should definitely make more user-friendly . I have a graduate degree and this thing took me 15 minutes to figure out.Bottom line , for the money , I expect more . Either pay more for a better model or go elsewhere .	-1
The current model of these is not what they used to be . I concurr with current reviewers on this major point.I bought a set for my 11 year old for a shooting kit to go with his new Henry Golden Boy.I 've had a previous generation set for years and mostly like them for the audio and protection and slimness . And knowing the negatives of the somewhat difficult to change batteries and the exposed knobs often turning them on in the bag - with no auto-off - killing the batteries ( thus getting into difficult to change batteries ) .But I ordered a set for my 11 year old because I knew them well and he really liked the fit and feel.I could immediately tell they were newer - the plastic moulding is ( acceptably ) different . I could not , without fear of wrecking the ear pads with excessive force , remove them to put in the batteries . Period . Pads would not come off without risk of damaging the pads . I trued the usual grips and angles I use on mine that help - but nope . So while I figured he 'd have difficulty and need my help on batteries - I was n't expecting myself , an experienced user of these , to find it impossible to access the batteries.So when 3M bought this from Peltor - they ruined them . Poor quality control on fit and finish of pads and battery access make these unusable.At the time I bought mine years ago - these were both the best and only in their class . That is not so now . Knowing the possibility I had also ordered and tried Howard Leight . Those my older son and I really like - but their rectangular pads wo n't cover the lower back corner of my 11 year old 's ear/head . So I 'm still searching for something for him . I may give him my older generation Peltor Tactical 6S and get Howard Leights or another perhaps higher end model for myself to replace them.EDIT 3/18 : Compared against Howard Leight 's . The Audio is crisper than the Howard Leight 's . No `` spacey '' sound . The Peltors did n't have as much gain ( volume ) . The Howard 's only had that `` spacey sound '' with volume turned up.So I gave my 14 year old theHoward Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffand my 11 year old will probably get these ( my older model pair ) .3M / Peltor - what have you done with a gold standard ? Unfortunate but true .	-1
First off , these amplify ALL sounds , so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete , my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones , and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step . I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on . They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable , but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off , I got it at the last GoldBox deal , and I was *NOT* sent the `` 7S '' model I paid $ 99.99 for . I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $ 79 on Amazon , and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later .	-1
These Aerobies boomerangs have been a disappointment . The AerobieSuperdisks are beyond awesome . These are not in the same league . We have had a lot of folks try these with nothing close to a return . Now I am not Mr. Frisbee , but for me these do n't work .	-1
doesnt give a sharp edge really.. Cant keep it stable to sharpen evenly also needs to be 3 inches longer to be more effective..	-1
I would not recomend this . Couldnt get it to snarpen a schrade 5 dollar knife that I 've had for 12 years .	-1
made in china and did not say so in product description . should have done my homework due to the low price .	-1
This should be called a dulling stone . Have something to sharp ? Then this will make that no longer a concern	-1
Sorry , I 'm just not a fan . This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes , but I just could n't get the hang of it with knives . The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle . The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you 're trying to sharpen , rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks . I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result .	-1
I was hoping that this would take over for the double stone I currently carry in my pack . This was bigger and heavier than two small sharpening stones of different grits . I do n't use this .	-1
This scope felt nice and looked cool and everything , and IS VERY CLEAR when looking through it..the buttons/dials were all nice , seemed like a good buy , however i experienced the same problem as other reviewers with something coming loose during firing..returned for refund..you may get a good one you may not . but with amazon 's easy returns you can take a chance on it . Its such a nice scope , but not shock proof ? thanks amazon..	-1
Owned this scope for 2 seasons . Mounted on my RRA AR15 . I was initially please with this scope . Made in Korea , zoomed smoothly , versatile , stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate . After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart . That 's right . The crosshairs literally fell apart . The lens were fine , scope was never dropped or abused . Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered . Weird . I liked the scope I paid $ 79.99 retail , and it appeared to be top quality . It held up well . I guess too many rounds went through it . Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food . Maybe pay more and get something rated for more use .	-1
I bought this Bushnell Banner 3-9x40mm as an upgrade to replace a 32mm Barska Plinker for my 10/22 rifle.It had been specifically recommended over the Barska but boy was I disappointed ! It has a very bad fishbowl effect around the edge of the lens . All scopes have some . This one has a lot ! I would n't use it for anything other than shooting paper with a .22LR because the distortion is so bad.The magnification is wrong . On 3x it magnifies equivalent to 4x on all my other scopes.If I had wanted 4x minimum I would have ordered 4x minimum ! The image is very clear , but only in the center , and not noticeably better or worse than any other 40mm scope I have.It 's not a bad scope . It 's just that it gets beat by scopes at half the price ... I 'm really just upset that I spent $ 75 on this Bushnell to replace my $ 30 Barksa and the Barska seems better to me.My advice : stick to scopes either over $ 300 or less than $ 50 'cause you wont get better untill you hit the $ 300 mark ...	-1
Cheap , low quality CHICOM scope with even cheaper ring mounts . Seriously just save your money and get something better . If you want a decent quality rimfire scope for under $ 100 , a Nikon is a good place to start .	-1
The scope adjusted fine and held zero on a small .22 I was very happy with it until I realized this thing has major glare issues , worse than any scope I have used . Unless your hog or coon hunting at night it is nearly unusable . Maybe something was wrong with mine , idk , but for the cheapest scope I have ever purchased it is not really worth looking into .	-1
I really wanted it to work on my 10/22 breakdown , but gave up after getting it sighted in at 6x , then going to 3x or 9x . It would not hold zero . 3x went to lower left quadrant , 9x to upper right quadrant . Several tests convinced me I had a defective scope . Tired of messing with lower priced variable zoom scopes , purchased a Nikon rimfire 4x- no issues . Decided I did not need 9x on a .22 rifle . FWIW : I do not have this problem on my large caliber Nikon variable zoom scopes .	-1
You get what you pay for . This is a cheap scope with poor optics . I will not return this as I got what I asked for but it will either sit on my shelf or get tossed as it is not even worth the hassle of returning . Do not buy this scope if you are familiar with Leupold , Nikon scopes .	-1
Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a gps or laser rangefinder . This product does not work well .	-1
It 's a good hat , but it is POLYESTER not wool . I do n't understand how Amazon can allow sellers to lie like this . Again , durable hat that 's well made and fits well on most head shapes ... but it is not wool .	-1
If you install these end caps onto your bike rack crossbars , they will never come out without a fight . After coming out , they will not be suitable for reinstallation . The price needs to come down for this product to meet its quality .	-1
Here in Florida , we get a lot of heat , humidity and rain . After having my rack system and Q towers in place for about 3 years now , I 've now been through 3 sets of end caps . They always start to crack right where the molding injection point is , and just go crazy from there . I 'm definitely going to look into something cheaper , as I 'm tired of spending $ 11 on a set of 4 stupid caps .	-1
What complete garbage and huge waste of money . I put 4 of these caps on standard Yakima round bars . I even lubed each one up with food grade grease , took great care to be sure each was centered well and tapped lightly with the palm of my hand . ALL FOUR of these pieces of junk cracked - I could not believe my eyes . Like another reviewer suggested I bought 4 standard 1 inch rubber table feet which fit perfectly and look fine , with the added benefit of a bit of cushion just in case one gets a stray head bump . Yakima might as well be stealing your money - these are worthless pieces of junk and they should be embarrassed to have their name on them . I am thoroughly disgusted and if I had not already sunk hundreds of dollars into building my roof rack I would get rid of the whole thing just on principle . I hate being taken advantage of and even though it was only $ 12 it is still tantamount to theft - 100 % guaranteed to break - 4 out of 4 cracked caps . I would give negative 5 stars if I could .	-1
Spent a small fortune putting together a Yakima rack system to replace a different brand that had been on my car 24/7 for the last 14 years..Putting together and installing the the towers , clips , locks and end caps , I was really happy with the results..Today I noticed that one of the end caps had split from about 3:00 to 7:00 and was hanging loose..Checked the other 3 caps and found a second one on the opposite side that had also split..I have only used the rack once since installing to carry my cargo box for a total 24 hrs..The cargo box does not come close to the end caps so it can not be the cause of the damage..Appears to me to be caused by faulty design or JUST PLAIN CHEAP MATERIALS ! used by Yakima..I will NOT be replacing these with the Yakima product but will be looking for something different that I can modify to serve the same purpose..HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT..	-1
It was too big . I needed it for mic when I teach my step classes and it was too pouchy for me . Its perfect if the purchase is for running but not for an aerobics instructor .	-1
Good construction , but does not fit a small wallet . You 'd be able to put your iphone and a small set of keys in there probably .	-1
This is not for survival situations . It only lights up things that are very flammable . Good for planned camping but not something that is not planned you will not be able to start a fire . You ca n't start a fire with a blast match by things you will find in the woods. [ ... ]	-1
I ordered the 35 pound weights and tested it on three different scales.. One read 34 even , the other two read it at a 34.2 ... It was slightly less than 1 dollar per pound according Amazon , however , I think it came out to evenly 1 dollar per pound since a few grams were missing .	-1
This seller is selling these for an outrageous price and you should look elsewhere . Bicycle Source US refused to cancel my order when I realized how ridiculous their price was and insists on charging a huge fee for a return.Please go elsewhere .	-1
you get what you pay for I guess . My plates came with all sorts of dings and pits . Really this is probably the lowest quality plate out there . Next time Ill spend a few bucks more	-1
I 'm XL in everything else , but in these , the Large fits properly.Unfortunately , the pad seems to be one size , and that size is XXXL.The fabric is smooth and durable . The stitching is clean and looks nice.Unfortunately , there is a stitch in the very front and center , most of the way down to the pad.This chafes way too much when riding . It 's a severe design error that should never happen.Basically , I think these designed for women , and sized for men .	-1
Shorts are very good . They fit well and padding is nice . However on second day threads started to open . Perhaps I got defective piece .	-1
The reel is avarege in quality but it came with broken reverse mechanism . I bought it as a spare reeal and did not use it until recently .	-1
First let me say I am a HUGE fan of the OLD hit a way . This new one is basically worthless . The ad says you can use it on a pole , where this is true it does not specify that the pole must be 2 inches or smaller in diameter . How many poles do you find that size ? Pretty much zero . It WILL NOT fit around your typical basketball pole as they are 4 inches or bigger.The strap is long enough , but the velcro is not long enough for it to secure around a larger pole thus making it worthless.I think the design is so that you are forced to buy their pole to use the item . If you notice in the picture of their pole it is a small diameter item.What once used to be great is not worthless , Unless of course you want to go out and spend more money buying their pole and equipment to use it.Do n't waste your money .	-1
Poor quality , with cheap non-ceramic guides and awful & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; . A telescoping rod can actually be designed and built to fish fairly well , and Shakespeare certainly missed that mark , here . I 've found a perfect ultra light telescoping spinning rod ( see my South Bend review ) , but still searching for a longer , medium action telescoping spinning rod that is worth fishing with .Swing and a miss on this one !	-1
Had perchused one of these 15 years ago in a combo pack . That was a great little rod , i had cought up to 4ib smallies , then last summer it finaly broke . So I ordered up a new one . At fisrt was impressed by the revisions to the guides . much wider than my original one . I did relize that the pole was only 4ft not 4'6 . I threw on my little Daiwa Crossfire . I get to the lake to pick up a few sculpin and brim . First cast the rod snaped in two , right in the middle . Didnt even get to reel in the line . Just splintered and snaped in two . Only had 1/32oz weight .	-1
Too ultra-light action of rod throughout length of this rod . To fix that , I pulled in the last section of the rod to down into the rod & glued it there , making the rod not as whippy . Then I noticed the amount of arc/bending of the rod is same all the way down to the handle , which means if you wanted to reel in any small lure you wouldnt feel the lure , meaning you also would have a tough time detecting a nibble if using bait without a bobber . So you 're limited to just bobber fishing with this rod , & even then only if you had shortened the rod like I did so the rod would n't bend into a circle if you caught a small fish . Also btw the eyelets are all-metal instead of any ceramic inside the loops to avoid eventually tearing line , but can live with all-metal guides at this cheap price , it 's the arc all the way down to the base that I do n't like.On the plus side , the grip on this handle is nice comfortable sponge . Plus you can fit the base of any reel on this . The best tiny telescopic rods are the Pen brand of rods , way better than this junk , but Pen small telescopic rods wont hold any reel of yours..	-1
Bought as a cheap rod ( 4ft 6inch UL ) to keep in the car for impromtu fishing trips . Rod sections jammed in place the fisrt time the rod was extended kind of defeating the purpose of a telescopic rod ! Returned for refund .	-1
I do not feel anything with this line when fishes bite . i put it in a very light rod , and i still have hard time feeling the bite if i cast far which i do , the good thing about it is that it does n't tangle and is good line and good castablility but it has serious stretch factor which i find very very annoying .	-1
Nothing worse than getting fishing line and having part of it come off the spool in shipping . I had to reel off about 100 yards or so before it caught up with the issue . The spool is too small for how much line they pack onto it . It was packaged well , its just a flaw in the manufacturing . I got the 10 lbs version and it casts like knotted mess . I have had to hand retrieve lures because upon casting it gets caught up on it 's self . I 've only run into this with real cheep line . If you are trolling though , it is probably not an issue .	-1
this is not meant for hunting . i have no idea why people say otherwise . ok if you walk to a nice stand that is easy to get to and do n't stalk around.i hunt public land and hike about a mile to two miles in , sometimes trhough some nasty stuff . this thing gets caught on everything , and when it does it falls apart , the arrows fall out and its just plain and simple silly.i strapped it backwards to my pack with some paracord and it made it out of the woods with less pain . promptly returned to store.avoid this and save syourself headache	-1
I MANAGED TO BREAK ONE OF THE SET SCREWS WITHIN 25 MINUTES OF OPENING THE PACKAGE , I BOUGHT THIS REST BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THE GOLDEN KEY TM HUNTER REST I HAVE HAD ON MYOTHER BOW FOR 20 YEARS . THIS REST IS JUNK . I AM TRYING THE NAP 800 INSTEAD . ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH A RATING .	-1
This is my first squirrel call . It does n't do the bark , squeal that real squirrels do . I 've sat on my porch and used it while watching the squirrels in my yard , , , they stop for a second , then go about their squirrely business . I think my expectations may have been a bit high .	-1
The quality is OK and the bats fit in well . It does hold as many bats as it says however the straps are way too short .	-1
I might have to re-review this tool if I ever cut anything with it , but so far I have been unsuccessful.Amazon suggests other people have bought a slingshot with this tool , which I assumed was used to shoot the weighted bag over the limb . Save your money ... the slingshot is not nearly powerful enough to send this bag more than a few feet , especially when weighed down by the rope and saw . Throwing the bag by hand is more effective.When throwing the bag , be sure not to catch the metal hook on your finger , or it will cut you.After several attempts at throwing the bag over a 40 ft high limb , I instead got the weighted bag and rope wrapped around a limb of a different tree , and could n't get it loose . I ended up just cutting both trees down with a chainsaw to be done with it.It seems like a good idea in theory , but it did n't work out for me .	-1
Lasted only for 1 blast gave as gift to a friend and it let him down , when he needed it on his boat not worth the money or effort	-1
I was very excited to get these guides until I took everything out of the box doing inventory . The company failed to provide bolts and hex nuts . So I got to waste my time , gas , and additional money going to several stores to get the equipment needed to install these guides . They look great now that they are in place , but I found it unacceptable to have to get all the hardware for a project that should have been complete and ready for set up on arrival .	-1
I could make a better guide on using PVC and glue.You ca n't even tighten the support rail enough to where it does n't move because you 'll crack the PVC .	-1
I bought these to replace a set of side roller guides on a 18 foot bass boat . If you look closely you will see that they mount close to a 90 degree angle with little extension allowed if the side of the boat is angled . I had to combine the old mounts of the rollers I removed with the tubes these have to get them to work on my boat .	-1
I used this on my boat canvas and it make it WATERPROOF . I recently bought this for some canvas furniture covers and it let the rain water pass right through . I am not satisfied with this product .	-1
I was looking for an electric knife to make slicing my round loaves of bread easier . Unfortunately , the crust on my loaf was barely being cut by the sawing action of the blades.Maybe I was using it incorrectly . The blades sawed back quickly and smoothly , but regardless of the amount of downward pressure I applied , the action did not slice my bread.It was also much larger than I expected it to be . I did not try cutting anything else with it , since I only needed it to cut bread . And I did not try cutting a softer sandwich loaf .	-1
Your experience may vary , but even though I followed the instructions on the bottle , I did not see any difference in the headlight on my 2006 Mazda 3.I am a fan of Meguiar 's products but can not recommend this one .	-1
I bought this product to reduce the micro fine scratches in a collection of plastic welding helmet eyeglass inserts , that are essentially `` cheaters '' for welders.I went through the routine as described on the bottle , at least 20 times over a period of two days , on my first sample . These were nothing more than scuff scratches . After what must have been a total of one hour of work of buffing ( with an old flannel shirt ) on this same piece of plastic , I will say that there was about a 25 % improvement , at the most . The scratches are still there and quite visible.Now , each of these eyeglass inserts goes for about $ 5 on Amazon . Sooooooo , you do the math . Was I wise to spend an hour of work on a five dollar item ? If I hired someone to do it for me , I would be prosecuted for paying below the minimum wage.In retrospect , I have deteremined that there is indeed one scratch that this product will most definitely remove . And dat be the scratch in yo wallet , bro.Ron DiGiovanniEaston , PA	-1
This product is defiantly to strong for removing hard water spots on dark colors , cause it will scratch the paint or gel coat very fast .	-1
I used this for a while . Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did . One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it .	-1
It shoots like a field point out to 30 yards . Beyond that it is unpredictable . I have used them for target practice in the woods . I have shot them at rocks and tree stumps . They bounce off without damaging the arrow . I shot them at a large ground squirrel at 15 yards , thinking it would only crush it without causing excessive damage . I was wrong . It punched completely through both shoulders leaving a 1.5 inch entry wound and a 2.5 inch exit . I had planed to use these on grouse , but now I am not sure they wo n't destroy them . I also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads . The slip on stopped on impact , and the arrow punched through the rubber . So this broadhead is better then those slip on , but I 'm not sure rubber is the way to go .	-1
The concept of an emergency use toilet at a reasonable price sounded great . The product took over a week to be delivered and is made for Tinkerbell 's Butt . It is built from very cheap plastic and the lid will not open all the way , so you have to crouch at a very uncomfortable angle or break the lid off the hinge ... which I am sure will happen in its first use.There are better products out there ... Skip this one unless it is a backup for your real backup .	-1
this rod is heavy to handle , the rod 's `` ceramic guide inserts '' easily break.the rod gets stuck when put together.needless to say save your money , pay a bit extra & get a better rod like the Daiwa beefstick.you do n't need any rod longer than 11 or 12 ft . I ended up returning it to amazon after a nasty cut on my hand due to ceramic guides breaking .	-1
not happy with it , I purchase two of this rods , reach scratched so its not the best deal I done here	-1
Leaked right from the start from around the valve on/off or the 1/8 fitting so back it goes . Looked well made and stout though !	-1
If I could give this zero stars I would . The product looked unfinished and had a couple of gouges in it . Not worth the hassle of returning it so I 'll just use it as is . It is possible that the product suffered the gouges during shipping but the rest of the defects can only be attributed to poor quality control . Do n't think I 'll be buying anything from TYR again .	-1
Frame distorts , screws fall out , top lid wo n't lock ( because frame is distorted ) , and the handles pop out or their attachment point . What 's not to like !	-1
these poles do n't stay together , in order for them to be able to come apart -- - they come apart when fishing too ... .I need to find a collapsible pole -- not this one =0 ( the reel was descent though =0 )	-1
the mask is fairly small , appears to be cheaply made especially the rubber strap - this strap will not stand the test of time . had i actually seen it in the hardware store i never would have bought , particularly at the near to $ 15 price . To me , the price/value would be more apt in the $ 8 range . It certainly does not look like the pic on amazon - the pic makes it appear larger than it is , the surface area of the filter hence will be limited in it 's ability to handle larger volumnes of air over time- but then they want you to buy replacement filters faster .	-1
Does not hold the ammo locked in place so you can load it , we do n't even use it any more , this was a waist	-1
I had to alter my grip to make this work for me . I have a model 642 with rubber grip . the wood grip models would work unmodified .	-1
The speed loader is great , but my wife 's Taurus 85 cylinder will not swing-out far enough for proper operation without hanging on the cylinder release lever . This was listed for my wife 's gun , but will not work with it , unless you get used to dropping the rounds into the cylinder at an angle . Very klutzy operation . Useless , really .	-1
Its a nice simple speed loader , however it do not fit my Taurus 605 very well . I do n't think it would be easy in an emergency situation to reload . Hope my aim is good : )	-1
The speedloader seems like a good product in terms of quality and function , but it does not fit my revolver . The website does not specify which models this speedloader does and does not fit . I purchased this speedloader for my standard .38 S & W ; Model 442 Airweight . The gun is plain old normal factory specs from the manufacturer , no after market parts , no customization , etc . The speedloader does n't even feed in half way to the cylinder before it gets stuck . You may want to do some research on this item to fitting your gun before you go through the hassle of ordering and returning.The ad on the website does not provide the information , but now that I have the item in front of me , I can tell you what is says . This item on amazon is for a : HKS Speedloader , model 36-A . The packaging says it fits 5 shot , .38 Special , S & W ; models 36 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 49 , 60 // Charter Arms // Taurus 85 .	-1
Even though this states it works on Taurus Model 85 , the cylinder really does not swing out enough for this to be useful . I can load manually much faster . Also , I found the mechanism that locks the rounds in place is hard to use and awkward . For 5 round cylinders , I say you are better manually loading .	-1
First off this review is just about the loader , not the supplier . THIS THING WILL NOT FIT THE COLT 38 DET SPECIAL . It is too big to get lined up with the cylinder because it is agenst the frame of the gun . It will only allow the tips of 4 out of six of the bullets to be placed in the cylinder then you have to relice the bullets and guide them in the rest of the way after you move the speed loader out of the way . DO N'T BUY IT FOR THIS GUN .	-1
HKS Revolver Speedloader for S & W ; 25-5/Taurus .45 Raging BullIt 's a good product . But , they sent me the wrong ones . The Taurus comes in both 6 round and 5 round variants . I met a guy at the range who gave me the info on what he ordered . His were 5 round speed-loaders . They sent me 6 round speed-loaders . I note from another reviewer that this has happened before . Like the earlier reviewer , I now have to return them . There is not a contact the seller link on this products page . Too bad . I might have been able to get the right information the first time ! Hey Amazon , you can certainly fix this !	-1
Its a good product if they would have sent the right ones they are supposed to be 5 shot loaders instead they sent 6 shot loaders which do no justice for a revolver that holds 5 rounds lol needless to say i have to send back ordred this same item 5 weeks ago and got 5 shot speeedloaders so i orderred 3 more and they send 6 shot loaders go figure	-1
I wanted a speed loader , but this was not a good choice or something , I ca n't get the ammo to stay put or hold till you put the ammo in it does n't hold the ammo , : - (	-1
I have been using HKS speedloaders for over 30 years and recently purchased two HKS-586-A 's to fit a revolver I just purchased . What a disappontment I received . They were much lighter in weight than my older models , and the signature `` click '' that assured me that my rounds were firmly secure in the loader was pathetically anemic at best , and THAT was after I had to jiggle the rounds just to get the casings to secure with the holding teeth . When I twisted the securing knob , it would just jam with the shell casings and not smoothly lock the rounds in place . I tried the second speedloader to see if perhaps I had just received a lemon , and sure enough , the other loader was no better . So here I am with two speedloaders that bind with my rounds while trying to secure them in place , and once I jiggle them and do get them secured , the weak tension from the ball bearing that secures them , leaves me feeling less than confident that the slightest bump of the knob would n't send my rounds cascading to the floor , and probably at a most inopportune time . Very disappointed HKS . You really cheaped out what was a great design . Guess I will have to re-think the Safariland II loaders . I would return these two POS 's but it is not worth the effort . I am going to send this evaluation to HKS and see if or how they respond . Interestingly enough , for a company that prides themself on customer satifaction and quality , they have not means to contact them . Their home pages just says : `` Contact your retailer . '' Thanks HKS for dodging the feedback bullet from a loyal customer .	-1
This is a tiny , flimsy case that does n't fit a single speedloader I own . Totally worthless to me . Would not purchase again even if I did have a speedloader that fit .	-1
eCop never even sent the items and had the nerve to have me start the process through 'UPS ' for the lost items that they never sent ! I wo n't lie for them or anyone else , the nerve ! I contacted them as soon as I got the delivery but only one item was in their very large shipping box . After a few months they wrote me to say they ca n't and wo n't start the paperwork with UPS because it would be harder for me to get a refund from UPS using a 'lost ' shipping item . They never sent the item and they want me to lie to UPS shipping for them ! I wo n't lie for anybody . I really hate being ripped off , but I 'll give the 10+ for the name 'eCop ' it kinda sounds like an honest little ma & pa shop . What a load of Bull ... .I still ca n't believe they wanted me to lie to UPS and Amazon for them . Again I want anyone who might want to buy from them BEWARE of a scam and do n't spend much on any item you want , instead of that just roll up the money and burn it over the stove .	-1
Bear Creek makes much better loaders , as long as you get the right caliber . This one works , but not as nicely IMHO	-1
Will NOT fit the XDS 9mm single stack . You would think that the sellers would have known this , especially since it is a very popular modelversus something old and obscure . I would suggest that they simply post a picture of the back of the packaging , it shows which magazines each model made by HKS will accommodate .	-1
The HKS works on my .45 1911 magazines but you have to push the rounds back with your thumb and the loader is plastic construction so it flexes especially at the thumb lever . This is not the best loader I 've used ( UPLULA is best ) but it is the cheapest at about half the price of the UpLULA . If you want something cheap get the HKS but if you want something that works best spend the extra bucks and get the UpLULA by Butler Creek .	-1
Read the application guide close ... very close . There are very few magazines that this will fit . I have a few that were listed on the guide , but as of yet it 's nothing more than a piece of plastic without a purpose taking up space in a junk drawer .	-1
Purchased this for my wifes 380 and she has used it a few times to try to get used to it but essentially it has proved worthless .	-1
My gym has a few of these jump ropes with the plastic tube sections on a rope . This is a cheap knockoff , not the quality of the other jump ropes that I 've used . I 'm disappointed in it , sending it back . Sigh ... .	-1
Case was mislead because the picture does not show the clips . The case so far has no technical problems , it is however just not what I expected . It 's small , but cheaply made , the clip mechanism is a snap-like action with no folds , so it reminds me of how ammo cases are folded . The package also took long to arrive . The case is overpriced for the quality , but nonetheless it has n't broke down yetEDIT : after a year of using this case . I regret buying it . and should 've coughed up 2 extra dollars for a much better , more durable and reliable case . this case dries up my pistol , so do not use this if you have a metal frame gun . i hate this case and have been using it to hold my art supplies instead .	-1
plastic hinge and case lock tabs are very thinmay be good for weekend use but every day use is not a good betget one with sliding locks and a wire - cylinder hingereturned for one that has above and was less expensive	-1
THE PICTURE SHOWS A 1911 IN THE CASE . IT WIL FIT A 1911 BUT IT IS A BOOGER TO GET THE MAGAZINE IN AND CLOSE THE CASE . I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE PRODUCTS ( I BOUGHT TWO ) BUT IT IS TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE . I 'LL USE THEM FOR SOMETHING .	-1
These are some type of polyester ( ? ) they just do n't work as well as cotton . It 's nice having the patches cut to size but the bulk cotton patches work much better .	-1
The reviews here seem to be written by kind gentlemen who do n't wish to sound harsh . But what they do say is quite a problem . These Hoppe 's patches are way too small for the bores they say they are deigned for . These Hoppe 's patches look like the same as the & # 34 ; Outers & # 34 ; brand 17/.22 caliber patches but Hoppe 's must be much thinner . I needed THREE .22/.270 caliber Hoppe 's patches for each pass in my .223 caliber rifle . And I needed two and one half patches of the Hoppe 's .270/.38 caliber patches to fit my .308 rifle . These tiny patches will cost you much more in the long run than the superior cotton patches from & # 34 ; Pro-Shot & # 34 ; that are sold here . If the Amazon word search here for & # 34 ; gun patches & # 34 ; ( ? ) had shown the available Pro-Shot brands , I definitely would have ordered them and been very happy . As it is , I am not that pleased . Go for the Outers ( better ) or ProShot ( best ) brands .	-1
These patches are way too thin . I even doubled up with two patches and goes through the barrel too easily . You 'll end up using more patches than the cloth type patches so you 're not saving any money and spend more time and effort to clean your .223/5.56 rifle . I do not recommend these patches .	-1
These are not my cup of tea , but it might be your 's . It just does n't seem to do the job or the way I like to do it with cotton or flannel patches . To me it seems too thin to do a good job .	-1
I needed some smaller patches for my 22 and these are just too small to be effective for cleaning the barrel because they slide right through . I would not purchase again .	-1
Very flimsy . Requires dozens for one cleaning . Very loose in the barrel of my 5.56 . These are also not very absorbent .	-1
These patches are thin and shed and tear easily . If I would have known what I have know now I would have spent my money the first time on the Allen Patches . AVOID	-1
I will no longer buy gun patches from Hoppes . The patches they sell are almost like synthetic toilet or tissue paper . They are thin , almost transparent . I prefer cotton patches , not this synthetic , or whatever material it is that Hoppes now uses . Go elsewhere and buy 100 % cotton patches , not this junk .	-1
While I have not used the Hoppe 's .38-.45 caliber patches yet , I just finished using the .22-.270 caliber size in my .223 rifle and the .270-.38 caliber size in my .308 . THEY ARE REDICULOUSLY SMALL AND THEREFORE WASTEFUL . I needed 3 patches to feel any correct resistance in my .223 , and 2.5 of the .270/.38 patches in my .308 ! Stick with the Pro-Shot cotton patches , also sold here as well . They will be far cheaper in the long run because you only need one patch per swipe instead of three . Pro-Shot is best ... ..Outers is acceptable ... ..Hoppe 's fail the test .	-1
I bought these because they were cheap and being Hoppe 's brand , I thought they would be good . I personally do n't like them . They are a fiber-like material and they do n't hold much liquid . I prefer cotton or flannel .	-1
Hoppe 's is an over-rated product line . Do yourself a favor and try something else . These patches are thin and rip too easily .	-1
Not made of cotton . Very thin and roof . Def looking into another cleaning patch for handgun . I wish I would have read more reviews . Lesson learned	-1
These are very thin and rip easy . I am use to having cotton patches and I will be going back to that .	-1
I ordered this on the 17th of April . It still has n't arrived ! ! ! ! Apparently , it takes OVER A WEEK to ship 1 item . Now I 'm normally very patient with these things , but holy crap people . It 's been 2 weeks ! ! ! Other than that , I 've used this product before . You 'll need to oil or lubricate your firearm after using this but it does dry quickly and cleans well . Generally , I clean with oil , spray this stuff throughout and wipe down , then oil again . I 'm fairly meticulous with cleaning my firearms though so you may not need to do this .	-1
One almost gets the feeling this product is no different than a widely used lubricant called WD40 which is a fraction of the price .	-1
it doesent fit , or at least not thick enough to really clean the AK47 bore , even when fully soaking it in cleaner and fully dry it goes through but not tight enough feel to really clean or pull all the crap from the barrell , at least doesent feel that way , comes out very very easily .	-1
Great idea for other calibers but this caliber requires the snake to be too small and when pulling through the barrel ... well the rope has a tendency to brake . I broke two of these already in my .17 caliber rifle . I usually recommend these snakes but NOT FOR THIS CALIBER !	-1
I could not really figure out what to do with this , and it seemed to not fit my 22 lr barrel , I tried pulling it through and it would almost feel like it was stuck and I was afraid something would happen to my gun so I stopped trying . However , if you can make it work , I think it would work well for a quick cleaning .	-1
I bought this bore snake a few days ago . Went to clean my .17 rifle and it broke the first time I tried to use it . Wasted $ 18 on junk.Dont waste your money on this product buy something else to clean the bore of your rifle .	-1
I want get the easy way to clean my rifle . my it is too small for 7.62 / 303 and 308	-1
I ended up sending this product back because it felt cheap . And I did not want this cheap thing breaking off in the barrel of my AR-15 . I ended up buying a cable style cleaning kit from Otis instead . Thanks Amazon for the quick return !	-1
been using bore snakes ever since they were invented . bought this one to replace my 30 cal that was worn completely out . this snake is LOOSE in the bore and will not clean . my worn out snake cleans a lot better .	-1
There is zero need for a sprayable form of Hoppe 's # 9 , it is smelly and gets everywhere you do n't want it . There is no applicator straw , you just get Hoppe 's ... everywhere . Buy a jar and you 'll be happier .	-1
Subject line says it all . I would not buy this again . It smells really bad . It 's probably a good solvent , but ...	-1
Followed the instructions to the letter . Metal surface was clean , smooth & free of any solvents . Wiped it down several times with ethyl alcohol . Applied Black Magic with a Qtip as recommended and got very uneven results over the area ( about 2in long & .5in wide ) . Repeated it 2 more times with the same result - uneven bluing . Yes , It does blueing but I ca n't recommend it if you want a quality appearance .	-1
After hearing so many good things about Otis kits I dropped ( the not unsubstantial ) $ 40 on this kit . While it 's a good idea , I really do n't think it lives up to the hype . The bore cleaning procedure is effective , probably about as good as using a proper rod , brush and jag . But that 's about all you can do with this kit . There is no way to clean any complex chamber- the short wire tool is next to useless in an AR chamber . There is no toothbrush , only enough oil for one or two cleanings , and no room to put a good rag in the pouch . After one use I 've gone back to keeping a bore-snake , toothbrush , bottle of CLP and rag in my field kit and keeping a proper cleaning kit at home.The Otis kit is not worth the money , or the hype .	-1
I suppose that if I really needed a very small package to carry my cleaning kit , this would be a life saver . Otherwise , it seems like it was a waste of money . Traditional rods and brushes work fine .	-1
I purchased the Otis Tactical cleaning kit ( not from Amazon -- got a better deal elsewhere at the time ) to care for two 12 gauge shotguns , a pair of .22 cal target pistols , several .38 cal and .357 magnum revolvers , and several 9mm and .45 cal pistols . From its advertising it seemed like the perfect `` one size fits all '' cleaning kit . But it does not live up to the hype.This kit does come with some basic tools to clean all common types of guns , including the needed slotted tips and bore brushes . But it does not have the ( optional ) picks and brushes needed to do a thorough cleaning . That will cost you another $ 15 or so . Only a small number of patches come with the kit , so you should plan on buying more right away . Interesting , no one who sells these cleaning kits locally in my area also sells the Otis patches . So I had to purchase those online ( which I did buy from Amazon ) . The patches cost about 10 times the amount you would spend for common square patches . Even though Otis claims you can get 6 uses out of each patch I found you will drag dirty patches through your barrel if you try to get that many uses . At best you may get 2 or 3 uses from each Otis patch if you really want your gun to be clean . In all I spent about twice a much for this cleaning kit as I did for a similar comprehensive rod-based cleaning kit.So how well does this kit clean your guns ? The patches will clean your bore about as well as any other slotted patch system . But I find I can get the bore much cleaner using a jag and rod . The fact that you can pull the patch breech to muzzle is handy , though , for revolvers . But if you clean your gun the way Otis illustrates in their instructional videos it will not get very clean . If you dissassemble your gun you will find the breech end of the bore is not very clean , and the slide is filthy . You will need to scrub all of these areas with a brush ( which the kit does not include but sells separately ) and wipe it down with patches ( do n't use your expensive Otis patches for this unless you want to spend a fortune on patches ) .In the end , the Otis cleaning kits ( they make several but work fundamentally the same way ) are useful if you want to take a compact cleaning kit with you to the range or hunting where taking a cleaning rod would be a hassle . If you want to do just a quick clean of your bore without disassembling your gun it will work fine . It is handy to clean the bore of a revolver from breech to muzzle . If you think a Bore Snake cleans your gun sufficiently then you will probably be happy with the Otis system . But do n't expect this kit to clean your gun as well as you can clean it with full disassembly and use of a simple rod and jag with much cheaper patches , a toothbrush , and some solvent ( I usually use Hoppes and BreakFree ) . I have spent many thousands of dollars on nice guns . I do n't mind spending money on a good gun cleaning system to protect that investment . But you will spend a fortune on the Otis cleaning system and , in the end , your guns will not be all that clean .	-1
Well guys , you tried to build the better mousetrap and a darn fine job . OOPS , your main beef about the breach to muzzle cleaning just doesnt apply to & # 34 ; most & # 34 ; of the firearms as you boast . AND ONE OF THEM IS MINE ! FAIL !	-1
I wanted a paddle holster , the description even says , rubberized paddle , I got a belt holster , it does n't even look like the one in the picture . The belt loops are too small for any belt I own so I ca n't even use it if I wanted to .	-1
I see that this model is mainly advertised as an H & K ; pistol holster , but the title and description both had written that it would fit the S & W ; Sigma 9ve . Of course , it did n't . It could n't be THAT easy , right ? As you can see from the picture , this holster has a square trigger guard area . This trigger guard area is actually the main retention device , other than just friction fitting -- so it 's pretty important to get the trigger guard area properly fitted I would think . When I slid the 9VE into it , I had to apply a significant amount of pressure to get it in , and I expected it to `` snap '' into place or something . It never did . Instead , the seam of the trigger guard area spread apart so much that I thought it would break . The 9ve not only has a round trigger guard , but it also seems quite a bit wider than the holster trigger guard mold is capable of accepting . The gun physically fits into the holster dimension-wise , but the trigger guard does NOT properly `` snap '' into place , it just kinda spreads the plastic apart , which is not good and does not provide more than just friction fitting.I liked the idea of the holster for an inexpensive way to carry around a 9ve on the farm , but I never got a chance to test the product out because it did n't even fit the gun , mainly due to the trigger guard area . I did n't want to play holster roulette online again , so I decided not to order another of a different model , but the s & w ; m & p ; fobus holster may work , seeing as it DOES have a rounded trigger guard mold .	-1
This is the first fobus holster I 've purchased . I 've seen them in their packaging at some firearm stores and they did look kind of cheap , but I have been seeking a holster for my H & K ; USP 45 Compact for a while now to use as a home carry holster.The CONS : First I would like to start with the description.This is an area Amazon and their vendors need to fix . They need better descriptions and a way to contact the vendor for questions . If you look at the photo you see a paddle behind the holster but the main title says belt . I was under the impression you get both just like Blackhawk holsters . Well this one just come with a permanent fixed belt attachment . Ok , you know what they say about what happens when you ASSUME.Second issue I have which can also fall under the first issue I have is that this holster will NOT fit the H & K ; USP 45 COMPACT if you have a rail adapter on it . ( I have a GG & G ; Slimline Rail adapter ) . I was unable to find a review saying it would not fit and it says nothing about it in the description.Third issue : After removing my rail adapter , this holster does n't really fit this firearm well , you can see that it is very tight and the seem of the holster is just about splitting . Definitely will put wear on the finish of my firearm if used often.Fourth issue the mold has bumps and scratches all over it like it has been used.The PROS : Low cost for someone who wants a belt attached holster.If you own a threaded barrel , this will fit.That 's my gripe.Overview : I will be keeping this holster because when i received it I did n't bother to look and see the packaging was zip-locked and I ripped it open so this item will not be resellable as & # 34 ; NEW & # 34 ; .I did try some of the other firearms I own and my Sig Sauer Mosquito slides in this well however the sight clips the bottom of the holster when drawing the firearm.There is a seperate paddle adapter you can purchase for this holster right here on Amazon for just under $ 10.00 , but if you do the math , you are better off buying a BlackHawk serpa holster as they are definitely better quality as I own a bunch with carbon fiber detailing for my other firearms and they come with both attachments ( Paddle and Belt ) and cost is about the same if you buy the paddle adapter . Unfortunately I did not have enough patience to wait for one for my USP . I believe they just recently made one for it , not sure if the rail adapter will fit either.As information for some people reading this that is about to recommend a custom Kydex holster . I do have one that will fit with a light attachment ( Raven Concealment ) .I just wanted one that I can quickly slap on when I need one on my person right away for when unknown people are at my doorstep ringing my doorbell . I do not want to do it & # 34 ; Ghetto Style & # 34 ; and do a Plaxico.I 've been getting a lot of unprofessional solicitors recently showing up at my door ( No ID and looking suspicious ) and it just takes one time.. I will not longer accept that risk.Hope this review helps someone 's decision .	-1
simply did n't fit . i could jam it in then barley rip it out so i tried to & # 34 ; break it in & # 34 ; yea that was n't happening	-1
Fobus usually makes great gear , but this mag holder did n't secure to my belt with the paddle as well as I required . Having two G20 mags on your belt is challenging enough without worrying about them falling off . I do n't fault Fobus for this , but it just did n't work for me .	-1
I am 6'1 & # 34 ; and I could not get this to fit me in a way which was comfortable to wear . Ended up returning it and going with a Galco brand holster which is much more comfortable to wear all day .	-1
The one step is great if you can put it together . Trius should revise the instructions because you get it half together and find out the rest of the instructions are n't there . The instructions only tell you how to put the base of it together but leave off how to assemble the working mechanism . I emailed Trius and asked if they had an updated set of instructions . After about a week and no response I emailed them again asking why they had n't tried to answer my email . The response I got was & # 34 ; just attach the arm and the spring and you 'll be good to go & # 34 ; ! ... ... DUHI looked at a few of the other reviews that mentioned the same problems putting it together so I looked at the box and did what I thought I should do . I had a couple of parts left over and tried to figure where they went and I still have n't figured that out but it works.I 've put some fairly complicated things together in the past and the one step should have been easy . The problem is safety . The sling arm is made of sheet metal and when the spring releases it with a lot of force you would n't want any kind of malfunction . There are a couple of very sharp edges on the sling arm that should have been made smooth because they are razor sharp.Bottom line is a good device without the essential instructions and the worst customer service I 've had to deal with other than Centurylink !	-1
This bag is not what I expected . I use it to carry my Marlin 336 scoped back and forth and it 's a very , VERY tight fit . I end up having to close the case halfway and then shoving the gun inside . The case is 43 '' and the 336 is 38.5 '' so it should have worked out better . I might get something else ...	-1
You would think that something this simple would be without difficulties . Not so . I bought two and both required major modifications to the buckle before I could even get them open . If you have another choice , take it .	-1
The one that I received can only hold 20 gauge shells . There is no chance of fitting a 12 gauge shell through any of the loops . Good price and good concept , but the quality control does n't seem to be there .	-1
This is about the worse made sling that I 've ever owned . As soon as I bought it , and put it on my gun , it broke . If you want something that will last , look elsewhere .	-1
What can I say beyond , I do n't like this sling and I would n't recommend that anyone purchase it . The sling appears to be well made and it 's not reflective of Allen Company 's other products . The main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place . It does n't matter how big or small you are , it just does n't sit in the right place .	-1
This thing will not fit on any gun ... .the shoulder padding is unmoveable and comes nowhere near your shoulder when put on the gun ... ..I got a refund on this and they didnt even make me return it ... I threw it in the trash and got my money back ... ..This is the only item I have ever ordered from Amazon that I was disgusted with ... ..it is truly a POS	-1
This will work in a pinch but is not nearly as good as using a standard sling with hardware . I use it with an air rifle that I did n't want to drill and put hardware on . It has n't broke yet , but not sure I would trust it with a high dollar gun .	-1
When mounted on a shoulder harness the mags would not stay in with movement { running } except straight up .Not how I want to carry them . ...	-1
Bought this from Midway USA about a year ago . Before purchasing , I checked and double checked that this would work with my magazines . Upon receiving it , I noticed the mags were very tight and would almost pull the entire pouch off my belt when I was finally able to remove the mags . Not good . I thought if I left 2 spare mags in it for a while it would loosen up ... nope . I also tried a little Rem oil on the mags ; it helped but not enough . I also tried sanding the inside the pouches ; did n't help.After I tried it again this past weekend . I got frustrated and contacted Fobus through their website . Steve Palinkas ( Customer Service Manager ) quickly replied and asked me to call him and included a phone number . I tried about 6-8 times and every call went directly to voicemail . I finally asked him to call me using the number I included upon first contact . He called the next day and asked if I was using metal or polymer/plastic mags . I told him plastic ( polymer ) . His reply was `` it dos not work with the plastic ( polymer ) magazines ; only the metal ones . '' He said H & K ; does not manufacture the plastic mags anymore ; which I do not believe is true and I have never even seen a metal mag for a USP ( not saying they do n't exist but I believe the polymer mags are the most common ) . I said that was odd since when I purchased my weapon over 12 years ago , it came with two plastic ( polymer ) mags and when I purchased the Fobus 6900 I also bought 2 new plastic ( polymer ) H & K ; OEM mags . I also explained to him that their own website does not state anything about whether they would for plastic ( polymer ) or metal mags . He said I would need to contact the seller to try to get a refund . He did n't even offer to do anything at all like exchange it for a new one . I find it extremely disappointing that Fobus has the same terrible customer service as Uncle Mike 's . I will never even look at or consider a Fobus product ever again . I guess you get what you pay for . Cheap price = cheap quality . If you need a magazine pouch ( especially for a H & K ; USP ) I would look somewhere else like Raven Concealment or one with a tension screw .	-1
These patches are way thicker than the name brand patches.That means that unless you have a really skinny rod , you are not going to be able to push them through their advertised caliber..I ordered these and .30 cal . and I assume that they are cut from the same cloth.I could not push the .30 cal through so I had to use the .223 size.I will not buy these again .	-1
These are about 1/2 the price as the ones in my local outdoor store . They are also about 1/2 the quality , I end up using 2 times the amount if not more when cleaning . They are very thin and the threads come out easily . If your looking for cheap , look no further . You get what you pay for with these .	-1
I like the holster but it did n't fit my Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 38 and it is J frame . I have been told Fobus is one of the absolute best holsters world wide . It just did n't work for me .	-1
Purchase this to use with my 2.5 in .38 Special but it was not comfortable probably because im not privvy to having such a had object on my hip . Im more accustomed to leather rigs that are attached to my tactical belt..to each their own .	-1
Cheap paper , you 'll tear it trying to get it out of the package . The package that it comes in , is 10 times the quality of thepaper the target is made from . A tip for you friends : pay 5.00 for a bale of straw , spray paint circles on the straw bale ofyour choice of colors , then you 'll have a quality target that will last all summer . In the winter cover it with a large plasticleaf bag , and put it in the shed for next summer . Take heed to my message to you , I give you true and factual info . Thisis a fact , it is a s*** item ... ..	-1
I bought this for my son cause the price seemed reasonable , but when I got it , it was really small . Not true to size at all . My son has 2 other karate uniforms size 000 , and this one seemed to be made for a 2 year old , not 50 lbs ! I gave it to a friend who has a tiny 4 yr old .	-1
this item was very small- I purchased it for a back up for karate class . It is the same size as the label of the one my son uses but it is much smaller- tried to exchange for next size without a response . Will just give it to the school to use for thier smaller kids	-1
First of all the shipping cost will either be higher then the item or same price . I think thats why they have it at a cheap price to makeup the cost . The problem is , the 7 plus dollars you pay is way to much.. Same item you can get at the dollar store.. Hope this helps	-1
Not good at all , I thought the whole of it was rubber , but no , it was cheap plastic that was already cracked . Buy something else !	-1
INITIAL REVIEW UPON PURCHASING : I purchased this hand pump for inflating my bike tires . I am only an occasional biker , so I use it every month or two . Thus far , I have been very pleased with its performance . It 's easy to pump and makes quick work of my bike tires . Those interested in getting perfectly optimized pressure will need a separate pressure gauge , as one is not included with this pump.TWO MONTH UPDATE : I 've owned the bike pump for two months and used it exactly twice . Yesterday , when I attempted to pump up my tires , the entire thing broke in two . I guess inexpensive really does mean cheap in this case . I 'll be searching for a better quality pump in the future .	-1
Coghlan 's Magnesium Fire Starter is a failure of a product if your life were to depend on it to start a life saving fire . In general magnesium is a great method to start a fire and anyone who travels in the outdoors for backpacking or camping should have numerous methods to start a fire . I have used magnesium fire starters from other companies numerous times and they have worked flawlessly . The problem is with the Coghlan 's brand . I have experienced on three separate occasions with three different Coghlan 's magnesium fire starters that the striker rod detaches from the magnesium bar . For people that do not have redundant fire starting methods and are counting on this product they may be in for a big surprise if the striker rod gets lost as they will have a difficult time igniting the magnesium . It appears that the rod is poorly glued in to the magnesium piece . If Coghlans were able to properly secure the rod to the magnesium this would be a great product but it is too undependable especially for a survival situation when fire is absolutely needed.Due to the problem listed above I do NOT recommend Coghlan 's Magnesium Fire Starter . I have successfully used magnesium fire starters from other companies that worked great . Stay away from Coghlan 's .	-1
Dont expect all of the items shown in the picture . All that I received is the slotted cleaning red shown at the bottom of the picture . That item is acceptable and will fullfil the intended purpose . I mean , whats the purpose of showing the other two items ?	-1
I attached this to my cleaning rod and put a patch through it . Just as I started to turn a solvent sprayed patch through my bore , the threads broke off and almost left me with a useless cleaning rod.I was able to successfully remove the broken thread piece and salvage my cleaning rod but this plactic clotted end is terrible .	-1
I bought this through a local shop instead of Amazon , but I came on here to provide a warning to others ... PROS : - easy to install- quick to connect/disconnect- cheapCONS : - you have to cut the end of the strap off to install this , essentially making it necessary to always have some kind of connector.- IT 'S PLASTIC ! ! ! ! I used without any problems for a few months . One day after getting home from a ride on the highway I went to take off my helmet and the clip broke . I could only imagine being in a crash and having my helmet come off , or if it had come unsecured at 70mph and my helmet flew into the person/people behind me ! it 's VERY convenient , but I wo n't bet my life on a plastic clip again . it needs to be made of metal , not plastic .	-1
wanted to use it on my Icon Variant , did not fit , the strap is too thick for the supplied plastic clip , besides the little button on the strap would make it impossible to go through the supplied plastic clip even if the size was wide enough , same scenario for my Arai . I 'll be dammed if I attempted to modify my helmets to fit this flimsy clip because it does not strike me as being made of strong material .	-1
I purchased these for about $ 6.61 each after looking and being unable to find them at a few stores in my area . Well , after ordering them I found the exact same ones at the dollar store for , well , a dollar . So I paid just under $ 20 for what is really worth 3 bucks . I was uninformed about the value of these but the fact that someone would sell them for that much more makes me feel I 've been ripped off . I would n't trust a seller who has such a high markup on something . They may have gotten my money this time but I will never again purchase anything from them . In fact , as an Amazin seller , I may just purchase the entire stick of these from the dollar store and resell them on Amazon just to undercut these people .	-1
If you plan on doing serious backpacking these are not great socks . In really wet environments where wet feet are a fact of life these are utterly useless . Once wet , they stay that way for days literally . Very comfortable , great for dry climates or day hiking . NOT for wet environments at all . I 'm sticking with my old GI socks , they dry in under an hour by a fire and a couple hours hanging from my pack and are pretty well just as comfortable .	-1
I was looking for a pair of socks to keep my feet warm for road cycling . These socks are good to wear around the house and walking outside . However , for road cycling , they do n't keep your feet warm below 45 degrees temperature . Above 45 , they work well .	-1
I bought this for my wetsuits thinking ti would reduce the order , but no chance . Dawn dish soap works better and for a fraction of the price .	-1
My wife and I each received a scubapro cruiser snorkeling vest as wedding gifts for our honeymoon.Mine worked great ( size large was good for me by the way , at 6'1 '' 185lbs ) , but her vest lost air after inflating it.It still provided visibility and protection from the sun , but it was a defective product.The 3rd party vendor , LeisurePro , has informed us that we can send it back to them and after an inspection they may ONLY issue a refund to the person who purchased the gift for us.I do n't think that 's the proper way to discretely deal with a gift return , nor is it the way Amazon deals with gift returns , but they wo n't budge on the issue.I come to Amazon because they stand behind their products and have a very good return policy in my opinion . However , if you have a problem with this third party vendor , I think you 're out of luck !	-1
The length is amazing on this mat as is the thickness of it but after all that there is nothing positive i can possibly say about it ! ! I also bought the matching MatWare Sleeve which i had to return since i ended up sending this back as well.I tried everything i read and heard about trying to `` break in '' a mat and to make it stop being slippery but nothing worked on this mat ! ! Extremely disappointed i am just glad that i was able to return it and get a refund before i broke or cracked a bone or something ! ! I would never buy again nor would i recommend it .	-1
No offense to this mat , as I have only found one that works for me ( Lululemon black pro mat , $ 100 ) . I 've tried this and the pro-lite , and neither kept me from slipping , even after the salt rub down . I waited too long hoping I could 'break it in ' as directed , and was no longer able to return , so I had to give a $ 70+ mat away.My form is good , but I 'm just too much of a sweater , the grips and light texture do nothing for me .	-1
I think I 've had this for 4 months now , use it 2-3xs/week and I am still sliding on it . I love the regular heavy manduka pro , but it is quite heavy so I leave it at the other studio that I teach for , and use this one to carry with me . Not worth it . I should have just purchased another heavy manduka pro . There 's no reason to spend upwards of $ 50 or $ 60 because this quality is more like a $ 30 mat .	-1
I expected the neck warmer to be shaped in a way which would provide adequate protection in the back of the neck and less bunching in the front . It felt like I was being choked .	-1
Buy the Carhartt instead . This does what it is designed to do and it does it well ( keeps your neck very warm ) but the fleece quality is sub-par . It & # 34 ; pills & # 34 ; and just had a cheap , thin feel to it ... .I purchased the Carhartt neck gator also , and it is made of much better ( thicker ) material ... my wife and kids have them too and all love it . There is a huge difference when your neck is kept warm in cold weather ... it keeps your whole body more comfortable .	-1
I bought & will be returing back to amazon since it 's very flimsy . Also , dangerous to open & close the scissors .	-1
Having purchased Coghlan 's items in the past , I thought I 'd give this a try . It does have some good idea items , but quality is very poor.The good : the water proof bag.The bad : whistle with a pea ? ? cheap , cheap and cheap . Minor first aid items- band aid are cheap to begin with , not to include quality is just wrong period . A pencil & paper you probably have everywhere at home . matches , that are not water proof or at least strike anywhere ? 5 '' of water proof tape , could you spare it ? A rusty needle sticking thru plastic bag , cool.The not so bad : standard poncho , Mylar blanket , green light stick 12 hour , 2 fire starters , and a button compass , and smashed orange trail tape of cheap quality.String , rope , razor blades , smashed fishing line , snare , safety pins etc , just not worth it.Bottom line : you can put a better kit together your self cheaper with higher quality items . Or just spend the couple extra bucks and buy better quality from AMK or others . After all your talking about a SURVIVAL kit , your worth the extra money right ? ? ! ! Get a pen & paper look at different kits and write down things that you want or will work for you and just get them . AMK survival kit is the best put together kit so far for the money . I also am putting together my own to see just what a quality kit will run.This kit was smashed , sliced thru and the box was trampled during delivery , not to mention the missing items !	-1
bought this bell thinking it was for adult bicycles . It was n't until I was on the Autobahn with car traffic going over 100 mph that I found out how wrong I was . It turns out , this `` bell '' is for a tricycle for 2 year olds .	-1

I really thought that the number of positive reviews would have been accurate , but the bell which I received does not even sound like a bell . Something is dampening the resonance and it just sounds like something rubbing against some metal . I eneded up going to Walmart and buying a $ 5.00 & # 34 ; Cars & # 34 ; ( the movie ) bell . It sounds much more like a traditional bike bell.Save the money and time and just buy a cheap bell from Walmart . It may have a cartoon character on it ( for me it is actually fun ) but it is much louder , and really sounds like a traditional bell .	-1
This product produces a slow flow due to its design . I bought it because a reviewer said it fits a Nalgene water bottle . And it will fit some . But the flow of water from it is very slow . I would not but it again . I would not even use it on a Dromedary water bag . The water bag nozzle is good enough .	-1
First off , though I tried to follow the instructions , I wound up with some problems where the bunched up portion of the wrists around my jacket did n't seem to get properly coated , and therefore let water into my rain coat that I treated.It seems like I used about an entire bottle of this stuff on one coat . I may have over-applied it , even though some areas like the wrists did n't seem to be properly treated.Given that I may have had some mistakes in application , I am going to say that I was n't impressed with the results . After application , a couple of rainy walks seem to see the jacket start to wet out in various places again . I could certainly see a lot more beading than soaking , but after a couple rains it seemed to wear off.I was hoping to avoid purchasing new raingear , and I gave it a shot , but from now on I 'll just bite the bullet and get the new raingear . While this product may turn out to be ok for casual walks around the block or to the store , I do n't think it fits my needs ( wearing my rain gear on motorcycle trips in heavy rain for 40 minutes or more ) .	-1
I bought several of these rings and installed them without problems UNTIL the other day . I was mounting one lower ring on my Savage 93 bolt gun until it tightend up ( the screw did ) but noticed the lower ring still was loose . The other lower ring did n't have that problem and tightend up properly . I switched off the problem lower ring with another one ( same type ) and it did tighten properly.Being curious , I bought a different set of rings ( Leupold Rifleman series ) from a local gun shop and tried them . Everything worked fine and I noticed that the Leupold rings were beefy compared to the wimpy Weaver ones . The small clip that tightens the ring to the rail is thin on the Weaver and heavy duty on the Leopolds . Hmmmm ... . Well I ditched all the Weaver ones and changed everything over to the Leupolds . I hear horror stories about bad scopes , inaccurate barrels , my gun not shooting consistantly straight , ect , and most of the time it 's a bad scope mount or improperly mounted scope . I ca n't trust these rings at all.Look at the picture of these rings and notice the thin rectangular piece of metal underneath the tighting screw . Then compare it to a Leupold `` Rifleman series '' ring and tell me which one do you want on your gun.Price difference is twice for the Leupold but $ 18.00 for the good one vs $ 9.00 for the cheap one should n't be a show stopper . Weaver does make higher end mounts but this line is marginal at best .	-1
Nothing against the scope rings but they where not tall enough for .257 and I had to send them back .	-1
You get what you pay for . Honestly they are n't -bad- , they are innexpensive low profile rings that are good for a .22 or something , but they rattle to much with my .308 and my 5.56the main reason it lost an extra start instead of being average rating , is they are not only low profile , but I can not look UNDER them because of the bolt in the way and I bought them to use with a rail that allows both the scope and irons , but this bolt is in the way , even though it does n't look like it in the pic .	-1
The screw is too long , zero visibility even in daylight conditions.Rip off . Even if it the screw was n't too long , the visibility itself is no better than a bead sight . Garbage .	-1
Waste of money . I bought this bulb and it was defective . Contacted seller and they send a second one which was also defective . They tried to say my flashlight was defective . I explained I had alligator clips to the spring and post and the guy said the switch on my flashlight was bad . If your thinking about buying these , go to a brick and mortar store with the flashlight and do n't leave until it works .	-1
The P60 Lamp Reflector Assembly by SureFire is an incandescent bulb that serves no useful purpose in today 's flashlight market considering that you can upgrade to an LED light that will last significantly longer , is much more durable , and is up to seven times brighter than this bulb . If you use your flashlight for work and need a reliable light then stay away from this bulb as it can easily be broken.Pros : NONECons : - Poor durability . Drop your flashlight once and this bulb has a good change of breaking.- Poor bulb life . You will end up spending less money if you upgrade to an LED light which will last for the remaining life of your flashlight . The initial cost of an LED will be more but will pay off in the long run.- Poor Lumen output at 65 lumens . You can buy an LED upgrade for a 450 lumen replacement such as Flashlight Bulb LED Upgrade - 450+ lumens - CREE R5 Single Mode Drop-in - P60 design : Surefire , Hugsby , Etc.- This bulb gives off a dull off white color while an LED will provide you with a bright white light.Overall , I do not recommend this bulb and would highly recommend an upgrade to an LED light which will serve you better on every level . This is especially true if you use this light for work such as the military , law enforcement , fire service , EMS , or first responder .	-1
I bought this knowing that it will fit my surefire light , It does fit well ; the only and very serious problem is that the metal part inside will scratch your light every time you take your light out . I only placed my light there twice and I regret it big time . Unless mine was defective ( which I think so ) but either way , save your money and go for a cheaper one , definetly not worth the money .	-1
Got a new Surfire light for my birthday and was planning on purchasing a SF nylon holster but decided to go for this one instead , BIG mistake ! ! Overpriced , very uncomfortable and the retention clip broke after using it a few times , not to mention the big scratches left on my new SF 6P , terrible design , save your money and go for something well made , something that will last longer and wo n't ruin your light . Surefire needs to realize they 're no longer the only companies making flashlights and accessories , there are others out there making long lasting and better products at more affordable prices ... ... That 's not just my opinion , it 's a fact ! !	-1
Forget it ... useless item ... not at all on a par with the Balistol products ... it really did nothing useful I can see , and if you really want some ... I have half a dozen spray cans that I will not ever use . To be subtle ( ? ? ? ) , do not waste your money on this junk !	-1
These are very small and expensive . Two cubes would not boil 16 oz . of water indoors out of the wind.There are better fuel choices . I do n't get the 5 star reviews .	-1
I used 5 cubes and it did n't could n't even make 8 ounces of water boil . I would not rely on this as a main mode of boiling or cooking . Do n't waste your time .	-1
good construction but ran small and didnt do well after a was even though I followed instructions . Might be taking a chance here .	-1
It 's a great little mirror , but wo n't stick to my helmet . You need a flat area about two inches square , where you want to mount it . Also , the glue failed to stick to my plastic hard shell helmet . I would guess it 's fine for styrofoam helmets .	-1
Let me start with the mirror quality . Its bad . Its some reflective coated plastic which if you try to clean by rubbing will become very dull and unusable in night conditions.Then the mechanism for holding it is poor . adjusting the mirror to view the rear is pretty tricky and by the time you get it showing the rear view the ball and socket holding the mirror will become so loose that every time you encounter some road vibration you have to adjust it . The rest of the part is good . The arm holds on to the helmet . But due to its very poor mirror quality and mechanism I will not recommend anybody to buy it . Its a bad product .	-1
The mirror attaches to the arm by a small ball joint , which is very loose . It was stiff enough to hold the mirror steady while riding , but it was loose enough to very easily pop right out of the socket when lightly bumped with a hand while wiping my brow . It popped out several times , and each time , I was lucky enough to find the mirror part on the ground and pop it back in , until this morning . I have no idea where the mirror went to when it popped out , and now I 'm left with a useless $ 20 plastic arm attached to my helmet . Very poor design . I wish I had read the bad reviews before purchasing this .	-1
Bought this from my local LBS for a longer ride this weekend . I spent more time trying to adjust it than I did enjoying the ride . When I removed my helmet to stop for water , it was readjustment time again . I 'm not even going to try and return it since I threw the packaging away . I 'll just consider it a $ 23 donation to my LBS .	-1
I 've tried all the glasses I have ( which is about a million ) and I ca n't get a decent enough image that I 'm comfortable in traffic . It stays very well ( I could n't get the goo off the first though third pair I tried this on , then it got less sticky and came off the rest fine ) . It is super adjustable . It even seems well made . It just does n't provide what I 'm looking for . Also , was n't too happy that mine came with zero instructions on how to & # 34 ; install & # 34 ; it . I was n't sure where on the lens to place it or anything , which arguably might be part of the problem . I finally found a video somewhere online that gave me an idea , but either way , it 's not going to work for me .	-1
This only works on large glasses , such as aviators , or maybe larger.Anything small or snug to your face wo n't leave enough room.If you can see someone behind you with a flashlight , then you could use this in the same spot on your glasses .	-1
I have tried fitting this mirror on several sun glasses and ca n't quite get the area behind me and the bicycle rear area of interest . It 's tough to find sun glasses that have hinged area , beyond ears and head , to mount the mirror with good rear views . I now use mirrors that attach to a bike helmet and extend well beyond ears , head and helmet . This requires less head twisting to see cars tailing me on the road than Cycleware mirrors .	-1
My sunglasses look exactly like the one in the picture , but no matter where I place the mirror , I ca n't see a thing . This may work for some glasses that 's really far from the face , but it wo n't work for most cycling glasses . I returned it .	-1
spent way too much time trying to put this is the magic spot so that I could see . anyway its garbage to me .	-1
this thing only works if you weear contacts because the go in the inside of the glass ... sad to say i have prescription sunglasses and this was useless for me	-1
My product does n't glue well . The outer plastic got off after a slight rain . Hope this kind of thing wo n't happen on the other of you guys	-1
I bought this for my son . After a season , I had to replace it . My son , is not a child , he is over 30 years old so it was n't a matter of poor handling of the helmet .	-1
This is a cheaply made helmet that does n't fit properly , especially if you have a somewhat larger sized head . Even though this is sold at a low price it 's not worth it because of the lack of comfort . I is totally worth it to spend just a little more and get something better !	-1
After reading other reviews for this and people saying they had a large head and it fit them I pulled the trigger and purchased this item . It arrived today and I put it on , sort of ... The darn thing does n't fit my head ! I turned the dial to make it as large as possible and even at the largest setting it just does n't sit right on my head . And I 'm not a large guy at all.The helmet itself looks decent , but I have to give it low rating because it does n't fit and it 's not comfortable to me even at the largest setting . Guess I will need to run down to the local store and get a helmet after I can try them on for size.This adult adjustable does NOT fit all head sizes .	-1
I do n't know how this helmet got such high reviews.As mentioned by others , the visor is a problem . It is cheap and flimsy . It is made so that you can detach . The holes for the pins on the visor do not snap in all the way and just keep it on . The visor flew off twice today when I hit a moderate wind gust.The shell does not feel like it makes a tight fit with the styrofoam and just looks cheaply made.The only thing this helmet has going for it is the dial for adjusting to different head sizes and it is moderately comfortable . The Giro Indicator is similar in price and puts this helmet to shame .	-1
This fell apart in less than one week . The outer plastic shell came off without any misuse at all . It just fell off even though there were no falls with it and the helmet was not mistreated . What a waste of money !	-1
The helmet itself is of decent quality , not the highest quality but not expecting much more from a $ 18 helmet.After about 15min wearing it to test fit I got a headache . Returned it .	-1
Every day I look at the dust on this ball and wish for my wife 's hundred dollars back . She barely used it one time . I would use it for ab work except I find it very uncomfortable .	-1
By labeling this a spotting scope this will get a review as such . This is a horrible piece of junk . You can not see bullet holes with this beyond 30-40 yards with much clarity . And to be honest if a `` spotting scope '' that sells for around 50 bucks that cant even do that is a horrible piece of junk . If u want to use this with anything but a .50cal at 50 or more yard you can forget about it . Also do n't get me started on the tripod ... reference my second sentence.OK now if this was say a bird watching scope this would be great . Its compact , very light , easy to acquire your target , comes with a very nice carrying case etc ... But i would think in this price point you could get something way better.Note to self for the 100th time : You Buy Cheap , You get Cheap.Hope this helps someone else .	-1
This item is CHEAPLY made . Ca n't use it at all with safety glasses on and the sorry excuse for a tripod it came with fell apart before we even had a chance to try it.This went into the trash unfortunately . Save your money and buy something better .	-1
Bottom Line : I have 20/20 vision and I had alot of trouble seeing target hits at 100 yards with this scope using .223 rifle . At 50 yards it was acceptable and I could clearly see bullet holes . Other problems include very poor eye relief and focusing as well . This scope will give you tired eyes and a headache so spend another 30 or so dollars and get a larger more manageable scope .	-1
Claim : & # 34 ; Fits most guns , with or without scopes & # 34 ; Actual : No friggin way ! ! 52inches long . 4 inches wide . Does not stretch . Bought it for my Tikka T3 with scope . Length is good , the width barely fits over the rifle butt ... and there is no way it will clear the scope . Used it for another rifle without scope . Just fits . Barely.Solution : If you have any kind of scoped rifle , do n't buy this . Buy the & # 34 ; Tactical & # 34 ; version . The tactical version is stretchy and is made for the AR style . Lots of room , same brand , silicon treated . Fits perfectly on a scoped rifle . Fits my T3 and Remington 700 perfectly both with scopes.Here is the link : Allen Company Tactical Gun Sockhttp : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LTXV8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1	-1

From this product 's packaging : & # 34 ; *WARNING* This product contains lead , a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. & # 34 ; Now then .

I learned my lesson with inexpensive shorts.For short rides ( under 15 miles ) , these shorts may be fine . But I made the mistake of using them on a 65 mile ( mostly ) mountain bike ride . They simply did not do the job and I was really suffering for the last 20 miles . The fit was `` OK , '' but not great . The padding was sub-par at best . If you are a casual rider , looking for a little added support , these may be fine . But be careful if you are heading out for a long ride because these will not do the job .	-1
This is the 3rd cycling shorts brand I 've tried and without reservation the worst designed . The elastic in the thigh area is unbelievably tight but at the waist the exact opposite . I definetly wo n't buy any more of these nor do I recommend them .	-1
I decided to give these shorts a try . They are a disappointment . I ordered a medium and they fit like a large . The fabric is loose , however the elastic leg bands are tight and uncomfortable.The chamois is also sized weird . It is very small in the crotch area and provides little support .	-1
I read and checked the size suggestions , and even though I ordered what should 've been my size , it was too large . I have a 33 & # 34 ; waist and ordered a large ( which was suggested for a 32-34 & # 34 ; waist ) . It was much to large , and the padding was hanging down ... I felt like I was wearing a too big diaper that I took a dump in .	-1
i tried on the Velo Gel at a store and decided to order these since they were 1/2 off..bad idea they were very thin , no compression at all , and the pad is minimal .	-1
First , let me establish my credentials for this review . I am an avid bicycle rider . I typically ride 4,000 miles a year . On my best year ( 2010 ) , I pedaled over 10,000 miles . Each year , I do a major bicycle camping trip of about 700 miles . This summer , it was a loop around Lake Ontario.Before leaving on the lake trip , my friend and riding partner presented me with a Bell compass ( like the one described here ) that he had removed from an old bike . Because it was a gift , I felt obligated to mount the darn thing on my handlebar . I was convinced , however , that it was a gimmicky piece of junk meant for kids . I could n't have been more wrong . That compass turned out to be one of the most useful accessories I 've had on any of my trips . When we were n't sure if we were on the right road ( going through Toronto , for example ) it was a great comfort to know we were at least going in the right direction . Yes , on rough roads the thing jiggles around in circles , but on fairly smooth road it is spot on . Even when you do n't really need it , it 's fun to watch.I liked the one my friend gave me so much that I decided to order a Bell compass from amazon for my second bike . And that leads me to this review . The item I received was flopping around in the shipping box with two six pound boxes of rice that I had also ordered . The compass did not appear to be damaged , but when tested , it would stick in certain positions . It was unusable.Undaunted ( well , maybe a little daunted ) I went back to amazon to see what else was available . Except for the trade name , all the offerings looked as if they all came out of the same little Chinese factory . This time I chose the Electra based on a Shipping Advisory that read `` This item must be shipped separately from other items in this order . Additional charges will not apply . '' At least this time , I thought , there would n't be damage from other things in the box . WRONG ! The compass arrived flopping around with a heavy pair of metal crimpers and a bag of metal connectors that I had also ordered . Although there was no visible damage it did n't work any better than the Bell compass . This one did n't stick , but its internal magnet was so weak it just did n't have enough oomph to align itself to the earths magnetic field in a timely manner . It were as if the ball was floating in molasses.Whether the problem is shipping related or poor quality control during manufacturing , it 's a crap shoot to get a good one . I recommend you go to a local bike shop or the bike department at Walmart or Target and pick out one that works.To amazon 's credit , they have an excellent return policy . If only their packaging policy was that good .	-1
The navigation does not line up very well and the bell is Not loud at all { do n't thank bell it 's not going to ring that loud at all } Once again it comes down to cost to return an item	-1
I guess you get what you pay for . I was hoping to use this as a navigational tool . My bad ,	-1
Since I purchased both this and the Eva-Dry I will use this review to compare the two . This pales in comparison to the Eva-Dry E-333 . If money or space is super tight maybe this is a good option but otherwise the Eva-Dry is superior in every way except that it takes up more space ( it 's about 6 '' x6 '' x1.5 '' ) .Reasons : It holds 100g of silica gelIt has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hoursIt has a hanger attachmentThe window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the colorThe construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full	-1
This product lasts a matter of hours before requiring reactivation at 300 for 3 hours . That can become quite costly just to keep humidity down in your safe .	-1
I was getting ready to put these in my cart when I read that an adult has to sign to receive them because they are human shaped . I 'm supposed to take a day off work and wait for the UPS guy ? Forget that - you just lost a customer . Its reactionary bowing to libtard nonsense that makes us weak , and I wo n't support this .	-1
Great sized target with outlined kill zones but it 's way too flimsy for dangling on a wire at a gun range.I have found that if you fold the top a few times in 1 '' increments about 2-3 times you can definitely use it.Taping other smaller targets to it ( like one of the 100 pack gammo 's ) makes them useful but I do n't think I 'd buy these again .	-1
These are ok but not great . All my friends are using really nice targets that allow you to see where you hit from a good distance , not these . The only use I 've found was letting my grandson shoot his BB gun at these , he likes them cause they have the kill zones marked .	-1
I gave two stars because I 've had to make modifications to two Thule products to make them all work together AND you have to keep on shelling out money for everything to work as you want them too . Obviously , the engineers at Thule have n't tried putting combinations of products in play to see their compatibility . I have the Big Mouth , the Thule roof supports that it sits on , and the Thule fairing . I bought the supports , then the Big Mouth so I can haul my road and off road bike , and then I had to shell out for the fairing because of the howling wind noise . The major issue is that when you combine all three you have to begin modifying . Due to the straps from the fairing , the long levers that hold the Big Mouth and the long bike strap levers all get in the way of each other . To solve this issue I had to cut off half of the bike strap lever AND ( since that was n't enough ) I had to cut off the lever that secures the Big Mouth to the supports . In the end , it 's a good product made less than average because Thule obviously did n't try it with different combinations of their other products ( which you 'll be forced to buy - ugh ) and that 's frustrating ... for a product to be great it comes down to the details and no need for the customer who paid $ $ to put in extra work to make things work ... Thule has yet to figure this one out .	-1
I 've been researching spotting scopes for months now , and thought I 'd found the perfect combination of price , value , and optics - but it was not to be . I was encouraged by the positive reviews I 'd read on this scope from several sources , as well as the endorsements from major magazines ' gear reviews . After using he scope for a few days , I feel betrayed.The first harbinger of trouble was when I unpacked the scope , and part of the tripod just fell apart . Now , I knew the tripod was n't going to be bulletproof , and that it was a light-duty included accessory that would require gentle handling , but REALLY ? It could n't even make it out of the package before failing ? I realize that any scopes less than German optics like Zeiss and Leica are going to be made in China , Korea , or the Philippines . This was born out upon opening the box and being assaulted with that nauseating smell of Chinese rubber and plastic . Ever been in a Harbor Freight Tools store ? Same smell . I 'd hoped that paying what this scope cost would ensure a little better fit and finish than the $ 59 versions at the local discount sporting goods store , but everything about it screams `` cheap import ... '' Crappy cardboard box , poorly made case , and that smell , that nauseating smell.But it 's supposed to be about the optics , right ? So let 's see how it performs . Be forewarned , the scope is heavy . While this gives it a solid feel , it 's impossible to secure on any average tripod such that it does n't vibrate and quiver if so much as breathed on.I knew eye relief would be a problem since I wear glasses , but at the higher powers the exit pupil is really hard to align . I 'm used to dropping my glasses to use most optics , but at anything above 20X moving your eye any fraction from the centerline of the eyepiece cause you to lose the field of vision instantly . It 's a game of trying to find the sweet spot to be able to actually see through the scope.The focus knob , while smooth and easy to turn , requires about a dozen turns from close focus to infinity . Since I wanted this scope for both shooting range use as well as birding , that 's a major problem since the Ring-Necked ducks I was trying to observe were n't inclined to sit still while I fiddled with the focus for 30 seconds trying to get things even close.A peek inside the objective end with a flashlight revealed a scarily crude quality of construction internally . Rough nuts and bolts , gobbed with black paint.The `` soft carrying case '' is a crude canvas bag with no padding , but the dealbreaker is that the zipper is on the BOTTOM of the case ! You have pack everything in and turn it over , then if you 're carrying it by the shoulder strap and the zippers are n't closed well , your scope falls out the bottom.If I 'd paid $ 100 for this scope , I 'd have resigned myself to having to live with these shortcomings for the price paid . But at over 3X that , I feel like like I was badly misled.I ca n't imaging this being anyone 's `` best buy , '' and I ca n't imagine that a hundred dollar option could be any worse . I 'll never be able to swing a Leica scope , and I 'm disappointed to find that everything in the sub- $ 500 range is just junk .	-1
I 've used RCBS case lube for a while now and thought to try this as a time saver in case prep . Some say they use this without incident . Well , it did n't work out for me on my lee press . I followed the directions , still got a couple cases stuck . I will stick with RCBS .	-1
Very quick and easy to install . I like how I could adjust the height of the kick-stand in fairly small increments for that right amount of tilt while parking my kid 's bike.But the lever is too close to the bike frame and too stiff that my kid can not kick it down to park his bike .	-1
This unit was a little flimsy when I installed it . Got hit with shipping and restocking charges when I returned it . There are better units available at this price point . This item was exactly as described and promptly shipped .	-1
I wanted a slingshot to just horse around with while sitting in my shooting house waiting on Mr big.This is my first ever sling shot and I have a hard time holding it straight and aiming and an even harder time shooting what I am aiming at . The ammo rattles in the handle but who cares . Put it in you pocket.I shot at many racoons and other critters but can not hit what I am aiming at . Too me , no fun at all and a waste of money	-1
When I bought this item , it did n't list that it was made in China . I just now noticed and it 's too late to return . Anyway , I do n't like it for that reason . I have n't used it and it 's still in its packaging .	-1
This slingshot looks really rugged in the pictures . So , I could n't resist . But , when I received it and inspected it , I really do n't feel confident in it . Not only do I feel that it is poorly manufactured . I think it 's downright unsafe . I 've also tried the Marksman and Daisy wrist rockets . I would recommend either of those over this one any day .	-1
I originally bought this knife to replace my Spyderco Kriss that I was carrying in my left pocket . First off the thumb stud is not high enough to be usable for one handed opening , and the cut outs in the frame make it very difficult to clip to your pocket one handed . I eventually replaced it with a Spyderco Native , I am much happier now .	-1
This maybe the sorriest folding saw on the market . The more grrber products I check out the more I think they are no longer interested in building a quality product only a good marketing stategy . I think the saws in Walmart maybe better . comparing this saw to the corona , bahco , or silky saws this saw is last by quite a distance . save some money and purchase a Silky if you can . The difference is really embarrassing for Gerber .	-1
First off , I want to clarify I did NOT buy this saw from Amazon . I did however get it as a birthday gift and let me tell you , this thing is a huge piece of junk . Flimsy blade , does n't cut well , gets stuck in wood , bends extremely easy . The 5 dollar Ozark Trail Sierra Saw I bought from Walmart 5 years ago is 10x better than this one . What happened to Gerber ? They used to make good quality products , now they just make cheap JUNK . Find a better saw , this one is a waste of money and went straight in the trash after a few minutes of use .	-1
This is my second SOG knife . The first knife I own is the SOG Twitch XL with the rosewood handle . First , the quality control of the SOG assisted opening knives , I feel personally , is lacking . On my first knife the assisted opening spring was broken . You could not open the knife using the thumb stud . I returned it and received a working replacement , but I was not impressed at all with the quality of the assisted opening mechanism . The opening mechanism on this Twitch II knife is better , but I am still not impressed . Even after oiling and using it still feels slow opening . This knife is very over-hyped in terms of quality and caliber . Thumb stud deployment of the blade or using the kick tang is only slightly better than average and does n't have the authoritative snap like my Kershaw Leek or my CRKT Koji Hara Ichi knife or my Gerber Outrigger Assisted Opening knife . The blade is sharp out of the box . The lock back lever is too tight for such a small knife . The spring clip is excessively strong . Too strong to easily clip to your pocket , to slow to remove from your pocket . The build quality is good , but nothing exceptional , also non adjustable pivot . From all the great reviews , I expected a better quality , high performance knife , especially at this price range . Unfortunately , this will be the last SOG assisted opening knife I will purchase . It is just an average quality , average performing knife .	-1
I hate this knife due to the fact that the blade handle ration flat out sucks same as the flash the blade feels to small for the handle the only reason I kept the flash is its weight is nice and it carries deep . I ca n't stand this so I gave it to my father since he loves smaller knives and have n't seen it on him yet he continues to carry his leek that I bought for him years ago.The action is nice when opening and has a safety on it if thats what your into ... ..just get the leek its a much better knife at this size and price point .	-1
This knife intrigued me when I started looking for a spring-assisted EDC blade to replace my Kershaw Leek ( Kershaw Ken Onion Leek Folding Knife with Speed Safe ) . I had never owned a SOG before and thought this would be the best time to try one out . Being at the same price point as the Leek ( just above $ 40 ) , I thought this would come close to the same quality and life as my Leek , but I was dead wrong ... -BladeThe full flat ground ( FFL ) blade was what first intrigued me and brought me to this knife . I have always enjoyed having a FFL blade and was ready to have one again . The grind was perfect , as I expected it to be , and the knife came razor sharp in the package . There appears to be a slight recurve in the blade in leu of a serrated section , and that was something that also excited me about this knife.Lockup was where this area fell on its face . There was WAY too much play ( side-to-side , front-to-back , and up and down ) with this blade . I have owned hundreds of knives over the years and know there is a `` sweet spot '' you have to find where the blade is n't too tight to deploy properly , but is tight enough to get rid of most , if not all , of the blade play . This is not the case with this knife . After playing around with it for several hours , I came to the conclusion that the blade is either too tight to deploy at all ( not just correctly , but AT ALL ) or there is too much play in ALL directions for this blade.The thumb studs on this knife are actually surprisingly useful , unlike most of the knives on the market today . Most knives either have studs that are too small ( or too close to the frame ) to use to deploy the blade or they 're too big to put into your pocket without risking an accidental deployment . SOG has found an excellent medium where the thumb studs are big enough to actually be functional , yet small enough to not take away from the slimness of the knife.Deployment is sketchy . As stated before , there is either too much blade play or the deployment does n't work at all . There is no in between for my knife.I have not had the knife for long enough to talk about corrosion resistance for AUS-8 , and probably will not keep it long enough to find out . I have heard that it does n't keep an edge very long , but it is easy enough to sharpen . All of this is hear-say since , once again , I have not put it to the test myself.-HandleThis version comes with an annodized 6061-T6 aluminum handle , but there are some with plastic scales ( which I hear has even worse blade play ) . It has a nice satin finish and texture , which seems a little slick in my opinion . I ca n't get a great purchase on the knife , but the grip I CAN get is adequate for most EDC uses . The finish seems tough and durable , but time will tell in that aspect.The spine lock was something that I had to get used to again . In a market full of liner/frame locking knives , it felt alien to use a spine locking knife once again , but it was something that I was able to easily get past with a little practice . I was even able to teach myself to safely close the knife one handed within just a few minutes.The safety on the spine release seems affective , yet flawed . It can be used to stop an accidental deployment as well as stopping accidentally closing the knife when unintended , but it seems difficult to get to unless you use a fingernail . It also works in a direction that , if you 're putting anything into your pockets ( or do n't use a clip ) , it can be activated/deactivated accidentally.-Pocket clipThis area was the most disappointing . I have seen and heard of knives where the pocket clip can not be moved , only removed ... and now I own one . You can only carry this knife in a tip-up right-side position . Your only other option is to remove the clip completely . For the price I payed for this knife , I could have gotten any number of knives that offer at least two clip positions , and a lot of the time they offer all four positions . I just like having the option ... especially for the money.Other than that , it works like any other pocket clip should : It rides nice and low , it is n't too tight ( but I contribute that more to the slick aluminum scales ) , and it secures the knife to my pocket.-OverallI am feeling buyer 's remorse due to the fact that I could have bought , in my opinion , a better knife ( another Leek , or any number of other knives ) for the same price , or less , and gotten better performance from them . I am seriously considering taking this knife back to the store tomorrow morning and getting my money back , but we will see.The size of the knife is just about perfect for my hands and as an EDC blade . The SAT ( SOG 's assisted opening ) works and works really well , but only if you do n't mind TONS of blade play . It 's a nice , light knife that is also slim enough to fit RIGHT into anyone 's EDC routine.If it was n't for the blade play , lack of pocket clip options , and price point I would recommend this to anyone looking for a work/EDC/utility knife . But , as it stands right now , I would recommend just about any other knife before I recommend this one . It 's a cool looking blade , but does n't meet my standards for functionality ( at least for this price point of over $ 40 ) to be something I 'd buy again , or recommend for someone else to buy .	-1
I 'm disappointed.Just received this and a Spyderco Tenacious today ... the latter being GREAT ... also expecting a United Cutlery Hibben III Survival Knife any moment ... VERY excited about that one , but anyway ... here 's why I 'm disappointed by the Twitch II ... I took her out and pushed the kick ... it did n't go all the way up into locking position . I tried it a few more times , to no avail , and came to the conclusion the pivot screw was too tight . Well ... before I stuck my allen wrench in , I checked the blade for play ... and would n't you know , it was NOTICEABLY LOOSE IN EVERY DIRECTION . This pissed me off because I knew it was already pretty tight ... the only way I could get the play out was to tighten it to the point where the knife was basically unable to open normally ... Knowing I was already out of luck with this one , I still tried to fix it on my own ... tightened it up , a couple of drops of oil , worked the blade back and forth , et cetera ... I 've now got it where it flicks open like it 's supposed to , but the blade remains loose ( in both open and closed positions ) , and that 's totally unacceptable to me ... so it looks like I 'll be sending this one back to SOG , or more likely returning it to Amazon to get my money back ... It 's a good looking , little knife ... it was sharp enough out the box , and the lock back and safety were fine ... but even if it locked as solidly as The Tenacious , this particular knife does n't really appeal to me like I thought it would ... Regards , SKULLSPLITTER - The CEO	-1
When I attempt to draw this knife , the holster comes with it . I have tried several different styles of boots with the same results . I would not recommend this product as a boot knife unless you plan to use two hands	-1
It is very tought to pull this knife from the sheath . It has kind of a funny feel and balance . Not crazy about it . It does feel tough like it would stand up to abuse . Good for a boot tucker and not much else .	-1
I will just echo much of what `` The Shepard '' said about the knife . It 's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself . And to make a strange situation even more strange , the belt/boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location ... ..which is why I no longer own this knife . Rideing my motorcycle today , the knife fell away somewhere on I40 . I do n't miss it ... .Lynn Stubblefield	-1
The handle is to small the sheath broke the first time I pulled it out and the blade will not hold an edge I sent it back with in hours	-1
sheath is a littl hard to work and the blade is very very heavy and thick im sure it would work but too heavy for me	-1
As other people have noted , the sheath is worthless . It does n't even seem to be made specifically for this knife . I 'll be making a more durable one from card stock , duct tape , and truck bedliner spray . As for the knife , well , it 's ok , but still only a three-star rating for it . I do n't have big ape paws , but the handle on it is still too small . In a fencing-style grip , the pommel stud digs into the heel of my palm . The design of the blade shape leaves a full inch of blade from the hilt unsharpened , so it 's effectively a 3.75 '' blade with a bit of extension , especially if you like to grip it with your thumb on top of the blade . A much better choice for only around $ 30 is theCold Steel Kobun Black Kraton Handle . You 'll get a much better knife with a more usable blade and handle , and a sheath that the knife wo n't pierce when you insert it .	-1
I 've been riding bicycles and motorcycles for the past 40 years , wearing all sorts of helmets . Just recently got into inline skating and bought my first ProTec helmet with the skates.Apparently , someone at ProTec forgot that ( 1 ) helmets get HOT , ( 2 ) people SWEAT , and ( 3 ) the glue holding the lining and the padding and the helmet together needs to be WATERPROOF.Any store selling these helmets needs to have their HR manager write up the irresponsible buyers who would put this piece of garbage in their inventory . Yes , it 's that bad . If you buy this thing , be prepared to find some nice waterproof glue and reassemble your helmet when it starts coming apart . And it WILL come apart . Unless you 're an alien with no sweat glands .	-1
This is the Pro-Tec `` Skate Helmet '' . Not certified , but good finish , good materials , and good looks . Fit is comfy too . They run small , so order one size up . I normally wear a `` Large '' Motorcycle helmet , and an `` Extra Large '' Protec.It was n't disclosed in the description that these helmets do not meet any safety standards . There is even warning label on the box and on the helmet that the helmet `` Offers Minimal protection '' , and `` does not meet any safety standards '' . It does have some protection foam , but it is n't CE/CPSC certified like it says in the description.It has a great look to it , and is very lightweight . Other helmets make you look like you 've got a mushroom on your head , this one is form fitting and very light.Most certified helmets are a `` one hit wonder '' , meaning they are designed to absorb impact by destroying the helmet instead of your head . Now if you were expecting many small bumps , this helmet would work , but for preventing brain truama this is n't certified.Bottom line - Good comfort , light weight , and good looks , but not a certified safety helmet .	-1
The compus does n't work and the twisers broke the first time I tried to pull it out . Do not buy this item . Spend a little more and get a Swiss Army knife .	-1
Pure garbage.Compass does n't work at all , first time trying to grab the metal tweezers the black & # 34 ; handle & # 34 ; came off so looks like I 'm never getting those out again . Knife seems ok but for $ 30 . This is Far below standard . I 'm returning this trash	-1
Cool idea but not very practical . The knife is OK , but the compass is garbage and the bottle opener is useless .	-1
This item beside the steering wheel with a screw influence its operation : and if the item with the can opener open I canned : maybe I would rather choose starve to death !	-1
the blade is fine , the tweezers and tooth-pick rival swiss army , the magnifying glass ok , the can opener is too small to grip , the compass GET LOST.for the money , i got mine back `` returns are easy at amazon.com '' .	-1
The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the compass does n't work at all.the other tools work OK I guess .	-1
To be honest , I did n't expect much when I ordered this , and had purchased it almost on a whim . I was surprised to find out this is even shoddier than I foresaw . The tip/handle on the toothpick broke off the first time I tried to take it out . The tweezers are about par for this kind of gadget . The compass never could decide which way was even remotely north and the magnifying lens was distorted and not even powerful enough to get a piece of char-cloth warm , much less smoking . The blade is thin ( to be expected in a & # 34 ; credit card & # 34 ; gadget ) but feels shoddy and brittle . I have n't bothered to actually use it for fear of injuring myself . The only relatively useful item in this multitool is the bottle opener , and even it is too short to be used easily . It 's a cute idea , but it 's not worth the money at any price .	-1
In order to use the compass you have to remove the metal ( can opener and knife and tweezers . ) Which is n't a huge deal . The can opener/screwdriver is very small but also not a big deal . But the killer is how expensive it is , the only useful part is the knife and magnifier glass .	-1
It came broken , the compass always points the same direction on the tool , it does not point north or anything like that . It does not function.I never really planned to use the compass , but the fact that it is broken in a brand new product , means the product is trash.I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Good concept , bad quality . The compass do n't point north , and its hard to get leverage with the knife . You 're better off getting a low end leatherman .	-1
I bought 4 different items and they all were put in the same box . I got the other three items and batteries were not in the box . I am pretty disappointed that they were not in there and thought I got a good deal for the price and was charged for them and their shipping .	-1
Does n't look like Liberty Mountain has any quality control on this . 2 of the three aluminum panels were cut correctly , and one was way off . So far off , that you ca n't use the holes to clip them all together for easy storage . Come on , it 's not that hard ? Stack them up and see if they are all the same , for heaven 's sake . This should have never left the store .	-1
Bought this because I wanted something foolproof and easy to operate . It arrived with a pretty scratched up stand , but I want results so I did n't make a fuss . I did a couple of burn tests on it and got reasonable results : 10 minutes or so boil time on 16 oz . of water uncovered pot . It was at this point that I noticed the burner leaks at the seam between the base and the top with the screw threads ( not at the cap with the o ring ) . I am going to either not store fuel in it ( pain in the ... ) or try to use JB Weld as was suggested in another review.I will be back with an update at that time . In the meantime , please test the seal on the burner prior to using it . Put some fuel in it and turn it on it 's side and rotate it around slowly , looking at the crimped seam where the base meets the top . I hope this saves someone else some trouble.Update 11/3/13 : I went ahead and modified the base using the `` Modified Trangia Stove '' video I found here : ask.com/videos ? geo=US & q ; =Liberty+Westwindstovemodifications & prt ; =360 & locale ; =en_US & o ; =15527 & chn ; =retail & ver ; =21 & tpr ; =10I still have n't been able to replicate the 7-minute boil time in the video . I use an uncovered pot and I am outdoors for my tests ; those two factors are no doubt influencing my results . I did get an eight-minute boil in a covered pot , but that is my best time with this item.I did manage to stop the leak in the burner for now using some household cement I found lying around ; I 'll keep my fingers crossed for that , though I am still not going to store fuel in it.I 'll be back with more later .	-1
The shirt fit well , but the buttons are located in a weird layout . The top button was to high as it would choke me if I kept it buttoned . So I kept the button undone . By doing this , it felt like half of my chest was hanging out because the next button down was much lower . .	-1
I 'm 6 foot 175 with a 42 inch chest and 32 inch waist and bought a large . This thing fits like hammer pants for my torso . If you have an athletic build , avoid it .	-1
Was expecting a cork ball inside to make it sound like a real whistle but nothing there . Would not recommend .	-1
I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago . my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . wo n't be buying again	-1
I purchased these 24 days ago , to use for the spring Turkey season . I have been out approximately 6 times now , and have worn these gloves each time . Each glove already has holes , caused by the seams tearing . My hands fit these gloves well , so it is not a matter of forcing these gloves on or off . They are just poorly made , and I do not expect to be able to wear them for fall season.One glove has a large hole in the seam running up the side of the glove , above the size of a quarter . The other glove has two holes , each about the size of a dime , in the same location . The stitching is obviously of poor quality . It 's obvious to me that the folks at Primos are n't using these themselves , or they would have already seen how much junk these are and fixed the issue.Primos has come to mean `` cheap crap '' to me . It 's not a brand I trust , nor will buy again . This is the third Primos purchase I have been unhappy with .	-1
I love two things : cigars and golf . I always have to put my cigar on the ground , or balance it on the cart somewhere . I finally ordered this thing , which arrived in the mail super-quick . It 's also much , much cheaper here than it is in a store . I found it in a store near me for like $ 16 ! So , there 's no doubt that you should buy it here . My main concern is the size of the clip : it 's ENORMOUS . Like , ridiculously so . Are you going to clip it to a telephone pole ? It 's laughably huge . Also , to put your cigar in this thing , you need two hands free - one to open the smaller clip , and another to place your cigar . It 's a bad idea - in golf I 'm always holding a club or a beer or my divot fixer . It 's inconvenient to have to have both hands free . I just want to set my cigar down in a safe place where it wo n't blow away or get dirty . I see other options out there and ended up buying the `` Cigar Compadre '' because I do n't like this one.It 's OK that this clip is enormous , because you can clip it to anything - golf bag , cart , etc . But it kind of crushes your cigar . Over time , the small clip that holds the cigar wore away at the wrapper and caused it to tear and come undone . Also , once your cigar gets smaller , it 's really hard to place in the small clip and then retrieve it afterwards.This works OK but the ridiculous size and two-hand-design is weak . I would n't recommend it for a golfer .	-1
I have owned this watch for a little over a year . Style wise , it was exactly what I was looking for and it had all of the bells and whistles that I like in a watch . Unfortunately , it 's poorly constructed . Just after the year mark ( so I was just outside of the warranty ) , the analog watch hands stopped working . The watch band is also starting to fall apart . A watch of this price should last longer than a year .	-1
I bought this item on May 22nd and I really liked it alot until I noticed that the tabs that allow the bag to be positioned higher or lower were breaking .

The Chicken Teriyaki with Rice was one of the entrees sampled recently at a camping club taste test . Unfortunately , it ranked the lowest of all of the entrees . Nobody liked it.It had a sweet taste with an odd , off flavor . Both the appearance and the texture were unappealing , the flavor even less appealing . ( It looks like something your dog yakked up . ) The only thing drawn to it was the flies , which at least kept them away from more desirable dishes . We all thought it was awful , and none of us will be willing to carry this around with us for a future meal.Pass on this one , there are much better Mountain House meals than this glop .	-1
Watch out , this dessert has trans-fat in it . I have n't eaten it , so ca n't comment on the meal itself . I grabbed it off the shelf , thinking it sounded good , but then realized yikes , it has trans-fat . Why do companies still use that stuff ?	-1
Tasted ok but looked like soup . White soup with brown crumbs floating in it . If you get it , bring a spoon .	-1
This product is usually very good . However it is n't good when the expiration codes are passed by 6 months . I have n't had this happen but it is no fun finding out the stuff you thought was good to go is n't . Bad codes on items that have them should always be looked for before they are shipped . I 'm sure it is good when fresh but horrible when it is too old .	-1
I bought this and found it to be extremely cheaply made and not water proof at all , I would not recommend buying this unless you are looking to waste money on such a poorly made item not even good enough for a gift .	-1
If you buy paintballs online , there will always be some that pop . This runes all the paint and makes every one useless . Never buy paintballs online . Go to Wall-mart , Dick 's or a paintball store and buy them . Besides , these are not good paintballs anyway .	-1
Guide rod was accurate out of the box -- impressively so in my case -- and wow what a great concept . At 450 rounds laser stopped functioning . Replaced battery , still did not function . Gave it a whack , back in business ( at this point I 'm already busy ordering night sights ) . 50 more rounds -- dead . This rod was in a nightstand gun that saw fairly regular range practice only , with perhaps 10 % +P ( as if it should matter ) . Wo n't be buying again.A couple more observations : Battery cap is of poor design and flimsy construction , and is clearly a weak link in the system . Spring tension seemed far beyond Glock spec 18 lbs.Oh well . Absolutely a ripoff at 300 bucks .	-1
Bought this in April . Stopped working in August . Only fired about 50 rounds with laser in weapon . It is a daily carry sidearm.Positives : Looks like a good idea in the adNegativesA total pain to install.Flimsy on/off switch , easy to knock wrong wayBroke after 4 months and 50 roundsWhen you call the company , you are routed to the customer service line , and it just rings eternally.Total scam . Bad product . Bad company . Save your money.Btw , I own multiple firearms and have multiple laser sights from different companies . This is the first one that has had any problems at all . I read all the instructions , changed batteries , etc.When you consider that a laser sight can be the difference between life and death in a firefight , this company is criminal .	-1
What can I say ? Laser targets at about 2 '' to the left 10 feet of my grouping center ( yes , at 10 feet ! ) . Tried it once at 15 yards and was so disgusted with the fact that it almost was touching the adjacent shooters target that I swapped in the stock recoil assembly immediately ! Over a 2 feet off to the left ? Whah ? Factory alignment my butt . I wo n't even get into the crappy stock cap switch . I even ordered a new one ( and recoil spring ... and frame spring ) , just in case that was the issue . No difference . Wish I had a rail on my Glock 19 ( 2nd gen rail-less ) so I could find a cheap solution . No extra $ $ to be spent on another brands expensive and potential failure . $ 300 wasted . Avoid , Avoid , Avoid . Probably would n't work to save my life anyway . Better to invest in night sights . Wow , $ 300 . For junk . Unreal .	-1
Sadly , I am sending this back to Amazon . After trying it , the laser was all but useless at the range . The pulsing light is not the problem but the size of the beam is so small it provides no benefit at all . Compared to my Viridian ( so crazy bright you do n't even need the light ) and my Sig Sauer CPL-RM ( what a bargain of a laser- you can get it on Amazon ) it is just pathetic . The slide lock which replaces the original has sharp edges making it VERY painful to break down the gun ! The edges are sharper than the original Glock part . I know it is nice to have a gun to put in your favorite holster but pass on this one .	-1
I got this item fast , I was highly impressed at how easy it was to install . The laser is very accurate for me and actually helped me get better at shooting . After less than a month of shooting with it I started having issues . My laser would come on even when the switch was off . Then my slide would not rest in the proper position . I attempted to contact lasermax since I was 2 days over the 30 day mark and they ignored all my emails . I attempted to call and could never get a live person on the phone . I finally gave up and contacted amazon , they are sending me a replacement but this item has such a high failure rate it will probably fail again.1 . There is cheap plastic in the housing for the battery . If you shoot more than 100 rounds in a day the plastic will start to to show signs of heat damage , I believe this is what ultimately lead to the failure.2 . The spring causes a lot of jamming . Glocks are very hard to jam with any type of ammo , since I installed this I 've gotten at least 10 jams where I 've never had a jam before.ONLY UPSIDE : Amazon is amazing ! Even though I was past the 30 day mark they sent me a brand new lasermax laser for my glock and allowed me to send my damaged one back . When the new one arrives in 2 days I will take a picture to compare what the old one looked like compared to the new one after a few 100 rounds . If you 're the type of person that likes to shoot , stay away from this product . For the pricetag it is very cheaply made.UPDATE 7/7/2013 : So got my new lasermax and the battery arrived dead . I can not even test it to see if it works . I am completely out of options and the only thing I can do is return it for a `` partial refund '' . For a product that is $ 300+ you would think it would have better quality control . There is a ring on the front of the laser that goes into the guide rail hole at the front of the slide . This metal ring is really thin and will wear out fast . I highly suggest staying away from this product . Even if it works for you it will die within a few months of use . The thing is built like crap.Amazon informed me that they 're going to give me a one time full price refund for the product given my issues I 've had with the product and based on other reviews on here it just seems like this product has a high failure rate . Amazon saves me again !	-1
you can not see your bullet holes.. lesson learned.. do not buy black ! and paper too thin like others have said , flaps around . I ended up turning it around to a blank white side and put target stickers on it.. will not buy again	-1
These were not good for the indoor range ( too big and thin ) and outdoors , they are very hard to see with iron sights since it is such a large black area .	-1
This is okay for sporadic use , but it is a pain use for long periods . Its uncomfortable and the velcro does not last . There were a few instances where the velcro failed and the bow was unintentionally released . If used , please check the velcro before releasing .	-1
First time my wife tried it out she accidentally dry fired the bow ! Destroying a several hundred dollar bow is not worth the cheap price of this release . It 's too sensitive . To use it you have to keep pressure behind the trigger making sure it does n't open . When you 're ready to fire , move your finger and it will probably just go off on its own . No thanks .	-1
Causes shots off far left no matter how much I adjust right.The trigger is too sensitive . It is a hair trigger and just thinking about putting a finger close to the trigger will cause it to release.Comfortable on the wrist , but waaaaaaaaaaaaay too sensitive .	-1
Works great in high wind but flame width at such a high temp can be felt quickly on thumb while holding down fuel release.Uses up the onboard fuel quickly so if you plan on regular use during a weekend hike . You better bring refill .	-1
I have had 3 of these . They work great for about 2 years and then fall apart.They will repair the lighter if there is proof of a `` manufacturer defect '' and proof of purchase . But , you must send it to them and include a check for $ 20 for the repair . Bummer .	-1
Right out of the box I could not get it to work . I tried every configuration and adjustment . At it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake . Poof . It does make a good paper weight .	-1
I was hesitant to order this lighter , as every refillable lighter similar in style to this that I have bought has done nothing but leak like crazy . So far this is working great though ! Brought it to the river with me , stayed dry , worked every time , did n't leak . For the price , very good deal.Update : It 's been about a week now , I have n't used it at all since the first weekend I got it . Now it wo n't light at all , unless you hold another lighter up to it . All it does is click and spit out butane . PIECE OF CRAP ! It was nice for the first couple days , for the price it 's not worth it !	-1
This lighter does not contain fuel . You need to buy it separately . Smallest appropriate fuel is $ 11.05 on amazon prime . In case you missed that . Pretty important .	-1
This thing chugs fuel . I can not understand why because it only generates the smallest of flames . It may not blow out and it may be rugged , but as a camper , I want a lighter that 's going to carry a couple weeks of fuel and can help in wet light scenarios , not something that dies after a few uses and is difficult to use .	-1
The item arrived packaged in a cardboard box with little padding . There was a small dent on the bottom , but I am going to put many more dents in it before I am done . The worst part of the design is that the lower handle-ring is attached to the body by two rivets that extend into the container . These rivets are postioned 2-1/4 inches from the pottom of the pot . As soon as I got this pot in the mail , I filled it with water and put it on a napkin . Sure enough , the left rivet leaks at the rate of about 1 drop per second or so . The handle-ring connection that the rivet secures is oriented such that it provides maximum stress on the rivets each time the handle is `` pulled '' , and therefore puts maximum stress on the rivets which implies that even if the rivets were to be pounded to fit more snugly in the holes , they would eventually be loosened by using the handle . A simple band around the outside of the body would have provided a better connectionpoint for the handle-ring and the body of the pot could keeps its integrity . Alternatively , I would have much preferred the handle-ring connection to be spot welded in place ( no rivets ) or to not be there at all . Drilling holes into a pot for rivets does not make sense , expecially only a third of the way from the bottom . If you do use rivets , at least make sure they work . These rivets don't.I did not test the water-integrity of the rivets holding the bailing handle . They are located only 1-1/4 inches from the brim , and I do not envision filling it up that far . The bailing handle was pretty nice in that it was designed to hold the handle securely in standard positions of `` straight up '' and just above horizontal on either side.The pot is the right size , 6-5/8 inches tall to the edge of the brim , 5-1/4 inches in diameter at the bottom , with little/no taper going up.It weighs in at .7 pounds without the percolation stuff inside.It is .9 pounds with the percolation stuff inside.The little clear knob on top is clear plastic.The price was right , so I may experiment with trying to modify the design of the pot to eliminate the lower rivet holes.You get what you pay for . In this case , the price only covers a potentially nice pot that is ruined by stupid engineering .	-1
I measured everything correctly . Set it up exactly how the instructions directed ( EVEN DID IT TWICE , just to be sure ) . The thing came crashing down on my head after two pullups ! ! Called for assistance , but got none . Got rid of it already , i have a tower gym on the way . Really wanted this product to work , but to no avail .	-1
I definitely messed up on buying this . This device is NOT padded where it goes over the door frame , and therefore , it will dent or scratch the door frame with every pull-up . I bought it to take it with me overseas , and will not have time to return it . Instead , I have to tie around it two thick wool socks , so as not to damage my bedroom door.Since then , I have seen similar brands for this device that run for $ 18 at TJ Max or Big 5 and they seem to be better designed to protect your door frame . Avoid this brand .	-1
I had a 12 year old boat that I never washed or waxed the entire time I owned it . I did n't know I needed to . I kept the boat in Ontario , and I live in Pennsylvania . The boat was either in the water or in winter storage in the marina . So I had a very dull gel-coat issue . I bought this thinking that this would do the job , because it had an aggressive and polishing characteristics . I should have bought perhaps 3 buffing compounds : course , medium , and fine .	-1
COST MORE TO SHIP THEN THE PRODUCT , overcharged for a very small package , was charged $ 4.55 for a package that had less than a dollar postage on it . The description was right on and the time for arrival was great . Just the cost to mail it . In the future I will just buy generic Tampons to start my fire . CHEAPER	-1
They remind me of bore cleaner patch semi compressed.Save your money . Save some dryer lint . I asked my wife to save some lint but I guess forgot to say how much . I had a quart bag filled with in a month . Make some small packs about the same size as these and add some little Vaseline to it . No , not to make you Squeal like a pig on your next river trip or for your next trip to Broke Back mountain.It helps to keep a spark and small flame.Works great for me with a flint .	-1
Perfect for the lazy . For this I am lazy , you can have the same thing with $ 0.10 worth of thread and cotton balls if you want to take the time to make them .	-1
Including shipping , these are over $ 10 for 10 , or about a dollar a piece . For a fraction of this amount , you can go and get a bag of cotton balls and a jar of vaseline , coat each cotton ball with a dab of vaseline , and using an old empty pill bottle , sans label , you can have your very own backpack 'fire kindling ' kit ... for about $ 0.02 each . In the end , that 's really all these are , anyhow ... cotton plugs with an igniter on them . Beeswax will also work with the cotton balls ... just do n't be ripped off with a 'pre-made ' gimmick .	-1
I am not sure what I was expecting , but what I recieved was 10 pieces of cotton . I would have been better served to buy a large bag of cotton balls for half the price	-1
There are many other products that will work better under worst environments but are a little more expensive . I would put this product in the same category as Vaseline impregnated cotton balls . The fact is , cotton balls with a little Vaseline is SO much cheaper.I would NOT suggest this product to a friend and I wished that I had not spent the money on this .	-1
Wow , to think I bought this ! It works fine - that 's the good news . However , now that I know better , it 's much more cost-effective and practical to just buy a few hundred cotton balls and massage some Vaseline into them and then put them in a pill bottle for tinder .	-1
I got to use this 4 times and the stitching on the shoulder strap came apart . Not to good for supossingly being a rugged back pack . I do n't recommend this even for a book bag . High dollar for lousy workmanship . I would not advise this one .	-1
I bought this to use as an overbag when flying with my frame pack on backpacking trips , so that all of the various straps and buckles , etc . are n't hanging out there to get caught in the luggage equipment . The bag is plenty big to hold my pack , but the material is n't nearly as heavy as the smaller Army-surplus bags I already own , and the clip that holds the top closed is a joke . It bent and popped open the first time I yanked on it . That 's it : I ca n't trust it on a plane . The bag will still be useful , I suppose , and it 's not very expensive ... but do n't count on it to be heavy-duty .	-1
I got 2 of each of the three sizes , six duffle bags in all . It 's not like I collect duffles as I had none . They do the job and that 's it.The material is sturdy , almost like canvas . Zippers are large and yet a bit plastic . There are handles on the side in the middle and on one end . There are metal rings to fasten a shoulder strap , but no strap was included .	-1
No good ! The straps do not like to hold , its not logical to use for anything more then holding clothes in . I wish it had had been better .	-1
This OK for storing two bikes in a fairly quiet part of the house.It 's built OK ; not terribly stable or strong , but will do the trick cheaply.Had some issues trying to set it up , pinched fingers , bicycle rotating and the hooks dropping to ground ( with the bicycle in top rack on it ! the problem seems to be the square section of the top part , as opposed to the round shape of the twist lock ) . As a result , I have forbidden my child to touch or go anywhere near it or the bicycles it holds .	-1
The shirt was great when I first put it on , but after the day of hunting it really stretched out especially the cuffs around my wrist and the neck area . Washed it on gentle with VERY little detergent and with a jacket , pants , gloves and more . Hung it up to dry and pretty much all the color is gone .	-1
If you understand archery at all , you know the arrow has to flex around the bow 's riser to shoot straight . If an arrow is too stiff for the amount of energy the string puts into the nock-end , it will fly off with the arrow yawed at an angle away from side of the bow from which it was shot . If it 's too flexible , the bow string 's force will warp the arrow around the riser too much and the arrow will fly away yawed toward the side of the bow from which it was shot.The arrows stiffness must match the bow 's force . The bow 's force is determined by the limbs , and how far the string is being drawn . Youth bows usually have less force in the limbs , and the draw lengths from youth archers are usually short too , which means relatively little force is put into the nock end of the arrow . Therefore the arrow should be relatively flexible to shoot well.An arrow 's stiffness is determined by it 's & # 34 ; spine & # 34 ; characteristics , it 's length , and any weight in the point , the inertia of which helps to flex the arrow shaft upon release . These arrows at 24 & # 34 ; are short -- and the shorter the stiffer . You 'd have to shoot a really powerful bow to flex these short shafts enough . Yet a lot of buyers will think to get the short arrows for the smallest archer 's and their bows . The arrows also have very light weight sheet metal points . They should have heavier metal points to help flex the shaft for bows of low draw weight and archers with short draw lengths.These fiberglass arrows are no where near as flexible as 1/4 & # 34 ; or 5/16 & # 34 ; cedar arrows of the same length . Get those instead . If you do by these fiberglass ones , at least get the more flexible 30 & # 34 ; version and do a bareshaft test . You can cut them down based on your test results using heavier points .	-1
shirt does not breathe . also the arm lengths are too long . shirt does not feel like real cotton but the tag says 100 % cotton . do not buy this shirt from this company . I 've bought baseball shirts before that were much better . again , do n't buy this company 's shirts .	-1
The shirt itself is ok , the fit was way to tight . these run a bit small . I normally wear a large , wish i woulda ordered an XL . It 'll be a good oil rag .	-1
Bought a few , fit varies and quality is just so so . Was looking for some decent gym shirts but they will end up being car rags .	-1
This shirt looked so wide at the waist , but the arms were normal . This made the shirt look like a gown or dress . Not worth it .	-1
Upon the first where it is excellent . Once you start washing it though , expect trouble . It does not stand up well to washing it all . In my wash on gentle cycle , with gentle detergent , in the most gentle fashion . I would say find a different product .	-1
Feet are unbalanced good set of quality crampons will work in ice and snow much better . the price was low so I thought why not try them . They look good on camera for stage shots.Would not recommend in real use .	-1
Its just plain hard to climb trees with these . it would be better if there were spikes more on the inside of your foot , not the bottom . One of the spikes fell of after my 3 attempt of climbing a tree ( with my hand claws too ) . I guess these would be good for hiking or something but not climbing .	-1
The gloves are comfortable and turn swimming into a bigger workout . There are two things that would improve these gloves . 1 . Exposed so I could fix my mask or snorkle etc . This way I have to remove the gloves to do that and these gloves are not easy to put on or off . 2 . Make them out of a UV material . I have the black and I think they must absorb the sunlight because my hands are a very dark tan . I apply sunscreen now .	-1
The frame was completely bent.Not destroyed but when I wore it , it will be slanted on my face.I put it on a flat surface and it is slanted nearly 2cm.Love the lens , hate the frame .	-1
These snap caps look great at first , but really scratch up with even the gentlest of use . I gave it a two because my firing pin is pretty well protected by this thing . When you only get two for this price , its not quite worth it !	-1
i have a wasr 10 and sometimes , not every time , these will jam up making it hard to pull the bolt back and get them out	-1
i am having some problems with these , getting them to eject on cycling the action . i have not tried them in different guns . just the cm9 .	-1
IT DOES THE JOB INTENDED TO , BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING WITH GOOD QUALITY AND BETTER LOOKING SNAP CAPS . FAIR ENOUGH . AMAZON EVEN GOT THE BALLS OF CHARGING ME TAX ? ? ? . SINCE WHEN , SHAME ON YOU AMAZON . EBAY IS BETTER .	-1
These snap caps are high quality pieces of manufacturing , and I have no doubt as to their durability and the protection that they afford to a weapon 's firing pin , barrel , etc.However , I have to give these snap caps only a two star rating because they do not function properly in my 9mm pistol . Upon loading the snap caps into the chamber of the weapon , the slide would not close completly from the force of the recoil spring alone - I had to assist the slide closed . I know that the issue is not the weapon itself because it loads actual bullets without a hitch.Once a snap cap was successfully slammed home it functioned as expected . However , once removed , I found that the anodizing on the base of the snap cap had been scraped away , and had to clean shards of marroon anodizing out of the slide of my 9mm.I can only think that A-Zoom 's 9mm snap caps must be machined to slightly incorrect specifications or that I got a `` bad batch '' , as I have bought A-Zoom .22 action proving rounds and .44 magnum snap caps that perform flawlessly.Needless to say that I do not think that these 9mm snap caps are representative of A-Zoom 's other products which have served me well in the past , but these particular caps did not live up to expectations or the A-Zoom name .	-1
I bought these thinking were good because they had the best/most reviews . The aluminum chunks ( not just the red anodizing ) sheer off on the extractor groove , and the lip of the case to bullet contour after just a little bit of use . It 's very cheap anodizing , and equally poor aluminum . Go with the red/orange Tipton snap caps with the visible spring loading , and the brass extractor grooves . Not these.Also do a Youtube video of `` SNAP CAPS : best & worst ''	-1
These fake practice bullets do n't fit the 9mm blank firing guns they 're suppose to its a waste of money do n't bother	-1
The carp anodizing is a joke on these . Do n't buy ! Get the plastic ones , or the ones that use real casings . The red color flakes off and gets into your gun . Stay away . Buy the good ones .	-1
bought this elsewhere and not even 25 fires to one , and almost tears apart . the area where the firing pin hits is almost pushed inside.Piece of gargabe product !	-1
The finish chipped pretty easily , and now they feed very inconsistently . I would feed them through a gun after every cleaning , and they were good for about a dozen cleanings .	-1
Aluminum breaks apart when cycling in the gun.The soft plastic `` primer '' is worthless after only a few dry fires.At the best , these are only good for teaching people how to load a magazine . I would not recommend cycling these or using them for dry fire.Google `` snap caps best and worst '' for YouTube video . It accurately reviews these .	-1
I guess I should have read the negative reviews a bit more closely . These look and feel great , but they do n't do the one thing they really need to do - FEED . I 've run round after round of regular , production ammo through my 9mm with no problems . Pop these guys in for a little practice and they do n't fit . Once in awhile a round would feed properly and allow the slide to go full forward , but that was the exception , not the rule . Out of 10 of these caps , only 2 actually functioned properly . They 've gone back to Amazon and I 'll try another brand . Very disappointed . If they could clean up the tolerances on these , they would be a great product .	-1
I really feel cheated by purchasing this product . It has no silicone ! ! ! Almost Dry ! ! This is suppose to be a wet silicone applicator ! ! ! Do not buy this product ... Buy Hoppe for less money and true product .	-1
BOUGHT TWO CLOTHS , AND BOTH WERE COMPLETELY DRY , AND CONTAINING NO SILICONE . ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SILICONE CLOTHS I 'VE EVER PURCHASED . DO N'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS BRAND !	-1
I purchased this model new in the box factory sealed . It looked fine except the front sight was not straight up and down . Upon firing the accuracy was very poor . No amount of sight adjustment would correct the problem . I sent it to the mfr . who replaced it with another gun . This one 's finish was a mess , serial no . illegible and the front sight ... also bent ! Someone at the factory had tried to bend it straight but ended up making it into the shape of an `` S '' . The rear sight was bent way off to one side as well . Perhaps an attempt to sight it in . Totally unacceptable . I am hoping that the mfr . will correct this for me . I have been a loyal customer of Crosman for years but they are apparently really going downhill . Sad , another USA company going down the tubes for such a simple thing ... poor quality control . No good reason for it . This pistol is not worth one-fourth the price it lists for . Will update if I get relief . Until then , BEWARE . Also , I made the mistake of not getting this via Amazon , who would have easily saw to the replacement or refund.UPDATE Dec. 2008 : Mfr . very cavalier concerning the matter . At this point it will cost more in time/postage for me to return it again , possibly to only get a worse sample the third time around . I 'm done with Crosman .	-1
Crystal clear but unless rour head and eye are exactly the same shot to shot the point of impact moves alot .	-1
I purchased this scope along with theAim Sports M44/Mosin Nagant 91/30 Scope Mount ( Short ) and aAccuShot Premium 1-Inch Weaver Style See-Thru Medium Profile Rings.The scope is just the right length for my rifle . It sticks out far enough that it 's no problem sighting it in , but in far enough that it 's no trouble cycleing the bolt.It also works well for my S & W ; m & p ; 15-22.UPDATED 1/6/2014 : After several trips to the range , this scope would no longer hold center . I was shooting at a target 50 feet away and the POI were about 6 '' appart , and not grouped at all.This scope was being used on a .22 , so high recoil is not the problem.Also , this scope was not dropped , or abused in any way ; I also do n't think it was damaged in shipping.I 'm going to try to return this , because I think this scope was a lemon.I will update when I get to try the replacement .	-1
I paid far too much for this item ( pellgun oil ) . I found it at Walmart and academy Sports and Outdoors for $ 2.98 . Fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me . Do n't be fooled learn from my experience . At 5.98 for 1/4 ounce that would equate to nearly 24.00 an ounce . Get the point !	-1
THIS PRODUCT might be okay if I GOT IT ! COMPLAINT SENT NO REPLY X TWO ! CAN I GET SOMEONE TO LISTEN ?	-1
These pellets have visible seams on them and are quite inconsistent . They do n't shoot well at all in my crosman phantom ( 2-4 inch groups at 20 yds ) . The skirts are n't very good quality and show visible deformations . They do shoot better groups with a 600 fps gun but if you want an inexpensive pellet the destroyers are the ones to get . Iv'e managed sub 1 inch groups with the destroyers in my crosman pumpmaster .	-1
Seemed like a great deal , great price , and a good brand reputation , but when my son opened it on Christmas , the gun had been assembled minus some rather critical parts ( the pump tube was visibly empty -- just a rod and nothing else ) . Either they shipped me a non-functional display model or Remington/Crosman has some poor QA . Sent it back for a refund and now have to look for another present . Tends to kill the mood . At least Amazon is good on returns ( and thank you to customer service ) .	-1
As i reviewed earlier on the co2 's , i can not figure out which one is leaking out air . It is either the co'2s or the b b gun . Either way i can not give either product two thumbs up .	-1
I would not ever recomend this to anybody I had it for 3 days and used 2 C02 cartriges then it started to get cold and the chamber split in 8 diffrent pieces	-1
Way too small . Only good for air soft or pellet gun . Anything bigger than airsoft will break the plastic holder on any impact other than dead center .	-1
The page did n't make it obvious these were tiny . Should make it more obvious . That sort of dales tactic is n't necessary .	-1
I tried to use but found too cumbersome and uncomfortable . I prefer to use my Galco ankle holsters without the calf strap .	-1
Dear Gerber , The silver trident I received was not sharp enough to cut through thin white printer paper without `` crinkling '' or tearing it.I have purchased several knifes from amazon and all of them can cleanly cut through paper with ease but this one does not , please respond with feedback.In addition , any other sheath available for this knife ? This is not what I expect from Gerber or a knife in this price range .	-1
I know Glock products always seem to get glowing reviews , I think this is just plan junk . I know almost sacrilegious right ? You want honest or the truth ? Tested with my G21 gen 3 and my G30 gen4 . I know its not listed for the G30 but seems to work the same with the G30 or G21.The pull necessary to release your weapon from the holster is way beyond what should be necessary . The up and down play on your belt plus it being so tight on your weapon means you have to pull upwards twice as far as most holsters . The wings for the belt stick out so far its almost impossible to find a spot where your belt pants loops can hold it against the needed upward pull . I find I need to use my weak hand to hold the holster down when I draw my weapon . Other reviewers suggested silicon spray but this only helped a tiny amount . Even getting inside with a knife and cutting down the tripper guard retaining `` bump '' did n't help all that much . Since I modified it I ca n't return it so it 'll end up in the box of never to be used accessories . It gets 2 stars because it could be modified to be halfway decent , but why ? I expected better from GLOCK .	-1
I 'm ready to buy two of those ( I cancelled my order the other night ) because it says both things : SIX ( 6 ) shot and good for SP-101 which is a FIVE ( 5 ) shot.So if anyone knows : Which speedloader ( Name and model ) is good for my Ruger SP-101 ( 5-shot , .38 Special ) , I would appreciate it ! Thank you ! ! I gave it ONE star because the presentation is so poor and messy ! BTW I went to the HKS web page ( poor excuse for a web page ) The list it ALSO as : HKS Revolver Speedloader for Ruger SP101/Taurus 73 , 74 , 731 , 741/S & W ; J-Frame Size 6 Shot6 shots ? ? ? Do those people want to sell their product ? No place in that web page for a comment or question about their product ... poor excuse for a web page !	-1
Was not a Hogue . Had all this ex rubber on the under side of the grip . Not what the Hogue would do .	-1
I placed this order by mistake . I needed the government model grips instead so I had to return them and order the right ones .	-1
First , what I received is not at all what appears in the picture . It is way smaller than the picture and the butt is round , not square . I 'm having a lot of difficulties to make it fit , not easy at all .	-1
Too short and weak . Get a Packmyr instead , those grips fit much better in my opinion . Too short in my opinion .	-1
although I have n't tested this grip yet , overall I ca n't see how it could possibly absorb more shock than the wood grips it replaced.I was expecting a much thicker material with a wraparound type fit.This grip is very thin material and leaves the frame exposed in a way that , to me , shouts `` ouch '' ! Again I have n't tested it yet so my observations may have no merit , but ... once I try it I will submit my findings-if I can still type ! ok I got to the range today and my view has n't changed.. I found the monogrip to have no shock absorbing ability that I could discern-in fact it hurt my hand ! Also , hogue claims nothing has to be changed on your pistol to make this grip work but that is not true.I replaced it with a pachmayer presentation grip that I find much more comfortable.my opinion is this is not the grip for a .44 mag.I am removing my 2 star rating to replace it with one star.this is no reflection on amazon as the product arrived quickly .	-1
This is a nice sized rod . The rod and the patch holder are coated red . The red comes off in your bore and on your receiver parts . Stay away from this rod . I returned it . Try the Pro Shot 6.5 & # 34 ; stainless rod . It is quality .	-1
The only advantage of this over an aluminum rod is the & # 34 ; Saf-T & # 34 ; paint that it is coated with . Once that pain chips off , you have a steel rod that can scratch your barrel . Since that paint has already chipped along the grooves about an inch from the tip after only two weeks , I need to find something else to clean my pistols . The handle does allow much better rotation when compared to the Hoppe 's standard rod .	-1
I chose the Trijicon sights because they were crystal clear , compared to the Meprolight , that were somewhat & # 34 ; fuzzy & # 34 ; . The night visibility was fine .	-1
Sight dot to small to see with glasses , does not mount in sight receiver hole , no tool to mount it .	-1
The fiber optics do catch alot of light , and they work great , but the snap mount they 're on wiggles around on the barrel , twisting out of alignment .	-1
I hate these targets . They are like tissue paper . Also 100 yard targets ? Impossible to see with a high powered spotting scope at 100 yards .	-1
I 'm not sure why some people have rated this item so high but it was one of the reasons I purchased them . I guess the people that rated this so high have n't owned a good pair of hearing protectors . This is my third pair of ear protectors and they 're the worst . I needed another pair because I ca n't alway locate the pair I have in the garage . I use them for woodworking machines and when cutting the grass . There is hardly any cushion and it does n't cut out any noise . Then if you have to wear eye protectors it 's even worse . They are useless and were thrown away .	-1
The rubber is very cheap and fragile . Furthermore , after having this on my 1911 for about a week underneath the stock rosewood grips , they had a weird film of moisture or oil when I removed them . I replaced them with some molded finger groove wooden grips .	-1
These grips are not cut properly to fit the pistol . They greatly interfere with the reliability of the pistol . The safety is extremely hard to engage , the magazine release does not work and the overall fit is poor . When I compare the cut outs to the wood grips there is a noticeable difference . These grips are a big disappointment and are at the price where I will take a loss from sending them back . Do not purchase these grips .	-1
It seems that using this kit can actually damage and render unusable certain types of airguns ... ..should n't that be a large warning in the description ?	-1
To begin with , something as simple as a bore light should not need to have directions included so I was n't surprised when there were n't any included . The problem is , I ca n't get it to work and I am no dummy . There is an inner tube that fits AAA batteries but they are n't long enough to make proper contact , and AA batteries are too big to fit the obviously needed , metallic enhanced inner tube , and even if I pull it out and load in 2 AA batts , I ca n't get it back together . I must be missing something but do n't know what .	-1
Packaged well and looks to be what I needed , but as they say , & # 8220 ; Looks can be deceiving & # 34 ; . This is total junk . Do not waste your money and look for a better product . Plastic body and interior battery tube is made from cardboard , Tried to insert batteries and they will not fit into top end where contact spring is located . Tried energizer AAA batteries and will not fit . Light is useless . Hoppes should stick to their cleaning products , ( which are excellent ) , and not put their name on imported cheap junk .	-1
I got this with my Hoppe 's kit , I 'd prefer if they just made it $ 3-4 cheaper without the light . The only redeeming feature of this light is the clear L shaped light reflector . Imagine you rip out the tube of a thick retractable ballpoint pen , a used tampon cardboard tube wrapped in aluminum foil , shove two batteries inside and cram it all in the pen tube.This is basically what this `` light '' is .	-1
If this is any indication of what Hoppe 's will associate its Brand Name with then I will definitely be looking elsewhere for all my gun care and cleaning needs . This is an absolute piece of junk that I picked up at a gun show to inspect rifle bores . It barely made it thru the show before completely ( and non-repairable ) giving up the ghost . Everything said by other one star reviewers is correct and accurate .	-1
Hoppes should be ashamed of putting their name on this garbage . The foil contact in this piece of junk is so thin even if it did work ( mine did n't right out of the box ) , it would break in only a few uses . I 've rarely seen a product built this poor . It 's unbelievable .	-1
The gun in question is from the early 70s . Do n't know if that had anything to do with it . I have another , older , Pachmayr grip on a model 14 from the 70s or 80s and I love it . It came with the model 14 when I got it .	-1
These are cheaply made and not stylish . The lenses are very small and do not look polarized at all . I expected better from Radians .	-1
Airgun are not firearms , and because of that , they have very different cleaning requirements . You 'll never get copper fouling , obviously , and since pellets are made of pure lead and travel between 350 and 900 fps , leading is a rarely a problem . ( If your pellets are traveling over 1000fps , you should be using a heavier pellet for accuracy 's sake . ) Low powered guns really do n't need cleaning at all . Many target shooters do nothing but run a clean patch down their barrels between matches . PCP guns and bulk-fed CO2 guns should have a lightly lubricated patch run down the barrel once in a while to prevent the barrel from rusting . That 's because the rapid expansion of the gas on firing chills the barrel , which induces condensation . But excessive use of a cleaning rod on any air gun will cause wear at the muzzle that can , and will , affect accuracy.There are several problems with using felt pellets . If your shoot them out of a spring air gun , you 're going to eventually damage the piston , spring , and piston seal . You can shove half a dozen in and it still wo n't cushion the piston properly . If you push them down with a cleaning rod , there 's a good chance you 'll score the barrel with the rod . The steel used in airgun barrels is much softer than that used in firearms barrels , since airguns do n't need to resist the heat and pressure found in a centerfire chamber . Some airgun barrels are made of brass , and one pass of a metal cleaning rod is enough to permanently damage them.The best way to clean any airgun barrel is with a non-metallic pull-through cleaning system . No brushes , solvents , and no gun oils . You can make a pull through cleaner from a piece of .080 weed whacker cord- cut one end at an angle , so it 's easy to push through a cleaning patch , and melt the other end over a candle flame into a blob that 's just under bore size . Use a file to shape it , if necessary . ( No sandpaper- that might leave abrasive bits in the blob . ) Slide the patch over the cord , and pull through from the breech end . Run plain patches through until they come out clean . Simple .	-1
I bought one of these and really liked it . A few months later my wife tried it with her rifle and wanted one . I went to the previous orders page and selected the same thing as before . The new one in now sourced from China and not comparable at all the the previous one . I 'd recommend buying something else now .	-1
( Total re-write 10/29/2011 ) Before I complained about a Marketplace seller selling a counterfeit version of the Shooter 's Ridge bipod . That 's old news ... Now I focus my irritation and venom on a REAL Shooter 's Ridge bipod , purchased locally at an LGS . I originally decided to have this mounted on a M & P ; 15-22 plinker rather than on a bolt-action that I initially thought I 'd use it on ; I admit that I never really noticed any problems with it but then I rarely shot that particular .22LR over the past year or so since I bought this Real Deal SR bipod late last year . The couple of times that I did take the Smith & Wesson plinker out I did n't notice anything bizarre using the SR bipod ( used in conjunction with a Shooter 's Ridge Harris rail mount ) , but then it was my nephews shooting the gun more than I was.Fast forward to today : I 've been working on my MSAR STG-556 rebuild ; one of the things I 've added to the bullpup is a 20/20 Precision forward Picatinny rail system that allows me to easily add a bipod ( and my own preferred vertical grip ) to the rifle . While I 'm waiting for another Atlas bipod on order to arrive , for 'chits ' and giggles I decided to try this SR bipod on the gun . It 's then that I discovered a serious flaw with this particular bipod : the legs are not manufactured to the same angle off vertical ! The rifle leans noticeably over to the right when looking forward to the muzzle . If it had been a pivoting unit that could be corrected for . But consequently the only way to attempt to level the rifle with this fixed unit is to extend the right leg approximately 1 '' further out than the left to compensate . At first I thought the problem might be with the QD mount attachment at the rail , but when I swiped the Harris L-S off of my SIG 516 to test on the STG-556 , that bipod mounted straight and plumb to the MSAR . So that only left the SR bipod as the guilty culprit for this Leaning Tower of Pisa act.Sure , the REAL SR bipod is less than 40 % of what I paid for the Harris , but manufacturing accuracy and exacting tolerances are important REGARDLESS of the price paid . As it is now I have little desire to use this defective SR bipod on ANY rifle . It 's certainly my fault for not checking out the unit more closely after I first bought it . I had intended on shooting the 15-22 last winter with the then-new bipod , but as with many best-laid plans that never came about . All of the mechanisms on this bipod work correctly , but the mismatched leg angles is just inexcusable.Live and learn , I guess . And I need to stick to quality brands like Harris , Atlas and Versapod ( among others ) and stop trying to be so bloody CHEAP . It ai n't worth it , as I seem to prove time and again .	-1
I was torn between one and two stars for this , but gave it two due to the price . This bipod tilts my gun to the side and it can not be corrected . Very sloppy manufacturing . I have never had this problem with the utg bipods .	-1
The rear sight fits the desert eagle Mark XIX just fine , the front sight does not . When you call up the company they say : `` oh yea , Magnum research changed that and did not tell us . Here is a machine shop in Michigan that will weld the front sight on for about $ 100 more '' . So then you call up Magnum research and when you press the option for `` representative '' you are disconnected.These sights are for the prior model Desert eagle Mark VII . They are NOT for the current model Mark XIX.waste of money . Total junk . Is not designed for the Desert eagle that has been the current model for over 12 years . They know this and use deliberately vague sales to lure you in . This crap should not be on amazon .	-1
Had a rough time installing them , I have The 44 Magnum Desert Eagle VII produced in 1993 . Contacted Magnum Research and was told that due to so many changes done over the years to the frame of the Eagle that the rear sights are not all the same , and the Trijicon DE01 are the only set made for this gun . The only way they would work was to file down to size . Talked to a lot of Gun Smiths and was told the same , what a nightmare it was to install . I 've installed sights on many guns with no issues at all , but these were tough . Tried so hard not mark the finish of sights but still got marked and marred .	-1
The rear sight would not slide into place on my G3 Glock 22 . Since I scratched the side trying to install it , I figured it would not be accepted as a return . I had to sand the bottom until it would fit . With a little red loc tite it has set well . The sites miraculously aligned perfectly and I have now fired 265 rounds through it with no problems . The sites are awesome , but they were advertised for gen 3 Glock 22 's , which is wrong .	-1
Purchased the Uncle Mike 's swivels thinking they would be great since I like other Uncle Mike 's products . The package arrived in a bubble wrap mailer after almost 2 weeks . When I took the swivels out of the factory packaging , I noticed that one of the swivels was bent at the swinging point of the swivel so that it made the swivel look cock-eyed when on the gun . The other swivel had a loose plastic cover on the turning/locking screw and made it difficult to cinch down . I think Uncle Mike 's better start letting some people in the USA start making their stuff again because this was terrible workmanship . I will probably start buying only Blackhawk products again . The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because they did fit on an old shotgun and OpticSale.com did refund my money .	-1
I can only give this item 2 stars because when the swivel on the mag tube was put on , I realized that it can easily flip up in front of the barrel and get blown off . That 's not good ! Guess I 'll have to find one that clamps to the side of the tube , and I really did n't want to do it that way . My gun has a 9 round capacity and that presents a problem for this type of swivel . Other than that , the quality of the product is top notch .	-1
I bought this kit to install on my brand new , right out of the box Mossberg 500 Cruiser with the 20 '' barrel . I removed the barrel and used the supplied spanner wrench to remove the threaded cap that secures the barrel . I replaced it with the one supplied in the kit . Everything looked right until I had to fight with the barrel for ten minutes in order to get it to re-seat . Being left handed , I blamed myself as I tend to be a posterchild for Murphy 's law . The next day I noticed that the Mossberg factory had left a spacer for the heat shield on the barrel untrimmed . I once again removed the barrel , corrected the issue , and reattached the barrel after another 10 minutes of fustration trying once again to re-seat it ! By now , I thought I was losing it ! I checked several videos on reassmbly on the web and no one had an issue re-seating the barrel . Finally it hit me . I had never tried re-seating the barrel prior to installing the Uncle Mike 's magazine cap . So I changed it back out to the original cap and the barrel re-seated like butter ! The screw on the Uncle Mike 's part is just slightly longer and this created the problem for me.So for my $ 16.00 all I have is one strap connector on my shotgun stock and a handful of scrap !	-1
For this item ... weighing in at 2.4 ounces ... small enough to be shipped in a large envelope ... LG Outdoors charges $ 13 for shipping ( in my case ) ... $ 13 ! ... That is nearly the cost of the product itself ... What a joke ! Honestly , I did n't notice the outrageous shipping charges during the checkout process because my cart contained other items and I assumed that the shipping total that was displayed was spread out evenly ... The other products , which were much heavier and larger shipped in the same amount of time the shipping costs were 1/3 less ... Do yourself a favor and stick to the Amazon fulfilled items ( Prime ) ... Stay away from LG Outdoors ... Oh , and their customer service is just as comical as their shipping charges ... I was told to send the product back at my own expense and I will be charged a 15 % re-stocking fee ... Thanks ! As for the product itself , I did n't see any issues ... I actually only needed a small portion of what 's included ( swivel stud ) ... Everything seemed of decent quality ... If this is what you need to add a sling to your Mossberg 500 ... Do n't hesitate to purchase this item ... Just purchase the item from someone other than LG Outdoors .	-1
I heard Uncle Mike 's made a good product , so I gave it a try . I wore this holster a total of 1 time for about 2 hours and the cheap plastic belt loop on the side broke , causing the holster and gun to fall to the floor . The holster is now worthless . Thankfully , I was at home at the time and not in public . I expect better from something made in the USA . I 've never had this happen with ANY other holster I 've owned. -- -- As a follow-up to provide an alternative option for folks wondering what to get- I replaced with a Fobus paddle holster , which I wore for about 5-6 hours of hard yard work . It 's not as soft and slim as the Uncle Mike 's , but it stays in place better ( not flopping around ) because there are ridges on the paddle that grip inside your waist band while the holster itself hangs over on the outside , and most importantly at no point did my gun wind up on the ground . It 's plastic , but not a cheap kind , and I 'm sure it will handle some wear and abuse . There 's no retaining strap , but the gun clicks into place , requiring a firm draw ... meaning it 's not universal like a generic holster , so you have to get the model for your gun.For those wanting to avoid a junk holster , Fobus is an Israeli company , and based on my experiences so far , Israel seems to make good , quality innovative products . It 's incredible what that tiny country can come up with in spite being about the size of a city here in the US and surrounded by enemies on all sides . I 'm guessing they make quality products because they do n't have room for anything else .	-1
These are goofy and ugly and i sent them back .	-1
I own several of these jugs , and they are great , with one exception . The vent plugs are hard plastic and they have a tendency to snap off just about flush with the hole . When this happens all you can do is push them through and dump them out . The real problem however is that Reliance does not sell these little vent plugs separately ( yes , I called them ! ) . You have to buy an accessory kit that includes a new spout , new cap , new gasket , and a new vent plug . I find this a little insane since I have never had the other items fail , only the vent plug .	-1
I just wanted 20 gallons or so for a cottage , I had two stacks , at three containers high and they leaned so far over after a few months , that they would have tipped over and totally leaked everywhere if left unattended for an extended period . So I now stack them two containers high and face the plastic screw-lid toward the side I dont ' want to tip ( as the container sags over time , the hard lid gives support to one side making them tip to the other ) .The construction seemed good at first , not as thick plastic as a gasoline container , but solid . The inside was not bad , there was no plastic taste I could detect , but did wash them anyway.If you fill one and grab it at the sides , be careful also because if the label is left on , the container could slip right out and to the floor . I removed them.They overall not bad , but they do not stack which is a big feature with sorage .	-1
THIS SHARPENING ROD IS TO SMOOTH AND DOES NOT PUT AN EDGE ON MY KNIVES AS I EXPECTED . I PROBABLY SHOULD OF ORDERED A MORE COARSE ONE .	-1
This is an adequate everyday beater hatchet to throw in your trunk for a camping trip or an emergency kit . Unfortunately , I can not recommend this hatchet for discerning buyers looking for a high quality tool for frequent use.I have not had the chance yet to use Estwing 's higher priced axes , but I have heard great things about them . This hatchet seems to be mass produced at lower quality in order to fill a particular price point niche.I ordered two of these and both of them had what I would consider to be material flaws on arrival . One had a burr on the blade so significant it was actually visible from several feet away ( as well as being easily felt with the thumb ) . A burr typically results from careless or inattentive sharpening of the blade and is formed when one side of the blade is oversharpened -- say , on a factory grinder -- resulting in the edge being thinned out and then curved away from the grinding instrument . This is easily remedied if you are into sharpening hatchets ( or if you are the original manufacturer sharpening the hatchet in the first place ) but it is disappointing to receive a new one in this condition.The other one I bought actually had a large chip in the edge . I do n't really care about this because any hatchet which you use frequently is going to get chipped and scratched . It is a sign of distinction . A pristine hatchet says the same thing about a person as a spotless pair of hiking boots . But as a sign of quality control coming out of the factory , I am again pretty disappointed at receiving a new hatchet in this condition.Finally , the rivets on the bottom of the hatchet which fasten the butt plate to the handle seem to be sloppily welded . Just looking at it , you can see that it was done in a hurry . Same reaction as above.The edge damage on my hatchets is easily fixed with a little filing . If you are new to ax sharpening , I would recommend some youtube research around how to properly sharpen convex edges -- the techniques are a little different from typical knife sharpening but not difficult to master . You will see some people using their axes to slice paper . In my personal but admittedly not extensive experience chopping wood , I have not needed this level of sharpness from a hatchet.In summary . These hatchets are supposedly made in the US . Just to let you know , I 'm an American and I love buying American products . But I 've also lived overseas for much of my adult life and believe strongly in supporting the local businesses and artisans wherever you happen to be located . You can find quality just about anywhere if you look in the right places . As someone who now lives in the US and happens to be American I have to say I 'm disappointed with the quality of these hatchets and saddened that `` Made in the USA '' no longer carries the weight it once did .	-1
Well I bought this for sighting in a few of my rifles , rifles which happen to be black . I read the instructions and I could tell that there was going to be a problem . This set would work great on regular hunting rifles and all pistols , It just doesnt work with rifles who 's scope and iron sights are up a little higher and not right above the barrel . the problem is there is no adjustment on the grid lens ( the black scope looking thing ) and there for it ca n't get higher than just above the barrel so it dosent work when your a little higher on your sights . Looked like a nice kit though .	-1
The only thing nice I can say is it is made of nice components.I followed all instruction , watched youtube videos , and I have sighted in many weapons . This did not work for me.I ended up sending back and getting the LaserLyte boresight , which is fantastic .	-1
i thought that I could n't go wrong with bushnell , but boy was i wrong . the lens was all fuzzy . another reviewer said it was frosty . it looked oxidized or something . Also , the lens thing , or whatever it is , is fixed at a certain height . so unless your scope is exactly the same height , and you can see through the fuzzy lens , then i guess you might be able to bore sight it . i did n't check this right away after i bought it , so it 's too late for me to return it now . but next time , i wo n't trust bushnell . my other experiences with bushnell have been positive though . this thing , however , is a very poorly designed product , definitely not `` professional . '' the arbors are good quality though , but useless without the lens . Umm , what else . the case is really nice . Oh , also , little to no instructions .	-1
I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .	-1
I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .	-1
worked good for a while until the entire locking mechanism fell out and i could n't get it back in would recommend not to buy	-1
i got a package with different used and crappy rings , i know this has nothing to do with the performance of this product but .. if i decide to buy again i would have to think twice , i was going to put in the trash but i sent it back .	-1
These are offset hooks . If you do n't know the difference , please look it up . Circle hooks are designed to not deep hook fish as easily as regular hooks . If you catch and release fish such as stripers , then circle hooks are the way to go . Fewer injured fish .	-1
Well the tag was on the sweatshirt so it appears it was n't a defective one but after only two washes the stitching has started to come off and the HUGE shrinkage after the first wash was unreal . If you do plan to buy from this seller you may want to order one size larger	-1
Do you have a very thin neck with a tiny head ? Gigantic shoulders and upper arms that taper to impossibly small wrists and hands ? Then you 'll love this sweatshirt ! The hole for the head is so small that I get static electricity in my hair every time I put it on . The material is very lightweight ( though I must admit it 's warm ) and the shoulder area is so huge that I feel like Shrek wearing it.The only thing I can say that 's good about it is that it is warm and it did n't shrink a lot in the wash . I do n't know what has happened to Hanes lately , but their fit and quality has gone down the tubes . I guess they 've decided to sacrifice quality for price , but I would much prefer to pay a little more for something sturdy that fits .	-1
Both my husband and I wanted a navy blue sweatshirt but the colors were picked over after Xmas . Hanes had the navy in our sizes so we decided to try them out since my husband has worn the underwear with no problem . Well these have the strangest sizing imaginable . Body was too large yet short and the neck was so small you could barely get it over your head . If I 'd only ordered one I 'd have thought it was just that one but both sizes had the same issues . Buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! Stick to their underwear .	-1
In the winter I wear turtlenecks & this sweatshirt 's neck is really open showing more than what this product picture shows.Updated 02-13-14 : The shirt is already peeling . If you want something nice , this is not it . If you want it for around the house , this would work for the price .	-1
I 'm fairly unimpressed . the Quality of the shirt is 'ok'.. but it 's certainly not a very dark black . It looks like what last years Mock necks looked like after having been washed 5-10 times . Also it was huge ... definitely not true to size .	-1
This item is not what you see advertised . It 's only a thin sleeping bag ! Do n't know where the `` no see 'um thing '' applies ?	-1
It feels like polyester and is badly made . It arrived with one of the seams partly open a couple of inches .	-1
Not much to say . Like the title says ... I wouldn & # 8217 ; t recommend this item . I don & # 8217 ; t use it because it just slips off in the water and I do not have a big head , so it should stay on .	-1
Not a fan of this whistle . Get a whistle with a cork ball that sounds like a whistle . This is just too high a pitch . I suppose it 's good if I want to call my dog , but not too good for a real emergency where people recognize a genuine distress whistle .	-1
These rubber toe tips tear very easily . A few uses and they are shredded . Better to use bandage or adhesive tape .	-1
Pros - Great power and accuracy , nice weight , good sites.Cons - Barrel hold-down inadequate . Barrel often pops open when fired , especially with fresh CO2 cartridge..After short time began leaking CO2 . Without firing will hold a charge for about 1 hour..Considering expensive price and short time before seals break-down the 617x is a poor choice , though it is great while it works .	-1
I do n't trust these other reviews being that my pair came with a few snagged fingers . I was given a refund because of that though , but I do n't want to waste my time again trying to get a proper pair for cold weather . I did n't give it one star because they make amazing facial skin sloughers , but that was n't what I bought these for . If they were sold as facial skin sloughers , I would have given them four stars , still minus one though because the finger tips were snagged .	-1
Bought these , hoping for classic gold toe quality ( nice heft , thick cotton cushioning , long life ) .Unfortunately , I was completely disappointed . While these are a slight step up from cheapie Hanes socks from the big box store , these are NOT the same quality we used to get from Gold Toe.The six pair I bought shrunk , pilled like mad ( bits of cotton sluffed off inside the sock after every wash ) and they all developed holes within 3 months of wear . No , I do n't use bleach . They simply were not made of very high quality cotton and wore through at the friction point at the ball of each foot.I wo n't buy Gold Toe socks again until I hear that they 've returned to their classic standard.Why , oh why , ca n't women get the same high quality socks that men can buy so easily ? I hope Gold Toe reads the mail and improves their manufacturing standard . Until then , I opt out .	-1
considering that these are over-the-calf socks , they fall down within 1/4 mile of walking , which kind of defeats the purpose .	-1
I ordered both the black and white socks . Despite the advertised ratio , which included no polyester , the black ones are labeled having 1 % polyester . The white ones were as advertised.The price was so favorable that I did n't send back the black socks . But I can really feel the difference that 1 % polyester makes and I would not buy them again . Also , if you take a pair of black socks on one hand , and squeeze , and compare to doing that with the white pair in the other hand , you 'll notice a giant difference . The black socks feel like 50 % polyester.Both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm . The white ones , upon wearing and washing , have shed clumps of material . Higher quality socks cost disproportionally more , I think.Do not get the black ones .	-1
Gold Toe has changed the way they make their men 's socks , and not for the better . The material is thinner , especially on the sole . There & # 8217 ; s far less cushioning than before . The fit is tighter as well.One pair in my pack had significant fraying at the top edge right out of the package.Rather than be a premium brand , these socks are now just a tiny bit better than the cheap socks from brands such as Fruit of the Loom . The only saving grace is that the elastic is a bit more comfortable.I bought these on a price dip so I got 6 pair for $ 11.99 . Had I paid the regular price , I would have returned them.Very disappointing quality , and I would not purchase them again .	-1
I am male with size 14 feet , so buying an extended size sock that fits is critical . I have bought Gold Toe socks before and love them . I recently ordered two 6-packs of the Extended Size cotton crew socks ( shoe size 12-16 ) , and was looking forward to receiving them . While the package arrived super fast , I immediately noticed that the socks looked smaller . When I held them against a new pair of Gold Toe socks that I bought at J. C. Penny 's a couple of years ago , they were about 1 1/2 inches smaller . I tried on a pair , which went on my feet , but felt tight . Heaven only knows what they would be like after a washing or two ! Needless to say , I am returning the socks right away for a refund.I am very disappointed , as I was looking forward to the higher quality of the Gold Toe brand . I guess different manufacturers are licensed to make these socks , which would account for the varying quality and fit . I will go back to J. C. Penny 's and see if they still carry the `` real thing . ''	-1
I recently bought a six pack of these gold toe sock in black , because $ 12 was a great price for a six pack of gold toes . I can tell you they are not the same quality of the pairs I had 5 years ago , and it makes sense why the price has gone down . They have changed them and have made them lesser quality , so that now they fit too loosely , they are thinner , less comfortable , and the material seems more coarse and more prone to wearing out . They have ruined what was a great sock . I recommend buying Adidas or Nike dri-fit socks which I now consider to be better quality .	-1
Been wearing Gold Toe socks for over ten years . A brand I once trusted is no more , and gone the way of the cheap manufacturing . These are comfortable , and they stay up , but like others have said , one or two washings , and they 'll pit and look old and shabby . I 'll still wear them , but only as long as they 're covered in the gym . As a reference , I compared them to a pair I had for over ten years ( back of the drawer , did n't wear them anymore because they had worn through the toe ) and the old socks still looked great ( except for the hole ) . I do n't expect them to last more than a year or so , but they were cheap . I do n't know if the more expensive ones were better because Gold Toe provides no description differentiating them . If you want a cheap sock with a short lifespan , get these , otherwise look elsewhere . Maybe the retail store socks are of better quality , but again , how are we to tell ? Shame on you Gold Toe , what happened to your QC ? UPDATE : contacted Gold Toe via email , told them about the pitting issues . They had me send back one pair to review . After about a month , they sent me a brand new 6 pack of their 'premium ' socks , no explanation , not even a word . Guess what ? Yup , the new 'premium ' socks pitted just as before.Gold Toe ... not anymore ... quality in this product a thing of the past ... darn it !	-1
The fit in the foot area is ample . However , the fit in the calf area is too tight . They even look like they were made for men with skinny legs . I ended up cutting them off above the ankle so they would be reasonable comfortable .	-1
I bought a pack of these 2 weeks ago , washed them once normally and today there is already a rip in one of the socks . I did nothing to rip it myself , just noticed a hole there in the ribbing . Not satisfactory at all . Gold Toe seems to be cutting corners or something .	-1
This sock is all bottom and no top . In other words the picture shows a nice upper ribbed quarter , whereas in actuality there is not much of an upper quarter at all . I sent them back .	-1
These are expensive stretch socks . I am beginning to think that some manufactures have the same size stretch sock and just label them to any size they please . Just because the sock will stretch to my size foot does not mean the sock is the right size . If the stretch force is pulling the material from the heel then at some point the heel material may very well side off the heel . The socks are going back and I know there are some from Walmart that does not do that . The ease of buying socks from Amazon Prime is so convenient that it 's hard to resist trying some other brand .	-1
I have bought Gold Toe socks for probably 20 years or more . They have always been high quality and wore very well . For the last several years I have bought them from Amazon with no problems . The last package I bought from Amazon were terrible . The bottoms frayed very quickly and wore through and the fabric became dingy and no amount of washing or bleach helped . I understand that they are now made outside the US so that explains it . I have seen this happen with dozens of products that I have used over the years . Before too long it will be impossible to buy ANY quality products in the US.Someone on here recommended Adidas socks and I followed their advice . No luck there either . I ordered 6 pairs of Adidas black low top socks from Amazon less then a week ago . A couple of days ago I wore a pair and then washed them . The bottoms looked like they had been ran through a shredder and one even had a hole all the way through the fabric.I 'm starting to think that Amazon needs to screen their sellers a little better . I buy a LOT of items from Amazon because I despise shopping but some of the items I 've been getting lately have me believing they might be knock-offs , including these socks . I know for a fact that a lot of sellers are running scams . I have seen things for sale for as much as 10x the price that they are available for everywhere else , one company with a Hispanic name tries to sell all kinds of items , mostly grocery items , for 4-5x their usual price . A lot of times if you point it out in a review Amazon refuses to post it.CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A BRAND OF ATHLETIC SOCK THAT WILL LAST MORE THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS ?	-1
Thought I would spend a little extra money on socks and I was disappointed . These socks did n't even last 12 months . All of them began getting holes in them and I would throw them away as they did . I have since replaced them with Hanes . I would not buy these again .	-1
Based on a previous experience , I bought these socks in April 2011 . Even though they appeared on-line to be identical to the previous purchase , they were obviously not.The first ones have lasted about a year with each pair worn an average of once every two weeks . The new pairs went into rotation when I bought them on sale in April , but lasted only about four months even though they were worn less often.Four of the six oldest pairs are still wearable , albeit not really pretty . Even as old as they are they still have a thicker feel than the newer ones did when they first arrived . Quality went way down sometime in the eight months between orders . Maybe they were from a batch of seconds ? Maybe it was just a fluke . Either way I am apprehensive about buying Gold Toe again.Instead , I purchased theseadidas Men 's Quarter Athletic Sock , 6-Packand can already tell that they are of higher quality . They are of heavier cotton and the stitching in the area of the ribbed ankle is noticeably tighter . Even better , they cost less .	-1
I tend to buy Gold Toe socks whenever possible . I have always found them to be the most comfortable , well made socks available . I recently bought a three pack of pairs of Gold Toe `` No Show '' men 's socks at a local retailer and loved them . So when I saw these six packs available through Amazon at an even better price I jumped all over them.These ARE NOT necessarily the same Gold Toe socks you will find at several brick and mortar retailers . You need to check the actual product number , as apparently Gold Toe has several similar products but with distinctly different quality . They are Gold Toe , and they look about the same , but the edge around the opening is slightly narrower than the ones I bought in the store . No big deal I thought - so they are sewn slightly different.I have an average man 's foot , about a 10 shoe size , normal width , etc . Typically I put on socks and they fit . I have seen other reviews where people like these socks and mention wearing a 12 or 13 size shoe , while people wearing a 9 1/2 or 10 1/2 complain about the socks ... .so maybe they run very large.Simply put , these are absolutely the worst fit of any sock I have ever owned . They slid down off my heel repeatedly . I tried several of the pairs I bought ( about 4 pairs out of 12 ) and they were all the same . They tend to slide around , not as if they are too big but just as if they are n't made right . They also are somewhat thinner than the Gold Toe 'No Show ' socks I bought in the store.The good socks I have are a Gold Toe 2247P . These are a model 656F . The 2247P may be very slightly higher on the ankle , but the difference in quality is like night and day.What a disappointment . I returned them . Fortunately , Amazon is awesome and offers free return on many apparel items , as well as free returns when something is defective.I 'd avoid these socks , or take a chance knowing you can return them .	-1
Not what I expected . I have wore Gold Toe socks for many years and these do not live up to any of the others . I thought I would try the lower profile sock and I will not be buying more . I wear a size 13 shoe so I bought the extended 12 - 16 size . I compared them to a Gold Toe Extended 1/4 sock and they were much shorter . They are also much thinner and lightweight . The top part of the sock is very thin . I do not expect these to last long .	-1
These socks are on the thin/scratchy side when compared to my other Gold Toe socks . I understand that workout socks should n't be thick but they 're not even thick/soft in the toes or heel . I 'd pass on these again .	-1
I am so upset with Amazon . I probably buy several thousand dollars worth of items per year and these are really too small and very substandard . The package reads : mens size 10 to 13 but I can not get them half-on . They are thin with a sparse rough hewn interior padding . These are NO STAR rated- the worst.I would skip these , they really suck and are very expensive for what is there . Perhaps as an applicator for paste wax on your car but not for a size 10 mens foot.Shame on you ; where is the quality control Amazon . Let 's start checking what is delivered under your banner ! ! That feeling of being taken advantage of is terrible .	-1
These grippers are not calibrated correctly.They all vary in strength and handle width ( distance between handles ) , among the same gripper number.You can buy grippers half the price and the same quality , that are calibrated more accurately than coc .	-1
I purchased this wheel from Amazon thinking I 'd be getting the highest quality ab roller available . What I got was a device that does not roll smoothly ; it sticks at several points in it 's rotation ( and lubricating it does not help ) . The wheel also possesses a few small rust spots . Since I order from Canada and pick up in the US returns are a massive hassle for me so I still have it and it sits useless in the corner while a cheaper ab wheel I had before gets used.Not recommended .	-1
The retention on this holster is very tight and the belt loops are flimsy . This would be my last choice in a holster .	-1
This holster is NOT suited for the baby glocks . I carry a glock 27 and this holster DOES NOT work , it takes away the ability for a quick draw . I had to use 2 hands to get my gun out of the holster and even then it was a clumsy holster . There are also better holster out there for the money , because this holster will scratch and take the color off your gun . Glock makes the BEST guns , but the worst holsters .	-1
The material is made of quality soft rubber and it would have worked for me except for the belt loops . The reason it does n't specify right or left handed is the belt loop is attached in the middle and not on the edge like in handed specific holsters . As a result it bulges out when placed on your belt and I was hoping for an OWB holster that sits close to your body .	-1
I should know better by now , but this time I figured if I bought the 3X size it might be long enough to at least make it to my belt . Nope . Now , having said that , I 'm not a scarecrow by any means -- I typically wear XL or XXL T-shirts . Right now I 'm wearing a Reebok 2X NY Giants T-shirt that 's about 4 inches longer than this 3X Russell t-shirt and I 've found this to be true of every Russell shirt I 've ever purchased . I do n't know what they use as a template , but all I can figure is that they use dwarves . Check out the model in the picture . The shirt is hanging below his crotch -- when I wear it I look like Comic Book guy from the Simpsons . I wear 40 X 30 jeans , so it 's not like I 'm Fat Albert -- I 'd just like Russell to add a couple of inches to all their athletic shirts . Their sweatshirts have the same problem .	-1
Either my shirt was mislabeled , or someone does n't know how large to make `` large '' size shirt . It was so big , I just gave it to my grown son , who is much , much bigger than me .	-1
It is a good B.O.B item , I have in the past wrote a bad review of this item , but after using it a few times it does work , but it 's not as thick as the one I used back in the early 90 's while on active duty.But if you write a bad report these people will email , and harass you until you change your review of the item . So I 'm not going to say the product is bad , because it 's not , but the company is not very professional at all .	-1
The fire starter I ordered was ordered from this page that states - '' This is the genuine G.I . Aviation Fire Starter with a magnesium edge and sparking insert . You can make a spark in just about any weather conditions . Government issue . '' Sold by Reiss Innovations , LLC and Fulfilled by Amazon.The one I received was NOT G.I . & was sold by Abco Deals . The glue on inferior products like this always gives way on the flint strip insert & you end up losing it . I have had a Genuine U.S. military issue for over 20 years & it 's still good & I 've been through several of these & they always come lose . I 'm getting very upset with the e-bay way amazon is doing things now . When I buy something I expect it to come to me as advertised . If this continues I will cancel my amazon credit card & shop anywhere else that has what I want even if it 's more expensive ; at least I 'll get what I paid for ! ! !	-1
Yes , it works ; if you have a lot of time to scrape a quarter-sized ( 2.5 cm ) pyramid of magnesium off the rectangular mass , protect it from every little gust of wind , and then try again and again and again to get the weak sparks from the fire steel to light it . However , if you are using a device like this to start a fire , it probably means that you are in a survival situation , and do not have a lot of time to get a fire going . Consequently , I have dropped this from my outdoor carry gear , and replaced it with a good flint and steel device ( one that produces a usable flare of sparks instead of the laughable little flickers this one produces ) and some good , reliable , waterproof fire starting tablets . They work quickly , reliably , and well ( I know because I 've used them ) . This magnesium thing works slowly , after much time and effort , and only in ideal situations ( I know , because I have tried it and given up in frustration ) . The fact that the military issues this dog does not impress me at all . When I am outdoors and off the pavement , I need gear that works easily and quickly . This thing does not , so I 'm not carrying it .	-1
They advertise `` genuine issue '' , but what I got was a Chinese copy . Plus , I have to pay to return it . When I called , they were not too interested in making me happy . Buyer beware !	-1
I start alot of fires while camping to keep dry and warm and I wanted to see how this `` classic '' compared with the Firesteel I have bee using ... ..boy was I surprised ... ..how can the military issue this thing with such better tools available ... .its a pain to use and if its windy , FORGET IT ! your shavings will blow away . It also appears to wear quite fast . I recommend Swedish Firesteel or another Firesteel product .	-1
I was wet , cold , and very tired that night I spent on the mountain . I shaved off a pile of this to start my fire . It goes `` poof '' when the spark hits it . I never got a fire started , all the wood around was wet . What I have used with 100 % success is Fire Ribbon . It is in a tube like toothpaste . It will burn while floating in water . It also burns along time . I now carry a half used tube ( smaller that way ) in my kit . It always , alway lights ... . Is about $ 3.00 at REI . Happy trails ...	-1
I bought 6 of these thinking they were actual Doan 's Machine and Tool bars . They were not . They are the same cheap bars availible at places like Harbor Frieght . They do not seem to have a good ferro rod and the magnesium alloy is not as good as a Doan 's bar . I learned my lesson the hard way so hede my warning . If you are looking for reliablity , durability , and quality , Go Doan 's .	-1
Not a bad canteen ... besides the fact that it LEAKS EVERYWHERE ! ! ! After a thin s***ty piece of rubber fell out of the cap , the canteen became as useful as carrying a full glass of water everywhere around with you . It also is made with extremely thin plastic compared toMy other good mil-surplus canteens . Not too impressed with Rothco right now ... .	-1
The lid leaked until I put o-rings in it . Not so much GI as it is GI reject . dont buy it	-1
This canteen is nothing like I expected . It is a lot thinner than the other military grade canteens I own it is more like a toy canteen you would expect to come with a cheap halloween costume . Would not buy again , do yourself a favor and go to an army surplus store and get the real deal . It does hold water and does n't leak , otherwise I would give it one star .	-1
This bottle combines the space of a water bladder with the durability of a water bottle . It is a little bit more space efficient than the G.I . 1 quart bottle . It is very easy to clean ( just empty the water out of the canteen and put the canteen down on a cloth or a carpet for a quick drying ) so it is easy to manage at a campsite . HOWEVER this water bottle has many MASSIVE downsides to it . # 1- It leaks badly . # 2- Any scratches make the canteen look bad . # 3- The bottle has a horrid design which makes it difficult to hold and store . I would not recommend this for any person or any sports . I would have rated this 0.1/10 but there is not an option for that on this website .	-1
I know this was a cheap Alice pack , without a frame . But what I did n't expect was the smell . I 've ordered a large LC1 pack with frame and straps from the Ammocanman . I have to say , he does good business . But the seller here ( ArmyGear ) should have probably stated that this Alice pack smelled of anus and throwup . I 've washed , soaked , aired out , this bag several times and it wo n't stop smelling . I 'm thinking about calling a catholic priest to have an exorcism with this bag . Shame on you ArmyGear . This was going to be a backpack . Not an airline tossup bag .	-1
Personally i am not a big fan of this product . I would not want to go any distance with this uncomfortable pack on ...	-1
I like these shorts for the fit and feel ... very light , easy wash easy wear ... pockets are excellent ... BUT ... 2 issues ... beware they run small..second ..and more importantly 2 out of three pairs are un-stitching below the pocket reinforcement ... after only one wash ! ! ! ..love Columbia ... but not in this case ... thank you amazon for the free return and credit ...	-1
The sizing guide for this shirt says 50 inches is XX Large , so I was surprised to find my Medium shirts measured 50 inches and were very long . They were more like dresses than shirts , because I take size Medium.Had to return them and now I am wary of buying Columbia online . It is a shame because I have an old Columbia shirt that is my favorite and these seem to be even better quality . My old one is labeled Large but fits more like a Medium , so that was perhaps wrong in the other direction .	-1
I own other columbia shirts but this specific style is HUGE . For a better fit try the Columbia Silver Ridge .	-1
Columbia has yet to let me down in the quality of their clothes , durability and materials used . This shirt , is no exception . The only problem with this shirt , and it 's a big one , is that the size is waaayyyy off . I would venture to say 2 sizes off . I ordered a large , as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines , but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it ! ! Seriously , it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large . I 'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him . Bottom line , do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first .	-1
The good : Calorie-to-weight ratio is decent , taste is pretty good ( for freezedried fare ) , texture is n't bad ( though slightly grainy ) when prepared to the manufacturers specifications , and prep is easy and requires zero dishes ( aside from however you boil your water . ) The packaging includes a ziplok-style top ; which you may see as more wasted packaging , or as just another useful barrier to keep leftover bits ( and smells ) from oozing out of your trash container , depending on your temperament.The bad : The packaging itself is considerably bulkier than it needs to be . There 's a ton of excess material outside of the heat-sealing which you can cut off , but there 's also considerably more bulk to the business section of the package than there needs to be , even if you cook the stuff the way they recommend . That said , you wo n't be making it the way they recommend unless you 're sitting on more clean water than you can shake a stick at . The package directs you to pour in 1C boiling water , mix , wait 5-6 minutes , then drain off the excess water and eat . You 'll end up pouring off over half the water ( and you 've already wasted the corresponding fuel ) you put in if you go this route ( and are n't desperate enough to drink egg-koolaid ) . I imagine you could make a no-wasted-water version if you were willing to mash up the egg chunks into powder so you did n't have to add extra water to cover them , or perhaps by simply adding less water and then massaging the hot packet through a towel to spread the love around - but speaking as someone not terminally addicted to scrambled eggs , I do n't think I 'll bother with the experiments when I could just carry something different next time.Still , for short trips in wetter climes , I can see no reason not to go for this .	-1
Look , I know these are designed for convenience and a very long shelf life but unless I was starving this would n't even be edible . Disgusting yellow pieces of sponge coupled with salted smokey chemical-tasting bacon flavoring.I 'm not hating on Mountain House in general but this flavor is the absolute worst !	-1
It was eatable , but not very good . Not worth the price in my opinion . A big bag of jerky would be a better choice for camping/hiking	-1
I thought this would be a relatively safe bet . Read reviews on another site and found those reviews mainly positive . Should have checked out Amazon . We tried this breakfast item and 2 Mountain House dinner entrees on a BWCA trip this month . While the Mountain House Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and the Mexican Rice and Chicken were quite good , the Scrambled Eggs and Bacon was inedible . The eggs were grainy and the bacon scant . Three out of 4 campers did n't eat this product -- tossing the meal while opting for gorp and granola bars as a substitute . Yuck !	-1
This is the third RoadPro product I own , the other two items are great but this one not so , heat up very slow , messy and extremely difficult to clean even with the aluminum container in side ( purchase separately ) is very wimpy .	-1
I 've used this a couple of times now and it does the job . Unfortunatly it 's a pain to keep clean unless you continue to buy the 'special-Aluminum ' pans ( 3 for $ 4 ) they sell to warm the food in . Given all the less expensive ways to eat on-the-road , just 2 stars .	-1
I have experience with many sharpening methods , sharpening stones included . The most important part about a stone is that it needs to be flat ! These stones all came concave and with edge ridges out of the box . For a beginner I would not recommend this product at all , however , if you can flatten the stones yourself , this kit is extremely cheap for the stones you receive . I was able to flatten the fine and medium stones with a little elbow grease , wet/dry sandpaper and a perfectly flat metal workbench , they were not that bad . The coarse stone however was ( is ) concave to the point that I 've dulled 2 belt 's on a sander and still not gotten a flat surface . I rarely need a coarse stone , and have others so I may not even finish flattening it . I do now have 2 nice flat stones on a convenient stand . I like the setup and the price , and after flattening the stones are working well . If you do n't have the knowledge , patience or ability to flatten a stone though , these will be completely useless to you and could damage your blades . Other reviews mention stones that are not flat , and this is a common problem with cheap stones , however , the coarse stone I received was the worst I 've ever seen . The system is nice to work with IF you get flat stones OR you can flatten them yourself . This was one of the cheapest fine stones ( 1200 grit ) available on amazon .	-1
Have owned two of these and neither has ever advanced an edge . Either my sharpening skill is lacking ( even though I do great with stones ) or this is just substandard product . I would not reccomment . Get some Spyderco Sharpmaker sticks and use freehand in stead .	-1
I bought this sharpening stone with dreams of making my blades razor sharp . This stone was not able to meet my needs . In fact it was so poor I was afraid to put my good blades on it . My stones are certainly not flat either like some other reviewers mentioned . And the oil that is required to use it runs out fast it comes with the smallest little dropper full . I 'm surprised that so many people love this stone system . After being so disappointed with it I decided to read the negative reviews and found one customer who recommended buying the Spyderco Sharpmaker . I am so happy I found that review because after buying a Spyderco Sharpmaker I am now able to make my blades razor sharp . I should have bought the Spyderco Sharpmaker in the first place . Im going to write a good review on the Spyderco Sharpmaker now .	-1
I rarely give bad reviews , but this is just atrocious . The material is thin . The zippers go the wrong direction on the pockets . I thought the lack of a drawstring around the bottom would be easy to ignore , but they shaped this thing so poorly that a drawstring is needed just to overcome the poor fit . I have always associated Columbia with quality . This has put a serious dent in that association . My wife was on the phone when I tried it on for the first time and with a single glance she just shook her head . Was n't even close . Would be zero stars if I had the option . Caveat emptor !	-1
When it comes to drivetrain parts , have found certain Shimano brands to be reliable and durable , have always been my choice in cranks derailleurs and shifters . Purchased this chain because I thought it would work for me . Installed it on my bike in early spring this year when upgrading to 9-speed . Lasted me about two months when after climbing a hill noticed a clinking feeling in my drivtrain . Stopped to take a look and found a link was popping off a pin widening the chain and rubbing on my Derailleurs as that broken link passed through . Fixed the problem with a Sram power link . Not even two weeks later after climbing the same hill another link started to pop off a pin . Only used a chain breaker on it twice , to shorten the chain and insert the guide pin . Picked up a Sram PC951 went through the same procedure of shortening the chain and connecting it with the Power Link and have no chain problems since .	-1
This chain does not com with a master link . Works fine otherwise would have been nice if the product description included this informationUPDATE1 star because after 100 miles on trails chain all ready broke . I cleaned and oiled before every ride . Full disclosure I weigh 230lbs and rides include 1 race and 4 training rides . I 've broken chains before but not this new .	-1
I bought this to help with stretching for running . I have to say , its just kind of silly to use . All the pictures in the book look the same . This was one of those purchases I would have rather not made . Its better to just stretch the old fashion way .	-1
I have had a few home gyms including 2 total gyms and 1 bowflex . I did not like either of the total gyms at all . They were easy to put together and very , very difficult to use . They were cumbersome and not fluid . I liked the concept of using your body for the weight resistance but it felt unsteady , uncomfortable , and akward . I tried this one for about 3 weeks . I really wanted to like it but just never did . Today , I am a much happier bowflex user .	-1
I bought this about two years ago thinking it would be a nice upgrade to the seat that came on my bicycle ... .I was wrong . I could tell very little difference . From looking at it you would think that the gel pads would make a big difference , but they really do n't . And then , to add insult to injury ... or maybe insult to severe discomfort is more appropriate ... one of the gel pads fell off . They are only glued on and not very well at that . If you are on the quest for a comfortable ride where it counts , I suggest you look elsewhere .	-1
Why on earth would you spend $ 20 , or more on this piece of junk ? Sure , it 's got gel under the surface ... and then covered in a cheap plastic or other material that heats up quickly . This bike saddle ( seat ) can & will literally burn your buns in the summer . If left out in the sun , it can also EXPLODE ! Stay away from this Wal-Mart junk & buy something about the same price but much better ... an Avenir Saddle.Avenir Plush Saddle ( Black )	-1
I was not to impressed with this string wax . It is way to thick and did n't absorb into my string well .	-1
On most compound bows there are a variety of things to work around . It 's very difficult to do that with this tube deal . Also it seems to be really sticky & balls up . I was trying to be cheap . Did n't really save anything if you do n't like what you got . If I had it to do over I would have purchased the liquid wax by Winners Choice just for ease of use . Also they are well known for great bow strings . Seems to me there sting wax would be no different .	-1
First let me say this is NOT Amazon 's fault . However the amazon description could be clarified simply to say that these DO include the necessary pads ( type & # 34 ; B & # 34 ; , in this case ) - not just the metal & # 34 ; clips & # 34 ; . For first time Yakima users this is not at all clear anywhere ( not just on this site but other sellers - I called three and not a single one could confirm whether the pads were included . In retrospect a call to Yakima would have been smarter . But this should not be necessary . Amazon - please be a leader and update the description to reflect the fact that the pads are indeed included ( not just the clips ) . Aaargh.My main gripe : the Yakima site has a rack finder application gizmo that I used . I did this several times to make sure I entered my desired application accurately.I wanted to install on a & # 34 ; bare roof & # 34 ; . In other words , using the q-towers OVER THE FRONT DOORS , in FRONT of the factory rails that are standard on the 2010 Honda Odyssey . The Yakima gizmo allowed me to select the & # 34 ; bare roof & # 34 ; option and told me Q133 is what I needed . Wrong . Q133 clips have a tiny . tiny . little extension that must be for attaching to the factory rails ( the ones that run along the sides of the roof ) - I did not try this ( I already have crossbars installed ) . Again , when it told me bare roof application I took this to mean one bar over the front door and one over the rear sliding doors . Nope.I did find a solution ( for anyone who wants to try this you are 100 % on your own for the risk you are taking - this is NOT recommended by the manufacturer but I got it really solid and stable ) .I found the combination that seems to work nicely ( for going across the FRONT doors ) is : clips Q112 with & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; type pads.Important note : This cip-pad combination is ATYPICAL ( the Q-112 clips are ordinarily sold with & # 34 ; E & # 34 ; type pads ) I had these other options for this combination because of the clips & pads I had purchased for other vehicles at the same time ( the Q-112 clips are for the rear of a 2006 Acura TL and the A pads are for the rear of a 2004 Corolla ) .A few more details if anyone is still interested in trying this : Yakima clips include very specific measurement instructions to ensure a solid fit . A little bit off and things could get really ugly . It took me ( with my son 's help ) over an hour to fiddle into what seems a really tight , solid fit for this off-label , over-the-front-door application . Here are the measurements / details : Bar length - 58 & # 34 ; q-clips : Q112pads : & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; typePosition the outside of the q-tower band ( the one that the bar passes through ) exactly 4 & # 34 ; from the end of the bar ( with end cap removed ) - do this for both sides . Then you should have 46 5/8 & # 34 ; of bar remaining between the inside of the q tower bands ( measuring across the top of the bar . The measurements given above are after the Q-towers have been locked onto the bar using the hex key.The fore-aft position is also critical - if you want it located differently you 'll probably need to relocate the q-towers on the bar.I have mine positioned so that the very front edge of the q-tower base pad is 16 & # 34 ; from the rear-most edge of the windshield molding ( a narrow black strip running across the top of the windshield ) ; the measurement was taken right the the top , outside corner of the windshield at the back edge of this strip.Make sure you adjust the q-tower tension so that there is solid resistance when closing and locking the rack into place . Of course I also have the vinyl pads on the clips to protect the paint where there could be any contact with the vehicle.Good Luck !	-1
imo these targets are to small and are not colorful enough.but if you want plain dull and small.then this products all you.i do not recommend this product .	-1
Ordered 2 tins recieved only 1 was charged for 2 , and the 1 I recieved was loose in a too big for item box ( pellet users know pellets get damaged that way ) complained bout this nothing came of it ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..was credited for 1 tin , of the 250 in the other tin got maybe 100 good useable pellets with lots of lead dust form rolling around ... ... .	-1
I bought this holster for my CCW Kahr CW9 . Holster is ok but I did n't like it . Because of the nylon material it is not sturdy and would flop to the side every time . Holster should do the job but just not for me . I like something a bit more sturdy .	-1
Yes , gerber label made overseas . I spose for no important reason this blade would do you subpar okay . After havin those assisted open crkt 's though , carrying this will bring you sour faces . Meaning , a crkt will spring right open in a split , but this takes more effort ( yes tho small ) top engage . I dont care for it , feelz cheep to me .	-1
The line itself is actually very nice and strong . Even pulling it tight with my hands , I found it VERY hard to break . My issue with the line is the thickness and the braid . The line seems to get caught in the clearance of the plastic in the reel ( ie the spool and drag knob ) very easily . The braid of line seems to want to curl around itself . I do n't consider myself a pro fisherman but I do get by and I do n't think I would buy this line again .	-1
Smooth and quiet at casting and it does cast longer distances compaired to mono lines . Very thin.I used this line to lift up my 30lb dumbbell , the line broke before it can mover the dumbbell from its position . My Berkley 30lb Mono line lifted the same dumbbell and held it for length . What is the true difinition of a 30lb test line ? This line will not hold up a fish that is 30lb .	-1
Odd shape requires an odd bracket , so you ca n't use old pump brackets on other bikes and swap the pump . Mine was missing the rubber insert required to seal it to a valve stem . It is not worth throwing more money at this one.My advice , find a different pump . This seems to be the general opinion of this pump .	-1
The short story is that I 've never been able to pump up anything with this product.Having hoped to use this with bicycle tires , I was completely unsuccessful . The fact that there is no hose to absorb movement of the pump made it difficult to even keep this product mounted on the valve stems on the tires .	-1
It is constructed okay and is a little light on the padding side . The fit for the UZI is really tight .	-1
This product uses a cheap one piece hinge that is not long lasting . Also be aware the picture in this listing is NOT representative of what you are buying . This is for an empty plastic container . These cases are worth about $ 1 each tops .	-1
Most 5 and 4-star reviews here are planted by Victorinox . I have bought about 30 Victorinox knives so far and I love them all except the one made with this cheap plastic which I initially thought were Chinese but then doing some youtubing I found this is indeed genuine but of low quality so I returned it.The best 111mm SAK are the ones with dual density plastic.The best 91mm SAK is the Fieldmaster ( same as Huntsman Boy Scout ) and Explorer Boy Scout . Both are 4-layer knives containing most useful tools.The Clasic SAK ( 51mm ) knives are so small are next to useless and are only good for key rings.Beware of all the false advertising and if in doubt check youtube videos by knife users not by Victorinox .	-1
While it might some idiotic , I actually cut myself very badly while using this Swiss Army Hunter . The large blade is great when it is in the open position but when you close the blade it is quite forceful . If you are not careful it will swing back and put a nice deep gash in your left index finger . Basically you have to ensure that you have a good grip on the large blade while closing it . I much prefer Leatherman or Gerber multi tools that have the feature of just `` push '' closing . Other than the large blade swing back , the rest of the tools are great .	-1
I 've carried a SAK Officer model for over twenty years , and after my latest close call with an accidental closing , i Now carry the Trekker . I have used every tool on this knife since its purchase , and they all work great except where mentioned below . The Liner Lock on the blade and flat head screw driver is super solid and like all SAK 's the finish quality of this knife is way beyond any other folder i have used . I do have three complaints about the Trekker : First the & # 34 ; One-Hand & # 34 ; claim is laughable , although it was the second biggest selling point i considered when making this purchase ( the first being the lockblade feature ) . Everyone i let use this knife complains about it being junk because they have such a hard time opening the blade ! ! ! Second the serrated edge on the blade worked great when cutting steak , but I use my Trekker for cutting just about everything , even filleting Sunfish , and the chisel grind was just terrible for most fine tasks . I eventually took a belt sander to the blade and completely removed the serrations . My final complaint is the Left handed liner lock feature ... making the Trekker almost as tedious to close as it is to open .	-1
Like several other reviewers , I ended up with a near-empty bottle that was essentially useless for the purpose of disinfecting water . An expensive lesson indeed ! I can far more highly recommend standard iodine tablets - there are several manufacturers - and I can only warn potential customers to forget all about Polar Pure .	-1
All of these reviews are based on nostalgia , this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash , i do n't even think Seiko care about this anymore since young people do n't used watches as they use to . If you want a mechanical buy an Orient diver , is a lot better than this Seiko diver . The past is gone , this is not what it used to be , be real .	-1
This watch is very disappointing . It runs about 5 to 6 minutes fast a week . Very annoying . I see from another review mine is not an isolated case . Seiko said I 'd have to pay shipping and it would take up to 6 weeks turn around on the repairs . Poor customer service for a brand new watch , what a rip off .	-1
I was shocked when I opened the box , this looks like a $ 20 pair of muffs . I 'm not sure I want to keep these muffs , WAY overpriced for the low quality . Is this someones idea of a joke ? these ca n't be worth more than $ 20-30.Do n't company 's care what consumer think anymore ? Update 02/11/2012My review was short , so I will add some more information after taking them to the range about 20 times , I will not use without inner ear protection before putting theses on.I based my opinions on 35 years of buying quality products ( before the time that we are forced to ( buy made in china ) products.most everything today is poorly made and wo n't last . These muffs are such an example . I do n't feel the need to be an expert in the field of hearing /Audio to give an overall opinion on the low quality manufacturer of this product . suffice it to say you can do better with a good pair of $ 40 pair of muffs .	-1
I Received these today . They were dead on arrival . Instruction are very limited , which did n't help . Hopefully these are an exception to the rule , but I will find a different brand to get next time.I have since bought Pro Ears Gold . Now that is a great set of hearing protectors ! ! !	-1
I went into a store to put eye and hands on the item before purchase . I will tell you that I was very interested in the product because titanium is not toxic and the lightest camp cookware available ( to my knowledge ) . Here is my main issues with this type of item . The metal is very very thin , and can be bent easily if the item is not guarded . Not to mention that it is very expensive ! The item , although made from titanium , looks weak and flimsy in my opinion . If your ultimate goal is weight reduction . Then this is your obvious choice , and I am assuming that you have the body fat percentage of an elite marathon runner or one of those elite cyclists , and you can no longer cut weight . However , if you are a regular Jane or Joe ( like I am ) , and you could shed just one pound , you could more than compensate with aluminum , and get more bang for your buck . So amusing to see individuals go for the lightest items that can be bought with respect to any equipment when they themselves are not the lightest equipment available ! I just do n't see the sense in it . If you are really considering lightening the load , consider a diet and exercise regimen and get a nice inexpensive aluminum pot , that weighs just a scratch more than this item ( hard anodized aluminum of course ) . Has better heat transference , cheaper , and looks and feels more durable . Save your money , unless your loaded with money to burn . If you really want something titanium , get one of those fork/spoon combo utensils . I would consider this item if you could buy it for less than $ 20 , but no way for $ 60 ! ! ! !	-1
If this was free , it would be overpriced . It is not worth carrying , too narrow and too thin to be any different than sleeping on the ground . Mine ripped when opening it .	-1
The website says this clip fits for Crossman 760 air rifle . It actually does not fit in my Crossman 760 Pumpmaster and is a useless device . I end up with tossing it away into the trash can and also wasted a whole box of pellets that was purchased together with this clip .	-1
me and a friend were shooting my co2 handgun in my back yard and several of these cartridges only got about 35 shots and they were done so i went and got some crosman powerlets much better 122 shots a cartridges alot better than the daisies just get yourself the crosman ones and you will be good .	-1
This is not what I wanted I ordered the wrong item . Would not be a fair review , so I pass .	-1
Junk , the springs never stay in or they jam up . You get what you pay I guess . Daisy makes low end stuff and these clips meet their normal lack of quality level .	-1
Definitely not competition grade . Pellets generally fall into two categories -- those that fit into the barrel snugly and then those that fit very loosely , such that I fear might fall out before I close the action . Those pellets that fit snugly generally fire true . Those that fit loosely almost invariably fire high . The pellets are OK for plinking at cans , etc . But if you are serious about your shooting and score , stay away from these pellets .	-1
The pellets are good at the price , but the packaging is so cheap that it got open and about 90 % of the pellets spilled out inside the shipping box and got lost . So it is worth it if you actually get them all .	-1
I was amazed by the amount of positive reviews this crappy pellets got , I felt the obligation to set things straight . This review apply to all Daisy pellets , not only this model.250 pellets , they are so poorly made that as soon as you open the container , half of them unusable , completely deformed , they are so soft that if you do n't put them carefully on your rifle , they will just bend.Unacceptable accuracy , poor stopping power for hunting.I know so much about them because my local gun dealer only had Daisy pellets available , for years I 've been suffering frustration thanks to this crappy product and would definitely want to avoid anyone else the inconvenience , do not buy this brand ! .	-1
The rear sight is weak , front sight fell off . Yes you can buy after market parts to build a new gun but why ? I bought it as a gift and ended up buying a better gun at Wal-Mart . Not worth sending back for refund . shipping was fast but the gun was junk .	-1
This purchase was immediately regretted . Five shots emptied the CO2 bottle , the next emptied in the same time , without being used . It would not hold pressure , making it the most unreliable pistol I have . I returned it and bought a Webley Typhoon , which works .	-1
The lens inside broke free on one of them and the other still worked so I guess it 's hit and miss .	-1
I 'd have to rate their quality control poor to bad . Mine came and after I wound it up ran for 5 minutes and quit . The second hand stuck at about the 20 minute mark and that was it . No amount of winding , shaking gently would unstick it , so back it went.Oh yeah about the pins , before I wore it I took it to a jeweler to size it and they bent one of the pins getting it out and back in . They appear to be too light gauge wire for the job.Anyway , back it went and since it was DOA , the return was not an issue . But I wo n't be buying another invicta anything .	-1
I ordered this watch as an everyday watch . I only got it wet while washing dishes or a couple of times in the shower . Within 3 weeks , there was moisture under the crystal that fogged it over . This is definitely not a `` Diver 's watch '' . It never went under water more than 6 '' and was supposed to be rated down to 200 meters . It is a piece of junk . I returned it to Amazon for a refund .	-1
I got a Pro Diver for my birthday and sorry to say it is the worst watch I have ever owned . It is self winding and if I do n't wear it every day the self winding watch runs down . May continue running for a 1.5 days at most . It also is very inaccurate and may lose up to 15 minutes a day . I would not recommend this watch .	-1
I understand some of these watches come with screws for removing links . This one did not it came with only small brads and the brads themselves do not secure the band and keep it from falling off of your wrist . I would not recomend any watch that has a band that the links are secured by links .	-1
They function in my Gamo p23 , but they 're very inconsistently sized and shaped so I pick out the worst of them . I 've read that standard steel bb 's are rough on rifled barrels like that of the p23 , which is the only reason I bought these , but I do n't think I 'll ever buy these again . If they were a lot cheaper I would , but at this price it 's not worth it .	-1
Those are not machined like others , these are casted and not very good.Some show burrs from the molds . These are not precisely made like let 's say RWS Meisterkugeln , H & N ; and other brands.This shows in accuracy , but if you just want a cheap pellet for plinking and it does not matter if the point of impact varies several inches every shot at only 10 yards i guess these are't too bad .	-1
I like Igloo coolers . For the money they are durable and keep the cold where it belongs . But after a few years the hinges , drain , and lid strap suffer from stress or abuse and split . I wish they were tougher and suspect they could be but there is a profit in selling these replacement parts . Yes these hinges will fix it but $ 8.88 for two 1 '' by 2 '' hinges of plastic is EXPENSIVE . My solution is to make a `` hinge '' out of something tough but flexible . I 've used old inner tube rubber or triple/quadruple layer Gorilla tape folded back on itself . Keep the broken hinge pieces as `` washers '' and use them as a template to cut the material to shape . Use ice pick or awl to punch holes and assemble . The one I made from inner tube has lasted 4 years . I 'm now testing the tape version on another Igloo . I shop Amazon because of the good deals , but free or cheap is even better !	-1
If you are looking for bottom of the barrel low price pellets these are the ones . Some of them where unsuitable to be shot and had to be discarded . The rest where very loose in the barrel of my Winchester 1028 WS and therefore had horrible accuracy . If you just want shots down range buy these . If you want to hit anything do n't .	-1
After running out of crossman pellets i whent down to the local walmart and saw these cheap daisy variety packs of pellets . I bought 3 and thought i had just gotten an amazing deal , but i was so wrong . The next day i was plinking cans and used the daisies . After 20 missed shots on one can at 15 yards i knew something was wrong . I know that my remington vantage is a pretty damn accurate rifle and im a pretty good shot . But even after shooting mounted it took me 3 shots too make an easy one . When aiming center mass on a can , mounted , at 10 yards i barely knicked the can . Please do yourself a favor and never buy these pellets . If your looking for a pellet that is accurate , affordable , and enjoyable stick with crossman .	-1
Unable to get consistent grouping . One or two may fly true then the next may fly way off target . Other pellets haveproved to be much more accurate .	-1
You might think that since Daisy has been making BB guns for a great many years that their quality control and performance would be great for their line of lead pellets . I bought a 250 tin of these and have shot about 150 of them so far . Shooting at my indoor range in the basement using a table with bench rest for the gun and target distance is 10 yards , or 30 feet . At that range my newly broke in Stoeger X-10 with a 4x scope ca n't get groups any tighter than 2 inches by 1 inch using a bench rest ! Which means at 50 yards your spread may be ten inches and not even accurate enough to plink at one gallon milk jugs . I 'll be glad when these are gone . Only thing they are good for in my opinion is for breaking in the action on my new air rifle . They do chronograph at the muzzle ( in my X-10 ) with 900 fps velocity but that is n't worth much if you ca n't hit anything with them . Too bad I ca n't make the rest into fishing weights.I do want to confirm that its not the rifle . I just bought a 250 tin of Crossman .177 Match Wadcutters and at the same 30 feet am getting five shot groups with the holes all touching each other . About Nickel size or less .	-1
I shot these out of my Crosman 1377 and they are not very accurate out of that gun.. The best thing about these is the price.. They were difficult to load and had way to many fliers ... I normally use Crosman Destroyers and they are super accurate out of my 1377.. Just my .02	-1
I have a gamo bigat cat 1250 and I had like 5 bucks left on gift card so I ordered them knowing that they are cheap pellets , but they were so bad i just tossed them in the woods ! ! ! literally ! ! ! ! ! I taped 4 sheets of blank paper together at 20 yards and i aimed in the middle and it hit 5 inches to the left ( P.S i was using a shooting tool so the rifle was completely steady ) then i shot another one and i aimed at the center again and it hit a tree that was to the right of the target that was about 5 feet away ! ! ! ! ! then i shot another and it want way low of the target and completely missed it dont bbbbbuuuuuuyyyyyyy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i had to give it one star but i wish i could of gave it 0 stars ! !	-1
Even for the price , this Winchester knife is not capable of meeting the demands of a true outdoorsman . The knife comes dull out of the box , and its chopping performance leaves much to be desired . Even for basic woodworking , I had a very difficult time with this knife . In fact , after some low intensity use , the stainless steel blade sustained chips along the leading edge . On the other hand , this knife works great for soft materials such as fruit , and meat.The knife feels comfortable enough in hand , but provides no shock mediation , and is extremely handle heavy . The smooth handle surface provides little traction , and I would dare not to use this knife with wet hands.However , the nylon sheath provides some redeeming qualities . It seems to be well made , and the stitching is on par . The snap closure works nicely , but the belt loop lacks any type of tactical disconnect . The plastic molded insert is definitely a nice touch.Overall this Winchester knife is n't bad , but I would consider spending my money on something a bit higher in quality . Fortunately , it was given to me as a gift . I give this Winchester knife two stars out of five .	-1
I got this tool for free with another ( Gerber ) multi-tool . I would not buy this tool for much money.If you want a folding pair of small needle-nose pliers , this is a pretty good choice . The motion is smooth , the machining is fairly precise , and the spring-loaded action is really handy . The pliers are indeed small ; they are suitable for items no more than 1/4 inch ( 8mm ) wide . The handles are an adequate 2.5 inches long , and while they are not quite level with one another , it 's no big deal . Pliers feel quite strong , with minimal flexing.The large straight screwdriver is poorly made , with a rounded-off instead of perfectly straight shape . The can and bottle openers are abnormally shallow . The serrated blade is very thick but not very sharp . The straight blade is tiny and not sharp . The cross-head screwdriver is tiny , like a sub- # 1 Philips but more vaguely shaped . The nail file looks and feels like a student project . In short , none of the fold-out tools is of a quality to match the pliers and handles -- they say `` made by the lowest bidder in China '' .The wood accents on the handles are attractive and feel good , but they do make the handles surpringly thick -- about 18mm at the thickest point.For the pliers and appearance , I would give 4 stars . For the other built-in tools , I would give 1 star ( a failing grade ) .	-1
Tried to use one of these to cut a wire coat hanger to temporarily fix a vehicle , crimped it all the way around the wire to score it then tried to cut it on the score and the steel snapped right where the handle joins the pliers jaws , that was about 8 years ago , ever since i have been using a leatherman super tool 200 with zero problems , this would be ok to throw in a glove compartment and use occasionally but be prepared for it to possibly break on you .	-1
the image pictured did not match what was delivered . the part numbers were in line , but the look was all different . I was disappointed as this was a gift for my father-in-law as an EDC . returned it . ultimately . the part is nice - no silver on the grip and the bolts are exposed , wood look plastic - but not what I wanted .	-1
When you think about it , it 's physically impossible to screw into sand , yet I see people trying to do just that , when we go to the beach . However , these devices can be helpful if you first dig a hole place it , attached to the umbrella post into the hole , and then pack sand in around the anchor and the pole . Adding water sets it even better .	-1
arrows bend easily and should not be considered multi-use . Every shot in my crossbow the fletching breaks off and Ive tried this with my exaliber crossbow and kodabow crossbow , same fletching issues .	-1
Not sized correctly.I wear Medium Longs in Army spec BDUs and have several pairs in this size . These are cut different and did not fit right .	-1
I have had this watch for about 4 months . If you do n't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down . I am very disappointed in the watch . It was not cheap . I paid about $ 200 . for it and I expected better . I am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops . I made a big deal about this watch with my wife , and now I get a lot of grief when I complain about it . It is sturdy , having hit the wall several times .	-1
Ordered the stainless steel bracelet version but received the rubber diving band version . I decided to keep it and so far it has performed correctly on my watch winder and on the wrist.It is running about 15 seconds per day fast so far which seems to be typical of Seiko automatic wind mechanical watches . For some reason mechanical watch manufacturers seem to favor running fast to running slow .	-1
I used to own this Seiko Black Monster . It really was a looker of a watch . Good craftsmanship , durable case and bracelet , and very bright luminous markers . It had good waterproofing too . But when it started to gain at least a minute a day , and stopped on me for a couple of hours , like another owner 's experience , I just had to avail of Amazon 's excellent return policy . ( Thank you so much Amazon.com , I will always remain your loyal customer ) .	-1
These are massive.. i mean massive ! ! bought them for my brothers road bike since his did not come with any hazards . i compared these to mine and they are almost double the size of all my hazards , they are going to just sit and attract dust now ... maybe i can give them away , i would not buy these unless you 're putting them on KIDS BIKES .	-1
This is a knock off and not correct . This one has only 1 clip and the other end is a loop . , I qualified in basic with the M- ! Garand and I should know . The one I bought from CMP has clips on both ends	-1
I got a couple of them just because they were priced well . I have an average to large head and they are too tight.. pretty much to the point of pain . So I did what everybody else with similar complaints did and attempted to stretch them a bit.. still too snug . To top things off they have this strong odor of gun oil , which might not be a complaint for some of us ; ) I 've washed them , stretched them , and done everything but beat them with a hammer and just ca n't use them as headbands . HOWEVER , I made the best out of the situation and use them around my neck as a makeshift turtleneck while mountain biking in the winter . I suppose these are amazing for people with medium to average heads , but for us big headed people.. keep looking !	-1
It ripped a little bit on the inside in no time at all . I 'd look else where for a headband .	-1
& # 34 ; One Size Fits All & # 34 ; is always too big for my head , this one however is too small . It 's so tight it gives me a headache . Multiple washes later it still leave black lint on my forehead . Went back to just wearing a bandana when I work out .	-1
I ride a bike indoors during the winter months . I wear a sweat band in an attempt to cut down on the sweat dripping onto my bike and the floor . I purchased three of these and have found them lacking in absorbency . I have other bands purchased from a different manufacturer and can ride a good 20 miles before the band is saturated . These bands barley make it 5 miles before the sweat is dripping from my forehead . They are comfortable and fit well , but their ability to hold moisture is severely lacking .	-1
Hunh , the very first review I read on these said that she had a 7 & 1/2 hat size & was n't too tight or too loose.My hat size runs from 7 & 1/2 to 7 & 3/4 depend on the style & brand of hat . Within a few seconds of wearing them I could feel the blood throbbing trying to circulate , and headache started immediately after . After about 4 days of hanging it on awooden chair and resting my arm in it strecthing it out for a hour or so a day , it finally does n't seem quite so tight . Now six more to go . If you have a large head , be warned !	-1
The gun itself is sloppy and at 15 ' it 's hard to get a gouping of less than 8 & # 34 ; even using a stand .	-1
So this thing had great reviews and maybe mine isnt one of the better ones but at 25 ft it shoots about 8 inches high and 4 inches to the right . At first i thought it was me but in fact its the gun . So i give it 2 stars . It does it with crossman bbs and the ones thwt come with it .	-1
Looks good very realistic for a cheap plastic airsoft pistol.Pros - reasonably powerful , realistic , grouping is about average for this price range , sturdyCons - sights are very inaccurate about 8 inches off at 15 feet . slow and somewhat difficult to load . Trigger action is pretty rough.There are much better airsoft pistols in this price range.I probably should have given it 3 stars but rated it a little lower because I feel it has gotten higher ratings then it deserves over all.I have not had it jam , It is sturdy and holds 21 bbs.I do n't shoot it much because of the inaccurracy , rough trigger action and I do n't like how it feels in my hand ,	-1
I needed a prop 1911 for a Halloween costume so I bought this badboy and painted it to look like my real 1911 . First of all , I was surprised that the actual bake-lite grips from my 1911 fit on this thing . Second of all , after it was painted it actually looked more legitimate than my real pistol to a lot of my friends ( scary ? ) Now , onto the part most people care about - the function.I used to play airsoft , many years ago , and had my share of spring pistols , a couple of gas Glocks and an AEG M4 . This is probably the worst airsoft gun I have owned . It has a fixed 'hop-up ' which is no bueno for the included .12G bbs . I test-fired it in the backyard once it arrived just for the nostalgic lolz and the trajectory of the BBs is hilariously ridiculous . They go up maybe 5 feet in elevation at a distance of probably 10 feet . You wo n't be hitting anything with this gun and .12G BBs , use heavier stuff . I ca n't comment on the muzzle velocity but it could only manage a small dent into an empty soda can . My old KWA gas Glocks would go through both sides of a can with ease.Brought back memories .	-1
Very cheap gun find something else .	-1
It 's too hard .. it does n't fly that well and for the money it 's claim to fame simply is n't valid . I 'm using Aerobie with much better results . The dog prefers them , they fly well , I like them as they do n't hurt his mouth.I read the reviews before I selected this disc .. I think the positive ones are wrong.But we all have perspectives , mine however are valid .. lol	-1
Despite the universal , one-size-fits-all , application chart , this holster did not come close to fitting my gun . It seems the holster was sewn too far into the open end so only my muzzle could be inserted . I followed all of their instructions and sent the new , unused , apparently defective holster back and received only half of my money back . I will never purchase from this seller again and I advise others against it , as well .	-1
Disappointed with this product . It was described as having a firm core with slightly softer exterior ... I find the the exterior too squishy and soft . I 'm not a regular roller but use the ones in fitness center which are definitely more firm .	-1
I was shocked to see that the actual roller product is made from very poor quality foam ! There is a lot of `` foam dust '' everywhere on the roller and the foam fibre break down easily.The actual product is nothing like what was shown in the picture . How deceptive marketing and unethical . This is not the high quality EVA foam like those of swimming buoy or other rollers.Buyer beware !	-1
This NcStar scope was a sad disappointment at the range for anything beyond 25 yards with a .22 or .233 caliber sized hole . The optical quality is really not very good , producing blurry images the higher the magnification being used . The included laser pointer is almost useless outside in full daylight and the included tripod is such low quality that I was concerned about actually using it . The included soft carrying case is alright , holding the scope and tripod well enough.Long story short I returned it for a refund , which is a fairly painless process and one of the reasons for shopping at Amazon . I recommendBarska CO11502 20-60x60 Waterproof Straight Spotting Scope with Tripod , which was offered on an Amazon `` Gold Box '' deal for a few bucks more than this one , but knowing what I know now it would worth even the regular price difference.Not Recommended ! CFH	-1
I can see better with my 3-9 * 40 nikon scope . It 's cheap and that 's what you get .	-1
Not sure I can really tell if they are COOL ( temperature wise ) or not . They do seem to come apart and ball up a bit . After a some washing and wearing , I ca n't imagine they would n't develop holes after a while . Not worth the cost , IMO .	-1
They are Not large enough , and fairly inflexible . Inelastic , Cheap , and unwearable for me . I discarded them . I would n't recommend buying them	-1
I bought this ball because I have a bad back and want to use it as a chair to help with spinal stability . Therefore , achieving the 90 degree angle between my hips and legs is *very* important . I bought the 75 cm ball because I am relatively tall . I inflated it , using a level and a hashmark on the wall to ensure that it was inflated to the proper size . At 65 cm. , I was frightened to keep inflating for fear that I might over-inflate and injure myself . I took it inside and when I sat on it ( at 140 pounds ) it barely makes a dimple . Thus , I know I am at about max capacity . The angle is a little shy of 90 degrees so I guess I 'll keep the ball until I can find a better one . Just note , if you are looking for a 75cm ball , this is not it ( and just FYI - the box *does* say 75cm ) .	-1
Before you buy this ball due to all the 5-star reviews , please realize that most reviewers probably have not owned/bought a ball of any other brand before so they just left a 5 star because it worked . It is not enough for a stability ball to work because all it takes is to have one fail and pop on you.I was hoping I could use this ball as a desk chair but I realized this ball might not be safe ! THIS BALL IS NOT ANTI-BURST , NOT PUNCTURE RESISTANT , nor does it have a WEIGHT RATING . Search Amazon reviews and you will find MANY reviews talking about how balls of different brand have popped/burst on the user and caused them to fall and getting injured ( banged up head , stubbed finger , bruises ) . This is scary ! I did n't do my research and just picked the ball with the highest rating when I bought this but I 'm now going to return this ball because it is made from a cheap almost shiny balloon like material , not thick at all . If you roll on something sharp in the office ( a staple , thumb tack , etc ) , it will pop ! The rubbery material also makes a squeaky sound when rubbing against the floor . The friction alone will probably thin out the material on the ball causing it to burst one day . It will also probably burst just under pressure when you sit or bounce on it because nothing on the description page or on the box says how much weight this ball can hold . I am returning this ball and getting another one before I fall on my butt and hurt myself . So far the best one I 've found rated for 2000 pounds is the GoFit ProBall Stability Ball ( link might get outdated so you might need to search for it , make sure you look up the PROBALL series , not the regular ) . The Gofit ProBall is just five dollars more and seems to be better quality than this ball . The ProBall still had reviewers who said the ball burst on them mid-sitting though so no ball is 100 % safe.As for the size of this Max Fitness ball , it was also too big for me . I am 5 foot 4 inches tall and I should have went with a 65cm because I ca n't even put my feet on the ground while sitting on the 75cm ball . This defeats the purpose of stabilizing with my leg/buttock muscles . The 75cm can be deflated to a smaller size but then it just feels way too squooshy with less air in it . I 'm giving this product 2 stars not because I got the wrong size but because of the safety issue.The only thing I liked about this product was the foot pump . It was kinda cheap/flimsy like the ball but it did the job and does n't seem as tiring as using a hand pump which balls of other brands come with .	-1
I ordered this ball from Amazon and it 's not actually 65cm in diameter . Its actually 56cm ( based on the measurements of circumference ) . I plan to use this to sit on at my home desk , but its way too small . this has been a total waste of my time and money . i 'm angry that i even need to ship this garbage back to Amazon for a refund . they should be paying ME for this !	-1
We have a considerable amount of equipment in our home gym ( LifeFitness treadmill and stationary bike , Concept 2 rower , etc . ) and this product ended up in the closet . Think we saw it on Extreme Weightloss and thought we 'd give it a try , but I think it may be better for someone who 's just getting into condition rather than those who are looking to take it to the next level or maintain it at a high one .	-1
This `` ABMAT '' it is a cheap imposter . They have obviously copied the logo from the real product ... do n't spend your money on it ... it is put together very poorly . I would n't pay $ 1.00 for it.with that said ... 1 ) Real Abmats are great , I have used them a lot . They are better on your lower back ( spine ) than doing situps without them.I suggest you go online to Rogue Fitness and buy one for the SAME PRICE there ! ! 29 + 5 shipping . That way you can be sure you are getting the real deal , made well .	-1
Went camping with my son in backyard ... ..this tent is good for kids ONLY . I am 6'2 and I tried camping in this thing with my 4 year old son . NO ROOM whatsoever . My feet were practically sticking out of the tent . For a little more $ $ , you can get something much bigger .	-1
half way thru the night of sleeping in this i started having dreams of drowning . when i awoke having CPR preformed on me . I quickly realized this tent does not breath well ... . i was swimming in my breath probably would n't be so bad if it was n't 29 degrees outside	-1
I got this for a overnight hike and we camped at the base of Mount Washington . I set it up in a flash loved it . Then i climbed in to go to bed at night . I could not zipper the main zipper for 15 minutes . Trying not to break it as I worked it down . I didnt want to be covered in bugs at night or have a Polecat walk in my tent . Then , i wake up at 3am in pitch black with ice water on my feet . It was raining and i slept on a slight angle with my head raised higher than my fee , the top of the tent was dry on the inside . The bottom where the seam is . The base of the tent meets the side must have had poor stitching . I had about 30-40 ounces of icy rain water in my tent soaking my sleeping bag . MISERABLE in 45 degree weather . Had to wash my bag now and i returned my tent the day after the hike . I wanted to love it so bad . So small , compact and light . But it has poor construction .	-1
I ordered 4 of these for my family to put in their cars . Light weight to carry if necc . I figured they are practical . Later I can get better tents if needed . If I had to carry one , it has to be light weight . 60 yr old female carring her own stuff . More then likely , I will chose to stay home . Too old for all that silly stuff of survival . It is 3 season tent . Very important to me . At least I know my family will have this shelter if needed.Update : received the tents , on the box they come in states `` two season tents '' The ad above states `` 3 season '' . I am disapointed in this , but I am not sure about the difference in 2 & 3 season tents . I maybe sending it back , unless there is not much difference in the 2 & 3 season type . I am really disapointed in this . I did not even notice this until I was showing my son the tent .	-1
No ventilation at all . Al the condensation that is produced over night from you will collect on the roof and slowly drip down to your floor where your sleeping bag is . I made a bad decision of buying this product and on 2 separate DRY weather occasions I woke up in the middle of the night with a cold and very wet sleeping bag .	-1
Terrible for shower use , only for changing or privacy ... unless you have a way to secure 5 gal solar shower bag nearby ! Hot , not enough venting at top or on sides.Velcro is weakUsed at 2014 Coachella . Good thing I had a 10 ' metal rack canopy tent to secure this too ! Or it would n't have survived the winds without paracord.Save your $ , buy a Stinky Pete .	-1
Ok let me start the review honestly by saying I love Everlast and I 'm a huge supporter of most of their products . They used to make really good hand warps . Im not sure what is different but I can saw durring hardcore mma their old warps held up for almost a year of VERY HARD USEAGE . However these ones fell apart after just some mild heavy bag drills maybe 10 hrs of use . Really sad to discredit Ever Last however ive been noticing that their new lines seem to be trash . These warps are trash buy something better .	-1
this compass was not a true Tritium compass it is mismarked and I have sent mine back . The real ones are really bright without having to charge in the sun .	-1
I bought this book thinking I 'd learn some stuff about knife throwing but I had already learned a lot of the things mentioned online or through experience . I 'm not saying the book is 100 % useless but it definitely was n't worth it .	-1
The guy that wrote this might b a knife efficianado but he does n't know how to write a book , I learned basically nothing from the ten mins it took me to read this pamphlet . I would recommend YouTube	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . It might make interesting reading for a child , but that is about it .	-1
it 's less of an instructional knife throwing book and more a rather uninteresting life story on Gil Hibben . I like to think one can usually find a few useful piece of information in any book , and this has a few , but do n't justify the purchase price . It 's flimsy and cheaply bound and almost seems like something that should come free with a set of Gil Hibben throwing knives ! !	-1
This belt is fine - if you only use it as a reflective belt . But it has a big disadvantage because of its spandex `` stretchiness '' . It is not ideal for attaching stuff to it.I bought a much better 1/4 inch 100 % reflective vinyl belt , fully adjustable with a spade clip fastener and with no stretch ( thus no sag and bounce ) . The entire belt is reflective , as opposed to the thin reflective strip on the spandex belt . A night time jogger needs at least three things : a reflective belt , a cell phone in a water resistant case , and a flashlight . I have found the greatest way to carry a flashlight is to attach it to your reflective belt at your side and have it point forward . This method is `` hands free '' . But you can only do this with a non-stretch vinyl belt that prevents the beam from bouncing ( adjusting the flashlight to `` wide beam '' also eliminates a bouncing spot ) . Since I often run in a park which has bears , wild hogs , and coyotes , I also carry a 4 '' can of mace ( for psychological comfort ) . With a non-stretch vinyl belt , I can carry all these items attached to the belt . Since the weight is distributed at the waist , you hardly know the stuff is there .	-1
`` Ow , Ow , Ow , Ow ! ! ! ! Get them off me . . . '' - Me after 10 seconds of trying these on . Went straight back to Amazon .	-1
What 's wrong with mine ! I ordered the product based on many positive reviews . Just couple times using it and it 's foggy .	-1
Fogged up , hurt my face , water got in ... . strap was n't comfy - I 've decided to swim without goggles at this point -- -- but that 's just me .	-1
Like many here , I am on the search for a really good pair of goggles which are comfortable , do n't fog and do n't leak . Sadly I am still looking.I tried the different nose pieces on these but none of them was at all comfortable . I was able to use them for about three laps of the pool then had to switch back to my other goggles since they were so painful across the bridge of my nose . They also fogged up very fast so I had to keep taking them off and on again . Leakage was not too much of a problem but since they were too painful to wear that does n't help much.10 hours after removing the goggles , I noticed a small indentation remaining across the bridge of my nose . The plastic used for the nose-piece is very hard and rigid . In my opinion these goggles would be vastly improved if a softer material could be used .	-1
I 've had 2 pair of these one I bought and another pair my boyfriend bought for me because I forgot to tell him to avoid these . Both fogged up horribly on the 1st swim . I 'm not sure what the deal is with these goggles but Speedo needs to change what they are doing with this style .	-1
I received the pair of these goggles I ordered this morning . When I opened the box and tried them on , the nose piece that was on the goggles immediately broke . It did n't just come off ; it broke off . This goggle comes with additional nose pieces . With difficulty I was able to install another nose piece but do no feel confident that it will stand the test of time . If these goggle 's nose piece was good and they knew it , they would n't send you a bag of extras.The goggles are also uncomfortable.I had kids on a USS swim team for 13 years . I 've bought and have personally used a lot of goggles . These are not worth your time . Keep looking.I gave these goggles one star because I could n't give it zero stars .	-1
This product may be great . But it does not fit well , I bought it this on sale and did not try for a month ... now I ca n't return this . Basically the nose does not fit well , perhaps I have a larger face .	-1
This cap was definitely too small for my average sized head and felt very uncomfortable when swimming laps . Ended up buying a cap for long hair ( even though mine is short ) which is much more comfortable .	-1
I decided to grow my hair out and the time in the pool was damaging it . So I got this swim cap based on the number of reviews ( only way with Amazon ) . The short of it - it does n't stay on . Maybe I have an alien head shape ? It does n't matter - moving on to plan B which is trying a swim cap with ear pockets . We 'll see ...	-1
Do n't recommend unless you have a small head . It is much smaller than average . Very tight even for a 4 year-old . Returned .	-1
I have mid-back length hair , which also happens to be very thick . This cap absolutely will not stay on my head - even if I twist my hair into the smallest shape possible , the cap still pops right off . Huge bummer , because the one that I bought has a really cool blue and white ombre pattern . Overall , this is a well-made swim cap , it just does n't work well if you have a lot of hair to wear it over . I 'm going to try the Speedo cap for long hair next and see if it works any better ...	-1
one size does n't fit all .it has little resistance in the water waste of my money . would not recommend kids can play with these	-1
Speedo Aqua Fit Training Swim GlovesI swim every day , mostly for the exercise ; however , I felt that was n't getting enough of that , so I thought I 'd look into the possibilities of swimming gloves . I wanted to see what the experience of others had been , so I came to Amazon to find out . What I read reassured me . Many people have commented on the increased resistance swim gloves provide , so I took the plunge and bought these . My experience ? Total disappointment . I could n't see any significant difference between swimming with or without the gloves . No , more than that , I could n't see ANY difference , and I went so far as to try swimming with a glove on one hand and no glove on the other . No matter . I still could n't see any difference.I was thinking of buy other , larger swim gloves , but I have already spent enough money on equipment , so I 'll just chalk this one up to experience . Other people seem to have had different results , but I wo n't be taking these to the pool again.Many people said that the gloves are on the large side . That was n't my experience . I bought the Large size on the basis of the table provided by the seller , but I now wish I had bought the larger size , because the Large size I purchased was a little too small . Not small enough to disqualify the gloves but small enough to be too difficult put on and a little uncomfortable to wear .	-1
This shows gloves with a velcro wrist . What I recieved was two pair with zippers . The zippers are very low quality and more suited for doll clothes than athletic equipment . The zipper pull broke after a few months of use and I had to sew the sippers shut . I would not recommend these cheaply made gloves .	-1
I am disappointed with this product . It is much to bulky for comfort . I plan to return it and buy one of the smaller belts .	-1
it crawls up while you 're trying to walk through water and exercise . not very much water resistance for me	-1
do not buy if you do not have a lot of money , had it for a year am a grown woman so I am not playing orruff in the pool , it is all broken up~2nd it is so big way bigger than they said , I am not that big but my son is so I got this so we could sharehe never got to use it since it is broken	-1
The belt sizing on this item was misleading . The belt was indicated to be 55 '' long and I could not come close to getting it on with a 48 '' waist . Also , this item should be sized larger as one of it 's purposes is to help lose weight and it will probably be bought by larger sized people . I ended up fabricating a new belt that did fit but ultimately ended up buying an Aquajogger belt which has a heavy duty elastic belt and works much better as it does not `` creep up '' like the Speedo product and fits much better.Update : I bought a spare elastic belt for the Aquajogger and used it on the Speedo belt . So far , so good . I am keeping the Aquajogger belt in my SUV for use at the beach .	-1
I have been lifting for years now and owned numerous pairs of gloves , naturally they wear out . While these gloves are very well built the overall design is flawed and uncomfortable.Pros : Lots of cushion everywhereWrap around provides good wrist supportStyling is good , look niceCons : Gloves have so much cushion you can barely close your hand around the pull up bar or weights , not a good kind of cushion , way too much.I measured my hand to figure out the correct size as instructed and bought according to the sizing chart . While it fit my palm ok , the gloves were way too long for my fingers and way too much cushion . I do n't have odd hands and i 've never seen this problem before with any other brand . My pinky actually disappears in the glove when gripping the bar . I had to cut a half inch off the fingers in order to make them fit . Problem now of course is sharp edges and the huge variation from padded gloves to bare fingers makes them unusable.I have learned my lesson buying harbinger gloves , they were expensive and not even remotely worth it . This is n't the first time either . I have bought them in the past , same exact problem . Bulky , uncomfortable and didnt fit right and thanks to the excessive cushion it eliminates so much feeling especially when doing the bench press with heavy weight it makes it dangerous.They need to do a bit more research on what makes a weight lifting gloves good while not going over kill and ruining the point , add gripping ability , cushion the hand from heavy weight , prevent calluses and keep your hands dry . All while adding control and comfort . As the saying goes , they should fit you like a glove and become part of your hand , so you can lift longer with heavier weight without destroying your hands . These feel like a big mess and all you want to do is take them off.I was hoping to get used to them to break them in , I could n't stand them . I went back to my old gloves that are falling apart .	-1
this was to small had to return my hubby has tiny hands but it was way to small they sent me the large one	-1
Stained my hands after 1st use , so threw in washer on light cycle , they fell apart , threw out rather than deal with return	-1
Have not used these very much and they are already tearing on me and will not last much longer . I will go with Valeo from now on	-1
These just felt bulky in all the wrong places of the hand . After using them for lifting my hands ( nerves/ligaments ) were actually hurting , especially towards the end of the workout ( while they did not hurt while doing the same sets w/o the gloves on prior days ) . I have average hands and ordered size L - yet they were very tight still - difficult to put on and even more pain to take off later ( had to pull off each finger separately ) . It 's funny , I had some gloves that came with a Makita circular saw and since I had nothing else I used those for lifting - and my hands felt much more comfortable in those gloves than in these . I would not recommend these gloves .	-1
On my second workout the palm on one of the gloves tore . I also found these gloves to be quite uncomfortable compared to other gloves .	-1
I 've had a number of Harbinger gloves over the years and never had a pair to bleed on me until these . I use these for an hour of bootcamp at 5:00 am , and so I sweat quite a bit . The back of the gloves will bleed the dye onto my hands which I have to scrub very hard to remove . If you sweat , do n't buy these .	-1
This is a very thin glove . I mean almost not there . Like wearing a plastic glove . What ever it is made of does not feel like leather or natural like it is advertising .	-1
The side of the glove is already torn and one of the stitching in the webbing of the glove is already coming off . As a graduate student , I can only currently fit in two week workouts . I 've started heavily lifting again barely less than a month ago and it 's already starting to tear . My cycling gloves are stronger than that ! You have to be kidding me ... Money wasted , pretty much.Another tip is to probably buy one size up . It was a good fit , pretty much perfect for me but this glove does stretch and can really choke the webbing of your fingers or constrict some movement of your hand . I 'm stuck with these gloves I guess ... They 're not bad , but they are far from good as I initially believed of them .	-1
Received these and was disappointed with the detail tailoring - the tailoring around the finger openings is loose/sloppy . This allows the material to gather or bunch and can be uncomfortable.I ordered the Large based on other reviews - but I think if you measure your hand correctly , the sizing will be accurate.The final straw for me was the oversized velcro closure on the back - so large it digs into the wrist when you fold your hand up - I ca n't use these , they are a return for something else .	-1
I use these to lift and when holding heavier free weights , there are pressure points that show up where some of the seams are . Not enough padding and seams placed badly .	-1
These are only OK gloves . They will work fine for occasional use , but are not very well made and mine fell apart after heavy use . The stitching on the index finger was the first place to give.Also , these take absolutely forever to dry out when they get wet .	-1
They have decent grip but they are so cheaply made . Bought these 3 months ago and the seams have already fallen apart . The entire palm has opened up and flaps around . I only use these glove at the gym . They look like I bought them last year . I ca n't believe how crappily these are made . My other complaint is that the gloves roll up under your fingers . You 're constantly pulling them out . The part where your fingers come out roll back inwards thus becoming a groove/bump under your fingers which become somewhat painful if you 're doing ( say pull ups ) . It 's like you 're pressing your hand down on a pencil . Wo n't order again	-1
I just received the gloves and the left hand is one full size smaller ( and believe me , my hands are the same size ... I do n't have the problem of having one hand being bigger than the other ) . Both gloves have a tag inside that say they are both M size , but the left is uncomfortably smaller . My best theory is that the warehouse some how accidentally attached a M-size-label to the left hand glove . Now what am I supposed to do with half a pair of gloves ?	-1
I bought this gloves so I would n't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout . One reviewer is clearly confused . They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand . Turns out there is no metal bar in it , but instead it was plastic or something similar . Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles . This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years . Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years . Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags . They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them . Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work . But they need to be greatly improved upon .	-1
I bought the large size , and it fit like a medium . My friend who 's about a 33 & # 34 ; waist was just barely able to to use this . We were able to trade , since he had a bought an XL , and it barely fit my 37 & # 34 ; waist . I 'd would have had to return this otherwise . Need to get the sizing fixed .	-1
The mat itself has a nice feel to it but it stretches a lot so if you are trying to do any form of yoga , sphinx pushups , etc it will keep stretching ( immediately , not over time ) until you have bad form . It also slides around on the floor easily because it 's not tacky at all . So you can not can not do jumping at any angle at all on this or you will be on your butt on the floor . Nice thickness but too stretchy and slippery . Not safe for P90X .	-1
I was very disopointed when this arrived it is a poor quality mat and will not stay in place it slips very easy and does not offer much of a cushion the material is awful it is way over priced . It should be sold in the dollor tree for a buck I would look elsewhere if you want a good yoga/workout mat . Only good thing I will say is I like that you can roll it back up easy	-1
I , unfortunately , must have received a damaged balance trainer because it leaks air . At first I thought I might be imagining it , so I added more air and , sure enough , it deflates rather quickly . I can even hear the *hiss* from the air escaping when I stand on it . So I fear I can not recommend this product ! My experience seems to be out of the ordinary , at least compared to the other reviews I 've read , so perhaps you 'll have better luck . I bumped up my review from one to two stars because I think that a ( non-leaky ) trainer would be a pretty good bang for your buck . However , if you have more money to spend , I think a Bosu Balance Trainer is a far better option . You have a lot more room to stand on it , and it can be used for both balance and cardio exercises .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in this product . The best thing I can say is it comes in a nice sturdy box and I like the blue color of the product . The balance trainer itself reminds me of a flattened , underinflated playground ball . Other reviewers say there is a way to add more air and I do see what looks to be a valve , but there are no instructions anywhere . There is n't even a piece of paper describing the product . The box does n't have photos of the product in use . There is a reference to the manufacturer 's website and that site has a small .pdf copy of a brochure which gives disclaimers about the product and a few exercises that can be done using the balance trainer , some of which require two balance trainers . There is one exercise in which you stand on the trainer and simulate walking that is n't too bad , but I quickly became bored with it . At this point , this product will probably end up unused in my basement . I do n't think it 's worth trying to figure out how to add more air .	-1
Quality just keeps getting worse and worse over the years . Started ripping after just a few workouts . This style keeps changing often and the quality keeps getting worse . I 've switched to other styles .	-1
It did n't really work for me , I actually found it to be uncomfortable and caused me some pain after a couple of 6 mile rides .	-1
First off , the picture shows a nice looking sleeveless shirt that 's snug around your shoulders and arm pits . However , the product is a cut out of the sleeves that goes all the way down to the lower part of your ribs ! Returning to Amazon/Russell Athletic ! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone !	-1
The shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out . It 's like wearing a football jersey without sleeves or pads . Also , the arm holes are too large . Skip it .	-1
Yeah well first of all it 's very cheap made , I personally never saw anything looks cheaper than this thingy and its price is not an excuse . Basically it 's just a piece of cloth which looks like tank top ) Size L is too wide but guys with belly would be happy -- it 's covering all `` non juicy curves '' .Looks like there 's problem with good tank tops for gym in US in general because in Europe there 's an amazing sports goods super market Decathlon where there 're plenty of good quality clothing with excellent value . For example , I bought nice tank top for 6 euro and it lasts 2 years already with I do n't know how many laundry loads and still fits me just perfect.I 've checked $ 10 and $ 30 tank tops here in US and non of them even close to that one.I ca n't say `` do n't buy '' because you have no choice here ) ) )	-1
Compared with any other clothing I wear , including other cotton tanks , this product is substantially undersized . I will shortly return it for a larger size and perhaps a different brand .	-1
I 've had some Russell Tees for a few years now and I love them in the winter because they are bulky and heavy . Either I ordered the wrong item or their quality has gone down the toilet . Actually , I think it 's both . The fit 's ok , the colors are ok , but the material is paper thin ! I 'll keep them and wear them in the summer , although I do n't need more summer tees , but I certainly would never buy them again at any price ! Walmart tees are FAR superior to these in quality of the material . Incidently , there is nothing I can find on these shirts or on the tags that indicate what the material is . I thought that was a law . label says & # 34 ; Made in El Salvador of USA fabric & # 34 ; .	-1
When I got these shirts they fit great ! After one washing in cold water and air - drying it turned into a different shirt . They got a lot shorter , up to my belt short and the neck got a lot bigger , showing lots of skin in the front and back . Yet some how they stayed wide . They are great if you want a disposable shirt .	-1
Dissapointed , noone makes a good t-shirt anymore ! I like the tank tops from russel but these shirts are horrible.The texture of the shirt is very very scratchy , and they wrinkle pretty bad . I only wear them around the house because of the wrinkling bull crap . Well , on to the next brand to waste some more money on what is probably more chinese outsourced junk	-1
ordered an XL , runs like a small Large.washed it three times , and it 's still too itchy to wear.would not recommend .	-1
They take up too much space , and given the size , you 're better just taking the whole bottle . I sent them back .	-1
These gloves are not terrible for $ 15 or less ; the reason they get 2 stars is because of the weak wrist support and the misleading pics . Amazon has pics of 12 different gloves with all sorts of different makes under this product . The initial one is accurate , these are the new style 'pro ' gloves with the elastic wrist band rather than the old vinyl or leather wrap that gave support . A cost cutting measure to use less expensive material I 'm sure.I bought the previous generation 'pro gloves ' from 2008 and even now , 5 years later they offer better wrist support than the new ones . Do not hit anything with these without wrapping your wrists well ! 180 & # 34 ; wraps , no BS.I plan to return these and put that money towards some better made budget gloves under $ 50 - either a better made pair of everlasts , maybe some ryval or venums , kofightgear I hear makes good inexpensive gloves , I think any of these would be a better investment than these . Then again for $ 15 , they are tempting to keep , but i know id try to use them as i would a better made glove , likely with bad results . Protect your wrists folks , those injuries tend to compound .	-1
These gloves are great for extreme beginner boxers , but that 's about it , and only for like a month or so . The impact cushion is cheap foam , the shape is strange and requires too much effort to make a proper fist , which could result in a serious strain and or broken metacarpal.Do yourself a favor and invest in some better quality gloves , you will want to replace them pretty soon anyways . Unless you are super broke and you really need gloves asap , invest the $ 24 that these cost and buy quality gloves .	-1
I bought these gloves as a replacement for some cheap $ 20 bulk generic made-in-China gloves my boxing gym has available . Because they are Everlast , I thought they would be good . I 've been very disappointed . These gloves offer almost no wrist support , and I had to start using wraps to protect my wrists . After about 4 weeks of medium-duty use , the vinyl is peeling and the stitching is falling apart . The only good thing I can say about them is that they do n't smell as bad as other gloves I 've used , so they do seem to resist odor as advertised .	-1
construction was s*** bought 3 pairs , the velcro was stictched on backwards on two of the wraps -- two separate ones ! shoddy , pos constructon , the threads started to wear open after minimal use	-1
If you wrap your wrists properly , you 'll see these are both too narrow and too short , way too short.Do not get these if you are hitting the heavy bag . They just wo n't protect/support your wrists or knuckles .	-1
At one time , you just needed to see the Everlast brand name to be assured that you were getting a top-quality product : one that would withstand anything you could throw at it.Now that they 've outsourced their manufacturing to China , Everlast quality is not the virtual guarantee that it once was.I purchased ( and use ) these wraps . However , one of them was manufactured improperly . The velcro closure is sewn to a different side of the wrap than it is on all the others . Because of this , I always ended up putting it on backwards . I finally marked it so I would know to put it on differently than the others.For around $ 10 , you should expect to get something that has passed a quality-control check . After all , wraps are just some strips of cloth and velcro ; they probably cost about $ 0.25 to manufacture.These wraps are short , just over 100 inches , but fine for hitting the bag . They are not elasticized , but that is fine for my purposes , as it 's what I prefer . If you want to do serious sparring or fighting , or if you want to put some padding on your knuckles ( under the wraps ) , you 'll need longer wraps than these . In short : you can wrap your wrist , knuckles , and thumb with these , but you wo n't have enough material to wrap between your fingers . They come packed in a plastic mesh bag , but it ca n't easily be reused . A cloth mesh bag with a drawstring would have been better.Summary : overpriced and shoddily-made .	-1
They did not last that long very cheap quality after 5 washed in the past 4 months they are shredded .	-1
OK , I 'm new to this , just got this to expand my exercise a bit . So as I 'm punching away , the bag has a tedency to spin a bit . No matter how much I tighten it up , even with the lock washer , it spins the bolt right out of the nut.Do n't bother with this , or if you get this , also buy a separate swivel mechanism . I 'm taking mine down and replacing it with something that acutally incorporates a swivel of sorts - the only `` swivel '' this allows is the bottom piece spinning , which puts the torque on the bolt which then spins out of the nut on top .	-1
If you are a cheapskate and are willing to endure joint pain then this is the one for you.Ladies , if your husband buys this for you , then he needs to dip into his beer money . Do not think this is a product designed for training . It is too hard and made from the cheapest materials money can buy . I am sorry Neverlast , but you have a terrible name in the Boxing community for quality and understanding what athletes need.Buy bags with foam liners , perferribly 2.5 to 3 inch thick liners.Sorry , but avoid this junk .	-1
I 've returned two of these bags . Both came in boxes that were previously opened ( the original Everlast tape was cut open and retaped with clear packing tape . ) The bags were not packed consistantly . Most importantly , what feels like sandbags were placed randomly just under the Nevatear cover . Great cover ! However , a few hard punches into packed rags and then a sudden hard shot into sand is unsafe . I 'm sure they make a good product , but I 'm having a hard time getting one . Got ta move on .	-1
I like the design . They seem to be made really well and look great . Unfortunately , I found them entirely unbearable . They pinch in on the side of my head on both sides in just the right place to induce a horrible headache within 5 minutes . I 've never had another pair of sunglasses do this before .	-1
I got this to take to the range , it is very long which is nice , however it is poorly made . The material is very thin and has a light plastic backing that will not hold up over the long term and forget about washing this , it wo n't make it . I had to return mine as it was ripped.I do n't recommend unless you just need something to lay your shotgun/rifle on but nothing more.Vidimo Se !	-1
I bought the 15 '' version of this adapter , and I own a number of others including a short version of this same thing . I 'm sad to say this is the thinnest steel of all my various hitch adpaters , and the only one I with a Curt label . All my other adapters are 3/16 '' steel , while this is only 1/8 '' .I could tell right away this adapter was made of thinner material , just be the sheer light weight compared to my others . Being longer , I would have expected thicker steel used by Curt , but no . Its the thinnest of all , and not likely a better grade that would allow thinner steel . Not at this price . All I know is , it better not bend ! ! !	-1
I have a Buyer brand adapter that fits poorly on my 1 1/4 '' cargo carrier . It causes the carrier to flop around quite a bit.I tried the Curt brand adapter hoping for a better fit . Nope.It 's loose in the 1 1/4 '' end and the 2 '' end.Why ca n't these company 's make there products true to size ? I ended up shimming up the Buyer adapter with some Stainless Steel shim stock.Anyone need a Curt adapter cheap ?	-1
I ordered XLT and got a 4XL . I mean it fit my 330 lb dad just fine but for me this was like a dress . I do n't know what they were thinking when sizing these but it is craziness .	-1
I returned the shorts because the fit was way oversized . I am a big guy but these shorts were just not sized correctly . Unless you like overly baggy clothes I would suggest ordering at least one size smaller than usual .	-1
Did not care for these shorts , elastic wait band not totally covered , so it rips at you skin after wearing for awhile . The more active you are the worse it feels . Also these are the only mens large I have ordered that are smaller then other large sizes alredy owned .	-1
I bought 3 pairs of these Russell shorts and based on previous experience had no reason to think they would be anything but great . I put on the first pair to wear straight out of the box . In short order when I went to put something in the right pocket I realized it had no bottom . The pocket had not been sewn properly and was open and continuing to unravel.Amazon 's customer service is usually great so I do n't anticipate a problem but it is shoddy workmanship from a brand I have always trusted .	-1
this really should n't be purchased . yea its cheap and it appears it might work , but really it does n't . the bike wants to fall over and it leans against the spokes . spend $ 40 and get a good metal rack that holds the whole back tire .	-1
This thing is not worth what it costs . The light is low quality and not bright . It feels flimsy and cheep . The helmet mount is equally disappointing . I would value this item at about $ 5 , so paying $ 20 for it is , needless to say , a rip-off . On some level , I feel I deserve to have overpaid as celestial retribution for having bought a bike light on Amazon and not my LBS . Do n't buy this overpriced item .	-1
Not much for a hundred yard . Might be alright if it wasnt so fuzzy , the on I got was a fifty yard unit as best .	-1
While this appears nice on the outside it has BUNK internals . After installing weaver rings , a hassle all it 's own , I mounted this on my rifle and found that there was not enough UP deflection available to even get on the paper at 50 feet . Bottom line is this is CRAP .	-1
this scope is a 1.5 x 30 at best was not clear and has no way to adjust the focus . not a good buy at all , the other scope that i purchased was just fine .	-1
At the time I paid [ ... ] with free shipping which it is not a bad deal.I have a few 4x scopes in other brands ; Winchester and Bushnell . This `` tactical '' scope in no way can called a 4x at all . The targets are too small on the cross hairs . Right now I am having a lot if difficulty zeroing it in , and this is not the first time in such task.My recommendation is to pay at least 10 to 15 more dollars and buy a better scope . The glass is way cheap , I mean the quality , and feels I am looking through a straw . Adjustments is too hard as well.The good thing is it is a small tactical scope , the pictures makes it look bigger . The construction seems solid and of acceptable aluminum grade . The eye relief is good and gives minimal glare , but my main grudge once again is it is NOT a 4x scope , maybe a 2.5 to 3x ...	-1
Pretty much a toy.If you are shooting anything bigger than a 22 or further than 50 yards you will be sorely disappointed.Great for a bb or pellet gun or maybe an airsoft , but that is probably about it .	-1
Returned these polos before ever wearing them once . Incredibly cheap and thin material-less than some of my t-shirts . You can alsmot see through them and they look like they 're about to fall apart.Spend the extra few bucks and get a quality shirt , these are worthless .	-1
These shirts are very low quality . You get what you pay for I guess . The collar does not lay down well at all and there was significant piling after only a couple washes . I ended up buying different shirts from Kohls for my husband .	-1
Fits ok in the chest , then flares out to accomodate a huge belly.As the average Joe in the Usa eats himself into oblivion , it is harder and harder for guys with athletic or normal BMI 's to find shirts that are not cut like maternity blouses . This shirt it thick and too course to wear in the Tucson heat , even if I were to add 60 pounds to my belly to fill it out some ... . Buy accordingly to your own phyical physical shape . If you need to try to `` hide '' your belly , and it is n't too hot , you will probably love this shirt .	-1
The description on Amazon 's page stated the tablets are 1 '' x1 '' x1 '' . Actual tablets received were only 1/2 '' x7/8 '' ( CIRCLE , NOT CUBE ! ) .I thought I could make my Esbit pocket stove economical to use with these tablets , but it actually takes two Coghlan 's tablets to equal one Esbit . The package claims a 9 minute burn time . My test run actually yielded 10 minutes , however , due to the tablet 's diminutive size , the heat output was notably lower than an Esbit tab . My test run ( one Coghlan 's tab for 10 minute life ) brought 1 cup of water up to about 150 degrees - barely hot enough to brew coffee ( Esbit pocket stove , Snowpeak 600 mug , foil lid , windscreen was used ) . While Esbit tabs completely disappear after a burn , the Coghlan 's left a pile of ash at the end . Chipping away this pile revealed a small amount of still burnable fuel underneath.It should be noted that the Coghlan 's package made no claims about product dimensions - it was Amazon 's site that made the false/misleading statement.Be aware of what you are actually ordering ...	-1
Cheap rubber . This worked great for little while but actually tore completely in half after only about a week of training .	-1

This case will protect guns in moderate shipping environments , such as going to the range and back . For more demanding shipping , such as mail or air , I would n't use it.The foreend of a Remington 1100 can be felt bulging against the plastic . This is because the case was n't built wide enough . With this tight of a fit , the foam padding is completely compressed . While the plastic affords some protection , a solid hit against the side of the case would damage the firearm . The plastic is somewhat thin.The foam was n't attached to the walls of the case . Upon opening , one piece of foam would be laying on the other with one wall of plastic bare where the foam should be . This created a minor hassle when putting a gun in the case . I used hot glue to tack the foam to the plastic which solved the problem . If you do n't have a hot glue gun , maybe doulbe-sided tape or five-minute epoxy would work.There are four latches . These can be completely removed from the case . Sometimes one will come off unexpectedly . I can forsee a situation when I will leave the range and a latch will remain behind . The case is sufficiently flexible that the remaining three latches would not hold the case together completely.You might be able to get two child-sized guns or two small carbines in this case . Do n't expect to get two full-sized guns in it.I 'm still looking for a good , reasonably priced gun case .	-1
This case is big and easily carry two rifles or shotguns . However , the interior padding is of poor quality and the outer shell seems like ti would crack with the first impact . Now granted , I do n't expect Pelican quality at this price point - but I would recommend spending a bit more $ $ and getting a much better quality case that will last you a lifetime .	-1
It is very inexpensive , so I guess I do n't have much to gripe about but ... Anything you put in it will slide around . The foam is n't attached to the side walls and the foam falls down when you open the case . I glued the foam to the walls and that worked well . However , I have n't thought of a fix for everything sliding around yet . I spent 4 times the cost of this on a purchase of a lockable hand gun case which has been beyond perfect . Lesson learned : You get what you pay for .	-1
The pump o-ring deforms too easily . It looks like it 's worn out from age hardening prior to being shipped . The internal lube is fine , but this just does n't really work well unless you get it the year it 's made .	-1
I have a small infestation of German cockroaches and I was really hoping this product is the answer . I received this in May 13 , 2013 and have used it up until today . That 's roughly a three weeks trial.Before I continue , I think it 's fair to know some background on German cockroaches in particular.1 . They are very small , normal adult size is the size of your pinky finger nail ... so unless they 're on the move it 's hard to see them.2 . They are the only breed of roaches I know of to eat their own kind when in need of food . This is also how they develop tolerance to your typical baits from the hardware store.3 . They choose to come out only at night , when lights are all off , and prefers to craw with both sides of their bodies in contact with a surface . This makes them hard to find , as they can only be found in small little cracks.4 . For the adult female , they are the only breed that carries egg patches with them wherever they go , unlike the other breeds that left the egg in plain sight . This makes particularly hard to eradicate because their offspring are as mobilized as their mother.This ultrasonic pest repeller although may worked out well for others , unfortunately did not work out for me . Just yesterday , I 've had two roaches crawling around in the kitchen completely oblivious to the ultrasound being produced from the machine . They 're still around going about business as usual , not a care in the world .	-1
I purchased this unit because I read the good reviews and thought I would give it a try for my problem with squirrels . Each year squirrels nest the in same spot above my living room ceiling in my attic . I had an A/C outlet installed in my attic near the nest ( about 10 ft away ) and installed this pest repeller . I set the pest switch to insects/rodents and the volume to medium initially for about a week and left it on 24/7 . The squirrels were not deterred . I changed the settings to rodents and loud and even installed it on a timer so that it would only come on at night since the loud setting can be heard in the living room and adjacent kitchen . After several weeks of use the squirrels are still there . I wish I could return it as it does n't work for the squirrels in my attic . I am past the 30 days return period . I guess I can try it on insects and see if it keeps the roaches away that are outside on the back deck !	-1
they were soooo good , I went for an identical pair , but they quality has dropped a LOT , it is hard to show in words , these are thinner , awfully stitched , fingers are not cushioned like previous which was a big plus for me , since fingers are not cushioned , the thin leather in the fingers folds and wrinkles and is uncomfortable when grabbing the bar , they feel flimsy ... totally dissapointed with the second pair ...	-1
It seems Ocelot was purchased by Valeo ( in 2011 ) . I edited my original review in 2010 , but the date of the review was not updated.While they look like the same glove , they are not . This is what I dislike : - Goat skin is not as durable . Calf skin was much better . Why did they change the type of leather ... local manufacturing sensitivity ? Made in Pakistan ) - Shorten finger lengths . The goat skin is bunching during lifting- Not true to size . My hand is 8 '' around . A large is extremely tight fittingWhat I do like : - Valeo still uses the memory foam- The look- The addition of the terry cloth on the thumbI will no longer purchase this weight lifting glove . Valeo should have left well enough alone . They took an excellent product and cheapen it .	-1
I bought these a while back so I could have some additional wrist support while lifting , and also to help avoid the cheese-grater and callous effect the weight bars have on my palms . Thus far they have held up very well , and I have been pleased with the purchase . I DO wish the colors were a bit more `` sporty '' ( e.g black leather and red/blue fabric ) , and that it had some sweat fabric on the thumb like a cycling glove , but those are nitpicky things . They fit well , are comfortable to wear , and do n't get smelly . I am very satisfied with this purchase , and would highly recommend these gloves.UPDATE 09/03/09 : After having used the gloves for slightly over a year now , I want to report that they are STILL very solid . There have not been a ton of loose threads or fraying at the fingers , which is good . The leather has held up and worn well , considering I lift 3 days a week and of course the bars are `` grooved '' , which digs into the leather . I have found the gloves to be very comfortable and the elastic on the wrist straps still has a lot of stretch . It 's very easy to get these gloves too tight , but you can just re-wrap . The velcro has held up well and is almost so grabby that it 's hard to un-do sometimes . My hands DO NOT get hot in these gloves . Though I still contend that some terry cloth on the back of the gloves or along the thumb line for sweat would be helpful , it 's nothing a gym towel ca n't take care of . And per my previous comments , these gloves ARE made in all-black , for anyone who does n't want the natural leather look . Hands down , I believe these are some of of the best lifting gloves on the market ! UPDATE 08/15/11 : The `` pinky '' finger of the left glove finally split out on me about a month ago . Otherwise , these gloves are still holding up pretty well . It 's a bit of a bummer , actually , because that 's really the only thing wrong with them at this point . I will definitely purchase these gloves again , when I decide my old ones have had enough.UPDATE 12/14/11 : I finally decided to order some new gloves . The old pair had held up fairly well for the abuse they were given , so I thought I could n't go wrong . Turns out , I did . While the old pair was made in either Korea or Taiwan , the new pair was made in Pakistan . They LOOK pretty much the same , but they are not . The leather feels cheaper , and the thumbs feel way too big . In fact , after less than a month of use , the thumbs are unravelling . Also , the velcro strap to tighten the gloves across the top of the hand do not reach the full length of the velcro on this pair . The color is rubbing off , revealing what appears to be black underneath ( unlike the old pair , which just showed worn leather ) . This new pair is VERY disappointing . As such , I have reduced my rating to 3-stars , giving some credit for the first pair but knocking off two stars for obvious quality issues . In the future , I 'll either find these in a store so I can check them out first , or I 'll go with another brand.UPDATE 01/22/13 : I have emailed Valeo about the quality of these gloves and to draw their attention to the negative reviews piling up on Amazon . That was on the 8th , and they have not responded . Thus , dropping my review one star further for poor customer service/response . It 's sad to see a great product trashed like this .	-1
This gloves started off well but they do n't last long . they are washable but do fade so wash by hand , only good for a few months .	-1
Do not buy these . Unfortunately , like most things these days , the gloves are made overseas in a sweat shop , in this case Pakistan . They are made cheap . The worst part is the dye that was used to color the leather bleeds and bleeds . I have thoroughly soaked these and wrang them out 100 times to try to get the dye out so they wo n't stain my hands , but no success . You will have brown hands after you workout , and the stains are hard to wash off . I just threw them out after 10 uses and ordered Harbinger Pro gloves .	-1
Do n't like it as is too long and does n't seem to be weighted correctly.Would not buy this again and wish I would have returned it .	-1
Looks like I wasted my money on this . I should 've taken 1 of the reviewers advice and not buy it . This jump rope clearly states that it has cancer causing chemical/materials . I was afraid of using it so I threw it away . Oh nevermind , I used it once but it is n't a great jump rope at all . For the price , you have a chance of getting cancer and a not so good quality piece of rope .	-1
Great price , but too long . For a 5'3 '' person , its too long , and the adjustment is not feasible . Also , the rope itself HURTS when hit by the extreme length .	-1
The rope comes pretty long . There are instructions on how to shorten the rope . You open the handles to expose the crimped end of the rope , with one extra crimp to use after you cut to your desired length . You get one shot . I cut it , put the crimp in place and squeezed it , which broke the crimp and sent it flying . The rope was ruined before I spun it even one time.Spend a couple more bucks and get a decent rope .	-1
The down side to this jump rope is that the rope itself is so kinked and crooked that it wo n't straighten out . I would recommend a weighted rope instead .	-1
I adjusted the length fairly easily , that 's not a problem . The 2 problems are:1 ) the plastic rope itself never straightened out from being in the package -- always had kinks in it.2 ) the ball bearings did n't work smoothly and after a minute of jumping , I had to stop and untangle . that sucked ...	-1
These weights are horrible if you ever actually remove the weight packets to adjust the weights . I bought both the 5 and 10 pound versions and both do the same . It does not matter how gentle you are . the little weight bags split open right off the bat , and when they do they leak grey , gritty , nasty sand everywhere . These are useless ! I 'm going to end up returning these both the same day they were opened . If there was a zero star option these would get that .	-1
These weights are adjustable by adding and removing sand bags , however the sand bags are not sturdy and tear easily . Also , the sand actually looks like dirt to me and not sand at all . Valeo was great when dealing with customer service . They sent me a brand new set of weights , no questions asked , after I sent them an e-mail and pictures of the sand bags . I hope the replacement holds up better than the originals did .	-1
They would be so much more useful if they were looped instead of just a straight band . I had to tie knots in them for most exercises . They are also kind of cheap and do n't offer as much resistance as I would have liked , they are very thin . You get what you pay for ...	-1
It said it fit most . I did not fit into the category of `` most '' . I was unable to use the item since it did not fit me .	-1
According to the instructions , this product can be used to tone the abs . There are several videos on the internet showing fitness instructors demonstrating how to use the wheel . I never could get coordinated enough to use it . I 'm not saying it does n't work . Just that I was not able to push and pull it as smoothly as it is advertised .	-1
It works for it 's purpose , but is kind of cheap and not a sturdy piece of equipment . Come on , just because you slap a company name on a product , does not qualify it as a quality product . Use stiffer , stronger materials and charge a few dollars more .	-1
your gon na buy this thing just like me and use it once , dont kid your self , and why cant you just do crunches , hahaa dont kid your self guys , i made the mistake	-1
It does n't stay no matter how tight I make the belt . I bend down to do dead lifts , and the belt rides up . I 've had personal trainers look at it and were n't thrilled either .	-1
This is bonded leather and seemed pretty cheap to me , I will pay a bit more and get a belt of higher quality that I can depend on lasting and not bursting during a squat or DL	-1
This belt is great , if you do n't actually lift . When you start doing heavy squats , deadlifts , rack pulls , and overhead presses , you realize the flaws in this belt . There is not nearly enough support up front so the IAP is inadequate , and the thickness of the leather used is an absolute joke ( although understandable given the price ) . The rough section of the leather tore entirely around the holes on mine ( it 's as if i 'd taken a knife and cut through the rough gray portion and stopped at the black leather front portion rendering the belt unsafe and useless ; and this was after approximately month of owning it . I used it twice a week on leg days , and twice a month I do OHP instead of seated dumbbell so it was worn no more than 10 times . My replacement is a Schiek competition power belt , and the difference in quality , weight , and thickness is staggering.Basically if you 're the type that wears belts while you do preacher curls and pec dec , this is for you . If your goal is putting up big numbers on squats , deadlifts , OHP , rack pulls , etc ... I sincerely hope you steer clear .	-1
My experience with this band seems to be different than other reviewers . The orginal band on my Seiko Aquamatic lasted only a few months . Great watch , lousy band . It was polyurethane and my experience is that polyurethane bands will crack and break . This was advertised as a rubber watch band . Real rubber will last for years though I have n't seen real rubber watch bands lately . I ordered this as a replacement and in a year or so it also cracked and broke . I replaced with with one I made myself from nylon webbing . The Seiko watch on the other hand is a great self winding watch . The one I have is my second one . The first lasted many years of diving and hard wear .	-1
OK to heat some broth , tea , or coffee.These have been around for years.When I was a kid ( 1960 's ) I put mine in my small day pack along with a can of Sterno , a can of beef-a-ronni , my canteen , and my boy scout knife ( can opener , knife , fork all-in-one type ) .It took about ten minutes before it was hot enough to my liking.In my opinion I would n't depend on them.Canned heat is best used for a chafing dish to keep food that was already hot .	-1
I might keep something like this around for a one time emergency like in a winter car blizzard kit . But if you think this may be a suitable camp cook stove for regular use then you are in for a disappointment.I got it thinking it might work well for a cheap housing for an alcohol stove but it proved to more trouble than it was worth.The entire unit is stamped steel , so while it is strong and durable that means it it will transfer heat to every part and get very hot all the way around . For alcohol use that means it will get so hot that your alcohol will boil and evaporate off during use.The hole in the center is so small that your cookware only gets heat in a single small spot . May be good for boiling water , but anything else like heating soup will burn badly in a single spot . Also there is not enough space from the flame to the stove top so you are only about an inch from your heat source which means your sterno can or alcohol will get that much more reflected heat back to it.Cheap paint will burn and flake off after a few uses . Not a big problem unless you buy it new and then whip it out in an emergency and have to choke on the fumes of burning paint . Or if you plan on using it on the trail be prepared for rust once the paint burns off.Does n't really protect your flame source from ambient wind.All in all if I wanted something that I was going to almost treat as disposable in an emergency kit I may put this in there . It is pretty well built and will fold up compact ( but it is heavy ) and should hold up to various cookware being used on it.But outside of something like that it 's not for me .	-1
I have the 80 lb Cobra crossbow pistol , which is great . It came with three of these aluminum bolts and I ordered an extra pack of 12 aluminum bolts . Well , these bolts are terribly fragile . The plastic rear section that includes the fletching ( fins ) is quite brittle and breaks off easily . Once it breaks , they are not repairable . What can cause them to break ? Almost anything . A target that 's a little too hard , a slightly angled impact , etc . Order the plastic bolts available from Amazon and other sites . These plastic bolts are single piece , molded with a metal tip and are virtually unbreakable . Occasionally a metal tip will come off , but they are easy to glue back on with Superglue or any strong adhesive .	-1
The bolts break easily and often when shooting at a cardboard box containing Styrofoam -- hardly a hard target . I 'll have to look more carefully than I did before for a more expensive option since will most likely not purchase these again ( without finding a workaround for there apparent fragility ) .	-1
Not at all impressed with this product . I attached it to my propane tank and then attached it my lantern . I was able to hear the gas flowing but was not able to get my Coleman North Star lantern to light . Completely disappointed because I was looking forward to using this during my next camping trip . I 'm not sure why it is n't working but I 'm thinking it 's a pressure issue .	-1
At first glance this rack seems well designed . In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure . However , after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose . On closer inspection I realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and would n't tighten . After pulling it out I was n't surprised because the screw is made of plastic . I could n't believe it . The entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw . The screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either . It is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it . I ca n't believe that Saris would do this just to save a few bucks . This rack went back to Amazon and good riddance .	-1
Let 's be mature , open and frank about this : your money buys what seems to be a 6x4 '' ( maybe it 's 5x5 '' ) piece of grey microfiber cloth of which you can use about half because it 's permanently attached a little black neoprene pouch . When not in use , you can store the cloth inside the 1x1.5 '' pouch whose bottom end never closes.In my opinion , what you get is not worth half the money this sells for.The microfiber is in no significant way different from the dozens you would probably get for the same amount if you bought 'generic ' ones . Moreover , since one end of the pouch never closes , your ONE little microfiber cloth that 's supposed to help you clean your camera lens is likely to collect particles ( dust dirt ) and , since it 's attached to the pouch , you ca n't clean it unless you do n't mind ripping it off . But , if you do that , it 's just another piece of generic microfiber cloth.I seriously considered a one-star rating but I concluded that one star would not be entirely fair . It gets 2 star because it 's possible to clean lenses with it.________________________Note : If you do n't trust 'regular ' microfiber cloths you can get theNikon Complete Lens Cleaner Kitfor about what you pay for this item . It comes with 3 moist lens cleaning cloths , a little spray bottle with cleaner fluid and a much nicer ( in my view ) black microfiber cloth .	-1
I was really upset when I opened this and started to clean the lens on my new Nikon D800 . It was full of dust . I could n't believe it . I am very glad I had a filter on the lens and started on the filter rather than the costly lens itself . I 'm not sure how it will work once it is clean but I 've never had to clean a microfiber cleaning cloth before using it before in my life and I 'm an old fart .	-1
I like the convenience of having a cloth on my keychain ... but its always falling out of its sack ... so its getting dirty and kind of defeats the purpose	-1
I bought this as my conceal holster for my every day carry . However , I have Crimson Trace laser grips on the pistol . Since the holster come up to cover the top front edge of the grip , it pushes the holster out a little bit . This prints . However , the cant on this is much better than say a Don Hume . So it 's a tradeoff . You wo n't have a butt print at the back of your shirt but you will have a little line print along the top edge of the holster . I took that tradeoff . The first looks like you 're carrying a gun the second is anyone 's guess . It 's a bit sticky but regular use and firing drills should take care of that . Along with wrapping my pistol in a plastic bag and storing it overnight in the holster . Overall , a good OWB holster at a good price.Edit : After trying this a few times , I 've decided it prints too much with the Crimson Trace grips . Back it goes . I 've ordered one from Brommeland Gunleather instead .	-1
Piece of shet ! how hard could it be to make one of these that does n't crack after a day of playing ? ! I read the reviews on this b4 i bought and i figured they where doing something wrong but nope ... i used it for a whole day of paintball and it broke right at the circular connecting piece on top i 'm glad i noticed it as i was cleaning my marker during a break because it would have shot out at someone or me or my car window ... my friend has one of these for his a5 that has a metal connector and i want to find that soo badly but he forgot where he got it , if someone finds it please mesg me on amazon ( if u can do that ) i think it 's from rap4	-1
i got this for my mom who wanted to see how far she walks during her work hours , But this thing counts every little movement . It & # 8217 ; s good to give you a rough estimate but if you want a serious reading this is not for you .	-1
At first it appeared to be functioning properly although we had some difficulty determining and then setting our correct stride length . Then , the second time we used it , it said we had walked .90 miles when the GPS on our cell phone said the distance was 3.82 miles . We reset it , walked 20 steps and looked at the display . It read 14 steps . We will return it today .	-1
This bag is a piece of junk . The D-Rings pull apart quickly , the sandbags inside shift incredibly quickly and will suddenly make you feel like you 've punched a bag of concrete . Someone training hard could break bones in their hand , sprain a wrist , this bag is DANGEROUS . The material of the bag is slick , if you have sweat on your gloves a punch can slide right off the side of the bag . If you 're actually training , not just doing some light cardio , spend some real money and get a real bag . Everlast apparently is n't the legend of boxing equipment they used to be .	-1
Before I reveal its critical flaw , let me say I love the way the watch looks.That said , the watch has no backlight ! ! ! I can not see the analog time at night and the digital display is completely unreadable even in dim light ( have you ever seen an LCD display on a watch that did n't have a backlight ? ) . Not having a backlight is an inexcusable flaw on a watch this price . And the phosporescent watch hands fade in about an hour , so that does n't help much . Of course , you could just carry a flashlight with you.Because of this flaw , I rarely wear the watch . I wear a cheaper Casio with a backlight that I do not like anywhere near as much.If considering this watch against any other , just make sure you also consider how important it is to you to be able to read the time in the dark and to be able to read the digital LCD display when you do n't have optimal light . If it is important , find a different watch .	-1
On Harris ' website , this is listed as a drop-in piece for the M1A , but they charge $ 10 for handling *any* order , even a $ 10 part like this . So , I bought it on Amazon , saved some money.Harris lists this as a THE adapter to install on the weep-hole in front of the sling on an M1A , to give you the ability to run a bipod . And it CAN work , as I discovered . But if you think this is going to simply glue in , guess again.The screw threads ( as shown in the pic ) protrude through the concave portion of the metal flange , about 3/16 & # 34 ; . The problem with this is that directly above where the flange needs to sit , is the gas cylinder , which is maybe 1/16 above where the flange seats . That means you have to cut off about 1/8 & # 34 ; of the threads , bevel the edges , and then test-fit again.The pocket that flange sits in , is the wrong radius compared to the part . The solution is to use a sanding flapper-wheel and dremel , to correct this problem , and deepen the pocket , so that the flange will sit at or below the inner plane of the stock.Lastly , the flange was about 1/8 & # 34 ; too long at each end for the formed pocket in the stock , requiring me to cut off , and then smooth , that amount on each end of the flange.After all of this was done- requiring numerous trial-fittings with the action- did I finally have a proper fitting for my bipod . It works ... The catch is that it TAKES work to make it work .	-1
It fits and does provide a lot of shade but if there is much wind it flop up down and all around and make you look like even more of a dork for wearing it .	-1
Do n't buy these . Unless you can pick them up for $ 5 , they are just likely to be one of those gotcha buys that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.I bought several pairs of these two years ago . They appeared to be part of a product line that had some excellent hoodies which I had purchased initially . I 've regretted these sweatpants ever since and have just ended up hiding them under one of the various and sundry heaps in my closet.The worst thing about these pants is the fabric . It is thin , it is SO thin that I can feel even slight breezes coming through the legs . The fleece on the inside of each leg does nothing to help with this or to give the pants a more luxurious feel . When I put these on , the fabric alone screams , `` Cheap ! '' at me.But that 's not all . The legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline . This would n't be a problem if the result was just a fashionably baggy appearance . However , in both of my pairs of pants , the elastic in the bottoms is weaker than a 10 yo rubber band . As a result , the bottoms are constantly dragging on the floor and getting in the way of my feet . I finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs . This helps a little but is also unnecessarily inconvenient.Last , I have not found the drawstring to be terribly useful . Rather than ending in two strings that I can securely knot , the drawstring is just one continuous loop that is much more difficult to secure . This is perhaps the most minor of the problems , since I can always just cut the drawstring in half . I 've been reluctant to do that , though , because this is often just a recipe for losing the string altogether.Companies often modify their styles in the course of different production runs . Possibly the problems I 've noted have been corrected . However , this purchase has left me feeling sufficiently burned that I am not likely to make a return to the scene of the crime to try my luck yet again .	-1
I like the size , design and pricing for this bag . Unfortunately , upon my first time using this bag , the connection to the reservoir bag was leaky . Not a little leak , but within a few minutes , there would be a puddle where the bag stands . I tried switching the tube around and it still leaks . Then I found out that the connection to the mouthpiece leaks as well . I emailed Outdoor Products but got no reply . I resorted to lining the connections with saran wrap to fill up whatever gaps were there to cause the leak and that seem to fix the problem for now . Now I 'm considering a Camelbak instead .	-1
Brought this on my recent camping trip . The clasp that holds the panel where the batteries opens way to easily . I had to close it several times during my camping trip .	-1
Petzl used to be synonymous with Quality ... .. however I am finding my expensive purchase is not even as good a quality as some of the $ 20 cheapo headlamps at walmart . Petzl needs to address this or just lose business altogether . I purchased a couple of these headlamps for bug out bags for family members and I am not sure they will survive the long haul after looking them over . They work , but not what I expected from Petzl .	-1
The knife you will receive is the newer BSA Explorer not the Yeoman that is pictured . While the Explorer is a fine knife ( I already have a couple ) it is not what I wanted . I wanted a 3 layer SAK with magnifying glass and in line Phillips screwdriver . The Explorer is a 4 layer knife , too thick for my every day use . This is a great knife if you want a BSA Explorer but not if you expect a Yeoman .	-1
The middle pole did not fit inside the top pole as it is supposed to . My wife and I are both mechanically inclined , and it is clear to us that the pole was not manufactured to specs . Whoever packed the poles in the box knew they did n't fit properly , because they `` made '' them fit by reversing the direction of the poles when they packed them . I had to add WD-40 and stand on a tall ladder to pound down on the two poles to make them fit together ( not an easy task ! ) . Also , the two plugs to keep the water/sand in the base were made of cheap plastic instead of rubber and broke easily ( minor complaint ) . The only reason I did not give this product just one star is because , once we got it set up , it 's good for the price I paid . However , I ca n't give it more than two stars because many people could not have assembled the actual misfitting parts we received .	-1
WHOOPS ! -- I used this sink a second time several months later after some storage , it had lost its rigidity completely . Now it will only hold a little bit of water but wants to continually collapse . I am adjusting my rating , this sink stinks .	-1
A pin on the bottom that should have fit into the rear detent had to be filed flush to get the item to fit . It works fine without the pin stay put and does n't move while shooting .	-1
Screws strip out very easy . The rail is ok but it is very easy to strip the screws . Spend more money and purchase a better rail .	-1
What is wrong with people who designed this thing ? It is very tall , and very narrow.It serves it 's purpose for letting you see the iron sights even when a scope is mounted but it is really too tall and makes a scope difficult to use .	-1
another piece of junk everytime I fire empty shells hit the mount : ( and cant move it its fixed refund please	-1
Do n't waste your money on this item . The mounting points wore down and became useless after less than 300 rounds .	-1
It 's a cheap rail that tends to loosen when shooting .223 . I took mine off and do n't even use it anymore . I 'll sell you mine on Ebay .	-1
Not bad . I only give it a 3 because the screws are a little short and you can mount it in only one direction to get all four mounting holes . I had to mount it in reverse direction and used only 3 holes for my wifes mount because she needed the scope back farther because she is small . Solid mount with all four screws for sure.04/29/13Had it mounted and loved it because I could see my hard sights . My rifle rolled off of the shooting bench , the end of the barrel hit the dirt and filled with dirt about half inch in , the butt of rifle then proceeded to fall to the ground and the corner of the scope touched the ground first . Made the bracket loose . Went to check why and the front screw was stripped out . I am just glad I used all four holes rather than three . Thought oh well now my rifle is messed up . Went to install the stock rail and when I did the front screw held . the reason why it stripped was because the screws are all too short and they only thread in half way rather than all the way into the meatal . Change the screws and you will have a good product . Better yet get differnt mounts that you can see through and it will be even better . Scope sits high in the air with this mount and can not touch your cheek to the stock . My wife hates it so I am changing hers over to what I have so I am really not using either of them .	-1
As stated in previous reviews , there are several issues with this product.I must start with , in my past experience , I 've had GREAT luck with NcStar scopes.Hands down , I own several and have had not a single issue with ANY of them . Bang for the buck they 're almost unbeatable.However , that being said , I must state that this rail that is claimed to fit the Mini family by Ruger is horribly inaccurate.When I removed it from the NcStar box and began inspecting it , immediately I noticed that not one , but all BUT one of the holes were poorly machined and virtually thread-less.The base machining was a few degrees off so the rail would not actually sit flat on the receiver.The brackets were faced , left-hand , right-hand & even when I dug up some screws from my garage ( after tapping to a larger size ) fit horribly.Whether you install the rail , extension forward , or extension rearward , the rear factory iron sight MUST be removed for proper fit . And quite honestly , because of the height of the rail , even if you could leave it installed it would be useless anyways.Long story short , even after machining the tab off the bottom ( guessing this was supposed to act as a key-way for the rail , but was n't aligned with the orientation of the poorly machined mounting holes , etc ) , the drilling and re-tapping of the mounting holes for proper hardware , I found this rail a complete and utter disappointment.In a cross comparison , this 15 $ rail was n't much different than the 45 $ rail I found on the web . They were both poorly machined , the NcStar seemed to be made of cheaper aluminum , while the 45 $ arrived polished with a clear anodizing . *shrug* Both had horrible mounting brackets and poorly machined holes.At least now I can say I 've finally had a NcStar product I did n't like . This rail went right in the trash and I 'm working on my own custom mount and rail system for the Mini 's . ; )	-1
It is cheap - both price and construction . The one Ruger makes and provides on the new Mini-14 's has a cut out so that the brass does n't hit the scope mount . This was too long - would have to remove the rear sight and I have a TAPCO Tactical stock on my Mini and the scope mount hit that in the front too . I would have to cut it down . Looking at the inserts into the integrated scope mounts milled in the receiver , the scope mount has little pins instead of metal flanges . Was n't worth sending back since it only cost $ 10.36 , it would have cost me a few dollars and time to return.I 've ordered Weaver see-through Mini-14 riser scope rings to mount my TruGlo 6-24X50mm scope since the Ruger high rings do n't clear the TAPCO stock .	-1
it mounted ok , and you could clearly see the factory sights . but once I mounted a scope on it i found it ws not square and the scope would not aline . I tried to shim it it but the front was just way higher than the back !	-1
Do not waste your hard earned money . This product is very cheaply made and does not even rate in my book as toy quality . It arrived with a bad paint job , missing a screw , and with a crack in the stock . Absolute crap .	-1
For close to $ 300 for a filter I 'd expect quality control to be a lot better . Product arrived , seemed very well built - & # 34 ; Swiss Made & # 34 ; on label , etc . For something that was deemed & # 34 ; the last filter you 'll ever need & # 34 ; or whatever the words are on their website it sure was anything BUT.I was on a backcountry hiking trip recently near Lake Powell Utah - used it once in a dirty creek and it produced amazingly clear water.. and the water tasted great especially when used with Sweetwater drops . Everyone else was using gravity filters and while OK , they still leave a taste in the water - and they are slow and fiddly - so I was stoked I finally have my go -to solution for long trips that was fast , trouble free and compact.Well , I got it out on the second day of the trip to pump some more water and on the 3rd pump the side of the pump totally cracked and water sprayed out of it from every direction . BAM - end of the filter & now I have no water . I was lucky I was traveling with someone who had a backup otherwise we would have had a situation.Obviously some kind of major product defect - but again - what kind of materials are they using that blow that easily . I did not put any pressure on the handle out of the ordinary - it just broke.Fortunately , I purchased through Amazon - a new unit is on its way for my next trip - but yikes , now do I need to carry backup purifier ? I have a hard time placing any confidence on survival with this gear - time will tell I guess .	-1
Although I used this thing gently and only filtered about 4 gallons of water through it total , the lower nipple broke off when I removed the silicon inlet tube . I 'd read other reviews where folks complained of a weakness in the design of this area , but assumed they were careless in their use of the filter . All I can say is that I was especially careful with mine and still it broke off . Now the filter is useless . If I had it to do over again , I would not buy this filter . Of course , I recommend that you do not buy this , as it will leave you in a pickle some day when you need water . If you buy it anyway , please carry iodine tablets , or have some other backup water source -- you 'll need it .	-1
Long story short -- -the intake nipple might break off . My filter broke as shown in the picture , and if you look around at reviews you will see that it has happened to more than one person . Mine broke while on a river trip -- -luckily another person on the trip had a different filter so I did n't have to resort to boiling or tablets.Remember , a good risk assessment looks at how likely it is that a malfunction will occur AND the severity of the consequences if one does.Would you trust a climbing rope that only occasionally breaks ? Car brakes that almost always work ? A parachute that usually opens ? I know the good reviews sound really good ( they suckered me in ) -- -but wanting it to be a reliable filter does not make it one . You have been warned ! BTW , good Katadyn customer service -- -they sent me a new filter body for free . This time I beefed up the intake nipple by filling the well in which it sits about half-way up with JB Weld . This leaves room for the hose to fit on the nipple while strengthening the failure point where the nipple joins the filter body . This has worked well so far -- -why did n't Katadyn redesign this themselves ? ( My failure happened two years ago -- -they have had time to fix their design . ) Always have a backup , regardless of which filter you buy . Good luck !	-1
I fell in love with their CAMP product several years ago on a group bike trip . Our guide had one and it was fantastic for five of us.After buying I discovered they had changed the filter technology from using a high capacity ceramic filter ( Camp model ) to a disposable filter with a max life of 200 gal ( Base Camp model ) . Now the product has no more capacity than a personal bottle filter . The fault is mine since 'Features ' text is accurate.I give it a low score because it no longer fulfills it purpose as a high capacity camp filter , due to cost and hassle of replacement filters . I would also not recommend for your emergency kit , because of the limited filter capacity.A+ DesignD- CapacityF- Total Cost ( filters add up ) If you are in Europe , you can still buy the Camp model with the ceramic filter that yields 5,000 gal life. [ ... ]	-1
This device is perfect for a larger group . Setup was easy . On first use we did n't get any flow , but I figured the filter needed to be primed . Once the filter is saturated and the flow is going it is effortless . Just hang it and fill your bottles.UPDATE 9/2/2013Took it on a backpacking trip , and we had a hand pump along also as a backup that used the same filter . Bag worked great for a few days -- probably 6 gallons of filtered water -- then slowed to a useless dribble.Assumed the filter was sediment plugged even though it looked fine . Swapped out the new filter from the hand pump and it was working again.But here 's the thing -- we put the supposedly `` clogged '' filter from the Base Camp bag into the hand pump and it worked fine.My guess is that the pressure of the gravity-fed bag is nowhere near what a pump model is.Ultimately ended up being very disappointed in this .	-1
I followed the instructions as the instructions said.Thick blue stuff came out of the tube when I was cleaning it . I tested the water for particled before and after . The reading was higher AFTER I had cleaned it and ran tap water through it . It was really slow to filter and did not perform to my expectations . I 'll not use this and it will be in my junc to get rid of pile . Buy a Sawyer filter and you wo n't worry about having to replace the expensive filter this thing has . I would have returned this thing but I did n't test it before the return period was over .	-1
The stove itself is good . The piezo igniter has n't worked yet . Maybe needs some sort of adjustment . Performance of the stove though is quite good , but I have little faith in the igniter.Update : Mine had the same issue and it had nothing to do with fuel . With the piezo you can see the spark jump and on mine it works 1 out of 20 times even after some bending adjustments . The other issue is the stove seems to lose pressure when running for a couple of minutes . This is even on a new cannister of fuel . To be fair I am using MSR canisters but I am not sure why that would make a difference . So If I had to make the purchase again I would go with the MSR equivalent that does n't have the igniter .	-1
The Stove comes with no canister ! ! ! Take into consideration when buying it . you 're just paying more than 30 $ for a small piece of metal ... . This is called cheating ! i expected canister with fuel at least . The description does n't say ( for the time i 'm submitting the review ) that the product comes without canister . im disappointed as far as i am going camping/backpacking in a week and i really needed and counted on that f**king stove : ( ( ( ( (	-1
This is nothing more than a rope with velcro and leather on the end so save you money . No other trick is possible	-1
I imagined myself gleefully bouncing along on my ball chair day in and day out . Reality was far less appealing . First , I always felt like I ended up slouching , vice the promised good posture . While I am certain I burned extra calories during the day , fighting to stay on my chair was n't my idea of & # 34 ; exercise & # 34 ; at all . The back on this chair , which is really a misnomer considering the fact that it does n't function like a chair back , broke after I leaned on it ... which was both difficult and uncomfortable.Best of luck to anyone that feels the need to try this . In theory I think it is a good idea , I 'm just not sure how reasonable it is in application . I switched back to a normal chair at work and gave this to my son .	-1
I ca n't understand what 's up with all the great reviews for this thing , it has absolutely no range at all . Might be able to find coins scattered along well maintained lawns but do n't expect to actually find anything underground unless it 's a BIG hunk of metal and closer to the surface.The only reason why I bought this was to find arrows that went under the grass in my backyard , so I figured a cheap unit should work ok . I shoot 250grain ( about a half ounce ) steel field tips so they are a pretty substantial lump of metal . After receiving the unit , I took an arrow with me outside for testing . I slid the arrow into the dirt , underneath the grass and tried to find it with the detector . Nothing . Next I took the arrow out of the dirt and just slid it underneath some taller grass . Nothing . Next I took the arrow and dropped it on top of the grass and finally got a faint beep out of the thing . I had to put the metal detector directly on top of the arrow head , about an inch away for it to register a strong audible . Repeated the same test with arrow and leaves/grass with same results . Had to be directly on top , about an inch away to really register . Worthless.My kid saw me testing this thing and wanted to try it out . With the poor performance of this unit , he gave it back to me after 10 minutes . Even more worthless.Item is getting returned .	-1
Did you analyze the water or just making generalizations ( & # 34 ; it certainly removes harmful bacterial , cysts , and protozoa. & # 34 ; ) Yeah , thought so .	-1

The frypan that was delivered is different from photo . The photo shows a folding handle all metal handle frypan . What was delivered was a non-stick frypan no different from a normal kitchen except that the rivets were replaced with wing nut screws . The handle has a rubberized handle at the end which makes it unsuitable for over wood cooking.The wing nuts quickly scratched the non-stick surface within a couple of uses . I am now required to carry the skillet assembled to avoid further damage . I would not recommend this product and suggest that even backpackers look at cast iron alternatives that are more durable .	-1
I lift pretty heavily 5 days per week and these gloves just could n't take it . The seams split down the sides within a few months , as did finger seams . The material on the palms wore out to the point of holes . The wrist straps were pretty flimsy.Do n't buy these junk gloves . Buy these instead : Harbinger 130 Classic WristWrap Glove ( Black ) . I 've been using these for 2-3 months now and they 're solid . No tearing or damage .	-1
We were very disappointed that although this pad was advertised as fitting both Olympic and standard barbells , it does not go fully around our Olympic barbell at all . We did n't have the time to return it , and instead are hoping that we can flatten it out a bit to make it go around properly . Otherwise , we 'll give it to friends who have a standard barbell . The pad itself is very good quality .	-1
This does not fit the Olympic set bar ! This falls everytime and I would not buy again . Also very very stiff .	-1
I bought these because at the time there was n't a lot of other cheap options - I 'm just doing push-ups after all , right ? The plastic was cheap , and already had a kind of stress fracture right outta the box . Has n't broken yet though.Foam padding is not firm enough , and also low grade.I did n't like how the bars were at an angle - I could n't find a comfortable position ; slanting inwards or slanting outwards ? Both felt weird.All in all , they were cheap , and I got what I paid for .	-1
I was very disappointed in these balls . They are way smaller balls than I usually like to pick up and that made me not want to use them .	-1
They are in fact 8lbs but very small and need to be inflated . I was expecting more of a women 's basketball size and it was more like a mini basketball .	-1
Do not buy this if you are expecting a full sized medicine ball . This one fits in the palm of your hand	-1
These gloves felt awkward to me and I did n't really car for them . I ended up just lifting without .	-1
Unlike most low-star-reviewers of this product , mine did actually come with all the parts in the box . I made sure to be gentle when handling this product because I could tell it was n't the greatest quality , especially the part that holds the weights , which is arguably the most important . I used this probably 3 times a week , and the grips began to wear out after about 3 months , when I started getting black residue on my hands following use . At 4 months , the product became unusable after the threads for the nut on the very bottom became stripped and would no longer support any weight . The 2 threaded parts on this product should be thicker and more durable.Now I 'll be looking for a different & # 34 ; forearm blaster & # 34 ; to replace this one .	-1
The bar itself feel solid but there are problems : - the grips are held with velcro thick seams that make them very uncomfortable to hold on to- the mounting brackets are too large and do not fit onto a standard size door frame- the screws supplied are made from a cheap metal and could not be used	-1
Nothing wrong with this chin-up bar . I exchanged for one that I did not need to use hardware for mounting . I did not want to mark up my door frame .	-1
Made of flimsy plastic , they flex with your body weight on them , and they sit high enough that they do n't feel stable either . I 'd prefer a sturdier construction that 's lower to the ground .	-1
[ Good ] These do give you deeper pushupsAfter 3 months of use , they still work fine ; though it should be noted that I 'm under 180 lbs.They are comfortable for most push ups except one type . [ Bad ] There 's a tendency for this product to fall on its side . You should get something that does n't flip .	-1
update : We 've had this for a little over a year and it 's become worthless due to leaking . I 've cleaned the diaphragm in the valve and soap tested it and it 's not leaking . Apparently there 's a bad seam in it somewhere . It was a very good bed until it started leaking but we only used it 8 or 10 nights before that happened. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- My wife and I pack with llamas . We 're around 60 and a thin pad leaves us too stiff in the morning so we decided to give this thing a try . Since the critters carry the load , a little extra weight is ok. Before we bought it , I emailed Aerobed to ask how many inflations we can expect from a fully charged pump . They said 7 to 8 . I charged the pump and kept filling and dumping it until the pump ran down . I got 7 easily . The 8th was really dragging down the pump and it left the mattress a little softer than we like . The pump is VERY fast , too . It takes 1 min 20 sec to get it to the firmness that we like , which is pretty firm . The valve allows it to be used with several alternate types of pumps and on an extended back country trip , I would recommend taking a backup of some kind , just in case.In all fairness , the 1st one we got did lose about 1/2 it 's air in 4 hrs . Amazon had a replacement one on the way the same day that I requested an exchange . They also gave me a call tag to print out to cover the return shipping . This one works perfectly . I sure ca n't fault Amazon 's service.It 's not our Sleep Number bed from home , but it 's very satisfactory sleeping compared to a 2 '' self inflating pad like we 've been using.Any airbed is cold on cool nights . We use a couple thin ensolite pads under the sleeping bags and we stay plenty warm.Most mattresses take forever to deflate and are very hard to get the air out to put them in a bag or roll up . This thing has a huge air release valve . If you 're on it when you pop the valve , you 're going down fast enough to get bruised when you hit the ground . I 've never see a mattress that will dump the air as fast as this one .	-1
This could be my fault , but for some reason I thought these would be sold as a set . Have n't even used this because my daughter needed two pairs so we ordered one purple set and one red set , so we thought . Instead , we received just one wrist band in each color . I thought the price was great , was a little less than other ones I saw , until I realized this price is for one band .	-1
Little hotties promised 8 hours of heat and gave me 10 . HotHands promised up to 8 hours of heat and gave me 3 . I have found that these things deteriorate over time , and I might have got an old box . I wo n't take the chance again , though , they are just too expensive ... I will go back to my favorites .	-1
Great value on a case of Hothands but the take over an hour to heat up and never got really as toasty or warm . A good pair of wool inner gloves work as well as this product	-1
It is really odd how this product was $ 13 one dad then $ 26 the next . Not worth it at the current price .	-1
This pedometer has plenty of features , is sturdy , and definitely stays attached , but it 's very difficult to calibrate accurately and even after a reasonably accurate setting it somehow figures out how to give false measurements . I run on a 1/4 mile track and after 3 miles this pedometer read 3 1/2 miles , which is far too inaccurate for it to be of any use . I do n't suggest anyone get this unless it 's just to get something to give you an approximate idea of how many steps you take in a day .	-1
Shipping was quick , but this was n't even close on accuracy . On a known course , it was off by 10 % . If you want an & # 34 ; eye-ball & # 34 ; guestimate of what you accomplished , this might be ok , but if you 're interested in accurate measurements , pay a little more and get something better	-1
Not for me . The lenses were not pink at all . More of a purpley mauve color and also very dark . Looked like Dollar store glasses . Returned for a pair of brown gradient lenses . Really liked the style , just not the lens color . Ordered the 55mm . Fit nicely Recommend , just not the pink .	-1
This is my second pair . The first pair were damaged , the Rayban box they came in was damaged , but not the outside box . I returned them and am still awaiting my refund.Immediately after returning these I ordered a second pair and they had the same defect , ( nose pads/fit could n't adjust/loose sloppy fit ) so I took them to two local opticians and was told the same thing . They pointed out issues normally associated with pirated items , such as the screws holding in the stems were of different colors/length , polarization not strong , glue residue where it should never be , different box than the model the glasses came in , damage in the glasses and inside boxes but the outside shipping boxes were undamaged and clean .	-1
Worthless . Broke on the first day . Only good as a stage prop ... They refused to return it because it was missing one of the arrows . I would not recommend this toy .	-1
I bought this as a practice crossbow and the string broke when putting it together . I called the company any they sent me a new string , it broke again , It 's a waste , do n't but it .	-1
This is only good to have to play with a few times . It was hard to put together . The string got messed up after the first time shooting it . And almost everytime i shoot it the string pops off . So its only good for a few time . Only recomend buying if you dont mind wasting $ 15 .	-1
I wonder if all of those 4- and 5-star reviews are referring to an earlier iteration of this headlamp , because the one I have SUCKS . As in , it seriously is not good at all . But before you dismiss me as the inevitable lone crank who writes a crappy review out of sheer sour grapes , I will elaborate.First , the battery lid is made out of a brittle kind of plastic with a protruding tab that leaves no doubt as to what will happen one day in the not-too-distant future when I change the batteries : it will break off in a most anticlimactic fashion.Second , unlike many other low-cost headlamps , the switch ( much like the battery compartment ) is clearly not constructed in such a way as to exclude rain . Since I live in western Oregon , this is quite the fatal flaw.Third , there is no hint of a warranty anywhere on the packaging , a sure sign that the company has zero confidence in their own product . Not even a 30-day return guarantee ? Pathetic . Even the cheapest Petzl has a 3-year guarantee.This last point leads to my conclusion , which is that this headlamp is not to be depended upon except as a backup or for use as a child 's toy . Petzl makes a better headlamp for only a slight premium , and even with their recently downgraded warranty , they are still a reputable brand . Energizer is good only for batteries at this point .	-1
This things sucks , to put it lightly ( I had to , sorry . ) It 's flimsy , so it 's almost impossible to aim the light where you want it . It 's cheap , it flickers like a dying fluorescent bulb , which is super annoying and required me to smack it a few times , and finally - it 's SUPER BRIGHT . It will keep your cortisol flowing [ natural wake-up response to sunlight emitting in the room ] . If I could contact Doc from BTF and take a time machine in the past to never purchase this garbage , I would . Stay away , run , do n't walk .	-1
The last Epicurean cutting board I purchased was from Sonoma and Williams . It was much thicker and slightly larger . Next time I 'll purchase from Sonoma again .	-1
The composite surface of this board is much harder than wood , bamboo , and plastic , which supposedly makes it more sanitary and dishwasher safe , but it comes with several caveats:1 . A harder surface wears down your knives faster . There 's no way around it.2 . It makes an annoying *CLACK* *CLACK* *CLACK* sound when chopping vegetables ; a definite liability if you have roommates.3 . The surface feels somewhat slippery , almost as bad as glass , which lends less control to your knife work.4 . The black board I had showed ugly scoring after a month or so . This may not be as much of an issue with the `` natural '' color.5 . After several dishwasher cycles , it had warped slightly , and would n't sit flat on my countertop . I had to get some shelf liner to stabilize it.If you want the best feel and control when cutting , get a wood or bamboo board . If you do n't want to deal with regular oiling and prefer the convenience of a dishwasher , go with plastic.I gave away the Epicurean board after three or four months . I eventually replaced it anOxo Large Bamboo Board , and I 'm quite happy with it : - )	-1
Good idea , but it fits very awkward , it adds about an inch to the length , now it does dampen felt recoil , but after every shot the gel pad moves to the side off center from the back of the butt and has to be readjusted making follow up shots a pain	-1
Bought this for the Mossberg 500 and was a little disappointed . I say a little because I spent a little , so expectations were n't high . First , it fits the stock okay but not securely enough to stop it from wiggling around and shifting during shooting . The material is n't very good quality either because mine is starting to rip apart at the seams and is getting worn out quickly . The biggest disappointment is that it does n't even lessen the recoil all that much . I mean , it helps but does n't reduce it enough to make it comfortable to shoot 25 to 30 shells . Compared to the Limbsaver slip-on pad I just got to replace it , this gel pad ca n't even compete . Not worth the money in my opinion .	-1
The only way I can see this not sliding around or off of the gun is if it were to be tacked ( sewn ) to an elastic shell carrier that goes on the stock .	-1
Gel does great job of cutting down recoil , but of the 100 + shotguns I have , it did n't fit any of them well enough for me to keep using it .	-1
This pad did n't work the best for my Benelli M1 , It fit like an old sock with a gel pack it .	-1
The mask kinda gets the job done and will guard your head from oncoming paintballs , but you CAN NOT USE THIS MASK IF IT IS WARM OUT ! After about 3 minutes of playing in warm weather , because it 's a full head mask , it will fog up to the point where you ca n't see a thing , and will become extremely hot . Do not get full head masks , they 're just too hot and fog up ( even in the winter ) . Get a face mask , and if you do n't like paint in your hair , just wear a baseball hat backwards ...	-1
The HeadShield will be overkill for most paintball players . For one thing , it gets hot under a mask anyway , and a helmet is twice as bad because the hot air under the helmet has nowhere to go , causing your mask to fog up faster . Also , helmets tend to be harder to adjust and put on . Finally , after a few times playing , you will usually get enough situational awareness to avoid getting shot in the back of the head anyway.The JT HeadShield is actually a mask with a helmet attachment . Rather than a single band to adjust tightness , now we have to make sure the helmet part is aligned correctly . One of the securing fasteners is smack on top of the head , which is quite painful if your head fills the entire space . Also , to put it on you have to put your chin to the chin of the mask and fold the mask over your head ( think how Darth Vader 's mask works in Return of the Jedi ) . If you wear glasses , like I do , this is next to impossible to do with your glasses on ( which you kind of need to see while you play , I assume ) .However , once the helmet portion is removed , the mask itself is decent ( essentially aJT Elite ) , though it only has a single untreated lens ( big thumbs down ) and that little silver piece over the mouthguard ( unnecessary but aesthetically pleasing ) will tend to come off after one or two rough games.Consider the helmet if you play speedball and get bunkered regularly , but my advice is to stick with a regular mask .	-1
Crotch blew out after a week . Luckily I 'm handy with a needle and thread . Other than that they seem like decent material .	-1
In a period of only 13 days , the fabric is pilling so badly I ca n't wear them anymore . The purchase was a waste of money in my opinion , as the fabric is very poor quality . The fit is great because of the elastic at the bottom , but the fabric did n't last . I can not recommend buying this ... sadly my search for great sweat pants continues ... ..	-1
Worked well for decorating as an ugly Team USA Costume by Ralph Lauren . It is comfortable and fits to size . It DOES NOT HAVE POCKETS , which is annoying . Well , you get what you pay for . It 's cheap .	-1
This shirt is of poor quality and the fabric is , I do n't know how to explain it , not what I have come to expect . The shirt does n't hold its shape and the wrinkling is terrible .	-1
I was looking for a skinnier and lighter wavemaster for adult woman but what i got was more of a child wavemaster . It is short and although I was looking for skinny i did not expected it to be so thin . Currently i am using it but it gets tipped easily and even smaller woman can knock it down with a simple front kick . If it was a 30 lbs heavier and a Little taller it would be a great item .	-1
these came out of the package with an awful chemical smell that was quite pungent . It last for many days , almost toxic smelling.The gloves are nice but I wonder what that smell is and why the manufacturer would not catch this before packaging and sending out.Ca n't be good to breath for anyone , let alone seep into their skin from working out .	-1
If you are planning on using this with the CGA320 adapter for CO2 regulators , look elsewhere . Go with the industrial size co2 tanks .	-1
It was freezing to touchwhen it arrived via UPS and when I attached it to the Airgun it would not fire nor did it have any power behind the paintball . The CO2 can was empty upon arrival .	-1
The valve at the top began leaking after 30 days . Basically if I disconnect the tank , it allows CO2 to escape ( hiss ) out of the valve . I have to keep it attached in order to preserve the CO2 that is currently in the tank . I wo n't be filling this one again after it is empty , rendering this unit as disposable .	-1
The worst thing about this volleyball is inclusion of padding between bladder and leather covering . I am serious , I got tired of playing cheap volleyballs through the padding . It is as if you play ball with a pillow that covers it completely . Description at Amazon did n't describe any padding to be present in a volleyball construction .	-1
Was n't very thick material and did n't last long out in the backyard . My son like it while it lasted . !	-1
I got this when I transferred to a smaller duty station that had a pretty weak gym and I was doing much more exercising at home than on base . All the sit-up bars I 've used before have been fixed pipes that you can wedge your feet under so they do n't move during the exercise . Absent a bar like that I try to find a heavy piece of furniture that has enough clearance to anchor my toes under . But when I was setting up a home gym in an apartment I tried to find something that did n't require me to mount something on the wall and I could do all my exercises in the same room . But after getting this I was not happy with it at all . First , to get my size 14 feet under it had them at about a 30 degree angle against the face of the door , which does n't feel as secure as I 'm used to and my feet would slide during the exercise . The only time I could use this without feeling like the door was moving too much was being on the outside of a closed door which actually took me outside my home gym , so I stopped using it and have n't missed it at all . Planks and crunches work the abs just as much , and when I have an urge to do sit-ups I can do incline sit-ups on my weight bench . This may a nice token for a New Year 's resolution , but I do n't recommend it for anyone who works out seriously .	-1
This may work fine if you have a single item you want to protect , but it totally filled up the Pelican box I had and did n't really fit my need . I suppose I could have cut this in half and wittled away what I did n't need , but I just set this aside and wo n't use it .	-1
I 've used Plexus for a lot of years , but I came here to buy a can , and the price is double what it was the last time I bought a can several years ago . As best I can tell , not a thing about the product has changed , and I get that prices have gone up in general on a lot of things . What amounts to 20 % + increase per year is stupid though , and I guess the empty can I have is the last one I 'll ever buy .	-1
The photo suggests something reasonably substantial for protection . The decription says `` one size fits all '' . Neither are even remotely true . The item is thin , and covers maybe an inch of your neck ... .if you can get it around your neck . The diameter range runs from an adult wrist to an 8 year olds neck . Buyers beware .	-1
The good : * generally large* 2 compartments* handles and a shoulder strapthe bad : * If you do n't put things in the bottom compartment , it will deform and does n't sit very well ( it tips over ) * Not durable : the material it 's made from cracks easily in the upper section where it folds/deforms ( around the zipper ) I stopped using this because it fell apart so easily .	-1
I 've used chain cleaners before , so I was very disappointed when it broke during its first use . It does thoroughly clean the chain , but the clips that hold the lid in place are 'WAY too tight . If you buy one , you may want to relax the wire clips before use . I will replace it with Nashbar 's chain cleaner. [ ... ]	-1
It worked o.k . at first but the bristles fell out pretty quickly . I switched to the Filzer . I 've only used it a couple times , but so far it works well and seems to be much more durable .	-1
The umbrella is relatively well designed but it did not last as long as the study design might make you think initially . The plastic bits where the spikes join with the periphery of the canopy are poorly made and easily get torn from the canopy . Because the spikes are not attached to them permanently , once the bit breaks off from the canopy , you lose it in the dirth and you can not repare the umbrella . I was much happier with my London Fog before I got this one .	-1
The title speaks , I think , for itself . The canopy is thin , the shaft and ribs are flimsy.I tried to return it and the seller replied that opening it constituted using it and refused to refund the purchase and insisted I would have to accept an exchange . No , thank you.Do yourself a favor and buy something else .	-1
Was given one of these by a friend . It is hard plastic , does n't work well with off-brand bottles . Buy a Guyot , they conform to Nalgene and off-brand bottles and they work 10 times better .	-1
This is the worst sipper I have found the Guy00t is 100 % better . This one develops a smell after a while and you really can not drink from it with spilling it .Just a bad product design	-1
This shirt is made well . It fits well everywhere ... ..except around the neck . I have an average neck and these shirts strangle me . I spend all day tugging at the neck line , trying to stretch it out so I can breathe .	-1
Sized at 2xl it fits like a regular extra large . Did n't like , wo n't buy again .	-1
If I wore these pants for an hour my waist line would be cut in half.I think it was the elastic as the pants without the fabric would have been XL . I probably could have salvaged the things with a new elastic.Second item from Champion that was not so good . I did find another brand that was a great fit , check my other reviews.I did send an email to csr @ txshirts.com and they did not respond . I now see all the others who have had similar experience from them in other reviews . They know it is not worth the money to return them or the bother involved . I threw them away.Not sure why they are still selling here . I have always had good experience with Amazon and guess these guys are getting below their radar .	-1
My husband picked these out and was unhappy with the thin fabric , compared to his other Champion shorts that are heavier weight and have side seam pockets . We returned both pair .	-1
The material is too thin and wo n't last and there is no pockets at all ; not even a locker key pocket in the waist band . They 'll go to the rag bin within a couple of months .	-1
The sizing is dead on , but I expected a better quality pants ( thicker , more durable ) fine for winter layering , but not a solo piece .	-1
Be sure to order a larger size ( or two ) if you plan to wash it.VERY disappointed in Hanes on this product .	-1
Good fit until the shirt was washed . One washing cycle and the shirt shrank by almost 2 sizes . Gave it to a friend 's pre-teen son and she said it continued shrinking and now her younger daughter is wearing the shirt . Not the quality you would expect from Hanes .	-1
I do n't like it . It does n't appear to me that it was originally intended to be a ski rack , but rather a rack some marketing type repackaged as such . It 's strong enough and technically it will hold skis but that 's it.Ski racks of this sort should not have hooks at all . If there are hooks , they should at least begin at a point that allows typical skis to hang properly . All the weight of the skis are on a couple points where the tip of the hooks meet the skis even for narrow skis . I doubt it will hurt the skis but it does beg that question . Also , it cause the bottom of the skis to swing away from the wall.The worst part is the mount . The screw holes are slotted and only in the middle of the rack . It makes it extremely difficult to prevent rotation when placing skis in one side . I 'd say the odds of marring a wall are rather high.I 'm using it to hang old skis for now since it 's cheap and I ca n't be bothered to return it . I 'll just use it to hang something else if I decide to get a better rack .	-1
These are really a bit too narrow to be suitable for todays skis , if you 're one of those sissy cross country skiers it 'll be perfect	-1
I use this water bottle for power walking , not running . The bottle itself is rather flimsy . The carrier is also lacking in construction.I 'm not a huge fan of the bite valve . I felt like I was going to tear it out -- maybe I am too aggressive with my drinking procedure . The bite value has a distinctive plastic taste and leaks whether tightly closed or not so be sure to keep it in an upright position . If you close the valve and completely invert your bottle , there will be a shower of water.The reflective hand strap comes loose easily and is not as thick as I would like . A thicker piece of fabric to grip the palm around would have been great . I find myself actually gripping part of the holder , which is composed of a thicker piece of fabric so I can keep a solid grip . Unfortunately , if your hand warms up it is then lying on the bottle and may warm your water as well.I do like the pocket . I have a small flip phone and it fits nicely along with a single car key . ( There is no way you would be able to fit a smart phone in it . ) Even with a small phone , there would be additional space for a license and/or credit card.I can not continue to use a water bottle that drenches everything because it does not stay shut . I may try to salvage this by finding another water bottle that will fit in the carrier . I do like the pocket but that is about it .	-1
When I received this product the lid was not securely tight and the solvent leaked out . I was left with a half empty bottle when I paid for a full bottle .	-1
Took it to the bike shop and they said it was a size they do n't even carry and have not sold any in recent history . Buy a long cage , that is the correct size for most 9 speed bikes and cassettes .	-1
This small hatchet seems to have a lot going for it . I liked the compact size , great sharp edge , and a pretty decent sheath . I took it out back to my fire pit and it cut well . Then I struck the back of the hatchet ( with a different hatchet I was testing ) to split a half a log . After about three strikes I discovered that this hatchet head is cast metal , not forged as anyone would expect . The casting narrows where the handle molding covers the head , and it had snapped right in two . This was a first for me dealing with any axe or hatchet .	-1
I bought this knife with an eye towards an everyday carry that had a slightly bigger blade than my usual preference . While this Smith and Wesson is slim and fits nicely in a pocket it is not constructed as well as some other brands ' products in this price range . My biggest complaint is the that the blade does not lock into the closed position . The blade has opened on me while slipping the knife into my pocket . The point tore up a shirt that cost more than the Buck and that was the last time I carried the knife .	-1
First off , for the $ 11.21 , I certainly admit this to be a good buy . However I bought this because I had lost it years ago , and was hoping to rekindle some lost flame.I bought it at Gander Mtn . in Arizona . It was much more expensive . And it operated smooth as butter.After opening my new one from Amazon ... I am frustrated as to how difficult it is to get the knife `` opening '' initially with the thumb stud ! I have to push up almost to the point of miscomfort.Once open , the blade does lock quite nicely . Overall the shape , and style just do n't impress me as much I guess . I would check out the SWMP1B/2B knives instead.Now on what J. Sweaney ( Kerrville Tx ) said : I do not believe this is counterfeit . ( [ ... ] ) They have the same knife on their website , just another color .	-1
This item filled with water , was a maze in terms of unfolding the material to change from carrying configuration to floating config and generally did n't seem to be a good design . Not a bad idea and I can tell they put some thought into it , but just not functional ( for the pool anyway . )	-1
I had orders that I placed two days after this one that arrived way before this one , in fact I had one that also came from Florida and it made it with in two days for some reason this one took over five days ! The shipping that they are using is enough to make me not use them again way too slow ! ! ! When the cap finally got here it looked like it had been under the truck , mashed down flat !	-1
Returned this item since it looked very in attractive on me . Your experience may differ . Good light fabric . Just not for me .	-1
From the reviews on these I was expecting this to have a thicker liner and a bit more loose fit . Sadly this is not the case . I now use these shorts os my lounging/camping shorts because 1 ) my junk still shows through , in fact it was comically embarrassing when my buddies wife pointed this out to me . 2 ) My body type gives me thick thighs and as such I can not wear these because they about a few inches of material from turning into biker shorts.Get something from prAna ( the Flex shorts have a liner , or Mojo for more leg room ) because their products are great and are about the same price.++Material feel nice -- - 'No Mystery Here ' shorts	-1
Bought this product and followed the directions to soak the holder in hot water and it still would not fit on the bottle . Thumbs Down .	-1
Unfortunately , I missed the return date by 2 days so I am stuck with these socks . I have 3 pair I ordered direct from Thorlo and the are far superior to these . The bottom is good but the tops are already thread bare and will wear through probably with the next time I wear these . I will never order these again through Amazon as these might possibly be seconds .	-1
I have worn Thorlo Running Rolltop Socks for at least 20 years with no problem . I am extremely disappointed in this last purchase in that the elastic at the top is very tight . The opening itself is small and evidently made for a little girl 's foot .	-1
These socks are a nice color and felt great on my feet . Trouble is , you get hole after hole in a short time if you wear them often . Surprisingly , these socks are not very durable and do not warrant the rather steep price that Thorlo socks command . I think the Thorlo brand is vastly overrated . I 'm going to try Wigwam 's or Gold Toe socks next time .	-1
I bought a pair of this sock in December , 2011 , and both socks are riddled with huge holes . I 've bought Thorlos before with much better wear . These are disappointing .	-1
Final Edit 9/1/2013I gave these socks one last shot . I work them to the school where I work figuring as much as I 'm on my feet - and that 's MOST of the day - these socks will shine or suck . They chose to do the latter . They sucked . They were hot and I was miserable . I should have brought a pair of back up socks but did n't . I paid a hefty price for it . I 'll no longer wear there . In fact , if they do n't fit my son , and they probably wo n't , they 'll be heading to the land of the thrift store.I was sorely disappointed in these socks from start to finish and will NOT be buying any more.- - - - - - - - - - - - -EDIT 08/25/2013After an extended use on the trail being worn packing a heavily laden backpack for a week 's trip , I found these socks to be just as I predicted . I 'm NOT impressed . Not only were they hot but they were slow to dry in a side by side comparison withWigwam Men 's Hiking/Outdoor Pro Length SockandWigwam Unisex Men's/Women 's Merino Wool Comfort Hiker Crew Length Sock.To test the theory that they were n't as good as I had hoped , I allowed another member of the group , my wife , to wear them . She too , when asked , said they were hot and not as good as the Wigwams.I 'll continue to wear them until they disintegrate but I wo n't be back for more.- - - - - - - - - - - - -I was truly excited about getting these socks since I live in the desert . I had hoped for a hike today to check them out but knee issues had other plans . Instead , I put them on to wear around in the same shoes I use for local hiking.HOT . That 's how to describe these socks this minute - and I 'm wearing them now . The current ambient temperature today , far lower than usual at 71F , did n't change a thing.As for the fit , right on target . In fact , probably the absolute best fitting socks I own . I wear a Men 's 8 and it seems that it 's close to impossible to get decently sized socks without actually buying perfectly sized socks . For that reason alone the earned the 3rd star for the review . Otherwise it would have been a 2 based on the CURRENT situation.Perhaps time will tell . Maybe once I 'm out traipsing around I 'll find these things to be the best thing since soles on shoes . I do n't know . Right now , it 's not so .	-1
ordered the smallest size i could get for my girlfriend , received the largest i guess they figure if the color is right thats enough . just in time to be useless before our vacation hiking trip , thanks alot	-1
They 're very comfortable for my low hiking boots but after a few uses , the socks ( above the boot ) are piling something awful and look ancient.They 're comfortable enough so I wo n't return them but I would n't buy another pair .	-1
I am extremely disappointed with this product . Thorlo used to be a very high quality sock , with very thick heel and toe cushion , and remainder of sock very thick also , HOWEVER , these new Thorlos are watered down versions , heel and toe very thin material , and remainder of sock is also thin . Not much cushion in the heel and toe area , poor quality . I will not buy any more of these Thorlos unless the quality goes way up , VERY DISAPPOINTED , Thorlo has gone way , way , way , way , way , way , downhill , they have gone the CHEAPSKATE route . Shame on THORLO .	-1
never really received full mask as described from vendor and decided to go with better quality mask . realize that it is worth the $ for safety sake	-1
The tricycle looks as nice as the expensive European brand , but the quality is quite disappointing . The headset squeaks loudly and no amount of oil seems to make it go away . The plastic bushings are cheap substitutes of a real roller bearing.The adult steering assembly is getting looser by the day . Soon , the adult will not be able to steer the tricycle . It must be a plastic steering part.Lastly the pedals keep falling off the tricycle . This is primarily because there is no metal cotter pin or retainer holding the pedal to the spindle . This pin would only cost a few cents , yet they cheaped out on it ! This is quite disappointing , considering my daughter used this for two weeks . We should have known that you get what you pay for .	-1
1 ) Amazon is shipping this item without the red focus sprayer ( the taped slot for it on the side is still there and empty ) , someone lost his at home and stole mine before shipping . Now the product is useless for tight spaces until I find one.2 ) Extremely toxic , unlike almost every other gun cleaning product3 ) Considered a hazardous material , so Amazon will not allow you to return it.4 ) Too hazardous to throw away in regular garbage.4 ) Dries out all the hardware and parts , while doing the same cleaning job as others that do not dry out the parts.5 ) CLP , Hoppe 's , M-Pro 7 , EEZOX , Frog Lube Solvent are far superior to this , in every way.6 ) Birchwood Casey and Amazon stink for selling this .	-1
Received the case and it would n't shut correctly . It always wanted to bend to one side when shutting . Feels cheaply made . Sent it back . Did n't want to risk putting my expensive pallets in this sub par case .	-1
Outwardly , this is a great looking extended slide release , and with the Wilson Combat name on it one would think it would be finished to perfection . Well , not so . My specimen , I believe , is typical . It did drop right into my Kimber CDPII . But , then the problems started . The face of the release , that part which contacts the plunger tube pin , was rough and had a casting ridge in it . It was so bad that none of my magazines had enough spring power to fully push the slide release up into the slide notch . I fixed the problem using 320 , 600 and 1000 grit wet or dry and a flat piece of glass to sand on . It took about 20 minutes . Wilson does say that his part may require `` minor fitting '' , but 20 minutes at shop prices is adding significantly to the price of this item . So , that problem was fixed . But , there 's another problem which I put in the category of `` design issue '' . When the slide release is fully engaged in the slide notch , the plunger tube pin nearly runs out of metal to rest on . In other words , the slide release is too skinny at the bottom . It needs more meat there to fully support the plunger pin . I can see the day when the pin may pop outward and lock the slide in the up position . My factory Kimber release does not have this issue and face of the Kimber release came from the factory with a mirror smooth finish . My opinion is that the Kimber slide release is far superior to the Wilson Combat product . Since I prefer an extended slide release I 'm going to stay with the Wilson Combat for now . But if it ever causes a problem , even once , in the trash it goes . My Kimber release will always be at hand in my range bag .	-1
I used this in Yellow Stone Wyoming with NO issues . I then recently used this out in Death Valley and almost got burned to DEATH ! I put the thing in my tent and went to brush my teeth . I returned to find my tent ON FIRE ! Lucky we were not in the tent or we wold be dead ! The thing did not tip over but a spark must have jumped out and landed on the air mattress causing that to burn and then once the air escaped from the mattress the tent was engulfed in flames . What a nightmare . We packed up and went to a motel in Beatty . My husband threw the thing away along with our bedding . Do NOT use this if you value YOUR life !	-1
This little heater lit the first time both times I used it . The problem is we were under a burn ban and needed this to keep us warm . It simply does n't put out enough heat to use outdoors . You should 've seen 3 grown men all hudddled around this thing to stay warm ! This is more like a big hand warmer except we could n't feel it beyond 2 feet away and it was only 40 degrees . Coleman says you can heat your tent with this but I learned early in my camping career that you do n't light things like this in a tent .	-1
not the best heater ever . it tends to give me a head ache i would not recommend indoors you will probably die . the base is loose and falls over all the time . doesnt put out a lot of heat . i found it to be a waist .	-1
Used on a hunting trip for 8 days . I used this in a Hunting blind that was 4ft by 4ft and 5ft tall . The temp outside was in the 15-25 degrees Fahrenheit range . This heater never got the blind warm in the least . In fact it stayed so cold I could still see my breath while breathing and had to continue wearing my insulated coat , coveralls and boots . The only thing I was able to do with it was sit it under my chair to keep my rear end and back from freezing.While in operation the unit puts out a cone of heat about a foot to a foot and a half in front of the grill and then after that there is no heat at all.On the second day of the hunt I left it sitting on a camp table overnight while it sleeted an inch . The next morning it would not stay lit . Apparently the white material under the black mesh is a wick or something and wont stay lit while wet . Positioned it next to another heater ( minus the propane bottle ) for a couple hours and it began working again.On one full 16oz bottle It would last for two full days from sunup to sundown before it needed changed out . Walmart sells the 16.4oz bottles two for 4 $ , a much better deal than amazon offers so check there . It is either ON or OFF there is no temperature range setting.For next years hunt I will try the & # 34 ; Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Propane Heater & # 34 ; .	-1
I bought this fan for a week of camping in the Ozarks . I was absolutely thrilled to see the unit ran all night for the first two nights on a single battery . As a precaution I changed the battery on the third night . The unit was not working in the morning . Assuming it was a bad battery I changed it . It slowly began to run and just stopped . I was unable to get the unit to run any longer than a couple of minutes at a time , and then only by spinning the blades to get it started . I gave up after the fourth night and eight batteries later . We disassembled the unit and bypassed the switch . Still nothing . By squeezing the motor , we got it running well . Clearly the motor was n't up to the task as the brushes were most likely gone . This was unfortunate as the unit provided a decent flow of air , and was quiet enough to sleep with . However , the tiny motor is not good quality . Also , it costs just enough to be frustrating , but not enough to go through the frustration of returning .	-1
This is a rather adequate small , portable fan that will put out some air circulation . It is rather lite-weight , until you put in the monster sized D cell batteries . The weight gain is considerable . The battery power does not last long either , approximately three ( 3 ) hours if you are lucky when using this in non-stop mode . Have to agree with one of the other reviewers that when you insert the batteries the fan does tend to bulge out and then you have to wrestle with it trying to put the cap back on . I , too , broke the tabs on mine but that was fixed with duct tape . If attaching this item to your tent ceiling using the provided magnet , it will make the ceiling sag quite a bit , especially after inserting the batteries . Recommend using this item in a tent where you have some head room and not worry about banging your head on it . The fan blade is made of plastic , so , theoretically , you should not have to worry about getting cut . Overall , an alrite item .	-1
I got this for my tent , but it was n't worth it . I thought that it would be handy to have something that I could attach from the outside of the tent via the magnet , but I I did n't like it . I would not recommend	-1
going to buy a better one . went camping lakeside in June . Temperatures in the 80s at night . Fan did n't help much . Was also difficult to hang from our tent ceiling . Magnet comes out too easily .	-1
do n't recommend this product . it is a very low speed fan , and does n't really hang well anywhere it would work in a tent . I have a Copper Canyon 1610 -- so its a very large and durable tent .	-1
The product works so far , but it 's pretty much obsolete now . Meaning , everything now is LED powered , which are incredibly light and compact . This guy is bulky , very heavy ( with the batteries and magnet ) , and the light is pretty dim . I have an LED flashlight which is powered by watch batteries that is far brighter than this light , and it is the size of a large pen . This light takes 4 AA batteries and still gives off a pretty dim light . And did I mention it 's bulky and heavy ? Hey , the light works , the magnet is strong , and it does the job , but I 'll bet ( if it already does n't exist ) someone will come out with an LED tent light that is far brighter and much less bulky . I 'd recommend this light only for car camping and just for basic lighting needs , not for reading .	-1
I gave this 2 stars because it can be used as a groundlight or table light , but it is really not that useful as a wall tent light . It 's kind of heavy and drags on the tent fabric . The magnet fastener seems like a good idea , but it 's not too practical in use . It also kept coming apart from the battery compartment , which I found annoying .	-1
Something that is going to support a stove , with explosive fuel and fire , should not be flimsy . I ca n't remember whether they have locks on the individual legs to keep the plastic from sliding up , or what the problem was , but we really tried to make this work but decided it was just unsafe and not worth it .	-1
I think this product is priced too high based on it 's quality ( I paid $ 32 , I think it 's worth about $ 20 ) . The stand is very shaky and it really needs to be staked down when used . Also if you use the stand to place a camp stove on it you need to secure the stove to the stand with velcro straps . The good news is that it is very light , compact and easy to use . The height is just right as well .	-1
This is a horrible little stinky stove that is very inefficient by today 's standards . Trust me , I 'm a sucker for older designs ... this ai n't one you want to hold onto . The burners are fickle , leave soot on the bottom of your gear , and are grossy inefficent at heating stuff - the main reason you presumably are in the market for a stove . Get a propane unit first of all , second of all , get one with the knobs on either end , and not side by side - those stick , wo n't adjust , and are horrible as well . I went through the entire Coleman catalog so I could help you . Learn from my mistakes . This stove would probably be ok if the apocalypse comes and you want to run the stove for awhile from your burnt out car 's gas tank . Otherwise , you will look like a moron among your fellow car camping friends meantime .	-1
I am really supprised that Coleman put thier name on this kit . Well , sorry two pieces in this kit . What I am talking sbout is what they call a dust pan and dust broom . These items should be included in a childs tent kit . The dust pan dose n't even measure 5 '' X 5 '' . Same with the dust broom , if that is what it is . The mallot seems to be really sturdy and well made . The tent stakes seem alright considering they have a plastic top . We will see how the stake puller works when I tear down the tent ... ... ... update commimg . All in all I am not really happy with this kit , but I guess it is Ok for the price .	-1
If you buy this stove , please stick with Coleman fuel . If you use gasoline , plan on the generator tube clogging up in a VERY short time , leaving you with an expensive paperweight.Yes , it 's dual fuel , as long as you do n't really expect it to operate very long before dying .	-1
Ok , not sure about all the 4 & 5 star ratings on this product . I 've owned both the Coleman model 533 and the model 553 , it 's 'big brother ' , and neither are impressive . They lack fine mid-range temperature control , versus the Feather 400 model , are quite temperamental to cold-starts unless on high and kept on high during the cook . The smaller tank on the 533 model means more frequent in-meal pumping of the fuel tank , and do n't dare DREAM of burning gasoline in the stove , regardless what the sales marketing says - because there are NUMEROUS COLEMAN WARNINGS inside the box of what it will do to your stove and its generator ... they REALLY do n't want you burning unleaded gasoline in their multi-fuel stove ( hey , Coleman , do n't make sure a big deal out of it in the box paperwork , if you are going to sell it as an intentional dual-fuel stove in the marketing phase , ok ? ) Overall , it is dependable to fire and burn , but hey , so are a few sticks of wood - and it is about as controllable for a fire as two sticks burning . It is what it is , cheap . You can do better with an Optimus or MSR all-fuel stove . Why do n't you check them out first , most of them pack smaller , burn better , and are built MUCH better ... and if you get their multi-fuels , they do n't warn you to death not to burn multi-fuels in it , they merely tell you how to properly service it after you have . What a concept . Coleman products have become a money grabbing , poor-quality fiasco in modern times . I do not recommend the 533 or the 553 stoves , as a result of this showing in both products .	-1
Made of cheap plastic and has no power to blow up my boat pontoons . It will , however , help with deflation times , so not a total loss .	-1
I bought this to inflate my Sevylor Tahiti , but its does not have the legs to fill it properly . Its fills the boat to a point then air starts being pushed back out the intake hole . The boat still needed help from my lungs to be full up .	-1
I bought 4 of these bags thinking they would work well for camping when the evening temps droped to 50 . Everybody in the family complained of being cold ! I used mine as cover instead of a bag , the double thickness made it warm enough.In all fairness I have used it as liner quite sucessfully . I put it in a 20 degree bag in tempts of slightly less than 20 . Slept on ice pack with a Thermarest pad and was surprisingly comfortable . It did feel nice to the touch.I really ca n't recomend this for anything other than sleep overs or a heated caabin type of camping . Using as a liner is barely acceptable , it adds alot of unnecessary bulk , your better off getting a bag thats rated a little lower than expected .	-1
I have seen these locally for about $ 8.00 each on sale , so I thought $ 20 for 6 sounded like a good deal . The $ 20 or below is for only ONE bag ! NOT a good deal at all .	-1
Leaked on first use , I had to patch the pvc . The way the PVC is stored leads to creases and tears . I believe the tear in the PVC was made prior to my receiving the product .	-1
I bought this for my scouts , it was far too small to wash anything bigger than silverware and one of the legs broke before then even filled it with water the first time . Since they were also limited to cold water because the material gets soft when on contact with heat , I decided to go back to my 5-gal bucket wash system .	-1
I really despised this Coleman PVC sink and it now lives in my bin of rejected and unloved camping gear . I gave it a chance , but it is too small to be useful and very unstable . With hot water , it feels like a child 's pool toy that 's been left out in the sun . It was a waste of money . It wo n't last and will soon end up in a landfill . There are far better products out there.Seattle Sports Pack Sinksare larger and tougher . I use two of them when car camping . It costs more , but it works and makes the whole camping experience that much more enjoyable . Problem solved . You do n't need to settle for this chintzy and cramped little piece of junk . Spend a little more for something that works and that you can depend on . Go big or stay home .	-1
The buckets leak into each other , it was tiny and very flimsy .	-1
As some other reviewers mentioned happened to them , one side of our unit sprang a leak on its inaugural trip . The other side held up fine with no collapsing even without water in both bins . We used the leaky side as a holder between wash and wipe . It was helpful but not as helpful as the functional unit would have been.Given that some people love this and some hate it , I am wondering if the big issue is one of quality control . I am still thinking about replacing it hoping to get one of `` the good ones '' .UPDATE 9/18/2011I did purchase a second one and when we opened this one there were two holes in it . We spent some time trying to figure this out , it is a great idea . Clearly others had successful ones . We wanted ours to work ! Sadly , we are going back to the bulky 1950s porcelain basin .	-1
I purchased this to use during tailgating.Tried it out for 1/2 hour or so and was not satisfied.Very little heat produced . Could only feel a difference if within a few inches of the heater . Would probably work just fine in an enclosed area , but not out in the open . Will need to look for something else , or just deal with the cold : ) Item was returned .	-1
This looked like a good buy for a camp mess kit . Unfortunately , it is hard to open and close because the handle that holds every thing in , is held by a screw . I found it hard to open and I overloosened the screw which then dropped out of the handle and I could not find it . The kit was hard to put back together anyway as the pot handle did n't fold right . Not a good buy . I recommend that if one purchases a mess kit , that they get one which the handle folds rather than screws together . The handle makes it easy to use and a folding handle is easy to open and there are no parts that can be lost .	-1
I was a boy scout in my young days and had a similar mess kit for camping . This one does n't even come close to the quality of the old stuff . It 's thin , cheap , worthless crap and I 'm being kind in my review of this item . The warning label on the box says `` Made In China . Contains chemicals that may cause birth defects or damage reproductive organs . '' Do n't waste your money on this mess kit .	-1
I originally gave this a decent rating but I 've changed my mind , this thing is so cheap and crappy I would n't recommend it unless you 're only going for one day camping and that 's it . It was cool that it all folded into one , nice that you get a cup and a pot with a lid but this thing is so flimsy it eventually would n't hold itself together . If this thing were made of better quality I would buy it in a heart beat . But this thing is so cheap , you get what you paid for .	-1
Mal producto , inutil para cualquier cosa , no sirve ni para juguete de ninios , no lo devolvi porque no valia la pena es dinero tirado .	-1
While the Amazon price is great , this lightweight aluminum mess kit is just not good enough for heavy camping use . We also bought the more expensiveTexsport Stainless Steel Mess Kitand are much happier with that kit.Here are my observations on this disappointing Coleman Kit : Pros -+ Folds up nicely for easy transporting+ Mug is actually kinda niceCons -- Frying Pan handle is secured in place with a `` wingnut '' and is so thin that it bends with any weight in the pan- Pot Lid is flimsy and poorly fittingNot Recommended ! CFH	-1
Despite being very light weight , this is not worth the money . The handle for the pan gets very hot , and is n't strong enough . The pot , when filled with water and lifted from the handle , will tilt over sideways and spill water everywhere.I did not expect much when I bought it , but I had hoped it would at least be functional .	-1
well , it is lightweight and easy to use but the aluminum is cheap , bends easily , takes on soot badly ... i gues it would be nice for a child but it isnt for serious camping .	-1
I guess if you need to cook 4 different things at the same time this might be worth it . But I 'll never need that . The metal is so thin it practically bends when you touch it ; now , that does mean that it 's very light , so it 's not all bad . It does fold up pretty small too . But the `` cup '' is about the right size for an espresso . So I 'm not going to use this , I 'm going to get a `` Stanley Adventure Camp Cook Set '' instead . It 's a metal cup , with folding handle , lid , and comes with two plastic cups that fit inside . You can also fit a gas canister and stove if you remove one or both of the cups . This Coleman set does have a pot with a lid , so when I decided to get a cup I searched for a cup with a lid . I only found two , strangely . Most metal cups have no lid , which is very inefficient in that it wastes fuel .	-1
My local WalMart sells these for $ 9 - about the same as Amazon - and I own three of them . After using the military-issue mess kits , I wanted some more for camping . This is what I ended up getting . I 'm disappointed . I 'll talk about this kit piece-by-piece.In general , the aluminum is pretty thin for a mess kit . Even when being very careful , I can only get five or six uses out of a piece before it gets too weak to be useful . The metal bends , melts , and gets holes in it with normal use . It 's just not made to withstand heat . Yes , it all nests together , provided you put it back together the same way it came out of the box . I 've found that I have to bend the plate ( which is more like a bowl ) somewhat to get it all back together . Unacceptable.-Eight-ounce cup . Yeah , it 's an aluminum cup with a handle . It holds eight ounces . The handle comes off without much use , which of course it 's not supposed to . If you 're thinking about boiling water in this ... do n't . This will work fine as a cup for cooled liquids.-Six-inch deep dish plate . It 's not six inches deep . It 's 6 inches in diameter , and about 1-1/2 '' deep . It 's more like a shallow bowl . Good for using as a plate or shallow bowl . The corners seem to be weak in mine , but the bottom always burns through first . It 's better than using a sheet of aluminum foil , but not by much.-7.5 inch frying pan . This is the same as the plate , just a tiny bit larger , but with a handle secured to it with a wingnut . Tighten the wingnut to lock the handle into place , either open for frying pan use , or closed to keep the kit together . The handle is very weak , and can barely support the weight of the pan with food in it . Again , it falls apart with normal use.-16-ounce pot with lid . The pot and lid count as two pieces in this five-piece set . It 's a weak pot with a weak hanging wire . You can boil some water in it , sure , but it 's not well-suited for cooking food . The lid is crappy and thin , and the small nub on the top ( it 's supposed to be a knob ) is just a piece of plastic that 's lazily screwed into the lid . Between the screw and the underside of the lid is , well glue . Something to drip into your boiling water when it heats up.Overall , this is a very cheap set . Not inexpensive at nine dollars , but cheap . It 's flimsy , and at times , dangerous . There 's no way you 're going to make a meal , even for one person , with this thing without spilling stuff . Better than aluminum foil , sure , but not by much . Also , make sure you stick some plastic silverware in this . You 'll have to snap off the butt end of everything so it fits , but you 'll have it .	-1
I bought these because I needed some cheap aluminum cookingware . I thought Coleman made pretty good stuff but this stuff is a joke . The aluminum handle on the frying pan is held with a single wing nut . If you do not tighten it enough , the pan will turn and spill . The rivets that hold the pan on are way too weak , I feel the whole handle assembly sag with no weight on it ! The rest of the kit is just as poorly made , I would not trust it backpacking or even on a camping trip . I could n't recommend this in either of those situations .	-1
Do not spend money on this item . It simply does not put out to the test . Not good . Invest in higher end products and we get better supplies.LouieV .	-1
Coleman products are almost always great , but this is not one of them . Made out of cheap aluminum , it is not sturdy and has no non-stick treatment , so cleaning is a pain . It basically can be used for one person for cooking a meal , but at a little more than a pound , it 's not worth it . I would n't even buy it as a beginner set for the new camper . I recommend the `` Open Country Sierra 5-Piece Nonstick Backpacker Cooking Set '' . It is treated with a non-stick coating on all sides and is lightweight . You really do n't need more than two pots for cooking a meal for one to four people . Always remember - you get what you pay for .	-1
this kit is a joke its so thin and weak . i didnt trust the handle and tested it when any weight was put in it the handle bent . i dont even want to waste time with this junk on fire it would be full of holes	-1
They 're all aluminum but very tiny . If you were a lone survivalist and this was all you had , they are great but for a family of 4 not so much .	-1
To say it simply the metal is too thin for actual flame use . The metal will bend and you will either burn yourself catching it or spill your rations . I can not see any other use for this except as a pet food bowls . Do not buy .	-1
I bought this product a local gun/outdoor store . It was only $ 4 and I thought it would be decent to cook a few meals.They are cheaply made and bend/dent easy.Once you burn something , the thing is trash.I suppose you can use it for an emergency in your car .	-1
Cheap . not much else to say , dont really waste your time , just go and get a GCI set up insteat , will last multiply times and then you know you have quality ...	-1
If this is all you can afford , then so be it . You can cook with it , but it 's very basic and light-duty . If you still want it , check at garage sales and do n't spend over a buck for the whole kit .	-1
I found the quality less than expected . The frying pan was dented just from closing it as the lid to the kit . However , if you need something extremely light , it will work , but it will bend easily . I would not recommend it for multiple uses .	-1
While this stove creates plenty of heat and will do so under wet , windy conditions . The few times i have used it , when I was finished with the stove , and removed the gas cylinder for transport . The Cylinder SEALS were compromised and leaked until the cylinder was EMPTY . I have several other stoves which use the same cylinders and NONE of them compromise the cylinder seals . Dangerous waste of fuel and a definite weakness in stove function..	-1
I purchased two cups for a camping trip and was a little disappointed to find that they were both dented . Even if they were not damaged I probably would have returned them because the `` lip '' of the cup was a bit sharp and I was concerned that I would cut my lip when drinking from the cup .	-1
The enamel chipped off through normal wear and tear after a few uses and I threw it out .	-1
Very poor enamel finish and the utensils are plastic ( not enamel like the GSI brand ) .Had to send back . expect more from a Coleman item.Amazon refunded the items so that made the experience easy on the wallet .	-1
Like other reviews , mine came chipped . It was one of the mugs . Feel dumb for buying a dining kit in the first place because the last thing you wan na do while camping is wash dishes . We ended up using paper plates . Only used two of the mugs for coffee in the morning . Other than the chipped mug they seemed ok .	-1
Let me say that the only reason that I gave this product 2 stars was because the cups and bowls are Ok. Everything seemed to be well made . The plates looked really good until I looked a little closer . Three of them have chips around the edges . I really expected better quality from Coleman . I would return them but I am so tired of businesses selling junk . I mean who inspects these things before they are sold to a customer.Update : I now understand why the quality of this product is so poor . I was under the impression that all Coleman products were American Made . When I went to wash this set to put it with the other camping equipment , I found on the bottom of each piece a sticker that said Made in China . Don , t get me wrong I am not prejudice in any way . It is just that now I understand why Colemans quality has gotten so poor .	-1
As hot as it feels when you put your hand to it , it wo n't heat up even a small tent .	-1
I have purchased several of these portable heaters over the years for tents , cars , trucks , and boats . This one was the most disappointing . I was in a car that broke down in Southern Ohio one winter night . I could barely feel the heat from this heater inside . I had some blankets which kept me warm until morning when someone came by . This heater is useless .	-1
Maybe it arrogance or just being lazy , I keep hopping that each time I use this thing it will live up to it reputation and not spill a drop . However , it never does . Leaks at every point that there is a crack , not a lot but a definite puddle of fuel . Then when you remove it ( from the lantern or stove ) , splash more fuel comes out . Never liked it after the first use , but its become a staple joke at our camp as for how much fuel it spills . We almost take bets on how much .	-1
Even though the lantern I purchased came with a funnel , I wanted to try this out as an alternative.Upon installing it on the end of the Coleman fuel can , I tipped it to check for leaks . None out of the end of the spout , but lots around the threads . After tightening it a bit more , I checked again . A bit less leakage , but still present . After applying monkey torque to the filler , it seemed to stop leaking , but it took lots more force to remove it . The strong spring to keep the filler shut is great except that it takes one hand to hold the lantern and one to pour . With a one gallon flimsy can it is difficult to safely do .	-1
When my Coleman stove arrived , it came with a funnel . There was no need to purchase this additional funnel whose shipping charge was about the same as the cost of the funnel .	-1
I bought this for the power outages we have occasionally in the Puget Sound . Keeping it charged every 3 months , the first time it was needed all worked as hoped , mostly . I say mostly because the difference between the `` High '' setting and the `` Low '' setting are pretty much indistinguishable.I was able to get more than 3 hours of light with no problems on that occasion , and the power came back on before the light dimmed or the battery ran out.The fluorescent light tends toward the blue , and has quite a bit of glare to it . I put an unwanted CD up inside the lantern above the bulb to get more light out of it.The next time it was needed , about a year later , the lantern worked for about 45 minutes then turned itself off . If you toggle the switch from `` off '' to `` High '' the light will come back on for a couple of minutes , then turn back off . The little yellow night light still worked however so it was n't a completely useless object . OK , so once the power was restored , back it went onto the charger and I chalked it up to my error of going too long between charges.I called Coleman `` customer service '' and spoke to the nice lady there . She could not tell me how long nor how frequently the lantern should be charged . `` You could just leave it on the charger all the time , I suppose . '' She said . Really ? A sealed lead-acid battery on the charger all the time ? That just does n't sound right . So I 'd charge it every 3 months for one day each time . There is NO CHARGED INDICATOR LIGHT.Fast forward two years to this week , ( January 15-18 , 2012 ) and we are having a real snow and then freezing rainstorm , so I put the Coleman Retro on the charger yesterday for five hours . Then today , 5:45 pm , tick , the lights went out . OK no worries , we 're all charged up ! No , WE are not . About 1 hours ' worth of light and ... off goes the light . Mess with the switch , light comes back on a couple of minutes , then off . Same as last time.A visit to the Coleman Company website will reveal a bunch of reviews exactly like this one . Some say it 's the battery , some think it 's the switch , whatever it is , this unit has proved to be unreliable and not good to go for emergency lighting.It 's cute as the dickens , and if you never hope to have it actually work as intended , would be a nice piece of decoration , or perhaps a paperweight . But for me , I 'm done with Coleman battery operated lanterns .	-1
Coleman Lantern ReviewWeak Plastic & Small ScrewsWARNING : Not for use camping , but makes nice end table lamp.I was pleased when it arrived and liked the light . The fact that it was rechargeable was a real boon as well . I got it less than a year ago and in fact had an opportunity to use it only seldom , despite living on a country property.Well , I had it on an overturned milk crate to light the area and I figure that 's twelve inches off the ground and I knocked it and it fell off . It fell those precipitous twelve inches into redwood duff - that 's right , duff - you know , the soft underfloor of a redwood forest , so soft in fact one could and even want to nap in it quite pleasantly , it 's so soft . It was an unusually gentle fall , even slow when it tipped , that I bet a stemmed wine glass would have survived.Then snap ! To my astonishment , the lantern broke clean in two - like an exaggeration of how gentle the fall was . The battery base and the light itself seemed to have cleaved clean off . Two separate pieces.At first I was dumbfounded , but then inspected the lantern with thoughts of fixing it readily . No go . The base is the heavier part , weighing a few pounds . It is held to the top lantern by three of the flimsiest screws . Perhaps the size one might use to hold a set of eyeglasses together . Astoundingly under-supported.The plastic is cracked around those screws so they will never hold again . Only a serious gloopy epoxy might do it , and even that would be tricky.This is a fine lantern but , should you buy , I recommend not taking it out of the box . Minor things like a sneeze or a slight breeze may be the death of this one . Or throw it away immediately upon arrival - you 'll be safer.Luckily I had a light to get back to the house , and was not on some camping trip . Could you imagine if this was a primary source of light and I was in actual need , plunged into darkness ? I contacted Coleman and they were surprisingly curt , with zero bedside manner when it comes to customer service . I would even say rude - they blamed me.After a few form submissions I got them to say that they only offer customer service for manufacturer 's defects . I suggested that this happened before the manufacturing - that this was actually a design defect . They did not like that . Basically , it was , `` tough , you dropped it . `` Well , I did drop it , so they 're right . But it was akin to setting down a bottle of water and having the glass shatter . I would naturally have some sort of expectation that the glass would be a tad more durable . Likewise with a camping lantern - just a touch anyway . The cause was disproportionate with the effect - it 's a product weakness and a serious one.It 's a design failing and a fatal flaw . I recommend staying away from this one . I seriously would not take this to the outdoors and I do believe it will let you down.And , as far as Coleman goes , I do n't think they care much about their customers : if my experience is the norm , I 'd recommend avoiding interacting with Coleman altogether . Not a very pleasant experience . Find another better made brand and be happy and safe . Worth it -*************** Update 2013 : ***************I have continued to try and work with Coleman and they just simply do n't seem to care about their customers or their product - I would say , it was an overall insulting experience . I have given up at this point.My assessment remains essentially the same - there is a critical design flaw and makes for a weak unit . Knowing what I know now , I would not feel comfortable camping with one of these.I buy a lot of products of this type and have never gone back to Coleman - in fact , I have gotten a bit of joy from consciously avoiding them : not like I 'm snubbing them exactly , but more like I take some satisfaction in knowing I 'm not going to stuck with some inferior product that is going to let me down .	-1
These Chinese made Coleman lanterns have a defect in the rechargeable battery . Most of them can not be recharged more than a few times ! Seriously . Go to the coleman web site and read the reviews on this product . I have one that I have to toss even though it 's seen very little use . Just like the majority of other reviewers on the Coleman site , mine wo n't hold a charge even though it 's seen less than half a dozen charge cycles .	-1
This quick & # 34 ; pump & # 34 ; is not very useful and not of the best quality . The worst part is the adapters / tips included . It includes two adapters - one for typical pinch valves and the other for larger valves typically found on blow-up mattresses . I found that the tip for use on the pinch valves is still too big . It barely would fit in those types of valves and required a lot of effort . There are some pinch valves it simply will not fit in . After using it on ten different valves the tip broke off . Now the item is useless . Poor design and poor quality . Avoid .	-1
Does what it says , but blocks more light to the rear than it reflects forward . Probably wo n't use much unless i 'm in a camp site that is close to others and staying up late .	-1
The top part where it sits on the crown of your head is camoflauge patterned . Sort of a dark multicam pattern.The mesh material itself is n't very fine . It 's not & # 34 ; No-see-um & # 34 ; proof , so the smaller insects can get inside . The holes are just too big.I would presume a juvenile mosquito could , if it tried , barely squeeze in there , but it should hold out the ticks .	-1
I purchased one of these Coleman Insect Nets yesterday ; what a disappointment ; it does not even resemble the photo on the box or in the adds . If I put it over my head it is skin tight . That would not work , eh ? For one of these type net to work you have to wear them over a hat with a brim to keep the netting a couple of inches from your skin . I can not get my hat in to this net it is so small . Evidently Coleman has changed the producers of this net ? A few years ago they where big enough . That 's why you see some positive reviews on here ; look at the dates and do n't buy this net ! Coleman Insect Head Net	-1
It 's light and fits just right over a hat and would be a wonderful product if the mesh was fine enough . Unfortunately the mesh is rather course and will keep out mosquitoes and houseflies but is useless against black flies . I grew to detest this product after having to use it for a few hours in black fly season .	-1
It was split at the seem and I was not able to use it even once . Low quality . Seemed like it would be good .	-1
While the concept of a nice warm shower while camping sounds great , Coleman fell way short of the mark with this product , much to my dismay . I ordered two of these solar showers for use on a three-month cross country roadtrip and have only attempted to use them once . The main design flaw with this solar shower lies in the upper reinforcement bar that is supposed to act as a handle to tie the bag up . While a full length handle would have provided ample support and added only an ounce or two to the weight , Coleman decided to install a hollow plastic rod that is slightly wider than the opening you can see in the product picture . This means that all the weight of the water ( approximately 40lbs when full ) is now pulling at the edges of the pvc pipe handle and will surely rip the vinyl material of the bag after one or two uses . Since this is supposed to be used in hot weather ( to heat up the water ) , the material tends to become very stretchy and malleable to the point where even just lifting the bags ( nevermind suspending them ) by the handle makes a rip or tear eminent.Furthermore , the filler cap will not hold water if the bag is laid on a table to heat up . Unless propped up so the cap is on top , the bag will slowly leak through the ill designed cap ( it 's soft rubber rather than hard plastic ) . As mentioned before I was afraid to hang the bag to let it heat up and had to make a bullwork of camping gear to prop it up on a picnic table.Finally the shower tube is far too long to be practical . I remember using one of these about 20 years ago while on my grandparents boat , and we would hoist it up the mast on our flag halyard to allow enough room underneath to shower . For camping , however , unless you have a pulley set up for a bear bag , the long hose is fairly impractical as it obviously wont work unless you 're under the bulk of the water supply . I suppose that cutting the hose and reattaching the shower head would have been an easy solution but after the first two drawbacks I was so upset with this product that I packed it up and am actually sending it home to save some room in my travel gear.I 'm very disappointed with Coleman over this product . I have used many Coleman camping products over the years and even currently on this trip and have had good results . For anyone looking for a good solar shower I can only suggest that you try elsewhere as this product is pretty much a waste of time and money . Luckily , Amazon offers it for about half the cost of the identical item in the big name stores , so I didnt lose out on too much money .	-1
you would expect with a name like coleman that this would be a good piece of equipment ... . it is at best a one time use thing .	-1
Minus one star above ... I got this for my son because he likes bushcraft and all that outdoor type of gear like dad . Well you can imagine what happened , it broke , it split in the middle during the first use on a twig lol ... . I knew it would , but figured my son could get a few uses out of it . I got it at A academy like the other poster on here did . Anyways i did notice there are different types of these mini wire saws , like the sportsmans and the commando . I would just go out and buy a real chain and attach two ends to hold it with if your looking for some type of back up . The whole point of me posting is so you do n't waste your money ! I would n't take this if it were free let 's put it that way : - )	-1
I purchased several to give to my scouts as a FUN survival tool . Good thing I tested it out first . I broke two in 10 minutes . The 1st may have been defective so I gave it another chance with a second . The problem is that the cutting wire is very thin and weakens with every pull because it heats up from the friction/ cutting action until it eventually fails/ breaks . I did try different kinds of wood ... hardwood/ softer pine , dead dry limbs and on living tree branches ( wet ) . All test branches were less than 2 inches in diameter.The only way it could work without breaking is not practical - go so slow as not to create heat . It would take more than an hour to cut through 1 inch . OR you could bend and break the 1 inch diameter twig !	-1
I got this at Academy Sports for $ 2 . It cuts slowly and it broke in the first 30 seconds of use . Just dont waste your money with this . The wire is about the same as a guitar string .	-1
I have been purchasing Coleman products for forty years or better , this is the first piece of # @ ! ! * @ that I have ever purchased of theirs , heck I bought two and they are both loose , wobbly , cheep made # @ ! ! * @ . Shame on you Coleman ! ! ! ! !	-1
Ok , generally the Coleman name makes me think of affordable , yet tough and rugged equipment , or at least it did till I got this FLIMSY PIECE OF JUNK . I 'm sure it 'll saw just fine , but my problem is the darned thing DOES NOT STAY SHUT ! If I have a folding knife ( or saw in this case ) , I want to know it will stay shut when it 's shut and open when open . Well , it appears to lock open ok , but it wo n't lock closed ! The blade just falls open right away after you fold it up ! I tightened the screw to make it tougher to open , and that helped a bit , but it still looks like it could jostle open an inch . An inch of open blade is still too much open blade when I WANT IT CLOSED ! The last thing I want to do when I 'm out in the wilderness is reach in my pack for my saw and encounter the teeth ! BEWARE ! The saw does not even fold up decently ! The only reason I 'm giving it 2 stars is because it looks like it would cut ok. Buy at your own risk ! I thought I 'd enjoy having a nice light-weight , yet durable fold up saw , but I might just go for a normal camping saw with a blade guard ! I 'm really disappointed I wasted the money on something that looked to be a really good buy . Sadly , it 's not even worth the hassle of returning !	-1
This thing is garbage and broke REALLY fast . Do n't buy this you 'll want to punch yourself in the throat for wasting the money . I would have been better off with a plastic kids sand shovel.What broke ? The twist-lock contraption that allows the shovel to fold and then extend into a locked position is weakly constructed.After like three or four scoops it broke and now i have a limp shovel , incapable of locking into position .	-1
The fat metal part you see in the picture on the shaft ? - yeah , that one , it 's not big enough . So when you slide it all the way up - your shovel is going to close anyway on your first dig . It could be used to move ashes around in a fire pit , that 's about it . I returned in within 15 minutes of opening the box . Buy yourself a stand US Military Issue E-Tool if you need to do more than build sandcastles with your shovel.The price is right , so some of you will buy one anyway . I did , lol . But look for yourself when you do ; extend the shovel , spin the clamp up the shaft until its very tight , and then grab the shovel and bend it , it will bend right back into it 's folding position after defeating the little clamp . It needs a solid metal O-Ring / Washer above the clamp , or bigger arms on the shovel . A waste of time .	-1
I kind of figured you could n't go wrong with the Coleman name since I recall the brand fondly from years ago . Well I was wrong . Coleman should be ashamed to put their name on this Chinese POS . It folded like it made from tin the first time I tried to use it . The only positive thing I can say about it is I did n't feel too bad when I tossed it in the trash . Even if it was free and you only had to pay for shipping ... Well , it is n't worth even the price of shipping .	-1
The steel ring where the shaft contacts the back of the shovel head is n't hardened . The shovel basically ripped itself apart the first time I used it to dig a hole in not very hard soil . Good thing it was n't an emergency . I expected at least `` ok '' quality from Coleman , it seems they really let there quality hit rock bottom . Looks like I have a new door stop , and will be looking for a new camp shovel . Unless you are looking to scooping a litter box do n't waste yer money on this garbage .	-1
The pictures are deceiving . The blade is about the same size as my hand . Could one use this thing to dig a hole ? Sure . Just do n't be in a hurry . And do n't need a big one . I would sent this back except it does n't take up a lot of space and will probably work in a pinch.Mechanically it is very nice . The serrated edge wo n't make it to the level of being a joke . It is nothing more than wiggles in the side of the blade . The blade has been somewhat 'sharpened ' . But there really was n't a lot of effort put into it . The grips are decent.The next time I will definitely take a close look at the overall dimensions .	-1
It weights 18 ounces ( does n't list that on the item page ) . Also you do n't need the handle extension so you can make it a few ounces lighter . The construction seems pretty solid ... Going to test it out test in out in a couple days so if there are any issues I will abridge my reviewEDIT** After 4-5 uses on soft ground the shovel had difficulty staying extended and consequently kept folding up.. Maybe I just got a bad model but I 'm not impressed .	-1
it does its job but feels cheap , I suppose you get what you pay for.. but its not all that easy to pack back in . I would say it is ok to keep the grass off ya..but I would not recommend to a friend	-1
Do not buy this pad ! I agree with all the bad reviews found here . You may as well sleep on the ground with no pad ... that is how useless this Coleman pad is . Do yourself a favor and go buy a hammock tent and never sleep on the ground again .	-1
This item is really a tent with an open side so you need to be prepared to put it up like a tent.Cons : -It takes two people to assemble.-You have to stake it or it 's fairly easy to knock over with a breeze . I do n't see how this is possible with the stakes that are provided . How do you drive a thin wire like stake into the sand ? -The paths for the rods are made of mesh . They tore in several places when feeding the rods through and also when removing them . Removing the rods through the mesh paths was very frustrating.Pros : - Price- Has a floor- Compact when packed- Light weight- Roomy	-1
Average quality set , handle wrapping coming apart after only 5 games . It is hard to find a good badminton set now days .	-1
I bought this after so many good reviews . The unit came with a box full of parts and at least one of the main screws was much larger than its supposed to be .	-1
I had to return this mirror because it did n't work for my bike , I guess it was missing parts as I was unable to install it on my bike . It looks great on the picture but it just did n't work for me , so I had to return it .	-1
After less than a year of ownership the brass ferrules that go into the hard plastic rendered the black plastic useless.The back plastic insert splits and wont allow you to tighten the mirror . This mirror starts off great but deteriorates quickly ...	-1
The Mirrycle often fails to reveal what 's behind you . There 's no perfect position you can put it in to always reflect to your eyes the positions of cars behind you . In contrast , my helmet-mounted mirror can be set in one position that *always* reveals what 's behind me.The Mirrycle 's failure mode is a function of the changing shape , width and topography of roads you bicycle on and how your handlebar happens to align with the road and your eyes . You ca n't move your handlebar just to correct the often incorrect line-of-sight because handlebar position is a function exclusively of the direction you must travel . In contrast , with a helmet-mounted mirror you can move your head just to bring things into sight . And if you re-adjust the Mirrycle every time the line-of-sight is off , you 'll have to re-adjust it frequently . This is n't an opinion , but a matter of physical fact.Another downside is cars appearing in the Mirrycle look much further away than they are due to its slightly convex shape . In contrast , my helmet-mounted mirror is perfectly flat and so cars appear to be exactly as close as they are . With roadway safety in mind , this is n't a trivial matter . Using my helmet-mounted mirror and the Mirrycle at the same time makes it clear that the illusion of being further away creates a false sense of safety , for when I switch to looking at my helmet-mounted mirror , I 'm suddenly persuaded to be more careful once I 've been accurately informed that the car coming up behind me is actually very close . Interjecting an illusion into an optical safety mechanism is crazy if there 's a way to avoid it , as there is with the use of a helmet-mounted mirror.The Mirrycle is also frequently in the way . You have to remember to re-position it before you plunge into an offroad trail in the woods . You ca n't have it sticking out as intended for roadway use when you 're navigating the often narrow twists and turns alongside trees and bushes . Yet even in the tucked-in position it 's in the way of your hand , as for example when you need to quickly dismount and remount . So while you 're off-road you have no rear-view mirror , unless you have a helmet-mounted mirror , which works as perfectly off- as on-road . And sometimes when you 're off-road , you do want to check if another biker is coming up behind you.So my helmet-mounted mirror always works both on- and off-road , but the Mirrycle only works on-road sometimes .	-1
The connection device on this mirror is a plastic part that deformed when tightened . I contacted vendor to replace the part , and the told me to go through amazon , since I bought it there . What kind of customer service is this ? The small plastic wedge that holds the mirror in place could have easily been put in an envelope and mailed to me . Secondly , this part should be metal and not plastic , as it malfunctions when tightened . Could be a great product if the defect was corrected and the company backed its products .	-1
I really wanted to like this mirror as I had physically looked at several different types and this one seemed to have the most flexible use and mirror image quality ( actual glass ) . Some of these use plastic and the image quality is really poor . My attempt to install the mirror was thwarted by two bad screws . The screws themselves appeared to be okay however , they were either too long ( would not screw completely into their intended holes ) or their intended holes were too short or internally damaged which would not allow the screws to be properly seated . Because of this the mirror could not be assembled . It was returned .	-1
After reading through a bunch of reviews I saw one stating that the included screws do not match the holes they are supposed to fit into requiring rethreading of the holes . I did n't want to believe this but when I assembled mine I discovered that this was definitely the case . I threaded the screws in anyhow figuring I probably would n't take it back apart again . The only screw that actually fit was the one that holds the whole unit in the end of the handle bar which is nice so I can remove it if I want to . The overall quality is mediocre at best and I would recommend buying something perhaps made out of metal . The plastic parts feel cheap and would probably brake quite easily if your bike were to fall over for whatever reason . Mine did not have a convex lens so I ca n't speak to whether it actually makes a difference or not . Just know that if you buy this product , you 'll get what you pay for , if not something less than what you pay for . The price felt right at the time but knowing what I know now I 'd spend a little more on a nicer piece of equipment . If you just want something cheap that 'll get the job done then this will probably suffice , just be prepared to deal with the screw problem by either replacing them with proper screws or straining a little extra when screwing them in .	-1
My gripe with this product has to do with the mounting hardware , a plastic wedge held inside the handlebar tube by a barrel nut and a long Metric bolt . The installation instructions advise tightening as hard as possible and not worrying about breaking the hardware . Fair enough , but woe to you if you ever have to reinstall the mirror -- when you replace your handlebar grips , for example.I was able to unscrew the bolt far enough to loosen the wedge and remove the mirror , but then the barrel nut got stuck . I had to use pliers to fully unscrew it . Obviously , I could not reuse the nut or the bolt after this.Not wanting to pay $ 6.00 for a bolt , a nut , and postage , let alone wait several weeks for Mirrcycle to send the parts , I visited my local hardware store . It turns out that barrel nuts and long Metric bolts are not available at retail , even in a good store with a fully-stocked Servalite bulk hardware aisle.I came up with the following solution : I bought a narrower ( # 6-32 ) Imperial screw , 3 inches in length , and a black plastic knob with a threaded metal insert . ( These are standard Servalite parts , but if you ca n't find or do n't want to pay for the knob , a wing nut will also work . ) I passed the screw backward through the barrel nut ( threads not engaged due to narrow diameter of screw , screw head against barrel nut , threaded end of screw sticking out of handlebar end ) , screwed on the knob , and turned it to tighten the wedge . If anything , I now have a better setup , because I can use the knob to loosen the wedge and rotate the mirror base , which allows me to adjust the mirror on a third , sort of up-and-down , axis . The normally-installed mirror can only be adjusted on two , basically side-to-side , axes.If I could reconsider this purchase , I would buy asimple mirrorthat attaches to the handlebar with a wrap-around clip secured by a screw.It 's telling that Mirrcycle includes an order form for replacement hardware with every mirror , and has a special online store just for this purpose . The company should be ashamed of itself for supplying lousy fasteners and profiting from the sale of replacements . The $ 4.00 postage charge -- almost ten times the cost of the necessary 44-cent stamp -- is insulting . $ 1.50 for a bolt is also about five times the normal retail price.Mirrcycle ought to switch to Imperial bolts and barrel nuts , at least for the U.S. market , since long Metric bolts are not available in hardware stores . A better design would use an ordinary nut , instead of a barrel nut , to grip the wedge . Finally , at these high prices , and given that bicycles are used outdoors , Mirrcycle could well afford to supply stainless steel fasteners , instead of zinc ones that are guaranteed to corrode .	-1
I 'll admit that my purpose was way non-standard - putting 10 lb metal weights on top of the main drain in my pool . When we finally got the pool problem fixed , I raised the bag and discovered that it leaked ; the metal weights had rusted , and brown water ran out . The pool was 9 ' deep , but I figured the bag would withstand seepage at that depth , but I was wrong .	-1
The oil bottle arrived empty , the pegs were missing , and there were no instructions . Sent it back . If anyone can suggest a substitute kit , please post it .	-1
When I opened my kit for the first time the sword oil container was open and the oil had spilled all over everything inside . Company should make a better oil container . Not going to return such a low price product . Shipping would be more trouble than it 's worth .	-1
this should be and could be the most handy little box for a bow hunter . i got this to hold the different tips i may need while out hunting . i had to cut the foam down to fit some of my larger rage broadheads . the little white plastic sectioned box is also crappy . i keep the rage repair/ rebuild kits in this . the section walls dont go all the way to the lid so all the blades , washers and so on all get mixed around if you put it in your pocket . the camo on the box is total crap , it looks like someone smeared on a small amount of dirt . they could not have cut more corners making this if they tried .	-1
listed as left or right handed and it is just RIGHT HANDED ONLY so I can not use it and got the full hand ... .	-1
I had such high hopes that this time I 'd find the right size but this mouthguard is a disaster . not only is it huge , even though I am an adult and ordered the junior size , but it 's so hard it made me gag really bad , made my gums bleed , and gave me a nasty jaw pain I never experienced before . yet another total waste of money , I 'd have happily shipped it back if it would n't involve additional international shipping cost . what a waste !	-1
Boil the heck out of it cause it 's thick and make sure to trim . I bought it to help me with snoring before I was diagnosed with apnea . It made me drool in my sleep . It comfy , but big .	-1
I followed the instructions on the label to get to shape this on my mouth , but instead the thing melted . Not impressed whatsoever with this . It 's cheap so I guess investing in an actual decent mouthguard might be a better idea .	-1
So I test drove the mouthguard while sparring , and I have to admit I was n't impressed . Despite being designed to allow mouth breathing , the passages are barely enough to provide enough air to someone sitting on a couch , let alone exercising . I would not recommend this mouthguard for athletes/fighters .	-1
Though they receive glowing reviews across the web , these just do n't work for me at all . The front dot is so huge is completely obscures the target , and I ca n't even see the rear line in order to `` make a lollipop '' . It may be my eyesight , but I just ca n't see the rear line reliably at my local range , and my accuracy is horrible with these sights.Your mileage may vary , but for me this was an expensive experiment that just did n't work out .	-1
What the manufacture wont tell you about these sights . once installed to adjust or remove the sights for any gunsmith work - will in fact destroy them . The sur-lok 1262 solution used ' to install the sights require heat to melt the bound between the slide and the sight . That much heat kills the tritium vial . Not making this up . I contacted their support and that 's the answer I received .	-1

This was being sold by The Sportsman 's Guide for $ 2 free shipping . I thought it was an amazing deal so I bought one , only to be refunded and told it was a & # 34 ; restricted item & # 34 ; and it was n't getting shipped . Yeah right . That 's BS right there . I 'm giving it zero stars for the simple fact that it ca n't be actually purchased for the price that 's advertised . I bought a whole crossbow with arrows through Amazon and that was n't & # 34 ; restricted & # 34 ; . Ridiculous .	-1

This was an excellent magazine holster that is specifically designed to accommodate two Glock 21 magazines . In the pouch I ordered , a loaded magazine fit snugly in one pouch and snapped shut fine . However , the other one was slightly too small and the magazine barely fit . The snap on that side would not close without excessive force and the magazine had to be pried out with quite a bit of force . It could have been really good , but ...	-1
First time used the handle just melted off . Came close to getting melted plastic on me . Dangerous .	-1
Worst duribility EVER ! The poorly manufactured lid was chipped by the handle when we opened the box , which immediately started rusting in our salt air . The rust continued for two months and started popping off the enameling . Coleman told us they were sending a new lid , arrive in 4-6 weeks . 4 MONTHS later we were still waiting . When it did arrive , there was no handle , or hinges . It did n't matter anyway as ALL the screws on this thing were rusted and would n't budge . Fast forward to month 12 of ownership . ( always kept this grill covered BTW ) I 'm doing my spring cleaning and taking out the bits of whatever from under the cooking grates ... .It 's totally rusted THROUGH the grill pan the size of a tennis ball ! ! ! ! ! They said it was from keeping it covered . So let me get this straight : you should n't cover it , you ca n't keep it outside or the air might get to it or might rain on it , you ca n't cook with the lid DOWN - so is the lid for rain protection ? Not with all the slits in the top to allow water in ! The company is replacing my grill , BUT I have to SHIP it to them , but I ca n't get the legs off due to rusted hardware . The cost of shipping that large and heavy of a box is over $ 60 ! ! ! ! I was happy using it as a grill , but for $ 170 it should be heartier than 12 months ! ! !	-1
I had an older version of the road trip that lasted for many outing with numerous rebuilds of components . It was a great grill but it finally got impractical to replace the parts . I picked up a new one in the LXE model . What a mistake . Not only is this thing ridiculously overcomplicated but it is dangerous . Cheap wheels to move it around ( as opposed to the older lighter model that you simply moved ) , slide out shelves- whatever . Coleman took a simple and very useful grill and tuned it into this pimped out mess.But the worst part is mine was dangerous . The tubing did not extent far enough into the burner orifice and the result is leaking propane . Makes for a cute flame coming out the front of the grill and that wonderful 4th of July sound when the extra gas build up . This is a problem identified in earlier reviews . Given that many people are happy with their grill and have no problems this becomes a case study in poor quality control . Gee the same Chinese that gave us lead toys- what a surprise.My suggestion is that you can do far better for the money unless you get lucky and get one that works . But then some people look OK with no eyebrows so you may want to take a chance .	-1
I 've owned this grill for over a year now and had plenty of opportunity to use it , my conclusion : Do n't confuse this with a barbecue grill . Despite the pictures used in the advertising , it does n't work well for hot dogs , hamburgers , or steak - a ten dollar charcoal pan will produce a taster meal , be easier to clean up , easier to store , and cost way less money . This works better if you buy the wire grates and use it like a gas stove.It 's heavy , setup and teardown are not that easy and are best done with two people - it has a tendency to collapse into a noisy heap during setup/teardown or if you try to move it after set up since the legs do n't lock in to place when it 's raised . The lid does n't lock down either - there is a latch but it is so loose it flops back and forth.A sharp looking grill , but my old Colman two burner camp stove and folding camp cook table are more useful , easier to set up , and easier stow .	-1
I can understand how a consumer thinks this product should exist , but it really shouldnt . This grill is cumbersome and barely portable . It has an awkward shape that prevents it from stowing easily in a car , nothing can go on top of it because it is curved . Every time I have cooked with it , my food tastes like propane too . This includes , hotdogs , hamburgers , and chicken . Ive tried to season the taste out but it permeates through the food pretty badly.The shelfs dont hold much at all . Even a regular sized dinner plate can hardly fit . It doesnt have any hooks to hold grill utensils either which if kind of necessary since the shelves dont hold much.I can see why people would think this would be easier than using a regular grill at a tailgate or something , but I would haul a regular grill instead to get better quality and ease of use . If space is an extreme issue for you , then yes this would probably be the best option out there .	-1
Well shame on me for buying a STOVE with plastic parts , I should have known better . The plastic parts are so close to the burner on this stove I ca n't imagine what they were thinking when they decided to go with this design . Other than of course the obvious ( cut costs and make MORE money ! ) .For the first dozen or so times I used this stove it worked great . Always lit very easily never needed any priming and had a nice even hot flame . It would burn for ages with out using much fuel . But the adjustment/on/off valve always pissed me off a bit . Even when it was new it was hard to turn the knob and it never felt sturdy . So tonight when using my stove to make some char cloth the entire thing just melted down . All the plastic bits and most importantly the ON/OFF valve just melted right off leaving NO WAY TO TURN THE STOVE OFF ! The stove was running on the lowest heat setting for about 30 minutes with a small tin on the burner that had a diameter smaller than the actual burner stand itself . It was chilly outside and kinda windy to I had a wind screen around it with about a 2-3 inch air space on all sides . This stove got so hot it melted the plastic height adjuster ring around the bottom of the tank ! Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it did n't exploded on me , which I was terrified that it might once realising I could n't shut it off and that it got so hot it melted all the plastic off itself.Time to contact Coleman to see if they will do anything about it . A quick google search for spare parts did n't return anything promising yet .	-1
I 've had 15 or so Ken Onion knives . This is the first time I 've been disappointed.Cheep plastic and bad ( I 'm just guessing ) parts from China . Does n't open all the way with the spring assist . Does n't hold an edge . Cut packing tape all day , and it needs to be sharpened . Had one of these knives ten years ago . Held an edge , easy open and close with one hand . Over all a good knife . This one left me wondering what happened to Kershaw .	-1
Updated Review , three months later : I had to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars . I now have to agree with the other 2 star reviewer that this knife dulls way too fast and just wo n't hold an edge.I have bought and reviewed several pocket knives here on Amazon and some of them stayed sharp after months of cutting small branches and thick cardboard boxes . The edge on this knife went completely dull after a few weeks of relatively light use . The great opening mechanism and sturdy clip does n't make up for the fact this knife is basically only good as a letter opener.Original Review : This is a nice little knife . Perfect size for carrying unobtrusively . 3-1/2 inches long closed . 2-1/4 inch combo blade , half serrated . I like the Kershaw fingertip OD lever on the top of the handle that snaps the blade open effortlessly . What threw me is that there is a tiny screw head on the bottom tip of the clip side of the handle that is a blade safety lock . It 's right next to the laniard hole . When it is slid toward the clip it unlocks the blade , when slid to the edge of the handle away from the clip it locks it . No where in the instruction pamphlet did I see this mentioned . No other knife I have ever seen has this lock . It 's so small I did n't even see it for what it was . It just looked like another screw to me . I called the Kershaw company but they were closed for the evening . I was about to pound the OD lever with a hammer when I noticed the screw had a little empty space under it , and I slid the screw down . That unlocked the blade . I just got this knife so I ca n't comment on the blade or durability over time , but it looks very well made .	-1
Good : Very sharp out of the box , slender , very light . Bad : Blade seems too heavy for the assist spring to properly open to lock 100 % of time , adjusting the pivot to make opening easier made lock up too loose . Blade heavily favors one side when closed , scrapes against inside of frame opposite the liner lock .	-1
This is my 3rd leek and I really love the knife but I hate the one that amazon sent me . There is something wrong with the speed assist because when I open it , instead of flicking open with little effort it moves towards opening but stops . Almost like it was binding or not lubed . I put a drop of triflow in the joint hoping that it would just be enough to function like all my other kershaw leeks but NO DICE.I have to go through the pain of sending it back and perhaps getting one that works .	-1
First of all ive own three of theses knifes all three times the blade broke . Stainless steel ? I do n't think so do n't go wade fishing and forget its in your pocket or u can watch it rust right before your eyes NO JOKE ! Saltwater will rust it in a matter of mins , and that fast action opening will be history . First blade broke picking out a splinter in my hand the tip snapped like glass . The second one tip broke while a friend was picking out a ingrown toe nail . Third one tip broke on a fishing trip while picking the ice in the cooler was reg ole store bought bags of ice . I used the knife to dig me a hole to put the fish on down deeper in the cooler and after doing so I looked at my funny looking knife before closing it to see its missing the tip ! ! ! So do n't pick ice with it . The teeth on the serration chipped out first day with the third knife I use it to peel back the sheathing on 12g copper wire . So your wondering y would u get three of the same knifes if there so crappy ? The point on this knife is deadly , opens really fast , good looking over all small easy to get in and out of the pocket , first one was a gift the second one I bought to replace the first one I broke and the third one was a gift because they broke it on there nasty toe haha lol . Want be a forth ! ! Third time was the charm . Or the last straw rather . No matter how cool or great the knife is if its cheap and make out of thin harding steel and cant even make it one full year under normal wear then its useless .	-1
A good knife should be sharp , of course . But it should also be designed so that it 's reasonably challenging to cut yourself when closing it . My friend was badly cut by his . You can see that other reviewers here an Amazon were too . Go with Spyderco instead .	-1
My experience with this particular Leek has unfortunately not been as good as I had hoped ( and not as good as with any other Kershaw knife I own ) . I found that the coating that makes this knife so beautiful also interferes with the action of the SpeedSafe assisted opening system . No amount of oiling , cleaning or other tweaking was able to get the SpeedSafe working properly , and the knife sits unused in a drawer.This actually kept me from buying another Leek for quite some time until I recently succumbed to temptation and bought a more standard model , which I 'm happy to report works perfectly and will be getting a 5 star review.So the old Leek can stay in the drawer looking pretty while the new one goes into my EDC rotation .	-1
Have purchased my 1st Kershaw Blur 6 months ago . All works well . Smooth movement both opening and closing . Rated 5 stars ... Extremely please with the knife.However this recent purchase , was very disappointing . Specifically , the `` liner lock '' jams against the blade after opening . This makes the knife almost impossible to close with the thumb . Tolerance is too tight for smooth action . Requires fore finger to manipulate the close . Received yesterday and mailed to Kershaw Warranty dept . today . Estimated 14 to 21 day turn around . Sorry Kershaw , I like your knives but , this unacceptable . Happens I guess ... Update 03/18/13 : Received back from Kershaw Warranty dept . and the Blur still has the very same issue as before . Two weeks out and back and no fix . Not good Kershaw ! Perhaps I should stay with my Benchmade purchases in the future . They have never disappointed me , yet .	-1
After using this knife for severals months my opinion of it has changed . This knife has only been used moderately . No heavy use or unreasonable cutting task at all , cardboard , zip ties , etc . The serrated portion of the blade keeps rolling over and constantly requires touching up . I contacted Kershaw and informed them of the problem . Much to my surprise , I was told that if I sent the knife in , ( at my expense ) that they would re-grind the blade for me to remove the serrations . REALLY ? I said that would be like if your wife had her hair done at a salon and after they messed up her hair they offered to cut it off ! I 've been a fan of Kershaw for years , ( I have 3 others ) but now after this I 'm kind of on the fence . The knife issue did n't bother me as much as the response that I got from customer service . Anyway , I think there are better choices than this particular knife . UPDATE ! Kershaw is currently replacing the blade with a non serrated one . Hopefully this will take care of the problem since I never had any complaints with their plain edge blades before . UPDATE ! Kershaw did end up resolving this matter to my satisfaction by replacing the blade with a non-serrated one .	-1
terrible never had it in hand bad knife found out it was a ripoff not a good product	-1
Bought this knife , I needed to send my EDC Benchmade 940 in to be sharpened after a year of hard use.Really liked the Blur out of the box , sharp blade , nice weight , felt good . Then I tried to use it in at work like I do my Benchamde . Cuts open boxes great , slices up cardboard fine . I tried to cut some plastic banding off a pallet of boxes , it FOLDED OVER ALL THE SERRATED TEETH ! Not sure if it was a bad heat treating on the blade or what , but returned it . Ordered an Emerson CQC7 ! Will never buy another cheap knife again !	-1
This hat is so small that they must have used the rest of the material on a matching pair of gloves and sold it separately . What used to be a large , nowadays seems to be extra small . Are they trying to save material ? This product is so tight and small it would fit an 8 year old . My advice is to go to a store and try on some hats . This was a waste of time and money .	-1
Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in ? The case weighs about 1 oz and is ready to fall apart . The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty -- covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt . The chips themselves are OK , without a reliable way to transport them this poker set is n't worth much . Of course its made in China and you get what you pay for .	-1
My rating/review is not for the product itself , but for the way it is being advertised . I have been in the trades for over 30 years now and keep on hand several different 3M filters and masks - the correct mask and filter for the correct job . In all this time I have never seen or purchased a `` single '' filter in a package . It 's always 2 filters per package , i.e . pack . Note that another seller here on Amazon correctly states `` 3M 2091 P100 Particulate Filter , 1 Pair Per Pack '' .TCP states `` 3M R-2091 Particulate Filter P100 , 4-Pack '' which any person who has bought filters before would therefore deduce that you would receive a total of 8 filters being as a `` pack is two filters '' and TCP is offering a 4 pack in their advertisement.Now had I of read the `` Product Description '' that TCP listed then I would have seen where they state `` consists of 4 each ( 2 pair ) '' .But quite frankly I had no need to read a product description or review . I know what a 2091 is used for as it 's not my first time using or buying them.Quality of service from TCP was fine - I ordered very late Sunday night , TCP used snail mail and I received them today , Thursday . Props to them for that.I 'm simply saying - advertise it correctly : 2 Packs and not 4 or just say 4 filters .	-1
I ordered a left handed X-Large regular ( not cadet ) and it is entirely too small . I know this is a cheap glove and I was not expecting much but the skimpy size makes it unusable.I wo n't order these again .	-1
I bought two of the right handed gloves in January 2011 . The price seemed great . The gloves were the right size for me and are comfortable to wear , but the material is thin . The seams on both of the gloves began unraveling between the fingers starting from the joint and working halfway up to the tips of the fingers . Then the material covering the top of my thumb began to rip . My fingers tend to get very dry and cracked in the Arizona environment and that is why I wear gloves on both hands . However , these gloves are just too poorly constructed to buy again . Cheap glove , cheap quality .	-1
My bad tore apart the very FIRST time we used it to transport my golf clubs . Luckily amazon replaced it , but I will see if the second go round is any better .	-1
Break way too easily . I was usually only getting a single drive per tee on these . Spend more or get plastic tees .	-1
We suffered with fleas terribly this year . We do n't have a tick problem in the yard , but mosquitoes are a nuisance . It rained quite a bit this summer , so I can imagine that may have reduced the efficacy of this product , despite the fact that I spread it during a rare 2-3 day dry spell this summer.I purchased Diotamacious Earth after this seemed to do nothing . DE is cheaper and nontoxic - and I saw dead bugs everywhere inside and out after using DE .	-1
2012 was predicted to be especially bad for ticks and mosquitoes , so I purchased this to be proactive and spare my 4 dogs and little girl from a parasitic attack.While its hard to know exactly how many bugs it killed off , I ended up picking a few ticks off my legs a few weeks after spreading the pellets and my daughter gets eaten alive every time she is out in the backyard ( despite citronella torches as well ) .The benefit did not outweigh the risk and detriment of laying down chemicals on my yard .	-1
The Hype says : '' Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular 's GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service . When used with a Cingular data plan and the phone 's Bluetooth or USB data capability , the phone can be used as a wireless modem for laptops and PDAs . `` I say : CACA ! If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it 's the slowest , laggiest , painfully irritating , useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using ! You could run to Seattle and knock on Amazon 's front door faster than connecting to the site.Update : 6/7/2006I tested the actual bandwidth and I connect at 39.1 kbps , that 's slower than dialup with a 56k ( 53.3 ) modem . When connected to Cingular 's GSM it says connected at 115.2 kbps when I connect via bluetooth and 230 kbps when I use the USB cable . Either way the actual speed is 39-41 kbps and I surely do n't have the patience for that.One last annoying feature ... Cingular `` brands '' their phones so you ca n't download games to your phone or delete certain ringtones etc. , as you can with other providers . There is also an annoying `` HELLOMOTO '' video/commercial that uses 25 % of your available space for videos of your own . There is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space . This truly is about the worst product I have ever purchased .	-1
The slim and attractive appearance is undisputed but the ease of use ( menus ) and reliability needed more attention . They promptly replaced it , both times it did n't work , including a battery that would n't hold a charge after only 10 months of use however the replacement battery wo n't hold a charge near as long as the previous 6 to 8 phones I 've had . I might have understood if it were a cheap phone , but with a hefty price tag ( I 'm embarrassed to say how much I paid for it ) , I expected the best and got much less .	-1
This is a LOUSY phone . I have had it for 3 months now and it has given me so many problems and caused me so much inconvenience that I can not even list all of them here . Here 's a list of some of the problems I have had with it , apart from the fact that it has a bad UI ... .1 . The phone has frozen on me about 6 times so far . I have to remove the battery , wait for 30 seconds and insert it again to reset the phone.2 . Most of the times I make a call I get a lot of static noise and the line goes blank.3 . In the past week or so , the battery has been draining out completely everyday ( Remember the phone is only 3 months old ) 4 . Each time the battery drains out and the phone shuts off , all my ringer settings etc gets reset to the default ringer tone , volume etc.I have already asked Cingular to replace my phone . Unfortunately they r going to send me another Razr , I would have preferred a different model ; less cooler , but one that works . My previous phone , which was a black & white screen basic old phone ( Samsung ) , was far more reliable than this one . Just today I overheard somebody 's conversation about wanting to buy a Razr and I discouraged her from doing so . I am happy about it : - )	-1
I wanted a net that my son could use in the back yard . It was n't the easiest to put together and it did n't hold up . I was surprised that an 11 year old kid could wear it out in less than 6 months of light use . I would n't buy this product again .	-1
Nice concept and my son loved playing with it for a couple days.Only downfall is the stretchy lanyard.Made from cheap fabric elastic that immediately got & # 34 ; sprung & # 34 ; and permanently twisted.If I can get some 1/4 & # 34 ; latex tubing , maybe I can make something of it .	-1
We did a real world distance test with 7 different whistles . & # 34 ; decibel & # 34 ; tests with meters are NOT representative of real world distance tests with wind , birds , hills , etc.. They are misleading.These are the 7 whistles we tested at 1/4 mile distance , over a hill and with general outdoor noise present ( birds , wind , etc . ) , in order of loudness:1 ) Storm ( or the Fox Sonik Blast - see update below ) 2 ) Fox 40 Classic3 ) Acme Tornado 2000 - the & # 34 ; loudest whistle in the world & # 34 ; 4 ) Acme Tornado5 ) Cheap tubular aluminum whistle from GoingGear.com6 ) Fox 40 Sharx - on paper , their loudest whistle in decibels7 ) Cheap $ 1.50 whistle\compass\thermometer from DealExtremeFox 40 Micro can be added to the bottom of this list - see update belowI did my test two different ways and then compared the results . First I had my 90 lb . son blow each whistle 3 times while I listened from 1/4 mile away , over a small hill . We could not see each other , but we used walkie talkies to communicate . Then we traded places and repeated the testing . We both wrote down our scores which were based on how loud we perceived each whistle , and we did not show them to each other until all testing was done . Here were the results : We both rated the Storm to be the loudest , easily.We both rated the Fox 40 CLASSIC to be the second loudest.We both rated the Acme Tornado 2000 to be the third loudest.The remaining 4 whistles were not significantly different from one another and none of these 4 were even close to the top 3 , with the exception of the Acme Tornado which , to my ears , was rated the fourth loudest . Not surprisingly , both the cheap whistles were barely heard , but VERY surprisingly , the Fox 40 Sharx was no louder . In fact , my son actually rated the cheap aluminum whistle to be just a bit louder than the Sharx . I rated them the same.The biggest surprise was the Fox 40 Sharx , which was among the quietest of the bunch . And here is the irony . Up close , the Sharx was , by far , the most ear-piercing , even more than the Storm . Hence the reason you ca n't do close up tests for whistles . The pitch of the whistle is just too misleading up close , and they simply do not carry over a distance the way you would think.Conclusion : If you want a real & # 34 ; life saver & # 34 ; from a distance , choose the Storm . If it 's too big for your taste , choose the Fox 40 Classic . The Acme 2000 would be a runner-up . Throw the rest away or give them to your little children to play with . At 1/4 mile they are barely heard.Update 4-10-12 : I was provoked to purchase , and add the Fox Sonik Blast to this test . Since there was no real need to compare it to all the whistles already tested , we tested it against the top 2 contenders - The Storm & the Fox 40 Classic . We tested using the exact same test . Here is the result : We both rated the Sonik Blast louder than the Fox 40 Classic . I perceived the Storm to be louder ( easier to hear at that distance ) than the Sonik Blast , while my son perceived the Sonik Blast to be louder . So , perhaps we could call it a tie , as far as which one was heard more easily under our test conditions . Although these two whistles may be about equal in loudness , they have very different tones . The Storm is a lower pitched tone while the Sonic Blast is a higher pitch , which made it more difficult for me to distinguish it from the nearby birds that were chirping . This is likely why the Storm sounded louder to me . Either way , based on this update , I would move the Fox 40 Classic into 3rd place.Given the much smaller size of the Sonik Blast , compared to the Storm , this would be the whistle of choice for those preferring a smaller size . I will still keep the Storm attached to each of our kayaks as the whistle of choice , because I prefer the larger size for this purpose . For a backpack or pocket , however , I will be using the Sonik Blast . Having said all this , I would like to emphasize that none of these whistles are much of a & # 8220 ; life-saver & # 8221 ; , for the following reason . Although we were able to hear these whistles at our test distance , it was only because we knew they were being blown and we were trying to hear them . Had I not known somebody was blowing these whistles , including the Storm , it is very doubtful I would have ever been able to distinguish the noise from the sounds of nature itself . In other words , whistles are only helpful at fairly close range , unless there is no other noise whatsoever going on , such as wind and birds . Bottom line : A whistle may save a life , but don & # 8217 ; t count on it.Update 4-5-14 : We just included the Fox 40 Micro in this test , up against the top 3 ( Storm , Fox Sonic Blast , & Fox 40 Classic ) . It was no comparison . The Micro could barely be heard by either of us . I would put it at the bottom of the list , no better than a cheap $ 2 whistle . Although good quality , I wouldn & # 8217 ; t waste my money on this whistle , the way I did .	-1
It 's pretty fast , smooth rotation . The only problem is the handle cuts into the rope . Used it for 5+ hours and the handle is slowly cutting into the cord .	-1
This rope broke within 1 month of me using . The plastic handles started cracking so I returned it to Amazon and got a refund . I 've bought other cheap ropes in the past and they have broken quickly as well . My suggestion would be to look for something that is higher quality	-1
I have this phone and I do not recommend it . My provider is T-Mobile , who I also do not recommend because of their unhelpful and unfair business practices . I had a billing dispute and they turned off my phone without warning ( complained to the Better Business Bureau and T-Mobile has since restored my service ) .I lived in Japan for 3 years , so needless to say I was dreading the idea of having to use a bulky , ugly , and outdated phone when I came back . The US is at least 2-3 years behind many countries in the world , and at least 5 or 6 years in the case of Japan . My phone in Japan ( V602SH by Sharp ) had an SD card , TV out , 2 megapixel camera , a huge , bright and colorful screen , plus a blindingly bright led flashlight ! It was a model from the previous year and only $ 25 , but I got it free because I accumulated enough points . Current models take even smaller mini-SD cards , or XD ! Anyway , enough about that . You ca n't get it here . There is no technical reason for it ( Japanese world band phones can roam internationally ) , except that maybe the DRASTICALLY FANTASTICALLY advanced technology will screw up the status quo here and decimate the crappy US cell phone market.The primary reason that I and a lot of people got the Razr was because of the design . I wanted something small and compact and attractive . On this point , the Razr scores well . The aluminum housing is sleek and durable . Unlike other users , I 've had no problems with the phone breaking . It seems sturdy and solidly constructed . I dropped it once from a height of about 3 feet and no problem . It did refuse to turn on and I thought it broke , but after a few tries , it worked again.Also I found that very cold weather impedes the performance of the battery ( yellow warning meter ) . When the phone warmed up again indoors , I got 2 bars on the meter.My first gripe when I turned it on was the ugly interface and dull colors of the menus and overall ugly visualization . The menus are hard to navigate and I 've had this phone for 4 months without knowing how to increase the volume ! I consider myself a computer and technology expert.The other MAJOR gripe is that you ca n't have multiple phone numbers for the same person ! you have to have a separate entry for each , so I have 4 entries for some people ( a work phone , home phone , cell , etc ) . What gives ? In this day and age Motorola chooses to ignore this basic feature ? ! My previous phones was an old 1 color Nokia . Nokia knows how to design a very good interface . Motorola needs to get off their lazy butts and offer an firmware upgrade or some remedy . The camera is laughably bad . 640x480 . Pictures look muddy and brown.Text messaging is good though , because of the predictive input style . Other than the style and the input system , I do n't have much to say here . The internal memory is shockingly limited . If I recieve more than 30 messages in my INBOX , the phone starts giving me a memory full warning . And you ca n't free up space by deleting some of the ugly wallpapers and motorola animations that are included . They 're locked . Additionally , because all the buttons are on 1 flat surface instead of being individual buttons like other phones , they are a little hard to push and do n't give a good springy feel . ( one reason , besides cost , that I do n't text message at all ) .Forget about the gimmicky mp4 video or mp3 playback feature . You will NEVER use this ( or even figure out how to get it to work ) . The phone has 5 MB total memory.. the average MP3 is 4-5 megs . The phone has no additional storage options . You do the math here.This phone is all looks and no substance . If you just want a pretty phone that is very nearly useless , get this . Otherwise , avoid .	-1
This phone has terrible battery life , a big sacrifice for the thin profile . I 've actually tried two RAZR 's thinking the first was defective because it was unable to get me through the day . The second was the same . What good is a phone that must be tethered to the recharger most of the time ? I traded the RAZR for a pudgy Samsung SCH-a950 . Not as stylish , but so far the battery life has been great ! The RAZR does have a huge display and some nice features . If they could only fix the battery problem !	-1
OK the good : *I got it for free*It 's made mostly of aluminum which is cool*It looks cool*It has a really nice screen on the inside - it 's large and the colors are decentThe bad : *It drops calls almost as much as my old Nokia ( which was inexpensive compared to the going cost of this RAZR ) *I dropped it twice onto pavement and now it resets itself at random . So this is basically my fault , but come on ... we all drop our cell phones . They should be able to withstand a couple of drops , especially if it 's made out of METAL and not PLASTIC*The camera 's resolution is pitiful*The outer screen is unnecessarily tinyBottom line , I expected more from this phone with all the hype from Motorola . But that 's what happens when you give in to the media I suppose . If you get this for free then I guess it 's OK , but I would never pay for this phone .	-1
So far many of the reviews have been from people who have owned the system for personal use.I do not dispute that the system is well suited for that.However for the past year I have seen them appear more frequently in hotel gyms . The benefit to the hotel of course is that it takes up very little space . The problem however is that it just does n't hold up well under heavy use . At every hotel where I have found this in use , all of them were damaged and therefore unusable beyond a certain weight level . The problem seems to be that the locking keys bend . I suspect this is a result of someone incorrectly inserting the key and forcing it through , causing it to warp . Once the damage is done , there is no way to correct it short of taking it to the machine shop and bending it back into shape or buying a new set of keys.So if you are someone who is put in the position of choosing something to put in your hotel 's gym , for your customer 's sake , DO NOT choose this device . Either get traditional free weights ( no moving parts therefore nothing to break ) . Or get something like an Iron Master .	-1
I have the same pair of pants that are the exact same number but are different . These pants are made of that terrible material that collects every little hair/lint/anything on to it and looks terrible . While the other pair that I had before and bought at the store and not through this seller are the exact same number and description but do not collect everything in sight on them . I of course returned them , and will just go to the store to buy the pair I want .	-1
i 'm a 29 '' waist but i noticed that as the waist sizes go down , other dimensions stay the same . so if you 're a skinny guy do n't even consider getting there because you will look like a hood rat in baggy pants , which is in no way presentable in a professional setting and outright uncomfortable which can get in the way of any active operations.on the contrary , the materials and workmanship are superior , so if you 're a waist size 38 and above go ahead and get these .	-1
The concept is solid ... This one is odd . MSR is a great company , but missed the mark on this one . You have to buy the dromadary bag for this ... Just be ready to fork out more cash .	-1
THIS BALL DOES NOT LAST FOR LONG AT ALL ! I HAD IT FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS AND PROBABLY PLAYED WITH IT FOR 3 HOURS AND IT IS ALREADY GRIP LESS ! ! DO NOT BUY ! ! !	-1
I have purchased this ball before , a few years ago . And have tried several different ones throughout the years . This ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball . From day one the panels started coming up at the seams , I tried to ignore it for the most part . Also has a fake feel to the skin itself , channels are not too deep , and the grip itself gets slippery pretty easy . I have played for about 20 years , and have a pretty good feel for the game , primarily run PG and SG on the court so the feel of the ball is important to me as it is for many other players . I did not attempt to return this ball , I put a blade in it to end the misery , and so noone else would have to use such a crap ball.Should note that the previous ball I purchased was great , it lasted a long time and had a good feel . It 's possible this one was a bad batch , but seemed to be doomed either way .	-1
I bought this crossbow in downtown L.A for like 20 bucks on amazon its 30 so I bought it its really bad no instructions but got it together from a good friend that knows about crossbows turns out in about the fifth shot the lever handel to cock the crossbow broke so if you want to waste thirty bucks on a toy go ahead	-1
The flame creates too much of a hot spot & does n't spread evenly across the bottom of the pot or pan resulting in scorching . If you 're just boiling water , it 's okay . The fairly good wind resistance is negated by the flame blowing out at lower settings . The pot supports bent after being heated 12 minutes while supporting two liters of water , roughly 4+ lbs . Granted this is a little heavy for any solo stove & more than one would normally boil for single or even double usage , but no other stove I tested had this same result . MSR makes many good stoves but the `` Pocket Rocket '' is n't one that I would recommend . There are many better canister stoves on the market .	-1
Not sure what all the hype is about these ? I find them to be no better than your normal metal stakes that cost way less . I would not buy these again .	-1
When you look at the picture it shows 4 steel replacement pins for the chain breaker . When you read the description it says that you get 4 . However you will only receive two aluminum , or alloy pins . They are bright silver , not black as the picture shows .	-1
I agree with the other reviewer : the connection tube does not fit the receptacle on the spray-can securely enough for this to work . Whoever designed this should be fired . Nevertheless I give it two stars because the concept is valid , and I still hope if I can get an assistant to hold the spray can , it can work.Addendum : I was able to get an assistant to hold the spray-can with the connection tube and we were able to get the system to work . So with two people the system does work . Even so it 's best on a relatively clean chain . A really dirty chain needs to be soaked in solvent .	-1
I bought this helmet for my husband , who admittedly has a giant noggin . There 's elastic on the back to allow for a snug fit or really just lots of pressure on two points on the back of one 's head . I 've yet to find someone this helmet does n't give a head-ache in less than five minutes . It looks nice and it might protect your head if you fall off your bike , but it will hurt your head up to and beyond the point of contact .	-1
I purchased two . The first one did n't last past the first ride with it . Not sure what happened , but I 'm not optimistic about what will happen with the second one .	-1
My bike was locked right outside my door to a metal railing with this lock . Went out , came back 4 hrs later and bike was gone , all this in broad daylight in the middle of the day . Unlike one of the other reviewers , I dont know how the lock was broken , but if you live in an area where many bikes are stolen , buy a better lock .	-1
first off there is a youtube video showing how easy it is to pick this lock . nonetheless , both keys that i have now do not work . one key got damaged and didnt fit . then i was using the lock with the second key and now for some unexplained reason the key wo n't fit in all the way . this is a poorly made device . after reading the reviews , i just used it as an ancillary lock anyways combined with my kryptonite	-1
i purchased this for a spinning class . after a few classes i ended up keeping my behind on the regular seat . this cover was not comfortable at all .	-1
This is a handy set , and it 's nice to have all the tools I use most often on my bike in one place . The tire patch kit is decent , and I 've definitely had use for it . Unfortunately , some of the most important tools just are n't very useful.The phillips screw head is pretty solid , but the flathead screwdriver narrows too much to be of much use for most screws . Additionally , the wrenches are supposed to lock in place but if you put any pressure on them they escape the lock and fold . That means if you have a tight nut , you really ca n't get it loose . I end up pulling out my ratchet kit every time for serious jobs . Still , this is handy to have on the road , and every once in a while comes in real handy .	-1
Generic Junk ... Ca n't add panniers , does n't hold much weight & tends to shift or turn on the seatpost . Stay away from this & invest in a good bolt on rear rack . Is there a way to give zero stars ?	-1
I could n't get enough resistance with my mountain bike in top gear , I think I 'm going to have to go for a spin bike instead . This trainer is not compatible with my Burley Canto recumbent . It worked fine , Amazon 's shipping box was inadequate and the trainer 's box was slightly damaged , I returned it and got a refund . Five stars for Amazon.com 's return policies .	-1
Not a quality item . I do not recommend this trainer unless you are , as I was , just looking for a cheap stationary trainer to try out the idea of riding a bike inside . If you are sure you want to train indoors , go ahead and buy a decent one that produces less noise and vibration . You could also buy this Bell unit from a local store , try it out , then return it since that would be easier than shipping back to Amazon . If you buy this one , you will just be buying a decent one soon anyhow .	-1
You 'd think that by now I would have learned the age old lesson that you get what you pay for . This bag is priced so cheap because that 's exactly what it is . The zipper on my bag never did work particularly well , and after two months it completely broke . Do yourself a favor and buy a better quality bag even if it means paying twice as much ( or even more ) for it .	-1
I used this bag for 100 miles before the zipper pried open during a ride . Part of the problem was that my bicycle pump ( 6 5/8 '' long ) was putting some pressure on the bag , but it was n't severe pressure , so I do n't think this should have caused the zipper to become un-toothed ( I made up a word , so what ? ) . Finishing a long ride worrying about your stuff falling out unnoticed is no fun , but I did bang the ends of the zipper down to prevent it from happening again . It now seems to function , but it 's not a smooth zippering and I have to test it out -- all the while wondering if it 'll open up again . I would n't recommend this bag . I mean , bike bags have to do two things : stay closed and stay on . This bag does a poor job of staying closed . The velcro straps have worked fine for me , so it has stayed on just fine .	-1
The size is what it is . Some seem to think that there are some magic bags out there that are actually bigger on the inside than other bags the same size . Sorry . Aside from that it is a good price . But , the top velcro straps will not hold on long , especially if you are doing any off road . It came lose 3 times on a 30 mile flat gravel trail . The position of the straps also makes it nearly impossible to get it tight under the seat . In a tightly strapped position , you can not get your fingers in there to secure it . That is why most bags have one strap that goes through rails under the seat and wraps around and under the bag . If your stuck with this bag , you can use a plastic zip tie to secure it better . It wo n't come off and go back on without cutting , but at least it will hold . I would recommend a single strap pack though .	-1
THIS IS A CHEAP BIKE MOUNT , IN EVERY DEFINITION OF THE TERM . INEXPENSIVE ... YES , POORLY MADE ... YES . YES YOU CAN LOCK UP YOUR BIKE WITH A PAD LOCK , BUT SOMEONE CAN SIMPLY UNSCREW THE NUT FROM THE OPPOSITE END AND TAKE YOUR BIKE . OFFERS NO SECURITY , SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND SPEND A LITTLE MORE AN A BETTER MOUNT	-1
The description should say it doesnt really work for all forks . This doesnt fit 15mm forks . But it looks like a good mount for reguler qr releases	-1
This item works just fine . It does what it is supposed to do ; however , it does not actually come with a lock like the title suggests and the picture shows.The item is titled : Delta Bike Hitch Pro 2 Locking Fork Mount with Lock.The picture shows the item , the lock and three keys but the lock and keys do not actually come with the product ... seems like false advertising to me . I ordered two of them and neither one had a lock . Bumming !	-1
First off : this rack eventually broke . It lasted about 11 months . The bottom weld on the drive side failed.Also , it shook out SEVEN of the bolts on the adjustable legs . SEVEN ! ! If laden , this would cause the rack , and by extension my bike , to lean while riding . I tightened it very hard ( almost fearing thread damage ) , and STILL it spat them out . At the very least these two bolts , being load-bearing and very important , ought to have come with a mfgr torque spec . I *HAVE* a torque wrench ! And all the bike 's other parts , even non-critical ones , have torque ratings printed right on them ! Delta needs to lock it up.I replaced this rack withTopeak Explorer Bike Rack with Springand I have n't looked back .	-1
Eh h , it fit alright , tuff to get even . Did n't realize it would n't work with bikes that are disc brake ready , , even though the bike does n't have disc brakes it still has the connector for it . Rack was kinda frustrating to get on and the instructions were not very clear at all . A lot of bending of metal to get it to work . Would n't get another .	-1
LOUD . VERY VERY LOUD ! . But - designed for MTB bars . MTB folks do not need loud horn unless they need to startle wildlife.Road cyclists need this product due to inattentive drivers , but product does not fit road bars . Delta , GET A CLUE ! You are not addressing your best potential market !	-1
Do n't buy this if you are going to be riding in any temperature less than 30 degrees F. It 's useless . The horn sound goes from a stout *PHOOOOOOOOOORNK ! * to a plaintive *wheet ? * It 's a known problem that the company admits they ca n't solve . I 'm returning it .	-1
The ostensible purpose of these is `` security '' , that is , the need to have an allen wrench to unscrew the skewer . Sure enough , the skewer rod itself has an Allen head , and indeed requires an allen wrench ; however , in their infinite wisdom , the Axeldrodz creators cut convenient wrench flats into the *other* side , the nut the skewer rod screws into ; thus anyone with an adjustable wrench or even pliers can open the skewer without bothering with the allen side . The nut should have been totally smooth dome , denying any purchase ; what moved them to cut wrench flats into it is beyond me . The skewer will function ok as a regular skewer , but if you want security , either get something like Zefal , or at least replace the nut with smooth one scavenged from an older skewer - many of them have smooth-domed nuts .	-1
If I had paid for this Safe Vault I would be frustrated ... as it is I 'm looking at it with the viewpoint `` what now ? '' A friend gave it to me used ... I tried a few combinations now the thing has been screaming for 20 minutes ( so much for the included paper stating it would reset in 3 minutes. ) . It took 5 minutes with a key to get the safe to open , then I had to slam it repeatedly to get it to close again . So ... onward to remove the batteries `` for 30 minutes to allow reset. '' . That was a feat in of itself where I learned not to try restting the combination in which the screaming box changed pitch to a `` mad fury '' until I had the battery disconnected.So.. what now ? I do n't see being able to readily get into this box during a stressful home invasion . I 'm more likely to store some less critical items we do n't need often but need to be secured in the `` secure vault '' and get a `` gun vault '' instead .	-1
I liked the drawer , programmable code , and key backup . But as another reviewer noted , mine also stopped working just shortly after the warranty ended . Even the key would n't open it . Luckily I was able to pry it open in about a minute .	-1
The housing of all these cases are all the same sheet metal but the locks are the one that kills me . This lock is flimsy but you might get lucky , I bought 2 of these already . One was awful , the lock will close when it wants to and the other one would open when you tap the door ! ! !	-1
Worst piece of junk of all time . The locking mechanisms were literally hallow , so inserting the key just spun and spun . The whole case felt plastic and worthless . I bought it to fly my firearm with me on a trip , and had to go buy something else .	-1
does not retain my .40cal mags very well , very loose . paddle holster is well made just not the retention part of it .	-1
This is a cheap tire in price and quality . The tire that came with the bike worked for a couple years , with many hours on a trainer . This tire is falling apart after only a few months on a trainer .	-1
I use speed loaders for my 5 shot revolver . This double holder is way too bulky to ever carry on a belt . It might be alright for the range , but that 's all .	-1
I ordered this item and , correct me if I 'm wrong , but it looks to me like it says `` 5 pack '' of arrows . So , what do I get ? A pack of three . I received a pack of 3 arrows.So , there 's that.Also , the arrows look very cheaply made . I have n't tested them yet , but the fletching looks like it is affixed with Elmer 's glue and would fall off in a strong breeze . I 'm not going to lose nights of sleep over this purchase , but I would steer any friend or acquaintance far , far away from purchasing this item from this seller.So , you know , do n't by this , would be my suggestion .	-1
I was a fool and did n't heed the warnings of others who bought these bolts . As everyone else has stated , they are junk . The nocks fell out right out of the package , and I believe they used Elmer 's school glue to glue on the fletchings . They fell right off mid flight . The only redeeming quality is the field points . I can take them off and use them on some decent bolts , which I will be purchasing from somewhere else . Save your money and get better bolts . If you are strapped for cash , save up and get them from somewhere else . DO NOT buy THESE bolts ! !	-1
crap , they fall apart when you shoot them the threads that hold the tips fall out and the fins fall off	-1
i bought a pack of these and a pack of the plastic bolts . The fetching on these breaks off after one shot and can not be re-glued.The plastic arrows are two pieces ( the body and metal tip ) so there is less to break opposed to the 3 piece metal bolts.i bought 2 more packs of the plastic bolts which have lasted me many volleys . occasionally the metal tip comes off and can be glued back on and made mostly permanent.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE METAL BOLTS . they are absolute garbage , get the plastic ones	-1
The arrows break way too easily . I could understand if I shot at a tree or some other very hard and solid target , but this is n't the case . They seem to break regardless of what is being shot .	-1
You can throw these out after the FIRST shot . Every single dart broke in half . Using a custom 4 inch cushioned board out of a 50lb hand crossbow . I feel like I got robbed even paying $ 5 for these . Products like this really tarnish the good reputation of Amazon . 99 % of the products are 5 stars but these are zero . Amazon ! ! Remove this product	-1
Very poorly made and some fell apart even before I opened the package due to the cheap glue that holds them together . Go for the black ABS bolts for your pistol crossbow and avoid these . These fly poorly and can sometimes come apart mid flight and shoot off in random directions , which makes them dangerous as all heck and impossible to find after firing them .	-1
I bought these for my son 's 80 lb pistol crossbow . The plastic arrows that came with the bow break some and I wanted to try a different type . These arrows were shot into a soft type target and every one he shot seemed to break in one way or another . I will not be buying these ever again .	-1
im changing my review due to that the first time i did n't test fire them more them 3 feet away . The bolts break apart in mid air being fired from the crossbow that amazon recommended these bolt for which is a 100 pound pistol grip crossbow . im sure these may work for a 50 pound bow fine but it is worthless for 100 pound bows .	-1
Fletching is brittle . If you hit anything that is n't soft it breaks off . Use once and throw away . Buy plenty if you plan on using the crossbow .	-1
I have used both these aluminum bolts and the plastic bolts with my 80 lb . Cobra crossbow pistol and can tell you that the black plastic rear section of the aluminum bolts WILL break after only a few shots . I now use only the plastic bolts ( they have metal target tips ) sold by Amazon and other sites . The plastic bolts are far more durable . Sometimes the metal tip of the plastic bolts will pull off . These can be glued back on very easily . On the other hand , the aluminum bolts are not repairable . Also , contrary to another review here , the aluminum bolts are about 2-3 grams heavier than the plastic bolts . The plastic bolts are quite accurate and retain their shape even after hard hits . Hope this helps .	-1
The arrows bribe almost every shot and were very dangerous . The crossbow is even sketchier , It misfires alt he time and is highly inaccurate . I would be comfortable being shot at at 50 yds , knowing it will miss .	-1
Although these seem to shoot much betterthan plastic bolts . It seems like every time Ishoot one the tail breaks off as its just gluedon plastic .	-1
I am shooting into a target and each shot I take breaks off the fin . This comes out to 50 cents a shot for ten shots . I recommend the black plastic ones , they will last a little longer .	-1
This is a made in china cheap quality product one shot and there gone for good I mean.if you want to waste your money go ahead ill just look for some made in the U.S.A arrows for my crossbow pistol	-1
1 Star because every single one broke when shooting soft targets . Shipping was about 1 week ... .decent.Half of them were loose ( plastic rear of the bolt ) . These are a one shot deal basically . For the price , I 'm not mad , but just for those who are reading these reviews , if you want some quality bolts/arrows for the Cobra Pistol Crossbow , get the ones with the PVC shaft 's . Search for them here on Amazon , and read the reviews on those . I just ordered 3 orders of those ( 108 bolts total ) for only $ 20 after shipping.Hope this review helps .	-1
Got these to do some serious shooting with after practicing with the cheaper bulk plastic ones . anything you shoot these into is going to break off either the fins or tips from the shaft . I would avoid these and just get another bulk of the plastic ones , they break too , but not nearly as easy as these and they 're waay cheaper	-1
NOT SELLER REVIEW . Sucks ! Where do I start ... BENT , like twisted . does not line up well at all . The ends I had to shave off with a file for hours to get the end caps to fit . Not worth the effort or the cost .	-1
I bought an extra limb just in case anything happened , and wow , this one IS NOTHING like the stock one . The stock one is a very smooth service , is not rough looking at all , and feels FAR stronger . This seems to be made out of an entirely different material , it is n't smooth at all , and instead of saying & # 34 ; Mini Crossbow & # 34 ; it says Mini Orossbow ( and O on both sides ) ( with the M paint pretty much gone ) . Def not trusting this weak junky looking limb on the crossbow . Hopefully there is a way to get actual real COBRA PISTOL limp replacements . Sending this one back .	-1
They are shorter and lighter than should be . I 'd not recommend . I 'd have returned but my kids already used and scratched the fin of one .	-1
This hat has no stretch in it so I did not like it . I returned it for another Tilley model with spandex and that was a major difference for me . The new Tilley hat with a little spandex is very comfortable . And , of course , Amazon made sure I got a full refund from the vendor , after some cajoling and whining . In the end I was taken care of and the new hat it just fine for my head . Thanks to Amazon for monitoring this exchange - it made the difference . I would recommend you buy a Tilley hat - but not this one - get the stretchy one with a little spandex in it for comfort .	-1
You will barely be able to lock your frame alone to a big rack , let alone tire or anything else . Really a waste . Get the bigger lock ... this one is only slightly lighter - still very heavy . GET THE BIGGER ONE !	-1
The lock itself seems fine , but considerably heavier than I anticipated . The biggest problem is the EZ-Lock mounting system , which is atrociously bad . I tried to get it to stay on my bike for upwards of 4 hours with no success . The instructions have grainy , thumbnail sized black and white pictures and terrible , hard to follow writing . They refer to a youtube video guide which appears to have been taken down . If you intend to mount this lock , please get a different one .	-1
This was a terrible lock . For one , I kept having a hard time trying to lock it into position with the bike clamp . Even after spraying some WD-40 on it , I was still having problems . Whenever I do manage to lock it into place , pulling it back out became a whole new problem , and oftentimes , it would slam into the frame of my bike because of how much force was needed to pull it out . Lastly , the clamp itself is extremely cumbersome . Instead of traditional screws , it uses a plastic belt . Once I had it locked in , I could n't undo it to re-adjust . I ended up returning this lock and getting aOnGuard Bulldog MINI TC 5013TC Bicycle U-Lockinstead . The bulldog is a much , much better lock because the clamp uses screws the the latching is actually done from the side , so it wo n't damage your bike .	-1
It was easy to put together ! Great ! Easy to use ! Great & # 8230 ; but the resistance is so poor . I need more of a work out . It makes me want to ship it back . If I did n't have to have the stress of taking it back apart.I think this is really good for a very out of shape person , but if you have been doing any form of working out & # 8230 ; this thing is a joke.And I am not in very good shape . Oh and another thing & # 8230 ; it makes you do like 7 or 8 reps for one calorie . I do n't think that is accurate . If you want something very easy to do while watching TV & # 8230 ; get this & # 8230 ; that 's what I plan to use it for now .	-1
I used this machine for a few months and I followed all the instructions . I even checked out some videos on youtube on the best way to use a rowing machine like this . The machine quickly began to degrade . There were areas of wear and rubbing all over the long bar , as well as metal shavings in the grooved area where the seat slides . I tried cleaning it and spraying it down with WD40 , but that just dripped out and I had to clean my carpet . I 'm under the recommended weight limit , so I do n't think that it should have broken down that quickly.It was a nice workout before it started to break down though .	-1
Simply put I could not keep my feet in the holds and within 15 minutes of use the wheel bearings in the seat were shot i spent more time putting it together then it lasted . Do not buy .	-1
Have not had an opportunity to really work out wit it yet , will try and update later.Assembly had some serious issues . The front support # 26 was too long to align the holes with the captured nuts in the front stabilizer # 28 and required grinding some metal off the front support to allow the holes to align.The two Allen wrench/Phillips head combination tools were too long to allow efficient use due to the placement location of the bolts holes.I would not have been able to assemble it if I did not have a grinder to take off a significant amount of metal .	-1
We used this tent once . Then tried to use it again 1 month later and the poles were ruined . the elastic string in the center that snaps the poles together was frayed and broken after 1 use . The metal sheathing that the poles insert into each other with seems to be a design flaw . We think that they contributed to the fraying of the string . Fortunately the camp ground was close to a walmart and we were able to buy a new tent . very disappointing . I bought this because of all the glowing reviews . I hope this review helps in your decision . You get what you pay for .	-1
I was very disappointed with this tent . It did not meet my expectations in the least . I found two major flaws in the tent . First , the poles of the tent were sticky . Second , the design of the D shaped door makes it difficult to open and close easily . In addition , it is very difficult to put up the tent alone .	-1
Extremely poorly packaged ... . just in a box with NO packing material . The axel broke through on side as a result.No spoke liner included.Was slightly out of true but tolerable .	-1
It seems as though none of the small companies has ANY SORT OF QUALITY ASSURANCE in place , when it comes to shipping items.I was so excite to get the product that I did not think that I had to look over it . I put the old rim in the box of the new rim , and then processed to toss it in the trash.It was only when I started to mount the tire on the bike the next day , did I notice that a lug nut was missing . Upon further inspection , I noticed that one of the spokes was bent ! ! ! ! ! ! And when the rim and fully inflated tire was spun on the bike , the whole wheel wobbled ! ! !	-1
First off , I am ok with the stays having to be screwed on , but my fenders did n't fit on my standard Raleigh Cruiser , the tires rubbed , and my bike is 26 inch . Paid for shipping coming , so if I wanted to send back would cost me about the same as keeping them . Nice garage ornaments though , just not useful for my bike	-1
I bought 4 of these from Yosemite Bicycles . Only 1 was as described . They all had the same part number , but 3 came with a handle bar mount only 1 matched the picture and could be mounted on my frame . I sent them all back and purchasedBlackburn Mountain Bicycle Water Bottle Cageof these instead . I am happy with them.2 stars because the 1 item I received as shown seemed to be of good quality , just hope you get the right one .	-1
This inner tube only lasted 24 hours . I inflated it to 80 pounds . The next day the tube had burst . I do n't recommend this .	-1
the second time I got this , didnt last a month on weekend trips . the valve cust with tnothing and the air pressure ( sigh ) comes out every day .. get a pump carrier if you are buying these .	-1
I seldom use this because of the smell and the plastic taste it imparts to the water . I have aired it out , cleaned it , rinsed it , aired it out again and it still smells .	-1
Because of the dimpled surface inside the bottle , cleaning it thoroughly is a pain . Also over time the seal has warped and water can leak if the bottle is tilted too far . Not a fan of this bottle at all . I always had a good impression of the brand and quality , but this experience ruined it for me . After reading other reviews of leaks , I can see it 's a design and quality issue . I 'd recommend checking out other brands before this one .	-1
I bought this so I could drink cold ice tea at work . When it is warm does not stay cold even 3 hours and after about 9 days of use it leaks in my lunch box . Wanted to take to Italy this fall for hiking , but that seems pointless since it leaks . Returning and will try something else . SO annoying	-1
My personal preference for a water bottle is that it should be fairly easy to squeeze to get the water out . I never knew about this preference until I got my Polar Insulated Water Bottle , which , by comparison with all my other bottles requires an inordinate squeeze effort . Now , I do n't even bother to use the Polar bottle for most rides . Instead , I fill a large regular bottle 3/4 full of water , put it in the freezer on a tilt to freeze* , and before a hot-day ride I top off with water and take off with it and another water bottle to which I add a number of ice cubes consistent with my need for the first part of my ride.Be sure to be aware that the capacity of the Polar bottle is much lower than that for similar external-sized bottles , because of the internal bag , a price one has to pay for the insulating ability . *Water expands when it freezes , causing the bottom of the bottle to bulge unless there is a large surface area for ice to expand into , which is provided by tilting the bottle .	-1
Functionally this thing is ok. No leaks , no smells , will hold up over time.However , I am a bit nitpicky with stuff I use all the time , and this product is very annoying and I have stopped using it.Drawbacks : - Handle is very wide , always contacts legs on bicycle regardless of position- Valve does n't have the best flow/play.- Threading on top is n't the smoothest . Easy to cross thread or not tighten 100 % resulting in leaks.I will stick with my non-insulated , $ 3 16oz water bottles . No frills , but everything works better without any headaches . I do n't really value the insulation .	-1
I bought these insulated bottles to keep some cold water at hand when on my long rides . They work great at insulation , almost too well . It takes a while for them to defreeze . My issue with these bottles is that they leak , every single time . I do n't think I would have notice if it was just water , I would have assumed it was the condensation on the outside of the bottle . Bit , it is n't , it leaks.Instead of just water , I prepare water mixed in with a bit of Gatorade ( nice pinkish color ) . hen I notice pink liquid all over my bike ( where the water was ) , I realized that it was the leaky water bottle . No matter how tight it still leaks . Both of them leak . It even leaks when upright in the freezer . I started noticing liquid residue in the freezer.So , yeah , it insulates , but leaks heavily . Maybe I have defective units .	-1
Compared to a plain old $ 5.00 water bottle from any bike shop , this did not live up to expectations . I have had no problems with leaks as others have had . But , the only thing I put in it is water.Filling up two water bottles the night before about 2/3 full & freezing them - then topping off with cool water in the morning , this Polar Insulated Bottle lasts NO LONGER than an ordinary water bottle available from any bike shop or even discount store . They both started to thaw at the same rate . Insulated ? Not hardly .	-1
This is the second same bottle I bought thinking that the first one was defective . I just do n't think they work . Will not keep water cold for more than an hour on a 70+ degree day . Worthless product for its stated purpose !	-1
these insulated water bottles work well and keep the fluids cold . Notice I said water , DO NOT PUT ANYTHING INSIDE EXCEPT WATER ! The liner stains and absorbs color and flavors easily . To make things worse , the inside has pencil eraser sized dimples which make it near impossible to clean drink mix . At most I got 2-3 months use before I had to toss it because the inside was moldy and gross .	-1
I 'm a biker and have other bottles . But I got this one to just keep by my computer so my ice does n't melt . Liquid flow is a little slow . I 'm not sure why as the spout is a good size . The bottle itself is n't level when sitting on a flat surface . So it wobbles a bit . The top does n't screw down totally tight but also does n't leak.The double-wall insulation on this bottle is a joke . If ice is put inside , it will sweat , just like a non-insulated bottle . So this negates one of the entire reasons I paid $ 8+ for this thing . It 's got cheesy tinfoil-type material between the walls of the bottle which appears to not really do anything .	-1
it doesnt keep liquids cold enoughf for a long ride like 2 or 3 hours . it fits quite well on the bike canister	-1
Camelbak bottles have a much better valve that does n't require you to push the valve shut with your front teeth after every drink . No more fat lips and broken teeth on bumpy roads ! The Camelbak valve also delivers 3-4X as much volume when squeezed . This is critical when climbing steep grades , as tilting your head back for long periods of time will cause you to lose your balance and veer into the road when crawling up Mt Hamilton , or Monitor Pass.Also , with the introduction ofCamelBak Podium Ice Bottle ( 21 -Ounce ) , Polar bottles are only about half as effective as what 's now state-of-the-art . ( There 's a reason these bottles are available , in every color and pattern conceivable , and the Camelbak ones are out of stock ) The claimed difference in capacity is about exactly the amount of liquid you can hold in the cap when turned upside-down . ( a useful `` cup '' when trying to top off the bottle at an anemic drinking fountain ) In cold weather Polar bottles are almost impossible to squeeze , while Camelbak 's are still manageable . Both are fine when squeezing over your kitchen sink , but when your hands are tired and cramping from gripping the brake blocks when climbing , you need an easy bottle . Especially important , because winter is the best time to develop your climbing skills.There are bogus claims floating around that CamelBak 's valves are hard to clean , and grow bacteria . This is utter nonsense . I 've had mine for 3yrs now , and never had an issue . When you get back from a ride , rinse with chlorinated tap water , fill , open the valve , and squirt lots of cold water through the open valve and slightly loose cap to force any foreign material out of the valve and threads . Once a month or so wash in the dishwasher , or put a shot glass of bleach in the bottle , fill with cold water , and perform the above back-flush . 3yrs . Zero issues.The Polar bottles , filled with hot tap water , make great pillows when I have migraine headaches , and between the legs , will take the chill out of the air in winter better than any space heater , and a lot cheaper . For cycling , use the CamelBak bottles .	-1
The inside of this bottle emits very strong plastic smell , which to me indicates a lot of leaching . I wish they made a bottle out of lexan ( or other non-leaching policarb ) , AND insulated , AND the right size for a bicycle bottle cage .	-1
just got this in the mail . shipping speed was appropriate . like another reviewer said , this chain is not the chain pictured . very baby blue . so it doesnt work for the bike i 'm building . also no master link . maybe its just me , but shouldnt a brand new chain come with a master link ? and like another reviewer said , the package was open inside the envelope like it had been replaced . the only reason i gave it two stars instead of one is that i didnt have to wait long . i would NOT do business with this seller again .	-1
The chain arrived in good shape . I have n't had time to install it yet and test it out . The main reason it gets 2 stars is because it looks nothing like the picture . The color is a very light baby blue , and it looks painted on , so I can imagine it wont be blue after 6 months . Disappointed , because the color in the picture would have matched my bike highlights perfectly .	-1
Spent more time fiddling with this than I did looking at the road . Does n't attach well to a helmet ( I guess they sell a mount for it ) , but nonetheless , I found this to be distracting . It 's too small to get a good view of what 's behind/side of you .	-1
These do not work that well . They are difficult to install . They move while riding at higher speeds . I rather use Italian Road Mirrors on the ends of the bike .	-1
I have hard time to make this product to work for me . I attached it to my glasses and played with the adjustments but none worked for me . I ended up using Third Eye Eyeglass Bicycle Mirror . Light and easy to adjust though it can break since it is made of plastic .	-1
The mirror did not work for me . I had to return it because it was way too short to provide a view . I also found it difficult to mount on the glasses and helmet .	-1
I do n't have the range of motion in my neck that I use to so I started looking into rear view mirrors . I put it on my helmet visor rather than glasses because I some time use sunglasses and other times use clear . At first it was very distracting , looking away from the road ahead to find the mirror and they start moving your head to get the right angle to see behind . I 've see some many other bikers using these kind of mirrors that I figured I 'd get use to it . No problem however , on my first ride with them , somewhere between home and the restaurant , it flew off helmet visor and I have no idea where to start looking for it . It looks well designed and lots of adjustment , but I would figure out a better way to secure it .	-1
Just not my cup of tea . It works , but on my helmet , its almost impossible to find a decent mounting spot . I may resort to drilling holes ...	-1
You can see doodly squat in this so called mirror . Do not get this joke of a bike aid item .	-1
I know many people find this product helpful , but I found it distracting and uncomfortable to use . I have been using handlebar mirrors for years now , and I could n't imagine riding without one ; it 's like riding blind . I gave this a try to see if it would enhance my rear vision , but was seriously disappointed . I experimented for days with slightly different positions , but I always found that it obscured my view of the oncoming lane . What good is it to see behind you if the mirror creates a fuzzy blind spot on the road ahead where a car may be turning , oblivious to you ? With a handlebar mirror I can still see the whole road in my peripheral , but the Take-A-Look requires your eyes to focus on a tiny square , which makes anything hiding behind the mirror ( in front of you ) very difficult to see at the same time . On a busy road , a split second adjusting focus can mean life or death.This mirror might be right for you ; it 's just a personal preference . The design for clamping onto the helmet works well and it 's not a bad product . But you have to decide if it 's worth giving up the little square of vision in front of you for a view behind . I would recommend a handlebar mirror over this , but I 'm glad I tried this and I think any mirror is better than no mirror .	-1
Not sure about all the glowing reviews here . For me , this mirror is no good at all . I do not have a bill on my helmet so I do not know about that config , but clamping to my eyewear does not work . I have tried every possible angle and combination , but mostly I am looking at my shoulder and only with strain can i occassionally see something in the road behind me . Quite useless	-1
I am disappointed in this stand . The stand was out of square when I received it , and had to be aligned . There are no assembly instructions , so trial and error is the only way to figure out assembly . The stand is steel , but the piece that holds the guides for truing is plastic , and moves to easily when truing the wheel . I will get some use out of this stand in my home shop , but feel that is was overpriced for what it is .	-1
after i instald this mirror it doese not set out far enoughthe only thing i see is my own armnot realy for the newer bikeswith the grips takeing the end of the handle bars	-1
I 'm basically just getting used to having no mirror . I 've tried a couple of types now and I ca n't see a darn thing out of any of them . I really ca n't even get an idea of what 's behind me because this one in particular , keep moving . I 've tried tightening and even putting rubber between the clamp on this and the metal bar of my bike and that helped , but not enough . I ca n't be adjusting it every 3 minutes and I just ca n't get it to stay still . I mean , it 's a road bike on a paved trail but it just wo n't stay . Really nothing I 've tried will stay still and not droop .	-1
Tube did not last long , blew out from the side even though not over pressurized . I will look for an alternative .	-1
Sunlite tubes are the same tube you can buy at Walmart called the Bell , and other low cost brand of tubes . These tubes work great for the casual rider or kid , but for a serious rider their a joke . The tube has large inconsistent thicknesses vary throughout the tube from paper thin to thick which is why some people have had the tubes blow because the paper thin areas got too stressed and blew . The Presta valve versions uses a much cheaper version of the valve that fails within just a few months of using it . Why any serious road cyclist would want to use these tubes is baffling to me . I gave them 2 stars , actually I would never use them in any of my bikes , but for my kids bikes their fine so I gave them 2 stars for that .	-1
Both tubes have leaks in them ! Gee , thanks SO MUCH ! ! ! Not worth sending them back to be replaced . VERY disappointed ...	-1
it is made with very substandard plastic ... they broke on my first use.Do not waste your money buy something else instead .	-1
I 've changed a lot of flats . These patches just did not stick for long . The glue is too weak . Not recommended .	-1
I bought a set of these years ago at which point they worked fine on the soft , stone age tires that I road on my mountain and road bike . I recently got them out of storage to put on some new WTB Dissent , steel bead tires . Lets just say the tires won . I can literally bend these in half , and rip off all three `` hooks '' while trying to install a single tire . By the time I was done , my tire levers were scrap plastic and my tire was laughing at me . I do n't understand how others are rating these as `` sturdy '' . Maybe if you 're putting on a kmart nobby . Anything with steel bead , or a post 2000 road tire ... .good luck , because you are going to need it when you 're standing in the boonies with a flat and 3 broke tire levers .	-1
My bike did n't come w/ a custom-sized kickstand , and had to take a hacksaw to it to take a few inches off of it , plus put it into a vice to hacksaw parts of the mounting plate so it would fit into bike mounting area .	-1
The product seems very sturdy and works as described . The big negative for me is that it is very very heavy . After installing it , I decided it was too heavy and decided not to use it .	-1
I bought this seat , used it for a few rides and sent it back . Having said that , I 'm now wondering if sending it back was a mistake ! Here 's why ... First , this seat is not comfortable as we might think of comfortable . It 's not soft . It has no springs , but only a fairly thin jel cushion ( approx . 1 in . thick ) . The sit down area of the seat has no special shape or contours that would render the seat especially comfortable . The seat is firm to hard when sitting on it , which is not necessarily a problem in itself . But if your looking for `` soft '' or `` cushy '' this is n't it.After a few short rides to adjust the seat to suit me I decided to give it a real test , which amounted to a 35 mile ride on the back roads of NE Kentucky . After about 6 miles I began to wonder if I should turn around and go back , fearing that if I went too far I might not get back . My back side was already beginning to get a little sore . But I determined to push on . Well , by the end of the ride my bottom was moderately sore , but not terribly sore . I did n't experience chaffing or raw skin , just somewhat sore in the sit down area.The overall ride was not comfortable by any means , nor was it extremely painful either . However , by the end of the ride I did n't feel so sore that I could n't go another mile ( I been that way several times before with other seats ) . I sent the seat back because it was n't `` the seat ultimate '' ; that is , it did n't provide hours of pain free riding as I had hoped.I have since tried a few other `` comfort '' cruiser type seats , which at best were not any better in the long haul . They feel better for short rides ( 5 miles or so ) but after that they seem to cause as much or more pain , maybe from all the padding ! And these seats have caused some chaffing , which takes some time to heal.As for me , I did n't have a problem with balancing or getting used to the different feel of `` the seat '' . I do n't ride no hands anyway , and my bike has a fairly vertical front fork ( suspension MTB ) , which does n't lend itself to hands free riding . The seat positioned far enough back so that it felt about right compared to conventional seats . This seat is also very small and light weight , which is a plus for me ( but might not be good for very large people ) . This is definitely not a `` one size fits all '' design . The seat also seems to be fairly well made.I do think that this seat is grossly over-rated by the manufacturer as being the `` most comfortable seat in the world '' . So far I have n't found any seat to be that great , but I keep hoping that there is a better one out there . I have deducted 1 star because of their advertizing tactics . Their pitch about preventing sexual dysfunction should also be removed from their advertizing . This is a cheap sales ploy with no real medical proof . Besides , if the seat is truly as comfortable as they claim , there would not be a concern about sexual dysfunction.In any regard , if I am unable to find a truly comfortable , 50 mile per day seat , I just might end up going back with this seat again and sticking with it .	-1
The concept is decent , but the execution makes this seat 1 star and useless . The seat rails are absurdly short and positioned under the seat such that there is absolutely NO WAY to get the fore-aft position of this saddle anything close to usable . The most rearward position still puts you inches behind where you should be with your knees FAR FAR too far forward with NO WAY to correct this problem . Unless you are extremely fortunate to have a body conformation that lets you sit very much far forward , this seat is useless . If you find that you have your normal saddle way forward or use a zero offset seat post , then this might work out . I was intending to use this on a trainer indoors , but it is not good for anything . If you were to ride outside , you would find that with no step at all you ca n't control the bike with your legs and will not want this at all for that reason . It seemed like a good idea for a totally different trainer seat , but it failed . 1 star all the way . Do n't bother with it .	-1
I needed a seat without a saddlehorn projection and decided to try this one based on the numerous reviews and the lower cost compared to other seats . What I purchased was an uncomfortable compromise . While I can no longer tolerate a full saddlehorn seat , what I found was that this seat puts too much pressure on the flanks of my rear-end , putting uncomfortable pressure on my siaticas . Despite pumping my legs , and distributing pressure from side to side , my legs began to go numb due to sciatic pressure . And it did not take but 15 minutes for the pressure to become uncomfortable . Needless to say , I cut my ride short and will be looking for a differrent seat.Other reviewers cited the difficulty stearing without the saddle horn between one 's legs . I found this to be true . It is truly amazing how one steers with gentle pressure with the inner thighs on the saddle horn . Without that pressure , steering has to be somewhat relearned ; certainly not a difficult or impossible task , but it definitely adds another challenge to what used to be instinct.I am certain I will find a better seat than this . I will post any superior seat I find.kone	-1
We bought this seat for our stationary bike thinking it would be large and supportive . It turns out that it 's actually smaller and less comfortable than the one that came with the bike to begin with . At least a normal seat gives you some forward and aft support , unlike this seat which is like sitting on a rail .	-1
Bicycles are lightweight conveyances . They need to have light weight components . Sadly , this is the heaviest saddle I have ever hefted .	-1
I had to send back because the S M size is too small even for a woman shoe ... I recommend to buy the bigger size ( L LX ) . Those will be what u need and will give more stars . 'Esta banda no se va en el primer tiempo , oh oh , porque River es passion y sentimiento , oh oh , Millonario no me importa lo q digan , el periodismo , la policia , sos lo mas grande de la Argentina ' ...	-1
I installed the toe clips and went out for a ride on a walking trail , this was by no means a technical MTB track or anything remotely close to that . About half way through my ride , the right toe clip struck a tree root and snapped right off . The base of the clip was still bolted on to the pedal.These are most certainly NOT durable and long lasting , as the description would have you believe .	-1
Seems to work on bicycle chains , however , not on moped chains.I bought a 49cc engine kit from ebay . It came with a chain and sprocket to install on a bicycle.The chain is too thick , and does n't fit the tool.2 stars , because it seems to be made from good plastic.-3 stars because it does n't work ( which is probably my own fault , for not researching the chain 's size ) .If you want to adjust your bicycle chain , do it with this ! Mopeds , scooters and motorcycles , use another tool .	-1
This bike mirror is advertised several ways . I bought it as a 9 '' mirror , but an 11.5 '' mirror arrived . Interestingly , my order says 9 '' , but the description in my order says 11.5 '' . The problems : 11.5 '' is ungainly long and awkward , more suitable for a moped or motor scooter , not a bike . Worse yet , the clamp on the mirror is sturdy , but so shaped to fit a tiny child 's bicycle or a tot 's tricycle with very small diameter handlebars . My bike has standard 22.2 mm ( about 7/8 '' ) diameter handlebars . Yes , you can crush the stiffeners on the clamp and force it to fasten around ordinary bike handlebars , but that makes for a poor installation . My advice is if you have an ordinary bicycle stay away from this mirror . I am returning mine . Sorry I can not give it 0 stars .	-1
I fitted these to my handle bars and they kept coming loose . The metal part meant for anchoring it to the bike is weak . Bent while I was tighten the bolt so that it gets a good grip on the bars . Metal is to soft , and keeps expanding , hence the mirror keeps moving . I have decided to remove them and ride without mirrors . Sadly , I bought 2 pairs for my bike and my wife 's bike .	-1
I purchased two Sunlite bicycle mirrors for our cruiser bike since the Blackburn end bar style would not work due to the cruiser handlebar configuration.While this mirror positioned , correctly allowed me to see everything without my body obstructing , which occurs with straight type handlebars , it is cheaply made . The metal clamp is made of soft metal as I found out when the mirror continually became loose and I repeatedly tightened the clamp . As avid cyclists , we do a lot of riding , we regularly check all components on our bikes as parts do become loose over time when you ride a lot and especially on not so smooth bike paths.Also the mirror end has an adjusting screw that I had to repeatedly tighten as well to keep the mirror in place . I noticed recently , after having this mirror for 1 year now , that the mirror would not stay tight . While I was tightening the nut next to the mirror I noticed the mirror moving off the screw.Upon further examination the mirror arm contains a threaded end for the mirror part to screw on to the arm . The plastic piece on the mirror , which screws onto the arm , apparently became stretched or stripped inside . Thus , tightening the nut on the mirror end actually forces the mirror off the arm . This is not a long life product.I have since looked at other bicycle mirrors that have the mirror attached to the arm differently and appear more secure -- such as the mirrors Electra Bicycles sell .	-1
When I first got this item , it was great and had alot of fun with it . However after about 2 months of use , the switch on the microphone broke . I wasnt able to change from the PA to the siren function and back .	-1
I bought two of these tubes ~ each went flat after or during the very first ride . The tubes are heavy duty but the valve stems not so much . The air was escaping rather quickly from a split at the base of the valve stem itself . Save time , money and aggravation and buy some other tube for your hybrid bike .	-1
Note to tube manufacturers : If you sell a tube specially designed not to leak , charge a few pennies more and use a metal valve stem . The tube may be fine , but I 'll never know because the valve stem is cheap . After two rides , the stem developed a leak next to the wheel hole , even though it was almost straight . I 've never seen a valve stem leak at the wheel that was as straight as this one , and I 've seen a lot of tubes last years with much more angle on the valve stems .	-1
I bought four of these ... two for each bicycle . Well , two of them went flat within days . One split on a seam ( no corresponding hole in tire ) , and the other split at the stem ( same as above ) . My tire sidewalls specify 50 - 75 psi , and we regularly run at 70 psi . We ride mainly on streets , sidewalks , and paved bike trails.They are awkward to change out , as they are so stiff . It would be well worth it , if they were n't falling apart .	-1
This is not a convex mirror and it must be positioned under the handlebars to not be obstructed by the arm . The handlebars must be turned to sweep and get a full rear view which is difficult to do at times . The mirror also , even when tightened considerably , still loosens with road bumps . It is also difficult to adjust because the axis 's of movement are oblique.I consider using this mirror more dangerous than safe . While I have my eyes on the mirror searching for dangers behind I find myself missing what is going on in front.I now orderedCateye BM-300G Road Mirrorand hope it will be a better choice . I wish I had ordered it first but still wonder if the same criticisms of this mirror apply . Look for my review there in a week !	-1
The arm/stem is very short and my son can not use it in the way intended on his bike -- he can not see behind him because his arm is in the way . Great size for the mirror itself but try another one .	-1
Bought this for my bike . I never could get it to work well or get any accurate readings . Returned it and decided to just use an App on my phone that maps my ride and gives a more accurate distance .	-1
The tips break off much too easy , its enough to fight a kevlar bead tire without constantly try'n to stay with in the limits of these weak tools . Nice little package otherwise .	-1
These worked fine for the first tire . Two of them snapped on the second . I have been wrenching on my own bikes for years and have never broken levers before . I am going to find some that do n't break . If I were out on a ride I would have been very disappointed if these broke .	-1
I tried putting it on my mountain bike but it does n't look like it will last too long so I took it off . I would hate to be in the middle of my mountain bike riding and for it to fall out of place or go in to my rim and damaging it .	-1
Bought this for my son 's 20 in mountain bike and it did n't fit . No problem I thought , I 'll use it on my wife 's bike , or my bike . It did n't fit those either . Seems to be made for a specific application , not universal at all .	-1
First of all , it comes with bolts to attach to the bike , but no top plate ! I had to rummage on ebay to find one . If your bike is like most mainstream American bikes , it has no built-in kickstand mount , so you 'll need to find a top plate to get this thing mounted.Second , it has a tendency to bang into my cranks , so I have to keep it tilted at a very special angle.Lastly , one of the rubber feet fell off . The design is clearly poor in this regard -- there 's no way the designers could have expected those tiny rubber caps to stay on for very long.I recommend checking out Velo Orange 's porteur kickstand .	-1
I bought this product for the extra length and I got just that . I got the extra length and it bent on me . Now it 's JUNK ! ! ! ! I would n't recomment this product to anyone . I 'm not going to send it back because I lose on shipping through AMAZON both ways , so It 's scrap . That 's the problem I seem to encounter with Amazon . You get the money back for the article purchased but you lose out on the two way shipping , there and back . I 'm really not sure if I 'd buy any more items through Amazon due to this cost factor.WHAT DO YOU THINK , AMAZON ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
If you like a tube that weighs 3.5 pounds then this is your # 1 choice.For me , I like to keep my bike on the lighter side , so I guess I will bechanging those flats more often - but it will be worth it not to have thisadded weight .	-1
I bought 4 tubes from Niagara Cycle Works and 2 off them were defective.1 had a puncture right out of the box . I aired it up outside of the tire to make sure it held air before I installed it and it would n't hold air.Another one was installed and the second I tried to fill it up , the presta valve broke . Very frustrating experience . Do n't buy these tubes . The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the other 2 tubes worked fine.One good thing though ... . If you buy from Niagra , they are extremely friendly and helpful and replaced the two tubes with another brand . Will definitely buy from them again !	-1
i am just gunna make a long list of this product 's defects : -way too long for 27 wheels-parts of tube looked worn out-didnt even survive their first ( approx ) 10 mile ride.i really wish i had read the reviews before i bought it . waste of money ... ... ... .	-1
I had ZERO problems installing and using these tubes . I think maybe some folks need to go on YouTube and learn how to properly install a tube before attempting to do it . The tubes themselves were flawless and fit perfectly . I just added enough air before installing to give them `` shape '' . Then tucked them in and aired them up SLOWLY.UPDATE : I just purchased and installed another one of these tubes today . I had the same problem as a few other folks ... it was about 8-9 inches TOO LONG . I figured the area that was folded over inside the tire would straighten out after I put some air in it . I put in about 20 pounds and then flexed and bounced the tire in the hopes it would straighten out . I continued to air it to 80 pounds and set it aside to install later today . As I was walking out of the garage I heard a HISSSSS . The tire had deflated itself . I tried airing it up but no luck . Took the tire and tube off and the tube had a tear-hole in it . Hopefully , I can return it for a refund . I 'm gon na try a different tube next time .	-1
The first tube popped with a little pressure . The second one I purchased expanded too much in one area of the tube . I 'm assuming the tubes were defective . Either way I 'll never purchase again . Stick with your LBS	-1
This tube blew out after less than 10 miles . Crap product , do n't buy it . Spend a little more and save the hassle	-1
Overall this was not a good purchase.Cons : WEAK metal . Was getting dents from me trying to pry my bracket.No grip ! I had to wear gloves because of the sharp creases my hands would receive , was n't much help to wear gloves either.No leverage . This is a very short tool if you consider how stuck these brackets can get.Pros : Still thinking if there are any .	-1
I 'll start off with the pros : very good quality that I can see will last me a lifetime , and saves time when working on older bottom brackets.Like the Park Tool double-sided headset wrench , however , this tool is an extreme uni-tasker that I only use because I feel like I need to use it after wasting my money . The pin spanner is only one size , which runs the risk of being useless if the bottom bracket needs a different size - a much better option is buying the Park Tool adjustable pin spanner , which fits every size . As for the other end , I give the same alternative to the headset wrench : a 12 - 15 inch adjustable wrench that has the added leverage to produce much more torque on extremely tight bottom bracket cups.Again , if you work on bottom brackets frequently or simply have money to waste , then buy it . Otherwise get yourself a 12 -15 inch adjustable wrench and save yourself some money .	-1
nice product i could not use it because of the frame style of my bike i did give it to a friend and he loves it i am very fond of the lizard skin line of products everything i have purchased i am very pleased with great quality	-1
It is called the missing link because it is a weak piece of crap and will pop off during the heaviest part of a ride and throw itself into road debris/shoulder never to be seen again . They are sold in 6-packs and are cheap so if you do n't mind spending 10 minutes on the side of the road every good ride then be my guest , personally I prefer a chain that you can use without constant failures . The only reason I even gave this 2 stars is at least you can use the rest of the chain as replacement links .	-1
I would definitely not recommend this unless you like really heavy kickstands ( 3 times the weight of their old ATB design ) and you are a glutton for punishment tracking down screws that fit . All four screws are 3'/4 '' too short for my Trek and are also Philips head , which is nonsense on a modern bike , since nearly everything is hex recess drive now . I am currently looking for a better engineered kick for my bike . Greenfield , get a clue ( hey , of course ALL bike frames are the same ! ) .	-1
I have a Specialized Hardrock and it did not fit my bike . It looks like it has the connections to fit the holes on the back of most expensive mountain bikes , but it does n't . Fits only basic bikes without solid reinforced construction .	-1
I bought this hoping it would be the answer to my sore bottom on long rides . Seat feels soft to the hands but it feels hard on the bottom . Took 16 and 20 mile rides and my bottom was very sore . Also , the springs make a popping/crunching noise when depressed , which is annoying . Nothing I could do about the noise . The seat is heavy , which for me is not a problem if comfortable.I 've tried 2 other similar seats since this one , including the Bell memory foam cruiser seat and the Schwinn Deluxe Cruiser , which also has the spring suspension and gel . Both of these seats are more comfortable to me than this Cloud 9 . The Schwinn Deluxe Cruiser is the best of the 3 for me ; however , none of these seats give me pain free rides for 20 plus miles , so I 'm still searching - about to give up ! Running out of options . Even tried the Ergo `` The Seat '' deluxe gel version . I did a 35 mile ride on it , but not without much pain and discomfort , so sent it back . I do n't like `` trying '' seats and returning them , but I could have a couple hundred dollars in seats , none of which I can use comfortably . I 've ordered the Hobson seat , which at this point I have my doubts that it will be the answer , but who knows ? I am a 58 year old male , 5'8 1/2 '' tall , about 165-170 pounds and a little on the muscular side with some droopy `` old-man '' flab/lose skin around stomach and bottom areas , possibly from when I was overweight when I was younger . I think this squishy flab and skin might be part of the cause for my riding irritation and pain . When I was a young man I road a 10 speed racing bike with a narrow hard plastic seat for long distances ( 80-150 miles/day ) with minimal pain . I guess age has made the difference . I currently ride a mountain bike/hybrid and because of back issues I ride in a more upright position.Any suggestions from similar riders about possible seat options are most welcome !	-1
I returned it because the seat is uncomfortable dont get mislead by the & # 34 ; Comfort & # 34 ; in the title . Spend a little more and get a better seat it does make the most contact with you when you are on your bike besides the handle bar grips .	-1
Save your money for a something better , which would be just about anything . I purchased a pair of these 11 months ago and have less than 500 miles on them . They are now in the trash because the tread has separated from the carcass .	-1
My child really liked this bell , and it worked great right out of the box . However , it broke after only 2 weeks . I do n't recommend this .	-1
So I 've spent plenty of money on my other paintball gear including some nice Lapco & # 34 ; self cleaning & # 34 ; barrels and an Apex tip . The one thing I rarely need is a squeegee . So I picked up 3 of these figuring I 'd have enough to last me a year at the rate I use them.Well , the things are garbage . They have no volume to the swab and barely exert any pressure on the inside of the barrel . I can pass one of these down my barrel 10x and still have residual paint.When I wash the squeegee it never returns to full volume . It stays matted down and less than 2/3 the barrel size . Useless.Additionally the rubber connector between the two swabs ( pivot point ) has torn after only 2 uses.Really just a garbage product for anything more than a 1x use .	-1
I have two bikes and I can only make use of this on one . Here 's why : The space for the handlebars on the mount is too big and the mount doesnt get proper friction to correctly hold the water bottle . One set of handlebars is a mountain bike style , and I ca n't use this mount on that set . Another bike has a set of low riser bars with a piece that connects between the rise for the handlebar stem . I 'm able to mount this on the top and it hangs and the bottom of the bar supports the mount so that it does n't fall , keeping the water bottle upright.The other problem I have with the cage is that unlike my Ibera cage , my water bottle has fallen from this cage twice , causing damage to the lid of the water bottle.I 'm giving it 2 stars , because I think I am in the lucky situation where it generally works for me , but I 'd like to find something better ( better bottle grip , better handle bar grip )	-1
I liked this pump for the first two times I used it . Then it stopped working . I thought maybe the batteries had run down after only two uses ( 10 minutes total ) and opened up the battery compartment and found water- not a lot , but a small amount . No wonder it wo n't work . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM . It was past the refund date and sold by Amazon . I tried to contact Atwood with no response at all from them.I 'm still working at getting a refund for this item- will update if I do- but I still would n't suggest buying a pump that is meant to be submersible but is not water tight ! ''Update- Amazon is making it right by taking the return , but I still can not recommend this pump as it is not watertight.Update # 2- Atwood finally responded to my inquiry and said they would replace it if I sent photos as they do have a one year warranty . I had already packaged it and Amazon had arranged a pickup so I did not get a replacement- but my same concerns hold . I guess you could check for water tightness before putting batteries in , but if you put batteries in and then water leaks , you 've lost 3 D cell batteries , so even trying out a pump before returning it would not be free.If I had one sent to me , no charge , with batteries , I 'd try it again . It was a really useful item while it worked .	-1
Never Never NEVER bring a knife with you on a camping trip or survival situation if it is not a full tang knife I see people on here saying oh yeah its a great knife but it is n't is just a useless toy marketed to amateur survivalists who dont know there ass from fire wood if your in a real survival situation I would immediately break off the metal knife and make a spear and keep the handle in my pocket . Even the survival materials are useless the fishing line is the worst kind you can buy and degrades with time and you only get one hook and god forbid you loose it just pleas for the love of god go get a real knife I know it says survival and its cheap and big but it will let you down and you would have waisted the money you spent if I had to recommend a real survival knife I would tell you to go look at the Smith and wesson Bullseye search and rescue series especially the cksur6 cheap and sturdy	-1
I find the SOG knives to be clumsy , awkward , slow access . Check out Buck , made in USA products . True one hand operation . With fore finger , flip the lock safety back , flip the `` trigger '' , voila , eyes closed , blade is out and ready . SOG , meanwhile , the slide thing has to be moved to the `` red '' ready access , then maybe with one hand after much practice , you may have a blade out . For a reliable switch blade alternative , in my opinion , the Buck is the only choice . And the Buck is razor sharp and seems to retain edge . My SOG knives are good letter openers , edge seems reliable , and are fun to play with . But not a `` carry '' unit if quick access is a consideration .	-1
I should have paid more attention to the reviews so I do n't blame SOG . However , I was shocked at how small this knife is and it 's construction is below average . It would not stand up to any hard or even moderate use . It 's good for opening letters .	-1
I think I might have received a defective knife ... the silver blade lock release on my knife was n't stationary and rattled around . I know this is a good little knife , and a lot of people like theirs , but I think I got a bad apple .	-1
First , I would like to say that I really tried to like this knife as I have been looking at them for a number of years . However , I tend to be extremely picky when it comes to my blades because I us them pretty often and for hard use tasks . This was going to be my everyday carry , or EDC , knife to have with me at all times . Despite the excellent price , there were certain quality issues that made me decide not to go with this knife after getting it into my hands.I want to begin with the positives as there are some . When looking for a knife , you need it to be sharp ; this is a sharp knife from the factory . It 'll shave the hair of your arm with ease and rip through cardboard boxes . The AUS8 stainless still is adequate , but not the best for edge retention or corrosion resistance . Again , it is decent . However , you do not want a $ 200 EDC knife that you ar going to abuse . The AUS8 is affordable and easy to sharpen , exactly want you want in a blade of this type . Also a plus with this knife is its featherweight feel in the hand . It is a mere 1.2 oz , making you forget you even have it and proving easy to carry . If weight is of a concern to you , this knife may be something to consider . This knife also has a knife clip that is reversable for left and right hand carriers . I am a lefty and many knife makers are oblivious to us southpaws , so its nice to know that SOG is one of those companies helping us out . Since it is a spring assisted opening knife , it deploys extremely quick , nive for when it is needed immediately . Lastly , the knife just looks tactical and cool . The blade shape is really nice looking and effective for cutting tasks and the full-flat ground blade is razor sharp.Now for my critiques on this blade . First the locking mechanism used to close the blade is not ambidextrous and seemed awkward for me , as a lefty , to engage this mechanism ; seemed like for righties it is not a problem . Next , the handle , or scales , did not have much traction at all and although lightweight , felt very cheap to the touch . I know this is an inexpensive knife , but I 've held cheaper knives with better scales . Also , this knife is small , so this may be a problem for people with bigger hands or needing to do bigger jobs . My biggest issue with this knife was the LOCKUP ; it was horrible . I have purchased all Spydercos before buying this one , so I be be picky because they lock up like a safe , so be it as it may . The SOG Flash 1 's blade had a considerable amount of up-and-down and side-to-side blade play . Usually , you can fix this issue by simply adjusting the pivot screw , but this was not the case . When I adjusted it to eliminate the blade play , the knife became a stiff manual knife as apposed to a quick assisted opener . It was extremely disappointing to me . It is truly the little things and attention to the itricate details that people must see . This lapse in quality really bothered me and led me to return the item . That being said , not all the Flash 1s are like this but I did not feel like returning and trying a new one . The inconsistant quality control is what led me to ultimately get rid of this knife . However , I plan on trying a sog Twitch 2 in the future . Hopefully , I have more luck with that knife .	-1
my bad I didnt see the knife size its tiny almost a toy if it wasnt razor sharpe .	-1
After installing the tube inside my tire I could not get the tire to hold air . I took the tube out of the tire and found a small pin hole in the brand new tube . The area where it leaked was not caused by the installation process as it was directly in the center of the tube which faced the tread of the tire .	-1
All four of mine have the same slight imperfection on the spoon , but it 's just cosmetic . The fork tines are longer than they need to be which reduces the spoon capacity . The handle is thin and feels a little awkward . It 's not a horrible spork it 's just that there are much nicer ones for less . I also have the Vargo Titanium Spork and it 's lighter , the build quality is better , the handle feel nicer , and the spoon seems to have a little more capacity . The Vargo Ultralite appears to have the same awkward handle , but weighs over a 1/3 less . I 'm not sure how durable it is in comparison since I have n't seen on in person.Vargo Titanium SporkTitanium Ultralite Spork	-1
Turns color like , THE MINUTE YOU USE IT . Why even bother getting me all excited over the color ? Huh ? I would have bought a better spork if I 'd known it would look like all the others as soon as I used it once and just in some harmless jello . Bad .	-1
Sorry , but this is a 'swing and a miss ! ' I really wanted this design to work because it offers several benefits , one of which it eliminates the need to carry a funnel to refuel camp stoves . Unfortunately after just a few months of use the cap has developed a leak and the bottle is for all intents and purposes unusable . I will probably just put a standard SIGG bottle cap on it and use it for backup .	-1
It is okay , it leaks oil though . That cap is useless , dont store it with oil . If you have left over oil just use it up or put it back into the can or something.I mean denatured alcohol = oil .	-1
I purchased this watch to help me train for a race . One of the nice features is that you can have different stop watches going in different directions ( you can have one counting down from 60 minuets and one starting a 0 seconds and going forward ) . I have been able to set the hour , but not the minuets . I have also not been able to reset the timers . For the last couple of months , I have been stuck with an alarm that goes off every few hours . I am able to work around not being able to reset everything , but it is really more of a pain than anything .	-1
I wanted some quality socks and these are , but they feel rough , too rough . I LOVE the Wigwam Cool-Lite Mid socks ( see my review ) , but these are not something I 'd recommend .	-1
I was under the impression these liners would prevent heel blisters . I hiked three miles today and I have major blisters on both heels . I wore the liners and a heavy pair of knee high socks . A little disappointed	-1
I only wore these socks for one day and there was no way I could wear this product a second day in my boots , the socks lost their snug shape and became baggy . I returned this product on the second day of ownership because I really need socks that will hold up & not create blisters while I wear boots long distance walking	-1
Just a thin socks	-1
NOT very sturdy . Friend was just holding it at different angles to look at it and it fell apart right in front of us . Handle slid off the blade and the pommel end came off when he tossed the remaining handle onto the couch ( it was poorly glued on the end ) . But it looks pretty good just sitting on it 's stand . It is not sharp ( did n't expect it to be , just thought i 'd point it out ) .	-1
Display only- NON-FUNCTIONAL- bent it in half with the first swing , bent it back and then broke it in half with the second . Still , attractive as a household d & eacute ; cor item .	-1
It does n't fit all my mags and does n't always fit securely . I do n't feel that it gives me an advantage over single magazine.YMMV	-1
Better off getting a TriMag Triple Magazine holder.. No gluing or fitting issues . Amazon doesnt sell them but google it .	-1
I was expecting a snap on plat for connecting to of my 10 shot mags for a quick flip while shooting . This device will give you the capability but you have to glue the mags to the plate . I will not glue the mags to the plate but if you do n't mind doing that you are in business with this device .	-1
This is not well made . The collars do n't spin smoothly onto the bars - they are too big , so they shake back and forth . Once they are tightened onto the weights , they are stable , but it is metal on metal ( only two rubber washers included ) . There is a bad smell coming from the rubber also . I really do n't think these are worth the money . For about $ 15 more you can get a set of what will probably be similar bars , but with # 30 of weights . Skip these , buy something cheaper or get more for your money in a kit .	-1
The description says 70 % Acrylic 30 % Wool . The one I received is 100 % Polyester : ( That actually makes a difference . It 's going back .	-1
I am a big Marmot fan , but the product description said that this was partially a & # 34 ; wool & # 34 ; hat . But the label on the product itself did NOT have any wool content . It was all synthetic/polyproplyene . Very disappointing that the product description was inaccurate and misleading	-1
Very flimsy , tried to back off the screw and it broke in my hand , if I could give this product & # 34 ; O & # 34 ; stars I would ! Spend more get a better product !	-1
All these do is jam my 22 . I have a brand new S & W ; MP22 , it does amazing with every type of real ammo I feed it , except this fake stuff.If I could return these without a hassle , I 'd do it . I 'll never use these .	-1
I bought this for my mossberg 500 cruiser after I 'd added all kinds of stuff to it , figured `` why not upgrade the front sight also ? '' Well , you get what you pay for..or less , I do n't feel this sight is even worth $ 8 . It 's a nice idea , it comes with several threads to fit several shotguns , but on my Mossberg 500 cruiser it did n't work . The sight itself is poorly machined and the plastic hiviz was not smooth , it almost looked melted to some degree.I tightened the 500 thread to the sight to the best of my ability with a needle nose plier trying not to damage the threads , then I tried to put it on the gun . Once it was tightened as tight as it could go , the sight was crooked , facing 8 o clock rather than 6 o clock . I 'm going to try to get some blue lock-tite and see if I can get it to be perfect but I 'm surprised they did n't send a tiny bit with the sight and make it an even $ 10 to ensure a perfect fit.I bought it and by the time I realized I did n't want it , I 'm outside the limits of the return period . No , I 'm not bashing the product because I ca n't return it . 2/5* , and if some blue lock-tite can fix my problem and the sight holds true I 'll change my review . Thanks for reading , and happy shooting .	-1
It was not secure fit and lost it during the shooting . I will not recommend this . Not sure which product should I use .	-1
i bought this sight for my remington 870 and i had to have a gun smith install it since Remington bead sights are press fitted then i took my shotgun for 5 tests 100 rounds each time . the sight placement makes my shots way to high and i end up putting my cheek way low on the stock in order to get a accurate level shot . if you are wanting this sight for a Remington 870 just consider my mistakes before purchase	-1
if you want a good fiber optic sight go look at Williams gun sights there the best ive found for the cost	-1
You do n't receive 6 pieces as the picture appears you will . You only receive the 3 large pieces . I returned this SCAM product ! DO N'T BUY THIS if you expect 6 .	-1
These scent bombs are a total waste of time and money . They do n't work worth a darn , and they are so cheaply made that they are more likely to fill your bag with deer pee than help you catch anything . I guess that might be OK if you want to hang your bag up and use IT as a scent dispersal system.I recommend tying pieces of twine around cotton balls , and bringing them out with you . They cost about $ 0.01 each ( if that ) and they are biodegradable . Take a bunch , and when you want to hang one , tye it up dry , then after it is secured put a bit of deer pee on it . At the end of the day , simply cut them down and stick 'em in the leaves . By spring they will have completely broken down and added to the fertility of the forest ! Save time and money . Use cotton balls .	-1
I am irritated . Just got back from deer hunting , used these for two days and after day 1 noticed that with the cap closed you can smell the scent through it . No problem , put it in a plastic baggie..well today i had to crawl under a fence line ... .Found out the baggie leaked after one of these did . I had to smell deer piss all the way home tonight ... .reminded me of how I pissed my money away on these things.Seriously ... in this day and age how do you mess up a screw cap bottle tinks ? ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ! ? Spend a penny more on your Chinese factory and do it right ! Will not buy again and will not recommend .	-1
The scent bombs have no scent - need to buy that separately . Would be nice to have known prior to purchase . Otherwise seem to do the job .	-1
The tongs bent on me in the field and i was forced to use the tip of a knife for the remainder of my time out there ! not fun ! I would not recommend this .	-1
It will not work without a file you will need to adjust this to get it to almost work I just bought another from the gun store	-1
I ordered this tool - and it does n't work on the front sight post of my Smith and Wesson M & P-15 . Even had my gunsmith look at it , and he agreed that the tool was not going to work on the S & W . Just my experience . Not the tool or the vendors fault - I should have checked to be sure it was the right tool for my particular rifle .	-1
I have to admit that I bought this stove as an impulse since I liked the way it looked . I did look at the ratings which were n't very good but decided to go ahead and try the stove anyway . I 've been a big fan of Vargo products . I have the Decagon and the Hexagon and love both of them . THEN I decided to try the Triad . Big mistake . First of all the pot rest legs spread way too far apart . What I call `` standard '' cups like the 700ml Snow Peak do n't really fit well on top of this stove . Very precarious and subject to falling over . Also , the stove sometimes does n't bloom at all and other times it takes up to 4 minutes just to bloom - wayyyyy too long since some stoves actually boil 2 cups of water within this time . Stove too is very slow to fill and like the Decagon has to be filled to the top or it wo n't work at all . I really wanted this stove to work . It 's light weight and relatively rugged but the quality control ( if there is such a process with this stove ) is poor . One of the bottom legs was not aligned when it was welded and is therefore permanently bent . I ended up returning the stove !	-1
This stove works ; well almost.I bought my Vargo Triad at another site , and there are several design flaws in this stove ; so I will take them on one after another.1 . This stove will not bloom unless you completely fuel the stove . 1 1/2 OZs of alcohol.Even if you put some alcohol under the stove in a bottle cap depend on the stove taking 1 minute 10 seconds to 1 minute and 30 seconds to bloomWithout the alcohol in the bottle cap to help prime bloom times will be 2 - 2 1/2 minutes.2 . If you do not fill the stove completely full there is a video on You Tube where Hiram Cook put 1 OZ of alcohol in the stove 2/3 full . The stove burned from the central hole for 6 minutes before the stove bloomed.3 . The place to fill the stove is only 1 milleter to 1/16th inch across so filling the stove is a painfully slow process unless you carry a syringe to fill the stove.4 . The stove WILL NOT work wilth small diameter pots . Expect to invest in a pot with a minimum diameter of five Or six inches in diameter.This stove will not work with the beer can pots the ultralight backpackers prefer , or the GSI minimalist , or the Stanley camp pot . I do not think even the GSI Dualist pot would work on this stove.If you want a Titanium stove to make other campers go Ooh look at the Evernew Titanium stove.If you want to buy a stove that works the first time & everytime , primes in seconds instead of minutes , does not need a pot stand , you can increase the amount of fuel to heat water for coffee- boil water for a freeze dried meal- add more fuel to cook a meal , AND will work with small diameter pots invest $ 2 . Buy a paper punch at Wal-Mart or the dollar store and a 3 OZ can of Cat food , can of potted meat or deviled Spam can . Then make a Super Cat stove.Soulsurvivorx2 , Andrew Skurka , and others have have videos on You Tube teaching how to make a Super cat stove.If you are not comfortable making your own stove ; I make stoves and sell them on eBay.I make and sell the Perfected Super Cat stove , and the Miser/Ultimate stove.The Perfected Super Cat is made from a Beer can , and the design has been tweaked to make the design as energy efficient as possible 1 OZ of fuel will burn for 14 - 14 1/2 minutes . Two cups of water will boil in 7 1/2 minutes . It also comes with the Miser 1.1 stove that will bring food to a simmer 170 - 190 degrees Fahrenheit on one tablespoon of fuel . I made this stove to cook canned soup , make coffee , and other things when you need something hot but you do not need it boiling.The Miser/Ultimate is taller than the Miser 1.1 just to hold more fuel . 1 OZ of alcohol in the Miser/Ultimate will boil water in 8 - 8 1/2 minutes , and give you a total burn time of 18 1/2 minutes .	-1
This chain develops tight links while riding . After loosening tight links several times on my single speed , I just gave up and put a 9-speed Shimano chain on . Problem solved . I put less than 500 miles on this chain before throwing it away .	-1
We used to get Grant 's ant baits and they worked great . When I could n't find those in the store any more I found these on amazon and thought they were the same . But they are not . What we had previously was in white plastic , these are grey . But more importantly they do n't work . The ants we have here ignore these baits . We still have a few of the older baits and we can place them next to each other and the ants will take the bait from the older white container and ignore the grey one . If we put out only the new grey bait container the ant problem does not improve.I am disappointed because my expectations were high . I expected a different product .	-1
Have several stakes around the house . Have never seen an ant go anywhere near them . I use the Terro liquid ant baits instead and they go crazy for that ...	-1
The original Grants Kills Ants was the most effective ant product I have ever used . Due to government pressures and regulations , the active ingredient has been changed , and they 've never been the same.If you can find the original Grants with arsenic , get 'em . These new stakes ( sometimes labeled Andro Kills Ants ) are not useful .	-1
The baits failed to attract any ants in my house . The ants would just run right past it and pay no attention to the bait .	-1
It 's a nice concept but does n't work in practice . I have a pair of Keen sandals that have their own lock type laces with only four lace rows and they work very well . They pull fairly easily straight through all rows just pulling on the lock end and they are about half as stretchy as these lock laces.It is a different story with adult running shoes or athletic shoes . My shoes have many lace rows and the laces do n't pull straight and easily through even a couple rows . Now I have to pull the laces tight one row at a time , like regular laces . The problem is that these super stretchy bungee laces want to slide back , so it is very difficult and time consuming to tighten and hold each row tight as you work your way up to the last row . Now I have super long laces that I have to tuck under one of the tightened down rows to keep them from flying around or tripping me . It 's painful , ugly , and unsafe . If I cut the bungees shorter , I ca n't loosen the shoes enough to get them back off , or more importantly , back on my feet the next time.If you do n't tighten your shoe laces and your shoes are a fairly loose fit on your foot anyway , this may not matter . If your child only has a couple rows of laces and they do n't need to be tight , then these laces may be fine , too.I replaced these after a couple uses with regular oval shoe laces . I can now appreciate the simplicity and suitability of ordinary shoe laces . It 's easy to tighten or loosen each row and get a nice tight fit that makes your shoe a part of your foot . Tie them with a bow and another knot for security to keep them a reasonable length .	-1
In the case of the product I received , it was obvious the package labeling has been intentionally tampered with.These items have a 5-year shelf life . The area on the package where the manufacturing date is supposed to be listed had been marked out with a black marker and covered over with a permanent-stick barcode instead . There is no way to determine when these were produced ... or the expiration date.These facts tell me these are out-of-date packages being sold for brand-new price . 1 star on both product and merchant . *I contacted Amazon and was assured this is not how they conduct business ( a sentiment with which I totally agree ; Amazon rocks ) and a refund immediately issued , along with assurance they 'd check into the matter . I have no doubt of it . * Further on the product : Because of the circumstance and weight of item I was not required to return it . Amazon told me to `` do whatever I wished with it '' . So I held on to it for a couple of weeks and just forgot it for the time being . When I returned to examine the item , as others have reported I noticed the vacuum seal had failed . The item appeared to be filled with air and no longer secure . Apparently the mylar covering on this is n't all that strong , which was somewhat surprising . So I opened the package to examine it out of curiosity . Here 's what I found : Being primarily flour , sugar and shortening it was still `` good '' as far as edibility . Rather than `` cookies '' the package contained nine 2x2 '' cubes which resembled and tasted like very dense cornbread . As others report , it 's palatable ( even relatively `` tasty '' ) but I honestly would not wish to try to survive on this for three days or more . It would get old ( as in tiring ) very fast . Agreed it 's supposedly `` emergency '' rations ... but I can assure that after living on this for three days one would not be in `` good '' condition . Aside from the flour , this consisting of large amounts of sugar and hydrogenated fat would cause relatively serious metabolism problems . The sugar would provide some quick energy , but the majority of it would metabolize into fat . The shortening would be largely non-digestible and have very little ( if any ) `` food '' value . The flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat . So very honestly speaking , this would be like living for 3 days on high-fat sugar cookies.In comparison I bought a package of quality trail mix that had a `` use-by '' date of some 2 years ( after all , it 's primarily nuts , roasted soy beans and dehydrated fruit ) . I found I could do very well on a small amount of trail mix ( which is why it 's called trail mix in the first place ; it 's meant to munch while hiking ) . One could actually eat a small handful of trail mix every hour or two and be fairly satisfied nutritionally , even for three days or more . Supplement that with some beef or turkey jerky ( which last ages ) and one would have fairly light-weight and nutritional emergency rations.So having compared these `` emergency rations '' with other options , I find the other options greatly preferable . The supposed `` 5 year shelf life '' on these packets are highly questionable . These are n't `` C rations '' ; they strike me as basically being mass-marketed and questionably-presented junk food ( well , considering the amount of hydrogenated fat ... worse than junk food ) .This is one of those cases of `` let the buyer beware '' . I recommend both reading the nutrition labels ... and then try buying some trail mix and jerky and see how well it does in a test situation . I think one will find the alternatives far more appetizing and satisfying . This product not only failed to impress ... it lost on all counts of examination ( shelf life , vacuum seal , extended-use desirability , reliable longevity and nutrition ) .Let 's be totally honest here : I would n't want to rely on this stuff for nourishment unless I was starving and there were no rats to hunt . ; ) I do n't often give products only one star . This is a DEFINITE one star , both in product quality ( or lack thereof ) and merchant deceptive practice . ( And no ... I 'm not `` competition '' dissing a product ... as my numerous other reviews will prove . Legitimate review and legitimate findings . This is just a plain ol ' bad product . )	-1
Terribly blunt , has lots of burr , black coloration seems to be painted on , wont hold an edge . To sum it all up a knife that wont ever be sharp , why would you buy it ?	-1
I am giving two stars because either they forgot to grind one of the sides , or because this is a left handed only knife and they did not put it in the product discription . I am not left handed so I can not use it ! **Update** I wish I could give zero stars for this , worst possible option for a neck knife , totally and completely useless !	-1
The sheath is way to bulky for this item it looks more compact than it actually is and is very awkward to carry . The return shipping cost via prime is more than what the actual refund would be . So its going to the donate pile at work .	-1
Did n't care for the whistle mold on the back side , it throws off a comfortable mount depending on where you put it .	-1
I literally JUST received this knife and I already know this is a serious piece of crap . Opened the box and the blade was dull , while sharpening it it was rubbing against the PLASTIC corners of my sharpener and the paint rubbed right off . Very light pressure on sharpening . Got the blade somewhat sharp and then tested it by carving some wood , not only did the wood strip the remaining paint but the plastic in the handle broke off and the `` metal '' cracked.The only good part of this is the case , very snug and secure.Overall its a piece of s*** ... dont buy	-1
This watch , like its Timex predecessor , succumbed to water infiltration . I was not snorkeling or scuba diving . The first watch I wore into a shower so it was n't fully immersed . The other was worn into a lake for a quick swim while camping . Neither lasted a year.The band provides great ventilation and a cool look on the wrist . This watch is unfortunately as reliable as the ones they do n't keep locked up in a case . I would not buy another Timex .	-1
I bought this looking for a cheap watch to go running with . Like so many other people I ignored the bad reviews and focused on the good ones . Initially I was very impressed with the watch . It was light , comfortable and had all the features I was looking for . After using it for a couple of months I went to put it on and it was completely dead . I replaced the battery and everything was fine . I then used it almost daily for my summer ocean lifeguard job , and the band came off the watch and I have n't been able to get it back on . I purchased this watch on January 9 , 2007 BTW .	-1
Great watch for running -- I loved the huge display , the large buttons that were mostly easy to push ( the side ones are trouble sometimes but the lap button is always easy ) , everything . Great . Then , just past my 1-year warranty deadline , the strap broke in two places on the same day . The watch is now useless b/c , as others have noted , you ca n't replace the band . It 's a real shame b/c until now I 've never had a single problem w/the watch . I wore it every day for a year , including running many many miles w/it through all kinds of weather . So it 's a great watch , but the unreplaceable band pretty much kills it .	-1
Rothco 's brand name usually means 'Buyer beware : Made In China imitation junk'.This is a good looking , fun toy for kids or a young teenager 's first compass . If you are 8 to about 13 , this looks COOL.Made In China . It 's a cheap plastic copy of a serious Cammenga type military compass that costs $ 45 to $ 85 . But it 's only a copy , and many of the features do n't actually work . It wo n't glow in the dark , the lens does n't magnify , and it may or may not even point North reliably.As a compass , it 's about the same quality as the $ 1 dollar store or flea market dime-sized compasses that slip on a wristband or keychain . It 's better than nothing , but not accurate to within 10 or even 20 degrees . And some do n't work at all.So get this as a cool toy for a kid , but do n't get this thinking you can depend on it to navigate around in the woods or on a boat . It 's just a toy . You would n't take a plastic toy gun out deer hunting , either.And do n't overpay . But for $ 5 , and guaranteed free return shipping if you do n't like it , you could have some fun .	-1
If you want it for a henry .22 do not buy it fit the hamer I put it on with loc-tite blue it fell off at the range in about 100 rounds of .22 lr it is running free with the birds and rabbits at the range	-1
I tried to put this on a Gamo Bone Collector Bull Whisper air rifle , and as I was tightening down the rings , with the provided wrench , the counter bore where the screw sets , fell out . The aluminum top could not handle the tension from the screws with the Allen wrench provided . There is not a lot of torsion generated from the small wrench they provide , and so that allows me to deduce that this is not so well made.I replaced them with Accu Rings , and found them to be perfect and exceptionally made .	-1
Would not fit on a pictanny rail..	-1
These watch is not accurate , it runs very fast and they are all the same , finally SEIKO is going solar like CITIZEN did a long time ago , they are making a lot of solar models , i wish they could make this same model with solar power . Forget about automatics , they are in the past , only crazy collectors buy them .	-1
Terrible . Wo n't hold air after just two uses . You get what you pay for I guess . Avoid this air mattress .	-1
I bought one of these knives at Bass Pro several years ago . While it is a Gerber , it is one of the imports -- not one of the domestic Gerbers that made the reputation . The blade sharpens easily and holds an edge fairly well . but after little use , I stopped using this knife and put it away . The problem is the liner lock . It does not securely lock the blade in place . A bump or twisting motion disengages the lock and that is Not A Good Thing . This happens often with cheaply made liner lock knives and this Gerber is no exception.While my knife seems to be fairly well made except for the locking mechanism , a friend of mine had one that was so sloppily built the blade rattled when in the locked position . When I saw his knife I told him he probably should get something made better . The next time I saw him , I gave him one of my Spyderco knives so he would n't continue to use this poorly made Gerber.If you have one of these , be careful with it .	-1
Unit arrived quickly , packaging was ok.Did not work correctly from the first use.Left side of the shuffler would hardly work and kept stopping.After using it 5 times the bar you press to get the cards to shuffle was hit or miss and the entire unit would not work.Sent back for a refund .	-1
So small ! Also not that great of quality and I do n't see how this is going to be waterproof at all .	-1
This kit is fine for essentials but do n't expect much more . Two of the bobbers did n't work and the eye 's in the jigs either were completely sealed or were n't a complete hole . Just go to your local department store and pick up a set for the same price or less at equal to better quality .	-1
The knife sharpener is not stable when using this pedestal mount , there is a lot of movement when trying to sharpen a knife with the lansky system on the pedestal mount ( which is no good ) . I would not recommend this product . I wanted to return mine , but it costs more for shipping than I would get in a refund so I threw it away .	-1
do n't like the stand better than holding in my hand but rocks around to much couple more bucks could of got the metal stand	-1
Mines out in the garage all busted up and useless , including extra polishing stones . Very poorly thought out and constructed design ... I ended spending more hard earned money on a Gatco system , Way Better ! ! !	-1
I bought this to sharpen a number of knives of varying blade lengths , from my Benchmade pocket knife up to a chefs knife . Sharpening blades longer than about 5 '' is troublesome - you have to reposition the unit in order to get a consistent grind . That would be fine , but the clamp mechanism is terrible at clamping , and tightening it down is a pain on your thumbs . The clamp frequently repositions itself on knives I 'm sharpening screwing up the grind angle . Terrible clamp ! ! I ca n't stress that enough.I do not recommend this unit .	-1
This thing could not sharpen a single knife I owned the way I wanted it to sharpen . The angles it says are correct just did n't do anything . Using the different stones in order and then abandoning all order did not do a thing for my ESEE-5 knife and my nice kitchen knives.It must have been the size ( .25 in thick on ESEE-5 and super thin on everything else ) of the knives or something , it just never worked . I even purchased the stand and mount to no avail.Thank goodness for Amazon 's return policy . I have bought a diamond sharpener for about the same price and it works about 8 million times better . Even my smith 's pocket sharpener puts an edge on my knives.I do n't understand how I failed to do this correctly , it 's supposed to be easy . I can sharpen my knives with water and diamond stones just fine , this is was supposed to be even easier .	-1
The stones work great but , the clamp broke the third time I used it . Smith 's offers a much better product than this one for around the same price point . I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys wasting money .	-1
Many say this works well but never did for me . I ended up getting an Edge Pro , which worked amazing .	-1
After using the Lansky for over 30 years I 'm finally giving up on it and getting an Apex . While the Lansky is good for smaller knives , it gives an inconsistent edge on long knives due to the angle becoming more acute the farther the stone is from the clamp . There 's also the problem of the inferior steel and construction used for the guide rods . The rods are not stiff enough and the angle of the `` L '' is slightly different on each rod . In my opinion this is the weakest link in the chain . IF the knife is short enough and IF the same rod is used with all the stones and IF the clamp is put EXACTLY in the same place every time , then the Lansky will put a great edge on a knife . Otherwise it can be a very time consuming and unsatisfying chore since a slightly different angle will be cut with each stone.I bought my third and last Lansky about five years ago and just pulled it out to sharpen a VG10 Mcusta . I decided that the knife was too nice and too expensive to subject to that abuse.I 'd give the Lansky 3 stars since it can , under the right circumstances , put a good edge on a knife , but I 'm docking it one star because of the poor quality of the guide rods .	-1
Maybe u have to be a knife master to use these stones but unless someone shows u how to work these I would n't buy . The little two $ sharpener from wal mart gets things sharper than these stones	-1
Junk ... Chincy ... Flimsy ... Too delicate ... One by one , piece by piece , stone by stone ; my entire kit and additional polishing stones I purchased to supplement the system cracked and self destructed . Get a Gatco and you 'll be better served ...	-1
Made out if very soft aluminum , not solid at all .	-1
really not needed or better than just holding a knife . the answer to a question not asked . nicely enough made though .	-1
I went head first into the landscape system with every intention of learning it as thoroughly as possible but for me it just never worked . So what I did was I switched to the edge Pro which kicks ass.now I have not that I can literally shave with ... ... later Lansky .	-1
I purchased this with the Lansky Diamond Hone system and was surprised when the post on the mount did NOT fit in the hole on either side of the & # 34 ; precision engineered knife clamp & # 34 ; . Either the post was too big or the mounting hole in the clamp was too small.I do n't have a lathe so I put the post in my big drill and spun it while sanding and filing down the end that is supposed fit in the clamp . I got it so it fits in both sides . It 's a nice tight fit on one side and a little sloppy on the other side so it seems the holes are n't even the same size on the clamp ?	-1
Too much wobble , creates huge problems while trying to maintain a constant angle . You will notice one side of the blade gets a beautiful glint , while the other has like ... A half glint , because of the wobble & very loose tolerances . You are better off just holding the Lansky in your hand . Purchased a DMT sharpener system and just ended up packing up the entire Lansky system .	-1
I wish I could have made this work ... . but I couldnt . I finally had a machine shop weld it on the gas tube . Then it broke off . Oh well .	-1
Had to sand down some rough edges toward the inside of the top of the four bottles for fear of loose metal ending up in the water . Other than that the other seams were done nicely . The strap could be a better design . If you want it removed from the bottle you pretty much have to cut it off .	-1
This product I must say was one the first online product purchase in my life where I was not satisfied . I passed up the Klean Kanteen brand and chose the New Wave instead because of price . When the bottle arrived , there was some kind of crusty material on the inside that appeared to be a manufacturing flaw of corrosion ( yes , stainless steel can `` rust '' ) . I recieved a replacement in the mail and it had the same problem , so I kept the first one , sanded the interior with 320 grit wet/dry paper and steel wool and sent the second back . The manufacturer e-mailed me and said `` contact the seller '' . Never again .	-1
This scope mount is garbage ... had to file an eighth inch off the front to get it to fit in my norinco . At first it seemed Solid , that is until I took it to the range . After about twenty shots it had begun to work itself loose . By the end of the day it was so loose I was worried it was going to fly apart during firing . Stay away from this piece of junk ... get a scope mount that mounts in place of the old iron sights and a long eye relief scope .	-1
Product arrived with rust on it . The product was slightly twisted . In the world of firearms this is an extremely unsafe product . I attempted to correct , can not be corrected . It is obvious this was not checked or fitted before shipment . The product shows it does not need alteration or gunsmith . This is wrong and unsafe . I can only imagine some SKS owning parent & # 34 ; kitchen gunsmithing & # 34 ; this part into place by hammering it in , then allowing who knows to fire it . WARNING ! Do not buy .	-1
This scope mount is not of good quality , metal is very rough . It is also heavy . It requires custom fitting to your rifle so unless you 're an excellent gunsmith I would recommend you find another solution to mount a scope to a SKS rifle ( scout style works for me ) . Not worth the money .	-1
This thing was obviously NOT meant for the Type 56 . After about an hour of cussing and wittling , the dang thing finally fit . It was too wide to slide into the dust cover , and the hole was n't wide enough for the spring . I wo n't know how well it works until I get out to the range , but , being a hard plastic , it ca n't really help recoil that much . It might , however , be effective in keeping the metal-on-metal contact low . Would I recommend it to a friend ? Well , maybe , if it works.UPDATE : Recoil reduction ? Not noticable . Then again , the gun doesnt kick enough to have a problem with recoil . It does seem to help prevent metal on metal contact . All in all , though , it has about the quality of something in a $ .25 coin-crank machine at the grocery store .	-1
Didnt fit under the standard cover for my SKS , could n't install it properly and wound up being thrown into the tool box where it shall remain with the other random useless parts I have acquired over the years .	-1
Friend told me I HAD to have these . Wo n't be listening to him anymore.I spent well over an hour filing and fitting these things into my two SKSs . One of my SKSs would have FTF ( failure to feed ) every 3 round . Never had a problem before or after I removed it . The second SKS Fed fine , but would have a FTE ( failure to eject ) during rapid fire.I guess the SKS has been around since 1944 without these , so I do n't see any purpose for them now .	-1
I had my sks for yrs and this item is n't needed . I wish i read the reviews before buying this.This could cause a problem like FTF . It 's fine with out it . I had my sks for 15yrs with no issues . It 's a gimmick .	-1
The buffer was too large to fit my Chinese SKS so it was useless to me . I gambled a few bucks and lost on this one . Recoil is so light with the SKS that it really is n't needed anyway .	-1
I installed this a few months ago and didnt shoot the rifle till today . It was already zeroed from the last time I was at the range . No two shots would hit the same point and NONE would lit the intended strike point . I was getting 6 '' of difference in two consecutive shots at 25yds through a Bushnell Trophy Dot Sight ! After 2 hours and 70rds of ammo I took the buffer out and WHOALLA ! THE RIFLE PUT THE ROUNDS IN THE SAME HOLE EVERY TIME ! ! ! I dont know what this does , it might mess up the harmonics or something , but it does it BAD . I have a late 80 's Chinese Norinco Sks with stock action and furniture . ****UPDATE****I was able to determine EXACTLY HOW this `` buffer '' was causing he problems with the SKS rifle . Instead of the insert acting as a `` buffer '' , it was acting like a `` superball '' and the bolt was BOUNCING off the `` buffer '' and SLAMMING forward at a speed it was not designed for and vibrating the rifle before the bullet had even left the barrel . Apparently the blunt force of the bolt slamming into the steel at the rear of the receiver was taken into account in the design of the rifle and bolt-travel timing ... ... conclusion is still the same , DO NOT BUY THIS .	-1
absolutely would not buy nor tell any one about this product it messed up my gun so bad I am still trying to get it fixed	-1
Do not buy this . It will not even hold a fake suppressor on more than a dozen shots . It will not hold a real one on at all . Get your barrel threaded . I wish I could give it a zero star .	-1
It 's a metal insert in a plastic handle . I tried to turn my front sight post with it and it immediately broke without moving the sight at all . Save your money , buy the UTG tool listed at http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TUSK0Q/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 . It worked like a charm .	-1
STRIPPED OUT AFTER THE FIRST USE , I WAS NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PRODUCT AND CAN NOT RECOMMEND . HATE TO BE ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD OF ACTION AND THIS HAPPEN . GOOD THING I KNOW HOW TO KENTUCKY WIND MY RIFLE .	-1
This will not turn metal ak sights ! It is a small piece of brass pushed into a plastic holder . It broke when I tried to use it . It may work with plastic after market ak sights ?	-1
This product was sold under the heading sks forward sight adjuster/removal tool . I have yet to come accross an sks that this tool works for . it wont fit through the hole above the sight pin . It may function really well , but i have no idea .	-1
This is an example of a great idea gone wrong . Yes , it 's lightweight.It fits in your pocket . BUT ... it 's made from cheap plastic and metal . It would not fit into the front sight aperture shroud of my Russian SKS without being forced , and the shank was too short to enable the slot to fit over the sight post all the way . Tried to use it with my AK , which is an unshrouded post , and the metal inside the tool chipped off when I tried to turn it.Not very sturdy.If your sight posts are a little stuck , this tool will not enable you to get enough torque to turn it without twisting the tool out of shape . If you have an unshrouded front sight post and loose sights , this may be for you . Your results may ( and probably will ) vary from mine , but if I were you , I would save my money and get the ALL METAL military grade front sight tool with windage adjustment- ( AK/SKS Military Grade Windage & Elevation Sight Tool Md : TOOL0312 . ) It may be heavier , and more cumbersome , but it will be a better decision in the long run .	-1
The only one that is good to use is the solid orange the others are transparent so it 's hard to see down range . But for the price it 's worth a shot	-1
The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because you get five of them . This is not a good alternative to a real high visibility sight ( tritium or even fiber optic ) . They are cheap plastic and they will melt if you fire your rifle for an extended period of time ( which most people with AK 's do ) . Further , they simply do not show up in bad lighting conditions much better than the standard black sights . Save your money and get a real hi-viz or other metal sight with tritium/fiber optic .	-1
I bought these to help see what I was aiming at . I thought it looked like a good idea , but it sure was n't . The front sight ended up melting and I decided that the front sight that came on the rifle was better . When I went to take it out , it twisted up and then finally broke in the rifle , so then I did n't have a front sight at all . Also , I do n't know what the idea was of making the middle of these things hollow , but it sure does help them twist up and bend when you try to turn them . Get a scope or stick to the sight that 's on the rifle . These are as hard to see as what was on there and more pain than they are worth .	-1
THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THIS ITEM 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE IT LASTED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH WAS AMAZING IN THE BEGINNING BUT ONCE I ADDED 10 POUNDS THE TWO SIDES BENT DOWN SO NOW IT LOOKS REALLY FUNNY WHEN I BENCH OR SQUAT LOL . ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO LESS THAN 100 LB WORKOUT . ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BUY THE 300LB OLYMPIC SET SO YOU CAN HAVE ENOUGH WEIGHT TO BENCH AND SQUAT .	-1
This 100-pound weight set is not worth the time for advanced training . The bar is hollowed out and the plates are just two thick . If you want to get any additional weights you wo n't be able to fit much else on . I actually got the set because I was looking for some cheap plates for my adjustable dumbells but I ca n't fit more than one of these plates on it so it is really useless . The set took over a week just to ship , but that may be an anomaly . This is something I will return . If you are not as serious about lifting or are a beginner this will probably be a good deal , but for someone stronger it is worthless . Do n't let the price get the best of you .	-1
It is what it is . A cheap Arrow holster that Im pretty sure I could tear with my bare hands .	-1
I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea , and this product was part of my pack . Thank goodness I brought a few water filtration backups and was able to switch to something else.In the hot and humid jungles of PNG it was important to stay hydrated , so I was going through 3-4 Nalgenes worth of water each day . I gave this filter a shot thinking it would pack well and be heavy duty enough to keep any contaminant at bay . Well , the filter must be heavy duty because it took about 15 minutes of constant pumping to get 1L of water from the river into my bottle . Now imagine doing that over and over , day after day . I checked the unit over and over hoping to clear up some kind of blockage , but I think that the flow rate is just that slow.I ended up switching to a particulate filter ( http : //amzn.com/B002GQZDJE ) and a steripen ( http : //amzn.com/B00BCI3QOQ ) to get the job done in a fraction of the time . You 'll need the filter to keep any particulates from getting in the water , and then the steripen will kill off anything microbial that remains in your h2o . It kept me healthy for a year when I was regularly drinking water from rivers and streams that were far from sanitary.I 'll take Steripen over MSR anyday !	-1
I ca n't say enough about MSR 's Whisperlite camp stove . It is light weight , easy to use , and boils water in a flash . However ! The real turd in the punch bowl is this pump-valve . Bad engineering , poor quality , and lousy durability . This is the third one I have had to replace . A real hassle when you are depending upon it while on the Appalachian Trail , miles from civilization . Someone in product development get the message and fix this problem . No more plastics . Use titanium or stainless steel . And make it so you can disassemble it without a degree in rocket science . KISS ( Keep it simple stupid ) ! And give this thing some guts so it can take a licking and keep on tickin ...	-1
MSR 's stoves are reliable and lightweight . This seems like a good thing until you realize that you are buying into a system which includes a plastic pump . I have had 4 of these now , of differing design . The oldest one lasted the longest , the second and third each lasted less than the last . I am on my final one now , as I have spent more money on pumps than on stoves ! The newest pump is claimed to be reliable , but it 's made of softer plastic than the older ones so I ca n't see how this could be true . What a shame . The third pump I had started leaking white gas while the stove was running , which is exciting ! I am expecting more of the same from this new one . The lawsuits from horrifically burned people must cost less the profits made by selling cheap shit . I can think of no other business case which makes sense.If you need your white gas stove to work , please look at another company 's product lineup . Preferably a company that does n't also sell expensive plastic replacement pumps .	-1
This stove is touted as being a standard in the backpacking world , but it is not reliable or durable *as a system* in the long term . The stove itself , when working , simmers decently and lights up quickly enough . You basically pump up the MSR fuel bottle and open the valve , which lets some gas out into the priming wick below the fuel cup . Light it on fire , let it burn for a bit , and then turn the stove on . This works well enough , but the problems arise when you consider the stove as a *system* along with the fuel pump and bottle . The bottles are fine , but the pumps are all fiddly and the plastic breaks down eventually . I 'm on my third replacement pump in 10 years . My last pump broke while I was afield , which really sucks . The new pumps are `` supposed '' to be more reliable , but I guess we 'll find out in 10 years or so ! I own one of the new pumps and I can tell you that it is a hell of a lot more fiddly than the old pump . If you are into car camping , this is a decent enough stove . It 's OK for overnighters as well , but I would n't want to be several days away from civilization with this s***ty MSR system . I feel sorry for fresh-faced youngsters who , like I , go into REI and get this stove . They have no idea what adventures they are in for ! My other stoves are a Coleman 425 two-burner `` green suitcase '' , a Coleman 442 Feather ( which I 've had for over 20 years of reliable service ) and a Svea 123R . None of these stoves have had the sorts of ongoing maintenance and system problems that I have dealt with in the Dragonfly.My advice is to stay away from MSR stoves and buy something reliable with all metal construction . You might save a few ounces in theory with the MSR , but do n't forget that to equal the reliability of the Svea or the Coleman 442 you need to pack an extra pump , toolkit , and a spare stove with your Dragonfly . I wish I could give this stove a better review , but after a decade I am selling it because I have no need for an unreliable camping stove .	-1
The photograph shows a complete unit , including a fuel bottle . I assumed this was what I was purchasing since the textual description makes no mention of `` fuel bottle not included . ''	-1
This came with my stove.It 's a pretty flimsy piece of foil , and I immediately went to my tool shed and just cut out my own from some material I had lying around . My suggestion to anyone considering this is to just go to a hardware store , take a look at what material is available and do it yourself .	-1
I have wide feet . The Velcro straps will not go around the ball of my feet when I have shoes on . The rubber straps will not stay on my Achilles tendon when I have my shoes off . What are you going to do about this ? ? ? Also , instructional DVD has no video .	-1
I have gotten this item to work as advertised only a handful of times . The rest of the time has been spent attempting to make it work as it is advertised to . I 've tried their silly suggested methods for starting it by flicking with your hand . Goodluck . The string method , a small red string wrapped around the inner ball mechanism and pulled quickly to generate rotation , works on occasion , but is nowhere near reliable and will result in you fiddling with the thing trying to make it work moreso than benefiting from it . If this is intended to relieve carpal tunnel symptoms when used properly , it would only exacerbate said problems while trying to make this thing work as it should . The few times I was able to operate this device as intended , the resistance offered was minimal and was better suited to very light therapy than any kind of muscle-work or toning . The idea is great , a gyro offering resistance . Well , this one does n't work .	-1
I agree with a review that described initial satisfaction with this product , followed by dissatisfaction shortly thereafter . I 've owned one , and that was enough until the quality improves . The first problem I had was that the gyro gradually became harder to start . The second problem was the annoying `` clacking '' noise the Powerball developed after a couple months of use . And cleaning the Powerball was no easy task . Additionally , I did take good care of my Powerball ; it 's just that the design is not as durable as it should be .	-1
The 950 came as OE on my recumbent . I have about 900 miles on it . It has often skipped in the middle two cogs , even after adjustments on the barrel adj . Today when I took it off to place it on an new upgraded rear wheel , all the 9 cogs fell apart ... and there was a small thin bolt/pin laying by them . `` What the hell is this ? '' Well it goes thru the first 5 or so large cogs , and then screws into the 3rd smallest cog . However there is no way for the average cyclist to do this . It apparently requires a special tool . Looking @ the old wheel I could see where the loose bolt/pin had buggered up three of my spokes near the hub ! So I guess it is good I 'd decided to upgrade the wheel , as the old wheel with damaged spokes could have been a real probem on the road due to this cheaply made cassette .	-1
Shifted fine for the first month of road riding . Then the chain began skipping over or jumping off the 4th and 8th gear . After replacing it with a Shimano Tiagra cassette I examined the SRAM closely . I found some of the coggs on the SRAM had bent . I 'm 6'5 '' and 240LBS , a klidesdale ! Still the cassette should have used a stronger alloy for durability .	-1
i gave it two stars as the qaulity isnt the best . and the belt wont fit around me anyway . i dont recommend this product .	-1
I got my belt today , the order was placed in to two shipments and sent out late ... thanks for doing that again amazon . Like the other reviews say this belt is not milspec , the rigidity is not there . I was ok with that . What I ca n't understand is what idiot sent me a tan belt . The bag says OD Green and the room was a little dark so I stepped outside to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me . Nope , this thing is tan . I compared it to my sons surplus web belt and my LC-2 suspenders and it is n't even close . I recommend buying a surplus belt , that is what I will be doing . If anything do n't order from bigflysports .	-1
The color is much lighter in color , looks almost tan in certain lights . The webbing is much much thinner too , but stangely enough , still has the old belt thickness retainers on it . Those little metal rectangular keeps that slide up and down the belt are loose and clank around , no matter how close you push those things up to the clasp , and need replaced . The front plastic belt clip is thinner and `` seems '' weaker , and its quite the pain to unclasp , you cant just use your thumb like on the old one , this one is secured TOO WELL and almost `` child proof '' , imo . I 'm just going to use this thing around the property for a second belt is all , since it doesnt meet the old specs . Have some of rothco pants , and loved them , thought they would have the same attention to detail in all their stuff , i was wrong . It may be that I got a `` bad '' belt , or noone has used the real belts before in the reviews ive read , but having been in the army for a few years , I got use to the quality of the old belts and this one doesnt come close .	-1
Nice bag with lots of pockets and storage . Half way through the first use , I noticed the front clip would not stay attached ( the one that holds the large inner pocket flap down ) . Not real useful if items can fall out as you are putting the bag on or taking it off . Bag was not overloaded . It held : shorts , two t-shirts , sweat pants , change of underwear and lotion.Too bad , it held promise as a day to day or gym bag .	-1
I was looking for a good , durable bag to use as a range bag . I 've tried several high count nylon bags and either they did n't fit everything i go to the range with ( yeah , i 'm one of those guys that bring the kitchen sink to the range , but if something goes wrong when test firing a new gun , i have the tools to fix it on site and not waste a range day ) or they fell apart after mild use . I decided to try a canvas bag ( back to basics ) . The pack certainly held everything I wanted to bring to the range but after the first day out to the range I was packing up to leave , picked up the bag by the shoulder strap , and the top of the shoulder strap started to come apart from the bag . The strap could use some extra support straps like you see on maxpedition bags . I 'm probably going to bring the bag into a seamstress and have a few supports added as well as have the strap reattached ( estimated $ 15 ) .	-1
All previous reviews stating the straps are too short are 100 % correct . I 'm 6 ' 200 lbs . and let all the way out I could n't even put the pack on . My wife is 5'8 '' and while she could get it on she could not comfortably wear it . It did however fit our 2 yr. old daughter well . She wears size 4T . Do not buy this pack as most likely it will not meet your needs .	-1
I gave this arm guard to my son on a Friday night . We shot for a while then quit . The next day he shot most of the morning . Then some of his friends came over and they shot . By late afternoon all the stiching had come loose from the elastic straps so the guard could not be worn . Rather than return it we stitched it back together . The design it good because it can fit tiny arms like my son if the straps are crisscrossed or large arms with the straps straight around . The materials are good quality . The construction is the weak point . Lots of the stiching did not line up so you had stiching that did not actually attach anything . That is a big mistake .	-1
Very flimsy . Could n't protect your forearm from a strong rubber band in my opinion . I opened it up , laughed at it , and immediately sent it back	-1
I like most of the gear I buy from bear archery , especially a quiver I just bought , but this thing is terrible . It 's just two tiny pieces of cheap velcro holding it onto your arm , when straps or clips would be more appropriate . It also does n't stretch much , and fits horribly on someone with big forearms .	-1
I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised ? Does the value justify the cost ? Does it improve my life ? I put my recommendation at the top , then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONI can recommend the product since it 's functional , though I 'm disappointed in the build quality . I own the bowflew adjustable dumbbells , which are a PERFECT product , but the quality and functionality of this bench seem subpar for the brand.FUNCTIONALITYThe major drawbacks are that it 's a little rickety , and it does n't collapse down . You 'd think that would be a trade-off - more solid/less compact v more flimsy/more collapsible , but that is not the case.VALUEYou have to measure the value of this product against what you 'd be paying to do all the same lifts in a gym . In that light , the value is great . A set of adjustable dumbbells coupled with this bench , and you can kiss weight rooms goodbye . You can work out while watching netflix.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE ? This product helped me ditch my gym membership . I have some gripes about it 's size and lack of collapsibility , but overall I 'm glad I have it .	-1
I bought two sets of these : one for my G34 and one for my G35 . Much brighter in the dark than standard night sights , and reasonable bright in the daylight . I prefer a red fiber in the front on my guns , but obvously the tritium would n't glow well through that , with green and red being on the opposite ends of the color spectrum.The issue I 've had is that the fiber is n't durable at all on these , and it 's not a general issue with fiber sights . It 's these specifically . I have 15,000 rounds through my 1911 with a fiber optic front sight . My G34 Truglo , however , lasted about 2500 rounds before it broke . Thankfully , I had the G35 there and swapped that sight on , because I was in the middle of a day long school . But that sight only lasted 1500 rounds before it broke as well.These would probably be fine for a carry gun that you do n't really shoot that much . But they will not last if you actually run a lot of ammo through your gun .	-1
it looks realistic but i cant zero it in , i do n't even see the dot , it did n't come with the hex key to tighten it with so i just use it as a decoration on my gun . i do n't recommend it , the looks will trick you	-1
this scope kinda sucks . the red X is clearly visible during the day but when it gets dark out it is to bright and you cant see anything . i suggest you save like $ 3 more and buy something make with some meatal . oh and the mounting system wables .	-1
I originally purchased this as a cheap optic to throw on my secondary airsoft gun just for looks . The price is great because I was n't worried about it getting shot out , or cracked . However the quality is SO CHEAP that it literally fell apart . It never saw any action and was never used in a game . I ca n't even begin to describe how cheaply made this was . It 's almost funny how terrible this product is.I would most definitely not recommend , even as a secondary optic on a gun you do n't really care about or use .	-1
Worked for about a week . Now it does n't clip tight enough to ensure that I do n't lose my pedometer . Luckily , I have another strap that has a different clipping mechanism , but I do n't like how it attaches to the pedometer as well . Wish I could find one with a different clipping mechanism on Amazon .	-1
I ordered a fit bit zip and when it came I found out that this was added to my orderI do n't know why but I found out it was some kind of a package deal . Anyway it 's useless with the fit it zip . It 's short , only about 10 inches so it does not go around your neck or anywhere . One question was would it go around her waist . Who ever answered said it would but it will not . I threw it out . Not even worth sending back . Kind of a scam .	-1
Of crub ! Cheap and useless . I definately would not recommend this to anyonel Broke after first use . Not worth it .	-1
does not work that great . the belt slides and moves around . but it did keep water out of my pouch	-1
I was really hoping my Galaxy 5 would fit . No way . I could not get it squeezed in there so the internal measurements are definitely smaller . I wish Dry Pak would make this a little larger because the waist strap is awesome . I returned it and bought a bigger kind but it goes around the neck . I would only recommend this if you have a small phone or using it for keys/cards/cash only .	-1
it will let water in if you put it in your pocket and go underwater . a ziplock is better .	-1
I brought this dry pak to go snorkeling and after the first use the handel on it broke , I will not buy this product again .	-1
I wanted a waterproof bag to put my Fitbit Zip ( electronic pedometer ) in and get some pool time credit . Good news - the Zip is surprisingly waterproof , even in a salt pool and my husband 's has survived 4 washing machine trips . Bad news - Dry Pak leaked both times . The first time I think I rubbed a hole in it by wearing it around my ankle and walking . I was careful to remove the cardboard insert , thanks to other reviews , and the Paks were dry inside at first . The second one came apart at the seam after only a few uses at no more than 4 ft underwater . The Zip does n't give me many step credits in the pool but I 'll take what I can get . I 'll be trying another well rated waterproof bag and not push my luck with the Zip in salt water . Also this Pak has recently increased in price by 50 % , giving me even more reason to not waste my money by giving it a third chance .	-1
this thing keeps contents bone dry , that is if you dont rip it trying to open the package , and as of the `` contents '' i mentioned , you would be lucky to fit a credit card and a small set of keys , this thing is TINY i cant even fit my blackberry in there .	-1
It works for a small dry pouch for money , ID and credit cards . It 's not big enough to fit a wallet or a cell phone in , which bums me out as that was one of the reasons I got it.The top yellow plastic thing is also really thick and has 2 rotating `` screws '' that tighten the seal shut . The thickness of this part is also kind of annoying . Finally , I had a real hard time getting the cardboard that came inside the pouch out , since it was stuck to the rubber/plastic of the actual pouch , and I had to finess it quite a bit to get it out without damaging the pouch.I probably would not buy this if I had seen it in a store .	-1
This `` wallet '' seems functional enough , have yet to go to beach though.I was very dissapointed in it 's size , although what you see in the picture , a few credit cards drivers license , and money will fit , that 's all ! ( you better have 50 's for money , a wad wo n't fit ! I did n't expect much , but caution , you can carry VERY LITTLE in this packet.Inexpensive enough so I wo n't return it , Amazon 's return policy is very fair , but not worth keeping or returning.There must be something better Amazon has , so browse carefully and LOOK AT THE PICTURE ! I would not recommend this product .	-1
they work wellBUT ! ! ! ... If you bench press alone in your garage or basement , you know the deal dont use them so you can slide the weights off your chest if you get stuck ! !	-1
and when they fit they were loose . i would stay away from these . did not like these at all . look at the ones from Cap . Much better fitting in my opinion	-1
These are not the best collars as they are not strong enough . I would not recommend these for holding much weight	-1
Bought some spring collars from Dick 's for my curl bar . They fit . Thought , & # 34 ; Valeo makes nice stuff , I 'll buy these for my dumbbell handles too & # 34 ; . Well , they do n't grip tight enough for my curl bar or dumbbell handles . My handles have the screw on collars , so that may make a difference if yours do n't , but I would instead suggest getting them from Dicks 's Sporting Goods as I know them to work .	-1
Figured I would get a little something liek this to maybe help with some specialized sweating so to speak . Keep some heat in to help shed a little extra water around the lower belly . this thing lasted all of ten minutes and the zipper popped off . On an up note its cheap enough I didnt waste money shipping it back I just bought aEverlast for Her All-in-One Body Slimmerand replaced it with . I use the hell out of it , but thsi thing got cut up to use as padded spacers . Dont waste your money on something you dont even get to use one time without it falling apart . You will be VERY dissappointed .	-1
these spring collars are a mixed bag - I bought several pair , to use on my two plate trees to secure the weights when I 'm not in my gym . Several of them are so tight , they 're almost impossible to get on the post . Ridiculously tight .	-1
Cord snapped only after the second time using it . It did n't snag on anything to my knowledge , just from slapping against the concrete . It was a bit chilly out ( maybe 35-40 degrees ) , but that should n't be enough to make it brittle . Oh well , you get what you pay for .	-1
Update : The key tumbler mechanism seized at work . I fiddled with it for 45 minutes in the freezing cold this February to no avail . I ended up having to buy an angle grinder to cut my bike free . Dropping rating to one star . 4 months of life out of a lock is pathetic.Original review : November 24This bike is a low budget lock , and you get what you pay for . I live in a low theft area , so the security is n't much of a concern , but I think I could defeat this lock with my limited knowledge and stuff I have in my garage . The worst though , is the key/tumbler mechanism . I was late to work last week because I had to fidget with the key to open the lock , then mess around with it to lock it around my bike . Hard to lock , easy to defeat.I like the mount , personally . I mounted the lock on my fork . It takes care of the previous fit complaints by those with small/compact frames , plus I hate the look of things on my frame . The downside is that the lock mechanism rattles around so much that I always put it in my pack instead of on my bike .	-1
Yes , the bracket is an engineering fail . Yes , it can sometimes be a pain in the ass to open and close this lock with the key . Hopefully it is still a strong lock and the Kryptonite brand will deter some thieves , but if you have a choice , do not by this lock . This one is at the bottom of the Kryptonite barrel .	-1
These clamps are tiny -- not oversize at all . I tried putting them on my seat stays which are maybe 1/2 & # 34 ; in diameter and they were way too small . I ended up going to home depot , getting some clamps there and dipping them in & # 34 ; vinyl coating & # 34 ; to make similar , but much larger size clamps which I could use on the seat stays .	-1
After patching a tube , I always put some air in it and let it hang over night to make sure it still is holding overnight where I fixed it and to make sure there are no other holes before I put the tube back in & # 34 ; rotation & # 34 ; for use . With these patches , they bubble up over the hole as they are a bit softer and more flexible that other patches I 've used . Specifically , when I have a pin hole in a tire and use this patch , it blisters up over the pin hole about 1/4 & # 34 ; in diameter and 3/16 & # 34 ; tall , about like a half of a green garden pea . It looks like a fluid filled blister you get over a burn on your skin.I do n't put a lot of air in the tire , just over the size it would be in a 700x23 tire . Basically just enough to hold it 's shape.These patches always bubble up if I leave them hung up inflated very long . I just let them hang for 30 minutes or so now . Just long enough to make sure there are no other holes . Even then they still bubble up though , like 1/16 & # 34 ; x 1/16 & # 34 ; in size . You can see where the pinhole is under the patch . I 've never had any other patch do that.Does n't seem to be a problem in use , but I did have one of the bubbles pop when I hung the tube over night.I 'll use these up , but wo n't be buying these again . They seem to be a bit too flimsy . I 'll also not use them on anything other than a typical small pin or nail hole.One the bright side , since they are so flimsy , they bond well with the tire and do n't have as much of that pinched look when you inflate the tube .	-1
Caution : I use a *large* wedge pack on my road bike , and this tube took up a good 85 % of the space in it . So bulky ! It may or may not be good protection , but the size simply is not worth it for someone hauling this with them on their bike rides . I returned mine immediately .	-1
I bought this tube because I read online from others that the standard version ( not thorn resistant version ) was too cheap and thin . Well , when this monstrosity showed up , I wondered how I 'd possibly take it on rides like I did with standard tubes . In the end , I decided there is no way I can take it with me . It 's HUGE ! So , I 'll be keeping this one in the garage for a future replacement , and I bought a regular Sunlite Bicycle Tube 700 x 18-23Sunlite Bicycle Tube , 700 x 18-23 ( 27 x 1 ) 32mm PRESTA Valve . Much better -- just like I always use .	-1
It 's a plastic watch that NEVER turns off . Difficult to use . And , the night glow is so weak you ca n't see anything . It just blurs the numbers.Oh yeah , it 's cheap . Move on to the next item . Really , i 'm not just bi**hing .	-1
After trying to attach it to my car trailer hitch rack , I could not find a way to mount it successfully.The quality of the product is good and if you have a way to mount it you will like it .	-1
This cooler is nothing that special . Its got a strange shape , the fastex buckles on the side are annoying to have to buckele and unbuckle to get shape , and it really does n't wow me on the keep cold factor . For the price tag , its nothing to rave about . I wanted it to be great . The construction is very good , but it just did n't do what I had hoped.Its not easy to get in and out of and the space just is n't enough ... Anyway , might work for other people , did n't work for usP.S . we did buy the 12 because we really only needed a 6pack cooler and still did n't meet our needs..	-1
If you have limited funds and only are concerned about head safety - this helmet will do . But be beware that this helmet is heavy . I tried wearing it around the house for a couple of hours , and it made my head hurt . I did not even dear to bike in it . It has very thick cover , and I think that my head would be sweating in this helmet . Also as a female bike rider , I found this helmet extremely unattractive . It made me look like a five year old and a mushroom at the same time.I really did not like this helmet and ended up switching it for Giro Atmos , which I love ( but it is much pricier ) .	-1
As far as I can tell , this is the lightest helmet in its price range , and it really looks great . If it happens to fit you comfortably , this is a bargain . In my case , my head is large , but theoretically within the size range this helmet claims to fit ( it comes in only one size ) . However , it did not fit well . I could get it on my head , but it hurt . It went straight back in the box and back to Amazon . I would also add that I agree with all of the complaints of other reviewers about the straps twisting sideways . Even if it fits your head OK , that might be enough of an annoyance not to bother .	-1
Although both sets of straps adjust for fitting around your ears , only the strap on your right is adjustable for the proper fit under your chin , so if you have a small head the plastic closing device will be close to your right ear or even rubbing against it uncomfortably . My head is small , but fortunately the plastic closing device does n't quite touch my ear so it is OK for me.The straps are rather stiff , and they twist a bit instead of laying flat against the sides of my face , so they hurt much of the time , and at the least are very uncomfortable all of the time..The rear dial size adjuster works OK - a bit tricky/sticky at first , so it 's easier to adjust it when it 's off your head and then try it on . Once it fits properly just leave that dial alone and the helmet will stay the right fit for you - barring tragedy ... . The helmet fits my head snugly as I like it to , and is lightweight so that I rarely think of it on my head when riding - aside from the straps that hurt ... .I like that this helmet does n't have one of those ridiculous plastic attachments in front that is supposed to act as a sun visor because they do n't work so well and get in the way.The manual warns that this helmet can not be left in the heat , including in your car , and that the material will melt in the heat . That does n't sound good ... There are 4 foam cushions to place inside the helmet for better fit or comfort . The adhesive does n't work at all , and so you 'll need to glue them on . Fortunately I do n't need them.I was hoping that after several rides the straps would soften and lay flat against my face , but they do n't , and they still hurt . I will request a refund .	-1
Th light works well . However it is not bright enough for night riding . This light is more suited to being a safety feature to allow others to see you rather than to illuminate the road ahead . You would be much better off with a halogen bicycle light which would provide much better illumination .	-1
This mirror , although the position is good when riding , is not practical . I was constantly trying to avoid hitting the mirror against anything such as a wall , pole or anything else . This is because it sticks out so much from the handlebars . You can not flip your bike upside down to work on it with this mirror attached.There is road vibration also . It takes a long time to figure out what is going on in the mirror . For example , at night there may be three cars behind you . But because of the vibration , it looks like 6 cars because what you see is 12 bouncing lights but it is really 6 bouncing lights from three cars with two headlights each.Because of the optical curve , objects also appear different than in real life . So it is also hard to perceive depth . I returned mine and have a glasses mirror that works much better.The reason I give it two stars is if you can not wear a helmet or glasses mirror , then this mirror is better than riding unsafely with no mirror at all .	-1
The mirror attaches easily to the brake hood and is positioned correctly for quick glances into the mirror . In many ways I prefer that position over a mirror mounted on the helmet or the glasses.Unfortunately , the mount itself is made from relatively soft plastic which leads to vibrations even on smooth roads . The joint for adjusting the mirror loosens too quickly so that readjustment is needed from time to time.Overall , I still love the concept but I removed the mirror from my bike again because in practice this mirror is not very useful . However , I am using this mirror as a starting point for building something sturdier using an aluminum mount .	-1
Tried this on my road bike with 9 speed Shimano 105 shifters and ended up returning it and going back to my Take A Look glasses mounted mirror . The pivoting mechanism is too loose . The mirror never stayed in place when adjusted and allowed the mirror to vibrate too much to see anything behind you . This thing is the least dorky looking brake hood mounted mirror I 've seen but it just did n't work for me .	-1
I have tried using this mirror on both my road bike and my touring bike ( with butterfly handlebars ) . In both cases , the mirror took up too much space on my handlebar and made changing hand positions awkward . I was constantly having to re-adjust the position of the mirror and tighten the velcro strap on my handlebar . I now use the mirror on a third bike that has v-shaped handle bars . It sits at the bottom of the handlebar V and is clamped on with a metal ring-shaped clamp . Since it 's at the bottom of the V on the handlebar , it ca n't slide down any lower . It 's finally functional as a rear view mirror , but not on a road bike as advertised by the vendor .	-1
Better than nothing , but it does n't really install clean and easy . Bumps out of alignment rather easily . Good rear view .	-1
I was extremely disappointed in this mirror . For starters , the arm is just too short . You have to be able to put it on the very front of your helmet in order for the mirror to reach your field of view . On my helmet there is n't a sufficiently large flat area on the front to use the adhesive.On top of that , they include a two-sided adhesive ( on side sticks to the mirror arm , the other to the helmet ) , but only one side of the adhesive is sufficiently sticky ! It would probably work if you used two adhesives and stuck the less sticky sides to eachother , but they only give you 3 of the adhesive pads , so clearly they 're supposed to work by themselves.The arm of the mirror is also rather flimsy plastic , and I was afraid I was going to break it during adjustments.In the end , I used up all 3 adhesive pads and was unable to get it to stick to my helmet . I ended up just throwing the mirror away , because it was n't really long enough anyway . Do n't bother buying it - this mirror is worthless .	-1
I have to agree that the mirror 'arm ' is too short.However , my helmet is one of the larger made . ( Bell Faction Dave Mirra Multi-Sport ) I also think I should have purchased a mirror with a larger diameter.Since the mirror arm and mount adjustment socket-balls have sucha limited range of movement , I had a very limited choice in wherethe mirror base ( double-sided-sticky ) could be installed.I have to look way up and left to see the mirror , andthat might take a lot of getting used to.Had I been able to mount it lower , it would be easierto use ( without rolling my eyes so far over ) .While out riding today , I found that the mirror can be removedfrom it 's base . Built into the flat mounting section , thereare two little 'snaps ' that hold two segments together.While I was reaching up trying to adjust my view , the whole thing popped off in my hand.I snapped it back on later when we stopped for ice cream . : ) There is much more vibration ( = fuzzy vision ) thanis seen in my handlebar mounted ( Blackburn ) mirror.If you ride on bumpy roads a lot , forget this mirror ! If I get another one , It will be bigger and have a longer arm .	-1
& lt ; Summary > A huge plus for safety , but not the best type of rear mirror on the marketA rear view mirror is a MUST for anyone riding with traffic.HELMET mirrors are NOT for everyone as they do require some getting used to . It took me at least 2-3 rides before I got used to it . I 've been using one since 2003 and do not feel safe without one.Helmet mirrors do a better job as you can still have a blind spot with the bicycle mounted mirrors - I have my helmet mirror set so I can see my shoulder and the side of my head . This gives me a clear view of traffic behind and to my right . By turning my head 30 degrees to my right , I completely `` sweep '' to all lanes on my left side.I have BOTH this this and the Third Eye helmet mirror . The Third Eye is definitely better . I have this one mounted on my Giro Animas so I can pop off the mirror when I go offroad and do n't need to see behind me . The Third Eye is mounted on my Giro Atmos , which I use exclusively for road riding.PLUS- Pops off the base in case you want to ditch it for an offroad ride ( or lose it ... ) MINUS- Long solid arm is not very stiff- Adjustment range is limited- Heavy mirror means it bounces and vibrates a lotNote : The helmets I have used them on are the Giro Atmos , Giro Animas , Bell Forza II and Bell Phi II.If you 've found this review helpful , please let me know !	-1
I realy liked the look of the helmet online and I have owned Giro helmets before so I was really disapointed at the shape of the helmet ! I strapped it on , it felt good , then my girlfriend started laughing and told me to look in the mirror ... it looked really high on my head ( which it did ) Sent it back and bought a Giro Xar instead ( perfect fit and look )	-1
FYI for those new to the helmet world . I have worn Giro since the early '90s and highly recommend this helmet ( 5-STAR ) for fit , weight , efficient sizing , pony tail accommodation on some styles , colors , and of course crash-effectiveness . However , if purchasing please be aware that helmets deteriorate over time . The Styrofoam will start to pocket , crack , and outer cover delaminate . Giro dates their helmets and this one arrived with a 2008 date , as well as cracks and pockets in the Styrofoam . Of course Amazon is the best ! and I had no problem returning this one . I ordered four off of Amazon , only one dated within 6 months [ husband 's large @ 12/2011 ] the other two ( smalls ) were date July & Nov 2010 - but all were in good condition so I accepted them . I think unless one buys a `` new design '' and has a large head , ( I have a small head @ 6 7/8 '' ) you will get an older helmet as the large sizes are probably replenished more often than the small . As well , a new design will most likely have a fresher date . We could find none of these helmets in the colors we wanted at REI or Performance Bike walk-in stores in the Dallas area .	-1
I ca n't believe all the good reviews on this helmet . Yes , it looks decent , but the thing is HUGE . I tried it on for the first time and looked hilarious . I decided to give it to my ( less ... fashionably conscious ) dad , and even he laughed when he saw it . Check out Burn helmets for some super cool if slightly more expensive helmets . I bought a Burn and it looks badass .	-1
Awkward to hold and use . Too hard to pump up a bike tire with this thing . It 's small and portable enough to carry in your backpack for emergency use but I gave up and switched to CO2 cartridges instead .	-1
First impressions often lead to purchases which the passage of time reveals as mistaken . Such was the case with this light . True , it is very bright and well constructed to resist the elements . Then , the defects emerge.Firstly , the batteries must rather laboriously be changed by removing three tiny screws , which although ensuring a tight seal in wet weather , are also prone to becoming lost or simply cross-threaded with repeated use . Use this light on a daily basis and it will deplete the batteries fairly quickly , whereupon one must fetch the small screwdriver and take out the little screws , taking care that they do n't roll off the counter and disappear forever.The second design defect of note is the brittle plastic attachment clip . Mine finally snapped under the stress of routine use , owing to the manufacturer 's befuddling choice of an inferior yogurt container-type of plastic.If you ride a lot and want dependable gear , I suggest Planet Bike 's stuff , which exhibits a comparable level of operating performance but much better design .	-1
Like many others I think that the front of this light is wonderful ... and the back of this light is terrible . It takes forever to change the batteries and the plastic clip on back is weak . I have returned home from a ride on two occasions to find that the light was no longer attached to my bike . If they could change these things , I would purchase another in a minute .	-1
This could be a very good product if they improve the quality . After the 1st week , The taillight clip broke off and I had to make a Velcro strap to mount it on the back of my seat . After 6 months of use , both the headlight and taillight cuts out intermittently . I almost got hit when the taillight went out . That 's when I decided to throw this thing away and put my old faithful vintage generator set back on that was purchased in the 70s .	-1
My head measures 55 cm , 2 cm below the max , and this helmet sat on the top of my head like a child 's cap . Actually , I placed it on my 22 month old 's head and it only fit him on almost the loosest setting . Also , the company sent me the wrong color too .	-1
Very poor workmanship . Big chunks of styrofoam either missing or flashing left from the molding process . Felt like a dunce cap rather than a helmet ... . Ca n't believe they charge that kind of money and turn out that type of quality . I felt like a dunce so I returned it .	-1
I was considering purchasing a new helmet and my choices were Atmos and Aeon.Atmos was bigger in appearance ( wondering what this does to wind resistance ) and eventually chose to go with Aeon ( was $ 30 more expensive for the color I chose . )	-1
It fits but it says its a Woman 's Helmet on the box : ( it even came in a pink box senses woman live the color pink.GIRO = Girl ? but I see men wearing giro helmets on there website.Can someone tell I am wearing a woman 's bike helmet when riding my bike around ?	-1
Reading the description makes it very clear these are good gloves , however nowhere does it specify they are for a woman . It was n't until i realized they also sell them in pink that they are girls gloves , and naturally did not fit when they arrived .	-1
This product sounds like a good idea , and maybe somewhere is a good idea . But this is not the one to buy . I purchased two pairs , one tore the very first time I wore them . Getting a response from the vendor and replacement pair took weeks of constant follow-up . I 'm pretty sure if I had been less persistent they simply would have screwed me out of the cost of that pair . The second pair began falling apart a couple weeks later , but at that point I was not about to deal with the vendor again . If you want gel wraps I recommend looking into other brands - these Everlast one are cheaply made and not worth your money . Even better , just stick with the traditional hand wraps , which I am back to after this experiment . Do n't recommend ,	-1
These in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves . If it was only a quick `` wrap '' , there would n't be any gel in the knuckles . Once your hand is in this glove , it can not fit into a standard boxing glove.This glove has half fingers which have elastic at the ends . The elastic is so tight that it cuts off your circulation in each finger and is useless . Otherwise , this is a good glove and provides good wrist support , but will wear out quickly.I 've used the Harbinger brand gloves for years , with absolutely no problems or injuries . Although Harbinger WristWrap Bag Gloves are twice the cost , the Harbinger are far superior.Harbinger 320 Bag Glove WristWrap ( Black ) Since these are one of the most important pieces of equipment that you will have , do n't compromise .	-1
These are good ... the fit and features were fine , as advertised . However , after a couple months of being hurled against my 100 lb bag , the gel burst through the fabric covering the knuckles , effectively leaving me without any gloves .	-1
I wish I could say that these are awesome but I could n't even get them on . I have small hands . I am 5 4 and my pinky barley comes out of my mma gloves . I was hopng smalls would be perfect . Well these things were tiny . For a very young adult at best . O well .	-1
Not suitable for any mature adult . I should have known considering it was by Paul Frank but just a warning to future buyers that it would only be suitable for young adults or big adults who would do n't mind this helmet style . Back to Amazon it went .	-1
The Bell Metropolis sounded like the ideal commuting helmet : you can put on a rear-view mirror , a rain cover , and an LED taillight . In reality , none of these accessories came with the helmet , they are optional accessories . Then I saw that the mirror attaches to the visor , not to the helmet . No problem if you ride a recumbent or use upright handlebars , but with drop handlebars you ca n't use the visor ( you ca n't see where you 're going ) and so you ca n't use the mirror.In contrast , Bell 's Faction helmet is half the price and you can put a mirror on it . It has only a few small vents so you do n't need a rain cover . In the winter I cover the vents with tape and fill them with foam . Plus the Faction comes down further on the back and sides of your head so it should be safer . And the shell is thicker .	-1
Big disappointment . The lack of quality control was evident from the moment my eyes first saw this helmet out of the box.1 . The foam was dented in places like someone had dropped it against the edge of a hard surface . Other places had excess foam covering up the outer plastic cover . Furthermore , there was just a lot of extra bits of foam all over the helmet that should have been brushed off.2 . The velcro for the pads were placed so only about 1/2 the velcro strip could be used to hold on the pads.3 . MOST IMPORTANTLY Bell did not cut off all the filling points for the foam cast . One piece stuck out under a pad about 1/3rd of an inch into my head when I put it on . It felt horrible and the helmet leaned sideways on my head because of it . What makes it worse is that whoever at bell put the velcro and pad in place over it , had to have seen it and just let it go.For a 100+ dollar helmet , this is unacceptable . My 20 dollar shwinn appears to have better quality control than this helmet . Also , this helmet should n't be named `` sweep . '' There is almost no sweep to it . It 's like most other helmets that look like you are wearing a bowl on your head.UPDATE : Returned it and bought a specialized helmet for half the price and the quality seems far superior . I am a cannondale fanboy that abhors specialized but they do make great helmets and bikes .	-1
I bought one of the 26x1.75-1.95 size , and it fits right , was relatively easy to install , but it 's too soft-it feels and looks like I 'm riding with a half inflated tire . I put it on the front only to test it before doing both tires . Excellent idea and concept , just need to perfect the material , or make a range of different materials for people to choose from . I 'm also 220+ lbs , so I tend to put a lot of stress on my tires too : - )	-1
The same quality that Maxpedition products are known for is also what makes them suck . If you are thinking about wearing this on your belt it will look ridiculous . I even took off the buckle to make it thinner and it is still is way to bulky . I would rather have something of lesser quality that was a lot thinner than this material that will last forever but is thick and bulky . It is a quality product , its just looks stupid to actually wear .	-1
Too small to hold your Iphone if you have it in any sort of case . I have a Lifeproof case , which is one of the smallest on the market , and it does not fit in this wallet.The wallet is too large to stick in your pocket or conceal anywhere . It wo n't `` clip '' to your belt effectively . Instead you either have to undo your belt to take it off or undo a thick and loud velcro strap . Internal organization is basically non-existent.In short , it is just the right size to do nothing effectively . This was my first Maxpedition purchase , and most likely my last .	-1
The price is right , but the dial-fit wheel started to slip , and would n't tighten properly the second time I used it . That part is very flimsy and not well-designed.The helmet has good cooling.Seems to leave way too much of the back of the head exposed . I understand that the pointy part in the back will keep your head from hitting the ground if you fall backwards . However , if something were to hit you in the lower part of the back of the head - such as a truck mirror for example - there would be nothing to stop it except that flimsy , hard dial-fit buckle.The chin strap fits uncomfortably , if you adjust it to hold the helmet securely . It really digs into that area where your jaw meets your neck . If you loosen it , then the helmet does n't seem to be on securely.Looks too bulky on my head .	-1
Too small and cheaply made to do the job right.Tie a loop on both ends of a piece of rope . Use non-tightening knots . Put one loop over the end of your booted foot . Run the other end through both eyes of the spring , and then go around and go through both again . Pull on the other loop and the spring will be easily tightened . Good practice in case you get your hand caught in a trap , this method can be done one-handed in an emergency.Google or youtube for examples .	-1
As advertised . Simple , nothing of the ordinary . Priced a bit higher than one would think and is smaller than thought . But is handy to have when out on lake etc .	-1
I poured this into my toilet and it clumped up inside the jar . So I could not get in all in the toilet fast enough . I should have flushed sooner . This stuff started foaming up to the brim of the toilet bowl . What a mess ! Even after flushing twice , it stayed in the toilet . After leaving over night , the foam went down . I have no idea how it did in the sewer line to kill the roots . I had to get a professional to clear the roots from the sewer line.I would not waste my money on this . Better to put it toward a professional to clean it out right .	-1
Like the other reviewer , my garden is still too early for tomatoes . But in terms of usage on other plants , this organic compatible product did n't seem effective . I 'm not sure how many times you are supposed to douse the plant , but even knowing it 's non-toxic to people did n't make me comfortable enough to saturate the whole plant . The small bugs that I saw up close did n't freeze and stick their legs in the air ( which would have been satisfying ! ) . They just went about their day crawling in the plants . I understand that some sprays act to kill the nerves , resulting in a slower death , but just how slow ? I love the concept of the organic use , and that it does n't have alot of chemical odor . The spray pump is better of course than aerosol . My hands did n't end up feeling gross either . But I 'm not seeing it as effective as yet .	-1
I 've been gardening for many years and I 'm always looking for better ways to protect my plants from insects without risking our health soSafer Brand 5085 Tomato & Vegetable Insect Killerwas worth the shot.About all I can say is that it was n't horrible ; compared to other products , it did keep some of the pesky insects away . However , I still I had quite a few insects that seemed to be immune to it.Comparing it to past products I 've used , I 'd have to say this one only gets 2 out of 5 stars because I felt as though I was using something only a step above water .	-1
These generally work to keep out big particles.I have found these have loose material on the inside and it tickles my nose a lot , this gets annoying.I 'll look for a different solution next time around .	-1
I have an ant problem in my kitchen right next to my sink . I left some food out to attract the ants out , then put down the gel . No ants went for the gel . I tried later by just putting out the gel with no food . No matter how I tried , the ants did n't touch the gel . I even tried the gel outside , hoping to see it work in action . No ants . At least for me this product did n't work at all .	-1
wow , this stuff is a ripoff , it give you about 6 spots of stuff and thats it . 27 grams is 6 spots of stuff that hardly works . you 'd kill more ants if you purchased the spray at your local outlet . luckily , i didnt lose much money .	-1
We had a sever ant infestation in our kitchen - during making sweet pickles of all things . Anyway , I bought this product along with several others which gave me a good chance to test various products . This product did n't attract the ants very well compared to other products . Also , it became useless after it dried which took only a few hours . In side by side comparisons with this product ( Combat Ant Killing Gel ) , Raid 's Ant Gel , Terro Liquid Ant Killer and a few others the Terro product attracted more ants and lasted much longer . FYI , I am a consumer and am not associated with any of these manufacturers or retailers that sell products .	-1
I have tiny black ants in my bathroom and I was hoping this would help solve my problem . However , it did n't . I used it per the instructions and ants really did n't seem interested . I bought the TERRO liquid ant killer and it works soooo much better ! Do n't waste your money on combat -- go buy Terro !	-1
I love Park products , but I think a mountain biker tested these levers . I have several different sets of levers , and these are the hardest to use . The lip that fits under the tire is too short and fat . My experience is with 23 mm racing tires , and I have n't tested with anything else .	-1
Nothing about this product is appealing . It is not & # 34 ; anti-shock , & # 34 ; and neither the compass nor the thermometer are at all accurate !	-1
I received the wrong item . It was a hiking pole by Hammers but it was the one with the cork handle . So there was no camera mount . It had to be returned . Waste of time ...	-1
I first ordered this bar because the title said CAP/Champion EZ Curl Bar and I needed one . It came with the bonus of two collars , albeit the clunky metal sleeve kind with tension screws , but it was a bonus item . What a mistake ! This is NOT a CAP product ! First of all , the bar has no inner bend , it does not look like the picture associated with the item , so triceps extensions and narrow curls are uncomfortable and not ergonomic . Also , the bar came without one of the screws for the collars so the bonus of the collar pair was moot . I called CAP and they had no idea what model the bar was . This is NOT a CAP product , it may be manufactured in a CAP plant ( maybe ) for Champion , but CAP will not back it . After a few days of wrangling with CAP I called Amazon . They kindly shipped me another bar , which was complete , but the chrome flaked off the sleeves in the first use . I was done . I ordered a XMark EZ curl bar , returned this bar , and was much happier with my purchase.I do n't need a commercial grade bar for home use since I am the only user so I did n't expect amazing quality with this bar , but it is flat out horrible . I do not recommend it . Get the XMark bar for about the same price , buy a few spring clips , and you will have a much better quality bar.Pros : Came with collarsSleeves turned well and did not rattleCons : Lacks inner bendDoes not match image on websiteChrome flakes offNot supported by CAPMight come with a missing partGenerally not a good purchase.I do not recommend this bar when better choices exist for similar money .	-1
HiI ca n't say to much , but this feels like European sizing to me . Europe is generally one size lower so , what is l in Europe is an XL in the US ... .I bought several other sweatpants from several other makers ... none was as small . Quality seems to be in line with the price .	-1
This pant is basically comfortable but very inconvenient in that it does not provide any pocket . It is obviously cut corner product . I regret that I bought four of this and some are ready to go to recycle to local charities .	-1
I had installed 3 sets of Planet Bike Cascadia fenders previously , and every installation was a piece of cake . These SKS fenders were another animal entirely . Tons of custom fitting was involved , requiring either a hacksaw or a Dremel cutoff wheel . No parts were preassembled , and no spares of the proprietary parts were included . To top it off , the plastic fenders themselves were badly warped , causing the fenders not to curve around the sides of the tires evenly . They almost touch in spots . I 'll use these until they entirely tick me off . Then I 'll do the smart thing , and go back to using Planet Bike Cascadias .	-1
This knife has a good stainless steel blade that sharpens very well . It is a strong full-tang knife with the steel running the full length of the knife under the handle.The knife is about 8-1/8 '' long total and has a 3-1/2 '' cutting surface ( with 3-3/4 '' from blade tip to the hilt ) .However , the handle is n't very comfortable . The recess for the index finger rubs against the back of the finger when you are cutting . And while the red wood handle inserts look nice , they are very smooth , so your hand does n't get a good grip.If your hands are medium-sized to large ( say 3-1/2 '' wide or more ) , the handle will also feel a bit small , and your pinky finger does n't get a good grip on the end.Winchester actually made a similar knife with red wood handle handle inserts , a lanyard hole , a finger guard , and about the same size blade , but without the finger recess . It is much more comfortable in the hand . It came in one of their inexpensive three-knife sets . ( There are also a couple of similar knives came in different Winchester sets , but they do n't have the lanyard hole in the handle . ) The Winchester three-knife sets are still available new on some auction sites for around $ 20.NOTE : Winchester also makes a larger 10 '' ( total length ) version of this same knife design ( with the recess for the index finger ) . Both sizes were sold in many sporting goods stores , hardware stores , and discount department stores in hanging blister packs .	-1
Not sure what this kit is for really . The bristles fall out so fast its a joke . Save your money .	-1
This brush was a low cost alternative to the enclosed chain cleaners . This brush is just about useless . It is hard to keep on the chain while moving the chain , the bristles do not clean the chain adequately , and the long bristles do nothing for my crank or cassette . I wasted money purchasing this brush ! I would advise you to learn from my error ! !	-1
Tiny and very unsafe feeling , though it 's probably safer than just an open candle flame . It feels cheap and it get very , very hot .	-1
Maybe I expected too much for this light . Very serious issue is the left over wax . The melted wax blocks the tube . I can find the wax all around the spring inside . Very hard to remove them to replace candle .	-1
The packageing was ok but the candle lantern pulled apart and could not get it back togeather . In short good idea and others seem to do ok with thm but for me not a very good execution . Will not buy anouther .	-1
I 've loved Nalgene products for years . When I saw a friend 's collapsible bottle ( her 's a Platypus ) , I thought Nalgene 's version would be even better . It is bigger ( 48oz compared to their 32oz ) , but the blue plastic lid broke during my first hiking trip . I 've had an identical lid on my regular Nalgene bottle that I got in 2002 and it is still in perfect working order . Either their quality control has gone down the toilet , or I received a defective cap . Either way , I 'm not happy . The plastic of the cantene held up in my backpack . It will still be functional , but can no longer easily be carried .	-1
I wish I could give this a 5 star review . I loved it while it lasted , but after 2 months and ~50 uses , it sprung a leak . I left it full on my nightstand laying on it 's side ( closed , duh ) and by morning it leaked a considerable amount ( 2-4 fl oz ) . The hole is almost unnoticeable , but when if I hold it over the sink upside down ( no squeezing ) , it slowly drips out of one of the seams around the lid area . When I put a little a pressure ( similar to pressure it would experience in a pack ) , it drips pretty rapidly . This bottle is awesome until it leaks . I wish I could buy more , but I ca n't trust it in my pack if it could spring a slow leak at any time and get stuff wet .	-1
This thing worked fine for about ... a month.. then developed a crack/hole in the corner on the bottom , so become useless . but the idea is good .	-1
I have a Trek 8.3DS ( 17.5 '' frame size ) and this lock is too big to fit in my frame , even without the plastic piece used to attach the lock to the frame . The plastic piece used to attach the lock to your frame is veeery large ! It adds at least 1-2 inches on the size of this lock , making it even more difficult to fit in a frame . You also need to leave clearence above the lock because it slides vertically out of the plastic attachment , which means you need ever MORE room . Do not buy this lock unless you have a frame with A LOT of space on the inside . Even then you will probably have to remove your water bottle holder .	-1
Almost all Kryptonite U Locks are Garbage . Even the $ 100 NY style locks . Watch the video on You Tube on how to open them in less than a min . Do not buy locks with round keys . OnGuard uses laser cut keys , case hardened Master lock padlocks are more secure than this U Lock . A disc lock and 2.5ft of heavy duty hardened chain from the hardware store run about $ 30	-1
This lock is well built , but I do n't like it because it wants to coil ( exactly like the picture ) itself to the original shape . This makes it harder to feed it through the bike to whatever you 're locking it to . Also dangerous because it coils back and can hurt you , your car and/or bike . It will NOT straighten . I would not recommend this lock .	-1
I bought this to lock up my bikes while on the bike rack on my van . This lock is better used with only one bike at a time . I needed a longer cord . It 's also very tightly coiled , which makes it harder to maneuver .	-1
Fit my road bike , but it doesnt fit my TRI back as my seat stem is bigger . Good for road bikes though	-1
Let me start by saying that I have a rather large knife collection and have been collecting knives for quite some time . I always love to look for good value knives because those are always the ones that just seem to jump out at you and ask to be used.As a left hander , I 'm used to receiving knives and having to switch the pocket clip over of left-hand carry . As such , I have all the necessary tools to do so , including Torx bit drivers , hex drivers , phillips and flat head drivers.After watching some great reviews of this knife on youtube by such people as nutnfancy , and cutlerylover , I was aware that the pocket clip was able to be removed and switched to left-hand carry , and I also was made aware that this particular model knife DID NOT have a dual thumb stud . Instead , it was a one-sided thumb stud with a Torx screw that is flush to the blade on the other side , thus giving the user the ability to remove the thumb stud and reverse it for left-hand carry.This was all well and good when mentioned in the reviews , but what I did n't take note of was the fact that everyone doing these reviews were all right handed and obviously never actually tried to convert the pocket clip and thumb stud over for left hand carry.I 've ordered this knife a total of two times now , because the first knife I received I sent back because it was practically impossible to remove the pocket clip , even after removing the screw . Also , when trying to remove the thumb stud , once it becomes the slightest bit loose , you will need a way to hold the thumb stud steady while you continue to unscrew the torx screw . You will also have to hold the thumb stud steady when screwing it back down as well , because if not , the torx screw and thumb stud will just spin in place unless the stud is anchored still . After being unsuccessful in trying to merely hold the thumb stud still with my fingers while screwing it in , I tried to preserve the integrity of the thumb stud and not mar it by wrapping it in cloth and using pliers to hold the thumb stud still while tightening the torx screw down . Well this is impossible as well because the thumb stud still gets chewed up and ruined.After this ordeal with the first knife , I gave this knife a bad review and received a lot of feedback from people here on amazon chastising me for my negative review . So after some thought , I wanted to give these people and Kabar the benefit of the double and chalk it up to the fact that I may have just gotten a dud . So I gave it another shot and ordered another one.Immediately out of the box , I ran into the same problem of not being able to get the pocket clip off of the knife even after the screw had been removed . This time however I was determined to remove this clip even if it meant breaking the knife ! I wound up prying the clip off with a flat head screw driver resulting in minor scratches to the pocket clip . This angered me for two reasons : a ) Because Kabar designed the knife so poorly that they forced me to have to scratch up my brand new knife just to be able to remove the pocket clip . b ) Because nobody should have to go through this much aggravation just to remove a dang pocket clip ! LOLOnce I got the clip reversed , I started on the thumb stud . Again , I ran into the same problem as before . As soon as I loosened the torx screw on the opposite side of the thumb stud , it would just spin in place instead of unscrewing . My attempt at holding the thumb stud still with my thumb and index finger failed , and I soon realized I would once again have to use something to wrap around the thumb stud and use pliers to hold it still while I unscrew the torx screw ... most likely resulting in marring and chewing up the thumb stud again.I really did n't feel like scratching and/or chewing up the thumb stud again , although now it would match my scratched pocket clip , so I boxed this second knife up and promptly requested a return . This angered me as well for two reasons , a ) Because Kabar consciously made the poor decision to produce this knife with one thumb stud instead of dual thumb studs when it would not have cost them virtually any more money to just go ahead and produce the knife with dual thumb studs like most other folders on the market today . Instead they had to go ahead and make this knife a complete nightmare for left-handers . b ) Again , nobody should have to go through that much aggravation just to convert a thumb stud when it should have just been a dual thumb stud from the beginning.I contacted Ka-bar about this issue and asked them why they did n't just put dual studs on the knife , as it makes the knife immediately usable by both a right and left hand users , and as a whole , it makes the knife look more symmetrical and aesthetically balanced . Ka-bar did n't have an answer for me as to why the knife only has a one sided thumb stud but told me that they did n't have any plans on changing the design.One may also ask , `` why would it be important to have dual thumb studs to make the knife immediately usable by both left and right hand users ? '' . Well , let 's say I 'm left-handed , and someone who is right-handed asks to use my knife . It makes more sense to have a knife that both left and right handed users can easily manipulate.At the end of the day , I just felt that this knife was really designed for right handed users and was just made with the facade of being left-hand friendly when it was truly anything but ! Final thoughts : If you are right handed looking for a decent value folder with AUS8 stainless steel , then this would make a good workhorse knife . If , on the other hand you are left-handed , then I would run for the hills in pursuit of a knife that is truly more left-hand friendly ! I gave this knife a two star rating because of the aggravation I went through trying to set this knife up for left-hand use ( not once , but twice ) , when Ka-bar unfairly gives people the false belief that this knife can easily be converted . Likewise , the reality of the situation with not being able to convert the thumb stud , or pocket clip , would have reduced me to having to open the knife like like a Buck 110 with a pocket clip on the wrong side . This is just a deal breaker for me.As I 'm aware most people in this world are right-handed and if this knife works for you , then great , stick with it ! It 's a good knife for the price ... FOR RIGHT HANDERS.As a left-hander my two experiences with this knife were nothing but angering and frustrating.I want to leave off by saying , that if Ka-bar released this knife with dual thumb studs , and a pocket clip that is readily and easily removable like the average folding knife , then I would definitely give this knife 5 starts for the price .	-1
This knife is a good design , but made of very poor materials . For the price , i 'd say perhaps a little over priced . I 've been using it for one day , doing some basic shopping and throwing and the handle is lose . i would n't buy it again if i had the choice . i give it a one out of five stars . i will never buy something with a kraton handle again .	-1
had gotten used to the heavy ( not as big though as this knife ) Gil Hibben knives . I thought I was pretty good at nailing the target on the side of the shed . This came and I was not expecting such a long thrower . I should have read more closely so not anyone else ` s fault . I had given the other throwers to a buddy and he never used them so with some hinting he agreed to swap me . No he has a monster which I seldom was even able to stick and I have what works nearly every time and feels right .	-1
I love cold steel ; well , most things cold steel . I own several cold steel products and have not as of yet had a problem . Regarding this knife , all of the features it has should be great for a bushcraft knife . The steel rating is good , it has a thick tang for its size which makes it ( durable , good for de-limbing , and splitting ) , it can be sharpened easily yet will hold an edge well , the handle is comfortable and grippy ( this is good for all conditions : ie . snowy or rainy days ) , it is long enough to do some medium duty tasks , and is dura-coated so that it will be weather resistent . Based on these attributes I bought the knife ( and the fact that cold steel has a good reputation ) .My intention for this knife was for it to serve as a light to medium duty tool . I have a backcountry system . I use a saw to cross-cut logs , then an axe to split them , then a knife to make kindling , carve with , make tent stakes , or any other random task one does around camp.With high hopes I took the cold steel SRK out with me on a backcountry adventure . I fell a dead standing tree with my saw , cross cut it into workable lengths with the saw , split those logs with my axe into fourths , then with the SRK I proceded to further process the wood into smaller kindling size pieces with a baton for my fire . Essentially I took wrist size pieces of dead pine and made pencil sized pieces of kindling.After about fifteen or twenty minutes ( using my brand new , never used SRK ) I noticed that the blade became loose in the handle ( noticeably ) ! It was troubling to me because I have many camp knives that have seen 1000 times more/harder use and are perfectly solid in their construction . But seeing as how my faith in this knife had caused me to bring only this knife with me I had to continue to use it ; for there was no other choice.After further menial tasks like making tent stakes for a rain fly , a feather stick to start a fire with my firesteel , and cutting some chord to size to use as lashing for a primitie shelter , I was understandably hungry and stuck the knife into a log I had cut near my chair by the fire . Sitting there , I ate , I listened to the rain above me hit the rain fly and thought about what needed to be done to finish my shelter . When the rain abated I rose up from my chair and pulled the SRK out of the log I had stuck it into next to my chair . I took a few steps before I noticed that the tip of the knife had broken off into the log . I did not twist the knife in the wood , I did not ply it , I simply stuck it into the log to keep while I ate . Moreover , It was the first time the knife 's tip had ever been stuck into anything ! When you consider that the knife became loose in the handle after fifteen or twenty minutes of light use making kindling , and that the tip broke off simply after being stuck into some soft pine wood , I have no choice but to come to the conclusion that either I recieved the biggest lemon that cold steel has ever made , or this line of knife sucks ! Either way it does n't bode well for the knife or for cold steel . If their quality controls are so poor that a knife of this level of incompetance leaves their factory to be recieved by a customer who has paid a good amount of money for then they have a problem in their manufacturing process . Or if this knife is not a lemon and it simply is the way that the knife is supposed to be then they have a problem with their manufacturing process.I will be promtly sending this knife back to cold steel for a replacement hoping that it is a lemon issue . However , if the second one that I recieve back performs in any way less than perfect I will be doing two things : first , I will rethink the trust I have in the cold steel brand , and second , I will look at my existing cold steel knives through more cautionary lenses . By that I meen I will not be going out into the backcountry with only my cold steel knife anymore and will bring a second as backup.Lastly , the fact that I have to reconsider the quality of the brand and consider bringing a second/ backup knife along with me out into the field is unacceptable . A camp/survival knife should be something dependable . It should be something that when you use it you feel as though you can depend on it to do what you ask of it to do . And for the reputation that cold steel has worked for , and for the price that you pay them for their products , you should feel as though you could trust their knives with your life , and you should be able to ; for one day you may be asking the knife to do just that ! My rant is done .	-1
I do like the knife but the sheath with mine is horrible . Turn the sheath upside down and the knife falls out . Do n't even need to shake it , just turn it over . I suppose you could go through the trouble of using a heat gun and trying to reshape the sheath opening ... . Then again , when you buy a new knife/sheath combo you kinda expect it to work . Back it goes . Hopefully your setup might be fine . I am a Cold Steel fan .	-1
i bought this for a close friend of mine . the knife itself has a wonderful balance , shape , handle , and blade thickness . the sheath is also exceptional . we used it as we do any other knife for things such as batoning , carving , and food prep . after several days we began to notice a pretty severe blade wobble . i returned it promptly and bought him a different knife . really was hoping this knife would have worked out , but the tang is not secured correctly in the handle ; .	-1
Not really that comfortable and daily loud . I would not recommend it in a blind where you are shooting fairly close ( with my son , so I needed a 100 yards or less shot ) .	-1
I order from AMAZON all the time . I have spent money in the thousands , and after emailing amazon a couple times wondering why they were waiting till the last minute to ship my knife with the PRIME two day shipping , I found out why . THEY SENT ME A KNIFE THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN OPENED AND THEN THEY USED A LOT OF SCOTCH TAPE TRYING TO RESEAL IT . BEWARE ! ! ! I HAVE PICTURES IF YOU WANT TO SEE JUST ASK . I do n't know about other people but 50 bucks is a lot of money for a knife , if I had wanted a used one I would have went to the flee market ! ! its a shame , i was really eagerly awaiting the arrival of a new knife , NOT USED JUNK	-1
I know , it sounds odd to hear a complaint about an assisted-open knife opening too quickly . There are some features of this knife I really liked , and a few things that caused me to stop using it.Pros : * The pocket clip allows this thing to be clipped to your pocket and hide there so no one can see it . Because of its bayonet design , the entire knife will be hidden in your pocket . * The safety provides peace of mind . I carry my knives in my pocket and normally take off the clips , because I do n't want sheeple to cause a fuss at the office . Because I also keep other items in that same pocket , I did n't want to risk the thumb studs getting snagged on something while I walk and cause the knife to spring open . * The serrations are pretty good . I used this to trim the ivy growing along the walkway to my house and to cut little saplings growing on my property , and they performed quite well . I could grab a handful of ivy and cut through the whole bundle with one tug . * Opens with little effort , and opens quickly . To me , this was both good and bad . * Light weight compared to other knives of its size.Cons* Because of the thumb studs , every time I would open this using them , my finger would slip off the stud and run along the side of the blade . That 's a big no-no and a deal-breaker for me , because if the serrations had a knick or the steel was bent , or whatever , then my finger would get cut opening this . Maybe it was the design of the thumb studs , or perhaps I was just opening it wrong , but I never like having my finger run across the blade itself as the knife snaps open . * The handle was too slick and did n't have any grip to it . * The straight edge was n't very sharp out of the box . * The knife has a lot of blade play right out of the box , both vertically and horizontally . For its price , I expect no blade play . * The AUS8 steel is really soft and I could n't keep an edge on it for more than a few days doing nothing but opening letters with it.Overall , this knife has a few features I really liked , but the downsides were too much . For the price , this knife was a huge letdown .	-1
This did n't work for me . It was way too loose on my bike , and my bike was not at all secure to my bike rack . Also a piece of the plastic broke off . I ended up realizing that it worked just as well to transport my ( female ) bike diagonally on the rack , and that this piece of equipment was n't actually necessary at all . They have a life time warranty so I know I could 've returned it for repair , but I did n't bother .	-1
This thing is TINY . I did n't realize it would be smaller than my everyday carry pocketknife . This knife does n't belong on your belt . It 's more like the size of a typical `` neck knife , '' and in fact I have neck knives that are quite a bit bigger . This is also one of the dullest knives I 've ever seen from Ka-Bar . It is at least a pretty knife , but on the whole a disappointment .	-1
blade is too thin and flimsy , I dont know how the military issues this knife , it is terrible . SOG is much better.I returned my ka bar and bought a SOG	-1
BEWARE ! THE SHEATH IS DEFECTIVE , AND EVEN WHEN USED PROPERLY , THE SNAP ON THE SHEATH SCRATCHES THE FINISH ON BLADE , WHICH IS THERE TO PREVENT RUST . KA-BAR HAS NOT CORRECTED THIS ISSUE , AND KA-BAR DOES NOT HAVE A REPAIR CENTER . THE SHEATH IS NOT MADE IN THE USA , AND THE DESIGN ITSELF IS DEFECTIVE .	-1
I bought this item in June 2006 for a camping trip to Bass Lake , CA.The chair worked very well for several months . However the plastic composite fulcrum piece which holds the legs in place split in half while sitting on it in my house . I slightly tweaked my back when I fell . I only weight 190 lbs . I think it may have been defective . I emailed the manufacturer and they did not respond .	-1
Shoddy construction . The various arms are secured by plastic screws . One of the arms would not allow the screw to tighten - as if perhaps the screw receiver was set too deeply into the arm for the screw threads to reach . I tried it with other screws , but the length of the screws is consistent . Thus the screw will not work .	-1

The bicycle seat is comfortable however it does not wear well . As you continue to use it the material will tear and as time passes the foam will show through . The covering on the seat should be made of a more durable material	-1
I 've used this rack 4 times now and it continually falls off my bumper nearly spilling my bikes . The straps are cheap and I worry about them breaking . Go with a sturdier rack . I get being on a budget and all , but if you spend $ 500 or more on your bike , do n't you think its a good idea to spend a few extra bucks on your rack to make sure it gets to its destination ?	-1
The only thing remarkable about these bags are the price . These bags & # 34 ; might & # 34 ; be twice the thickness of a heavy duty store bought version . The seal comes apart very easily and is not waterproof at all . Do not trust your electronics or anything else you need to keep dry with this product . The seal , on either model bag I bought , will not stay secure if you tip the bag upside down . Do n't waste your money , time or effort with these bags.I have returned these bags for a refund . I do appreciate Amazon 's excellent customer service .	-1
Bought for goruck event , two held two did n't , just socks and neck gaiter but at 32 and soaking wet they were missed . Think i could have done equal or better with plain old zip-locks Would n't waste the money honestly .	-1
Very poor quality material and seal part . I really do n't believe that is water resistant like said . It 's not special because is made in USA . I prefer good products made in China than bad products ( like this ) made in USA.Do n't buy it !	-1
Says it fits an iPhone 5 & # 8230 ; yea , just the phone . 99 % of people have covers on their phone ! Who carries an iPhone around plain ? ? ?	-1
In taking the packaging tape off the bag 's packaging ( why was tape even there ? ) I managed to accidentally stress the material and make a & # 34 ; ding & # 34 ; in the bag where it 's stretched out now . That was just from removing tape the manufacturer put on their stupid packaging.I was going to use these for keeping things dry inside a hiking bag but clearly I ca n't trust them . Despite being advertised as & # 34 ; ultra & # 34 ; durable the truth is they 're about one step above regular freezer bags .	-1
I ordered these since i wanted various size water tight bags for various gear and come to find that they barley qualify for a little more than ziplock bags from a super market.granted , they are a bit thicker than a super market ziplock bag , but i would n't trust them either . i am going to stick to the sealine cases which are not only water tight but also waaaaaay thicker plastic and are far more durable.

When I was a young and dumb teenager I bought a similar bike , thinking I did n't need one of them fancy elitist bike they sold at bike shops . I nearly was killed due to crappy brakes and poor stability . Please , if you value your life at more than $ 200 , spend that money on a used quality bike , not this piece of junk.I am not a professional bike mechanic , but I hang out with several , and I guarantee you will spend more money on repairs due to shoddy workmanship and disposable components than you will save by buying this bike shaped object .	-1
I have seen and worked on two of these for friends . They are not useful bicycles -- they look nice until you realize what you 're looking at , and then they 're merely horrifying . See my full review on my blog here : [ ... ] Save your money and buy a better bike -- a singlespeed , perhaps , or buy used if you have to . Avoid this mistake .	-1
I bought this bike for my wife because I was not sure if she would really be into biking and I did not want to make a large investment . I wish I would have taken her to a local bike shop and found something there used . This bike 's shifters are terribly placed near the stem of the handle barfs requiring you to move your hands every shift . The derailleur is junk and the pedals make a clink every rotation .	-1
With so many automakers jumping into the bicycle-making game , it 's a curious study to see how the bikes live up to the reputations of the makers themselves . In that regard , the GMC Denali certainly lives up to the reputation of the old GMC . Like the & # 34 ; luxurious & # 34 ; trim of GMC trucks it is named after , the Denali is a weak attempt at turning a budget-minded set of wheels into , well , a slightly-better-dressed budget-minded set of wheels . But make no mistake about it , spending a premium on looks does NOT get you better performance.Off the rack , the bike seems fairly impressive . It certainly looks like it can hang with far more expensive bikes , and you can fool yourself into believing it when you initially find yourself in a pack of cyclists . But when that pack blows past you , you 'll realize you bought what basically is a stripped down hybrid with no shocks and cheap & # 34 ; road & # 34 ; tires . This thing is good to get yourself acquainted with the form of road bikes , but it is not ready to go toe-to-toe with even slightly more expensive road bicycles . In terms of outright performance , it is about on par with less-hardcore hybrids . The effort to get this thing moving is immense ( relatively speaking , of course ) , the brakes are crap ( no matter how well adjusted ) , and stability is nonexistent.Further , this bike will break in all kinds of ways . If it is made of metal , it will likely bend or rust ( except the frame , which feels heavy enough to take on a small car in a collision ) . If it is plastic , it will break right off . So far , I 've got some bent gears , bent pedals , a torn seat , torn grips , bent handlebar , broken seat adjustment , broken light reflectors , broken water bottle cage , stripped front axle nut , etc . And those are the just the things I can name off the top of my head.If you 're looking for a budget bike to start off on , buy yourself ANY junker you can find on Craigslist and save the difference for a worthy upgrade when you 're ready . Do n't fool yourself into thinking this is a cheap bike that will last you a while .	-1
This bike is extremely cheap and heavy . I bought one from Walmart and could only stand to ride it for about 2 days till I took it back . The components are extremely cheap , the bike is very very heavy and the brakes might as well not even be there since they are absolutely awful and dont stop anyways . Save your money and get a nice used road bike or an entry level trek or specialized bike for under 700 new .	-1
When you pay this kind of money for a bike , you know they 're skimping somewhere . The tubes are poorly constructed , the welds are ugly , the components are bottom of the barrel . Everything will eventually fall apart on this , and if it does n't , you 're stuck with a heavy bike that you ca n't upgrade .	-1
Takes forever to assemble . Poor quality material , finishing and design . 2-3x heavier than even entry level road bikes . There are just so many things are wrong with this bike . If you are remotely serious about getting into road cycling sport , do yourself a favorite and invest in something safer . Save yourself the disappointment , and do n't waste your money on this . Go to your local bike shop and get a used `` real '' road bike if $ 200 is your budget .	-1
Having worked as a bike mechanic at a high volume shop for a bit over two years I have come into contact with many different GMC Denali bikes . My opinion on this bike , and the overall tone of the review that follows is : this thing is a piece of crap and not worth the money . As stated , I 've worked on and ridden pretty much every model of this bike . Starting from the mechanical end of things the most annoying things are the poor shifting , poor braking , and non-durable wheels.The shifting is really hit or miss on these , although never good , some I 've seen are better than others . I 've spent significant time trying to tune the shifting for some customers and sometimes it 's just not possible no matter what you try or how much time you spend . The problem usually is that the shifters are very imprecise , therefore it does n't put your derailleur in the right spot to line up the chain with the gear . This results in a noisy drive train that will skip gears often . All of the parts for the shifting and drive train are very low quality and are not easily serviceable . I 've seen a lot of loose bottom brackets on these as well.The brakes and brake levers are rarely set-up properly from the factory resulting in poor braking performance and making the brakes uncomfortable to reach . Even when they are set-up properly they offer very poor braking . The brake caliper has weak , flexible construction and the stock brake pads are not good . All of the power you put into pulling the brake lever is lost to the cheap components.The wheels are often poorly built at the factory and have varying tension on the spokes making the wheels go out of true ( they develop a wobble ) rather quickly . The hubs are also rarely set-up well . The do n't spin well and develop play ( side to side movement ) in the hub . I 've seen a lot of flat tires on these too.Mechanical issues aside , the bike is very awkward to ride . The frame is heavy and the geometry is awkward making the bike hard to handle and uncomfortable to ride . The front end is very heavy and has a very awkward angle on the fork making the steering very unwieldy . Shifting is very awkward because of how you have to move your hands to the grip shifters on the top of the bars . The saddle and handlebars are also not very comfortable . I would not feel safe riding this bike at high speeds.Between the rampant mechanical issues and straight up uncomfortable ride it is a joke that in the item description they even try to claim this bike could be used for competition . This bike will give you more problems than you want . You will end up in bike shops for repairs often , and we really do n't like working on these because they really are harder to work on and sometimes ca n't even be fixed . The repairs are n't usually cheap either , I 've seen many that the repair bill would be more than the bike cost and it still would n't be able to be fixed perfectly.Do yourself a favor and look for a nice used bike , many nice ones can be found in this price range that are ready to ride or just need a bit of work . Or shell out an extra $ 200-300 and get a decent quality bike from a reputable brand . Add the cost of service you will no doubt have to shell out on this bike to the value of having a better bike and you will have the difference in the price of this bike and a decent ride . This is a disposable bike , and a $ 200 disposable bike at that . Bikes are not meant to be disposable goods .	-1
This bike is totally unusable and unsafe . The cranks holding the pedals are too long relative to the frame . When you turn the front wheel to steer , it hits the pedal ! ( Not a shoe in the pedal , but the pedal itself . ) I would love to return this item as completely unsuitable , but unfortunately my son took a nasty spill the first time he rode it when the pedal hit the wheel and damaged the bike ( and himself a bit , though only scrapes and bruises ) . This bike is completely unsuitable for any rider of any size . ( I rarely write one-star reviews , normally choosing to not write about products on which I made a poor choice . In this case , however , I feel it imperative to comment on the design flaw . )	-1
After using this product , it seems more of a gimic versus something really necessary . I take care of my ride , so sweat is `` no sweat '' for me.Happy Holidays , Smacka	-1
The thong is too thin and does n't cover the entire top tube of the frame so I use a throw towel anyways . I read reviews about not spending money on a bike thong for an indoor trainer but decided to get one anyways . I could now easily do without one and use a towel instead since I use a towel anyway . The best part about this bike thong is the pocket you can put in front , which can hold my phone , controller , GU 's for a long ride , etc .	-1
Have n't found a good position to install this so it does n't irritate my hands while working out ... it catches about 60 % of the sweat and almost all of the drops that would have hit my bike .	-1
For those who are not at all concerned with moisture management , it provides a good cushion . I , however , am very disappointed with this tape . After about half an hour , the tape is so wet that it 's hard to hold . After about an hour on my bike my fingers are actually pruning . I shall be replacing it with something else .	-1
Seriously , did n't feel any much better than cheaper ones for half the price . I do n't see where the GEL part comes into play , as it just feels like foam tape to me .	-1
WOOD HANDLE SPLIT BAD . BEAUTIFUL KNIFE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! COLD STEEL NEEDS TO MAKE THIS THIS A BLACK RUBBER HANDLE . OH BOY SENDING BACK	-1
Accuracy just is n't good enough to use these out side of plinking . Ended up giving them away since I do n't plink much .	-1
I bought these pellets to plink around with my new airgun . I have been shootign airguns for 15 years , and so I know more then the average airgunner . However , I thought i would try these basic pellets . These pellets are just very cheap , lightweight , non accurate pellets . I struggled to get good groupings with these.So I went and bought another tin of Crosman pellets for surprisingly cheap and boy have they been doing the job . I have had great groupings , and they have enough knockdown power for hunting . Here is a link to the pellets - http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DCB61Q/ref=as_li_tl ? ie=UTF8 & camp ; =1789 & creative ; =9325 & creativeASIN ; =B001DCB61Q & linkCode ; =as2 & tag ; =jrsqe-20 & linkId ; =326CCJKCWLXWGRDG I would advise you to stay away from these very cheap Crosman Field Hunting pellets .	-1
The EB22 arrived today and I guess I am kinda let down . Here 's my summary : PROS : The wood grips are very nice . I was expecting them to be lighter colored , but they are a nice , rich dark stain.The pistol is not nearly as big as the 13xx or 22xx series . I was surprised at this , and pleased . If you *are* after a larger gun , then this obviously is n't for you.The pistol is very simple and clean looking , again digressing from the 13xx and 22xx series.The trigger is n't bad at all , but my pistol seems terribly inaccurate ( see below ) .CONS : The flat black finish has several imperfections , most that could be overlooked , but the serial number ( see my photo above ) has all kinds of paint damage from the engraving machine . Looks pretty trashy to me.I do not like the bolt assembly . The side bolt on the new 13xx and 22xx series is much more comfortable and intuitive . This one is kind of a pain in the butt . Not only is it harder to grab , but requires a quarter turn to pull back and then re-tighten upon inserting a pellet.No windage adjustment . There is elevation by a simple set screw , but no windage ( that I can find ( even in the owner 's manual ) ) .With that , I can not zero this or get even a marginally good grouping . My shots are literally all over the place and I do n't know why . Do CO2 pistols have a break-in period ? I did n't think they did . I have consistently strong pulling to the left . If I focus my eyes on the pellet 's path I can see it exit the barrel and immediately jut left . This ca n't be right.SUMMARY : I can not recommend this pistol . At $ 118+ , it is a poor value . The Crosman 2240 is 1/3rd the cost and is comparatively much better in all aspects , including accuracy . Granted , it has plastic grips , but that is its only downfall compared to the EB22 . I will hold on to it for a week or so and shoot it some more , but it 's probably getting returned.Disclosure : If any other readers know something about my issues , please speak up .	-1
I was going to wear these gloves like I do my regular ones , on the outside so I could pick up small things and use iPod . They were too short on wrist , so they felt tight and uncomfortable .	-1
I liked these glove liners at first . I have only had these for a month and used these as liners on cold days or by themselves on cool days , and I do n't use them when I do any kind of work . Just putting them on and off has put a lot of wear on them , and they now have holes in the thumbs , after only a month of usage . The holes are getting increasingly larger every time I wear them . They ARE comfortable , but not at all durable ! I will probably keep them as fish handling gloves until they 're worn out completely . They were not a good buy for me .	-1
These were pretty easy to install . I found the material chafed my skin when carrying IWB . I do n't like how the stickers only cover the side of the grip ; I think most of the gripping force comes from the front and back of the grip , which is not covered at all . I threw them out after a couple of days . I have not really been happy with other similar products I have tried either ( Talon rubber , Agrip , Pachymayr grip glove ) .	-1
The description states that this dual pack is 1000 mL . Do not be fooled , these are two 8 oz cans which totals 473 mL . When I contacted the seller they said there is 1000 mL of gas but the net weight is 16 oz . Well , the can says contains 8 ounces . To me , that 's volume . If it was weight it would say net weight ( As the seller indicated they did in their e-mailed response ) .	-1
PRO : The gun looks good on the outside , and it will shoot ( sometimes ) either pellets of all types , and BB 's . It will not shoot darts.CON : I have not yet been able to load a CO2 cylinder without half the pressure escaping . I think the puncture pin is out of alignment . The rotating magazine sticks about every other trigger pull and all that comes out of the barrel is gas . When you press the release mechanism to flip up the magazine cover , the magazine and all your ammo flies out of the breech like an expended shell casing and you have to go looking for it.If you want something for display or to wear on your belt when you go to the grocery , the Gamo PT-80 is a good choice . If you want something to target shoot or plink with , I suggest you get something else .	-1
folks yes it looks great ! all else stops there . This company will toss you aside once the gun is paid for .	-1
Pros : Very accurate right out of the box at 30 feetGood for plinking.Con : CO2 cannister hard to install . Turnkey is located inside bottom of grip , allowing tightening only with fingertips and allowing 1/2 turn each , at the most . Thus causing a considerate amount of air loss before the cannister is properly seated.Power of shots are inconsistent and degrades rapidly after the first few rounds.Wothless for varmits .	-1
This product sort of works especially if you use it daily . But the bags come back so I spray again the next day . No I wo n't be buying this product again nor would I recommend it .	-1
Sprayed this garbage on my romaine . Just as the instructions say . Two days later , with no rain , the leaves where chewed half off . The thing is I never had a problem with bugs until I used this crap . Do n't buy ! Nothing to do with Amazon !	-1
Did not like the scope , tried zeroing a 223 at 50 yards and had difficulity see where the rounds punctured the target	-1
This is the best bench rest I 've used so far this year . too bad it does n't come with a rear bag .	-1
I bought this to check my recent installation of a Nikon scope . It worked well the first time I used it . The next time I used it was 3 months later because the nikon on my .300WinMag shifted due to recoil . It worked well for that job too . When predator 'season ' was getting close I wanted to check my gear before wasting a morning with un-level sights . The plastic on the bottom of the units was begining to warp ! Neither unit would read level even on a surface that was proven to be so by my larger levels . I expected a piece of gear that would last through more than 4-5 months .	-1
I purchased this after reading the reviews on this sight . It was n't what I expected when I opened it . The first thing I noticed was the magnet had very little power if any at all . It would not stick to my rifles . If I wanted one to hold , I already had levels that were small enough to hold by hand . It was very cheaply made , had some sort of black stuff inside the bubble case.I returned it and ordered a Laserlyte level that fits on my laser bore sight . I hope it works , as this product would not . I tried it on the chamber and on top of the scope neither one had enough magnetism to stay in place . I tried on several firearms before I gave up.Maybe I just received a bad unit ?	-1
If you are hunting big game inside of 150 yards as the max you 'll ever shoot , these will do fine . At least the set I got will . But the plastic base on the flat level is NOT true and the race mount does not reliably fit the action without a true level to co-witness as a baseline . Therefore , past 200 yards , you are likely to see serious diagonal drift of point-of-impact relative to point-of-aim . Get the wheeler professional levels with the barrel clamps instead . This is definitely a case where the extra money is worth it .	-1
Very disappointed with this product compared to their other products , if I was the owner of this company I would n't spend any money on the patent . It does n't fit flush so you have the guess what the correct level is . No thanks , do n't trust this for your rifle .	-1
I found the magnets fairly week and this just did n't work well with any of my rifles . I should have spend a little more money .	-1
Basically the levels showed different & # 34 ; levels & # 34 ; when put on the same surface . Also rotating the levels 180 degrees caused them to show drastically different reading . Would not recommend , would not buy again .	-1
This was a nice scooter that my 6 year old enjoyed ... until it broke a few months later.There 's a reason it only has a 90 day warranty.I would not recommend it due to reliability issues . Other reviews also mention this.It 's too bad too ... otherwise it would have been a 4 or 5 star scooter .	-1
Had this for about a week before it just stopped working.It 's an ok scooter , it feels flimsy but for a younger child that is about 100lbs or less it 's probably fine . I rode this all of about 5 times and on the last time riding it going up a slight hill it just stopped working . Figured it was the batteries but it was n't charged and nothing at all as far as response . I just returned it because trying to get this fixed would be more than what the thing costs ... Speed is ok on this , not too fast but it 's not a snails pace like some of the lower priced scooters are . Not really much torque on this thing ... My advice spend the extra money and get a better quality scooter . I have the super elite 800 and it 's leaps and bounds above this . Next time I will learn not to go cheap on stuff , because it 's just that . Cheap .	-1
In my opinion , they are too heavy . I have to throw them almost as hard as I can for them to stick into the board . Usually they stick into trees easily , but not always . Also , the rotation is different from my other throwing knives . I have to stand in a different spot and almost chuck them at the board and still , they fall out a lot .	-1
It 's a cheap knife . but if you did n't know that from the price than you do n't care anyway : P lol . I bought it as part of a gag gift survival kit . It did it 's job . more of a stage prop than a knife ...	-1
It 's no where compared to the high quality knives like kabar , it has a extremely dull blade and I sharpened it . Good to show but not on field .	-1
The paint is chipped on the handle , which is the cheapest piece of plastic I have ever handled , and it 's all scratched up and even bubbles in the paint ! It 's a shame , the actual blade is beautiful . It was super shiny and sturdy.But the handle was SOOO bad I had to return it . if I had any type of skill , I would love to create a pearl or wood or ivory and replace the plastic .	-1
I purchased this expressly to polish the tarnished aluminum pedestal legs on a Herman-Miller Aeron chair . In short , it did n't work . I scrubbed a single leg for about 5 minutes , and after all that , it was still pretty much the same . And the cloth was solid black . In defense of the cloth , the areas that were n't tarnished beforehand did look better -- the gleam was back.So , in my experience , the cloth does n't work well on aluminum tarnish , but it does restore luster to untarnished aluminum . Unfortunately that is n't what I need , so the cloth went back . I did not try the cloth on any other metals , so I ca n't comment on its general effectiveness .	-1
Looks pretty but the construction/design and quality are questionable . After getting the axe , I was concerned that the poor design would allow for the axe blade to fly off if the thin plastic 'holder ' cracked . I researched the axe further and found some REI reviews that confirm that the design is flawed and that it breaks easily . I 'll just need to be cautious of people around when chopping wood so that when it does fly off , no one gets hurt . Not the quality I expected from Gerber ... .especially for the price .	-1
As an avid outdoorsman I ca n't endorse this product because it does n't satisfy my main criteria : Would you stake your life on this ? NO ! I really do n't like plastic . I do n't like the blade , the handle , the `` saw '' or the sheath . This is another case of `` I used to like this vendor '' .The saw is a big serrated knife and is almost useless fo cutting wood thicker than your thumb . A collapsible camp saw is infinately better and can cut logs . There 's no way I would carry this in my pack because it 's not worth the weight . It 's going into the car trunk for good .	-1
I ordered this hoping that it would be perfect for preparing deadfall wood for the fire at camp sites , but as soon as it arrived , it was clear that Gerber made this item look better than it will perform . The saw-in-handle design sounds great , but compromises the structural integrity of the handle . When chopping , you can imagine that the force is not all in one direction on the handle- it surges through the handle in multiple directions , including twisting . A hollow handle wo n't hold up long under these forces , and with a plastic material , catastrophic failure is possible.Secondly , the saw is a glorified steak knife . It wo n't handle anything that your multi-tool 's little saw ca n't handle . I returned it and am replacing it with the 16-inch Estwing camp axe and a separate `` Sawvivor '' collapsible hacksaw . More expensive , but both get top reviews and will survive for years .	-1
I really like Gerber products but this one took me by surprise . First thing I noticed was that the axe was dull as dull could be . Then I put the saw in the handle and it was loose , I fear one attempt at chopping would send it flying out of place . It is only held in by one magnet . The sheath seemed ok , but the overall distribution of weight was way off too . The handle is plastic and not high quality at all . Again I 'm a Gerber fan but I am surprised at how cheaply this is made . It is cute but as far a functional , I do n't trust it . I certainly did n't anticipate a dull axe and cheap plastic . I 'll be sending this back as the handle just now feel out when I carried it thru the house . Glad I had shoes on.I do n't recommend the product at all .	-1
Purchased this , thinking that online products would be better than my local bike store ... I was wrong..better of buying from my bike store and I did n't have to wait almost a week for it to arrived..next time , I 'll just drive to my local shop .	-1
expected something more usable and subtle but this thing is stamp steel , HEAVY , and bulky . not a fan of it at all , sent it back .	-1
do n't belive everything you read , I 'll stick to other lubes from now . There is no substitiute for getting hands dirty .	-1
I purchased two of these cages for my father 's bike . He used them and loved them since he got them , but during a ride ( we were together ) just 7 months later , one of his cages came apart at the mounting bracket welds . He was left with a bottle and half of the cage in his hand . The mounting bracket was still mounted to the bike . We pitched the cage and he put the bottle in his back jersey pocket for the rest of the 50 miles , but what a bummer this was . This cage saw light use , too , as he rides a couple of times a week . These cages did n't even get as much use as some on my bike would . Moral of the story , for $ 7 bucks a piece , buy something that is going to last instead of this . You can find full carbon bottle cages on ebay for 20-25 shipped for the pair and they will last a lot longer than these will .	-1
I ran this tire about 200 miles on the road and another 100 on gravel , cross-country and technical singletrack trails . I never used it in mud , which might be the best environment for this tire.The main problem is the tread is very pliable . It is n't firm at all , and this leads to squirm that you can really feel on roads and hard-packed gravel . I had very little cornering confidence . Even pumped up to max pressure , which usually is not necessary or a good idea , they rolled slowly.Poor puncture resistance -- if you run over a goathead thorn , you 're going to get a flat . ( I resolved this by installingMr . Tuffy Bicycle Tire Linerwhich I highly recommend for everyone . ) You ca n't get hardly any other tires at this price , but I could n't live with the performance and removed them . I 'm now far happier withSchwalbe Smart Sam HS 367 Performance Cross/Hybrid Bicycle Tire - Wire Bead .	-1
Like other reviews say , this tire is not made for standard 20 inch rims . I returned mine based on this .	-1
I can not judge properly . When put on Shimano Dura-Ace ; recommended , it slipped on almost every gear ; wildly . I had to remove instantly . Replaced with Shimano CN-HG73-LX 9-speed Chain.Worked instantly.Be aware , use with products you 'trust . ' It 's an expensive failure if it does . New cassettes , old ; does n't matter . Slippage everyone of them.Do n't trust .	-1
lousy workmanship the rubber is very easy brakeable does not fit the messurements that it is listed for , rubber very briddle !	-1
This broke before I had even finished installing it . It will not last ( did n't even last five minutes with me ) . You 're much better off with a more expensive alternative .	-1
Was very disappointed in Park Tools . Not their normal standard of quality . It 's cheap , stamped , unfinished soft steel you 'd expect from harbor Freight . Need I say more ...	-1
This product is ok for downtubes on bikes that are not wide like all of my carbon road bikes . This product should be sold with warnings that it is a problem fit for most modern road bikes , especially SWorks . My purchase is in the trash ... ..	-1
I tried this several times and I 've never worn out chains faster . This lube resembles the Teflon sprays you 'll find at any bike or hardware store . It 's a very light solvent , a tiny amount of heavy grease ( silicone ? ) , and Teflon powder . While it does lubricate very well , it also attracts sand and road dirt . After 500 miles the chain is worn out and there is a tar-like buildup everywhere along the chain path . Get this into ceramic derailleur bearings and they 'll become jammed with teflon powder .	-1
Sucks . It looks like the liner folded over and cut into the tube . The liner needs some thing to hold it in place .	-1
The plastic these tire liners are made from is too soft to keep a thorn out . Tried it with black berry and rose thorns from my yard and easily pushed them right through . I have a set of older Mr. Tuffy liners that resist these thorns but I wanted a wider one for the tires on my bike . These new ones are useless.NOT RECOMMENDED	-1
My husband bought this seat , and here is his review : I put on this seat as a replacement for the stock seat on my bike . I realized at first it had less padding and was right on my sit bones , exactly what I was looking for . However , something about the seat design caused the bottom of my legs to hurt . And they hurt for a week . Somehow this seat gave me a horrible saddle sore . I thought about trying to toughen up , but decided this seat was not worth it . I switched back to my stock saddle without ever trying this one again .	-1
I honestly can not believe how ANYone could say all the glowing things I read in here -- `` the most comfortable seat I 've ever owned ... '' blah blah blah . Wow are you crazy ? This thing is HARD as a rock . It has NO suspension , so you feel every bump . It is WAY too narrow -- about 6.5 '' wide at most . It is a torture device . The Amazon reviews REALLY led me wrong in this case ... .I am 5 '' 11 '' , athletic build , 195 # , 34 '' waist . I do not have an extra wide butt by any means . Yet this thing is so narrow that it usually rides BETWEEN my ischial tuberosities -- - MOST uncomfortable . With a ride 1.25 miles to work , I am in some pretty serious discomfort . Previously with the stock seat that came on my Raleigh hybrid , I could ride 16 miles before getting mild discomfort.I stuck it out and rode with this thing for 3 weeks , but finally I just had to ditch it and go back to my stock seat . Previously I 'd used a Cloud-9 seat and thought that was great , so I 'm going to get an upgraded one they call `` Extra Deep Relief Bicycle seat '' . I 'd highly recommend the brand to people interested in comfort.This planet bike seat LOOKS great - if that 's important to you . It DOES unload the pressure to your perineum - by sacrificing your BUTT . So your junk still works , but you ca n't walk far enough to get to the bedroom to use your junk anyway.This seat might be ok for a racer who is not putting ANY weight on the seat - pretty much riding with 90 % of his weight on the pedals and wrists . But if you 're looking for true comfort on a cruiser or hybrid bike , look elsewhere.Pros : price $ 20 , styling , looks , relief to perineum , installation , lightweight.Cons : PAINFUL TO SIT ON ! ! ! So nothing else matters .	-1
I bought this seat to replace a stock seat that seemed too hard . This seat is very well made , and when you feel it with your hands , is firm but cushioned . However , it did n't feel any better than the stock seat when actually riding a bike . It provides no noticeable cushioning . I wo n't return it because maybe I was expecting too much . I wonder if anybody ever actually uses these seats at the manufacturer before they sell one ... .	-1
My roommate ordered this seat from Amazon on my recommendation , based on the good write-ups it 's gotten here.She tried it and did n't care for it , so I offered to swap seats with her and keep it if I like it.Well after a five-hour ride ( and I do a LOT of long rides ) I have to say , this thing is coming off the bike ASAP . While there was some improvement in chafing when the seat post is set high , sitting on this thing is PAINFUL compared to my trusty Bell memory-foam seat . It made for a truly miserable bike ride.Sure , it may be a SLIGHT improvement over the original equipment seats designed by bike manufacturers that feel like you 're sitting on a cement brick , but this IS IN NO WAY one of the more comfortable seats in the market.And if you 're as disappointed in it as we were , you should know that should you decide to return the thing , you 'll be out not only shipping but also a 20 % restocking fee.Save your money and look elsewhere .	-1
This might be my mistake . Thought these would be good for my MTB cables , but they are way too large in diameter . I used one anyway but it 's obviously to big and does n't look right .	-1
These really did n't fit very well , but they did last long enough to give my grandson enough time to get is courage up to learn to ride a bicycle . They came off in about a week and ended up in the trash .	-1
We had moisture in the tent and they are also smaller than it says on the package - need to field test again - they are more compact and and lighter than a poly tarp	-1
the product works well enough its just very big . I ordered two but the company only sent me one . Weeks later i did get the refund from Amazon . Amazon rocks , proheat reusable hand warmer , not so much .	-1
Only provides heat for 45 minutes . A hassle to reset ( heat in pot on stove ) . It does provide a lot of heat quickly .	-1
Nothing wrong with the pillow but was expecting something better for the price . Great marketing though , convincing enough for me to spend twice what the pillow is worth .	-1
I have really wide feet.. I bought these socks for the gym . After wearing for a few hours took my shoes off I saw my big toe through a hole in the seem of the sock . Do yourself a favor get a better quality brand .	-1
I reviewed another type of Hanes socks ( B002WTC6BIand those were much better . These socks just do n't fit well and do n't conform to my feet . It kind of feels like they are not shaped properly and the material does n't have enough stretch / elastic .	-1
Just got this knife today from Sportsman 's Guide . Nice leather sheath . The materials used in the knife appeared to be of very good quality , but the workmanship was horrible . The rivets used to attach the stag handle to the knife were uneven and poorly finished . The middle rivet on the knife I received was sticking out close to 1/8th of and inch and was sharp around the edge . I actually got a small cut on my hand from it while inspecting the knife . If this is `` German craftmanship '' you can have it . Maybe the Germans should just make the components and have them assembled in China . Whoops , looks like Puma beat me to the punch and are now doing just that with at least some of their knives ! Probably will wind up with a better knife than the ones assembled Germany at present . Very disappointing what has happened to what used to be a top of the line brand .	-1
The bokken itself ( wood parts ) are decent with few blemishes and no cracks or major chips . Everything else that goes onto the bokken is terrible.First , the tsuba was a light caramel color , not a dark color ( almost black ) as indicated in the pictures . The slot on the tsuba is cut completely arbitrarily , such that the hole in no way matches the cross section of the bokken . The hole is too big , wrongly shaped , and hence will slide and rattle . The little white rubber/plastic piece that is supposed to fit above the tsuba is oversized , and does nothing to hold the tsuba in place . It is like a big loose piece of rubber , way too big for the bokken and tsuba.Second , the handle lacing/wrapping , as mentioned by countless reviewers , is a completely shoddy job at best . As is , it will be sliding all over the place and come undone . Essentially , there are just two thin pieces of DOUBLE SIDED TAPE , not the good mounting tape type or anything , just the lowest , crappiest , generic thin as heck type double sided tape , that runs along both sides of the handle . That is what is supposed to hold the lacing in place . The lacing itself , is NOT a soft high friction material meant to improve grip . It is actually a hard , textured , synthetic flat shoelace type material , such that it actually REDUCES friction and contact with the already smooth handle . This is why it slides all over the place . With that material on , it actually reduces the bokken handling and feel.I took all that stuff off , and basically now have the bokken bare , and it feels much better . So essentially , you 're better off getting either some real grip tape that people use for tennis rackets or skate boards , or just straight up buy a regular bare bokken . Do n't be enticed by the additional tsuba and handle wrapping on this one , because it is essentially useless .	-1
Of course I got the girly purple color . this is stiff material , I was looking to hold rain gear in it on hikes , but perhaps a bag for the beach ( that my wife can carry ) is a better use .	-1
I bought two of these so I could use my existing air-pump on my new bike , but after lots of jiggling and cussing about it I could n't get them to make a good enough seal to get the tires to more than half pressure . They are tiny enough that I may keep one in my saddle bag in case I have to half-air a tire with the wrong kind of pump , but I hope I never need to use it .	-1
For some reason , it was n't big enough to fit my pumps . Better luck for anyone else to try it . It is good quality though .	-1
These were way to small . They tend to lean toward a smaller person even tho I ordered the largest size they had . If ordering , I would go up one size .	-1
Contrary to what is indicated , this grip model CAN NOT be used on solid-shaft paddles ! Also , if you have a small hand size or use a Werner small-shaft diameter paddle , you may find the grip cushion is too thick to get a good grip on your paddle .	-1
The grips are a bear to get on [ follow the instructions - use water ! ! ] But once on , they did slip during use . Not a useful item - preferred using gloves .	-1
If you have a 9.5 to 10.5 you may find these very large and they slip and slide around . I used injinji liners and never had an issue with other models but this one caused problems . I am a 9 & 1/2 and followed instruction for sizing on Wigwams page and REI and should have gone with the smaller size . These are getting returned !	-1
I compared this overshoe with the Totes Geometric Loafer , and after trying both on , bought the Totes instead . Here is why:1 . It is not that easy to tell from the pictures , but the Totes looks better and is more stylish than this product.2 . If you choose the proper Totes size , the overshoe fits like a glove and nicely blends in with your dress shoe . By contrast , the Tingley overshoe fits more loosely and gives more of the appearance that you are wearing a rubber overshoe . It has a & # 34 ; sloppy & # 34 ; feel and look rather than the sleek and snug fit of the Totes.Bottom line : This will work , but the Totes is more stylish .	-1
It 's way too small - not 7 ' wide as was listed.It stretches way toooooo much . My el cheapo walmart hamock does n't stretch like this thing . I have it piano wire tight at waist height before I get in it . Get in it and it drops to within 6 inches of the ground . Junk ! Returned it .	-1
Thule made an all metal earlier version of this rack that had 2 pull-levers that folded down : 1 ) the bike rack , and 2 ) tilted the swing arm to access the trunk . This & # 34 ; modern & # 34 ; version did away with 1 ) the bike rack folding option . Now it 's screwed together permanently . And 2 ) instead of a lever to tilt the swing arm it has a cotter pin you have to reach down and pull out . In my opinion they had a great engineered design to begin with ... but then went back to the dark ages on this one . I sent this primitive design back .	-1

This is a 5 star product that gets one star for irresponsible marketing . It is highly effective primarily due to the extraordinary resin content . That is also the issue . Do not let younger campers use this product unsupervised . The occasional 'popping ' of the resins sends small , extremely hot , burning particles flying in all directions . This can ignite clothing as well as cause burnt flesh . Second note : The smoke is extremely sooty and the burnt remnant is sticky . This item should only be used to activate a normal tinder pile in a fire pit . I do not recommend using this in a pack-stove unless you enjoy hours of scrubbing.Why 5 stars ? ... I build reverse fire stacks ( larger wood on the bottom , smallest on top ) .I cut these sticks on a radial-arm saw before my trip . Half length approximately 4 inchs long . Cut down I am able to carry a large quantity in a zip-loc bag.I also use a box cutter to create a bag of shavings . ( I do not use any of my knives as the resin would 'gum ' them-up ) .I place one of the 4 inch sticks on top of a few shavings on the TOP of the wood stack . It ignites immediately , no coaxing required . Burns hot and fast . As it ignites the kindling below , you end-up with an extremely gratifying camp fire .	-1
when i brought this i thought it was really big and silly looking i mean it was cool the see the original needle move up when i sped up but it arrived damaged . the numbers that are suppose to move didnt ihad to take it apart to fix the inside piece that came loose . then after i got it to work it just didnt work properly . i ended up taking it off my bike and trashing this i really didnt like it and it looked stupid on my bike .	-1
This product came by itself without an instruction manual on how to install it . This is especially crazy since this item needs to be connected to the front wheel of a bicycle and has the potential to cause great bodily harm if connected improperly . Would still consider buying this product if you could insure that it came with detailed instructions on the proper way to install it . I have a bicycle that is motorized and can not take the chance that the wiring will get caught in the spokes causing a crash .	-1
Got this speedo for my Diamondback Wildwood Citi and after checking if against a GPS and car it reads 20mph and my real speed was 13.5mph thats 6.5mph faster then I was going . Furthermore after riding 12 miles ( miles confirmed with car and moped ) the odometer showed 1 mile more then the real distance . Also there is no way to correct this other then removing the speedometer and getting another type . I am sure that it 's ONLY made for a 27 '' bike not a 26 '' ( 80 '' per wheel rev . ) and for the price I didnt expect perfection but 6.5mph off is really bad.I think this would be a good speedometer for a child as it 's more Toy then real speedometer.thats my $ 0.02 worth	-1
I couldnt use this well . I couldnt cast this without it tangling and casuing a bundle of line . The reel seemed durable and well built , but I just did not have the patience to figure out how to cast this thing without it tangling .	-1

Much like most things from teeter these are well made ; however , I can not say they are comfortable . They put very uneven pressure on your foot/ankle and the calf band is useless . My recommendation is to get the best Teeter unit and you 'll get the best support and most comfort without having to have these boots .	-1
I do n't think this thing is doing anything for me -- - probably mostly placebo effect unfortunately -- EXPENSIVE and takes up a ton of room	-1
OK ... it 's better than a lot out there on the market . But , it still does n't stack up to what I usually install on the older road bikes I refurbish & sell . What I usually buy is an Avenir Groove Dual Saddle . I bought one of these at my local K-Mart to save a couple of bucks . I wish I would 've spent the few extra bucks for the Avenir Saddle . Bottom line ... it 's OK , but not great.Avenir Groove Dual Saddle ( Black/Grey , Groove Dual ( M ) ) Avenir Groove Dual Saddle ( Black/Grey , Groove Dual ( W ) )	-1
This CC has some nice features for the price ( backlight , temperature ) but is has some unaccepable flaws . My copy had a dead spot between 7 and 8 km/h and it the readout would be 0 , stopping the distance meter and the rolling time meter . This would mess up any measurement where you would travel at these speeds , which are quite common for me on some steep and prolonged climbs . The other unacceptable flaw was the flimsy mounting system . The CC was constantly falling off on small jumps and when I went though rough terrain , until one day , it fell never to be found again . I since ordered a bell CC which is less than 10 bucks , it has always given me very accurate readouts with no dead spots and has never budged from its mount , which is very similar in principle to the schwinn mount . If your are looking for a cheap and reliable CC , buy the bell CC for less than 10 bucks instead .	-1
I was very excited to get this unit , but I did not even get the chance to use it since the magnet could not be installed on the wheel . I 've called Schwinn in hope to get the part , but they asked me to ship the unit back , so I have decided to return it directly to amazon . I 'm sure it 's a good product , but I could n't use it , hence the review.I bought another one , so I shall leave a feedback for the other product . : P	-1
I could not figure this out . I could n't get it to work . I still have it in a bag because I ca n't bring myself to throw it in the trash . It 's horrible to try to change the info on the screen . I just ca n't work it at all , and I 'm a computer professional . And , I never could get it hooked up to the bike . I give up on this . I say just use your phone app , it 's a whole lot easier .	-1
Have never used it , was n't willing to 'wire up ' my bike to use it . Bad purchuse I should have thought it through first .	-1
I would have liked to have and use this . Unfortunately , it 's so cheaply made that it would n't work when I took it out of the box .	-1
Not a very stable mounting system for the magnetic pick up . As a result the mag pick up spins on the spoke . I would look at other products .	-1
The unit came with instructions in several languages , including English . But important details were very poorly documented . Unlike some people I actually do read the manual most of the time , and I read this one carefully . It just is n't very helpful . It is unclear as to how exactly to mount the magnet on the spokes . I figured out how to do it , but there are different ways that I could have done it , which would have been wrong.Once I got it installed , trying to decipher the instructions on how to make set it up was another challenge . I 'm fairly good at stuff like this , and it took me 20 minutes to figure out how to set the clock , for example . If I had to change it , I would n't be able to do it again . And what if I lose the manual ? On the road , the sensor evidently did not detect the magnet . The instructions said it must pass within 5 mm of the sensor . I kept moving it closer until it was almost touching , but still no reading on the screen . It would show the temperature and the clock was advancing ( so yes , I did put the battery in ! ) . But it kept showing 0 for everything else , and after 5 minutes , would turn off due to not detecting any activity . I checked and adjusted and re-read the instructions repeatedly . I even tried installing the magnet backwards , thinking maybe I had n't installed it the correct way after all , but that did n't help . Put the magnet back like it belongs , and fiddled some more . No luck . Maybe I got a defective one.The sensor and mounting bracket for the display are both affixed with provided zip ties , which I could never get tight enough to make me feel confident , and it gives the whole installation a home built appearance . I 'm disappointed , because I really wanted to like it . I 'm a fan of Schwinn bikes , but this thing does n't make it for me at all . Back it goes .	-1
My son was so excited when he got this but then he could't get it to work and could not find a place that sold batteries like this one . If he could get it to work , he probably would like it .	-1

Upset I could n't install the seat on my 70 's Schwinn coffee bike . Im sure its comfortable . ended up buying a gel seat cover for $ 22 at bike store .	-1
I bought this item not too long ago & had to bring it back before a week was up.. The seat is springy but that is all . I do n't believe there is any cushioning foam in it 's interior & It 's VERY HARD for the underside . I 'll admit I 'm older & a bit heavier now than when I was younger but They Just Do n't Make Bicycle Seats Like They Use To..So You Have To Find 1 That Will Be Comfortable.. It 's Quite a Racket ( IMO ) DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS Model Though.. It 's Not Worth the hassle of buying & then having to return it .	-1
Let me start by saying bike seat comfort is very subjective and personal . Even so , I ca n't find any way to like this seat ! It sure looks like it should be comfortable , but no matter what angle I placed the thing , I could never get the padding to respond and conform to my buttocks ! After several days of sliding off and constant repositioning , I returned this and purchased a Nishiki Adult Sport Bike Seat and it is SO much more comfortable ( not available on Amazon , but it is from Dick 's Sporting Goods ) .I give this one star for my body build , at 6 ' 2 & # 34 ; and under 165lb . Perhaps this seat is designed for those a bit heavier than I ?	-1
The seat is well built . I like it 's design . I got it like everyone does , trying to find a comfortable seat . I have not butt per say , so God did n't give me my own cushion . I need a seat that has cushion . This seat , as I had read on other reviews , is hard . So the fact that Schwinn even dares call this a & # 34 ; pillow top & # 34 ; is frankly ... a lie . In fact I think it is more like a & # 34 ; brick top & # 34 ; than a pillow top . If it were a truly a pillow top , I would n't have returned it and got the Sunlite Cloud 9 which is by far more pillowie than this Schwinn seat . Like I said , not a hater on this seat , but do n't like the false advertisement by the name . Schwinn , please name your seats honestly ! ... ... fyi-writen by a life long Schwinn fan .	-1
ok.. I am coming from a hard tail seat which on my mountain bike ... . and it was slick and easy to slid in and out of.This has some nice padding ... but not as good as I would have thought it would be . It was still hard in the tail when riding.ok here is why I rated it LOW : The material makes your pants/shorts grab when you push back into the seat . It is NOT sleek like most seats . For that it is coming off right away !	-1
Used on bicycle saddle for about 2 mos & a spinner for 6 mos or so ; noticed that the top gel layer ripped under the lycra cover , not cool . I contacted Schwinn & they replied that the warranty is 90 days but if I would like to I could send it to them & they `` would be happy to complete an inspection for possible replacement '' . Had n't decided if the shipping cost would be worth it !	-1
I even tried both a straight seat post and a leaned back seat post . This thing is just too big for my legs to peddle at all . I 'm a big person ( not in weight , but in size ) and I do n't think I have ever had a problem with something being too big.To give more detail , I have to slide forward on it to actually make it so my legs can bend .	-1
I bought this seat at Wal-Mart to save the return shipping if it did n't workout . Glad I did in this case.Other reviewers were correct when they said that this seat hits the back of your thighs when you peddle . If you did n't have to peddle it might be OK , but peddling is the whole idea of bike riding . The whole feel of this seat is more suited to roasting weenies by the fire , not riding a bike.Whether or not this seat would solve my soreness problem from my conventional seat is irrelevant . All the new issues resulting from this seat are worse . I could n't ride 5 miles on this seat ( much less 20 or 50 ) , to find out if I would get sore in the other places.Maybe if you ride with your seat very low with no leg extension to speak of , it might work out for you . But as for me , I like getting near full leg extension for increased power and endurance.Again , as others have pointed out , this seat is positioned too far forward putting your body over top of the pedals and too close to the handlebars making for a very awkward feel . There is no way to position the seat further back ( like 2 or 3 inches is what it would need ) .Unfortunately , I 'm still looking for a comfortable seat , and I 'm getting old fast ( 58 ) . Every hour I spend trying another one is another hour wasted . Who would have thought that the most difficult part of a bicycle to get right is the seat ? And reviews do n't help much either because every seat I 've looked at has a mixed bag of positive and negative reviews . You just about have to try them out for yourself.In any regard , this is definitely not the seat for me ! The search goes on ...	-1
Albeit the saddle looks like it will actually `` take the pressure off , '' it the Schwinn No Presser Bike Seat introduces other problems . Although the problems is not a male health concern , it interferes with normal biking . While pedaling , our thighs are continuously angling up and down as we pedal . The conventional seats allow this type of movement with little obstruction . With the `` no pressure '' seat , it either forces us to sit further forward or deal with the front lip under our thighs . Seating further forward will take us away from the comfortable sweet spot almost to where it feels as though we 'll be slipping off.The best remedy I have found in a comfortable bike seat must fit three criterion . A firm seat ( gel pad consistency ) , an open groove for the offending area and the ability to adjust the seat to angle a bit more downwards . I have yet to find something more suitable .	-1
When purchasing an exercise bike I had read a review where someone recommended this seat . I ordered it along with the exercise bike only to find out that the seat is not removeable on the exercise bike . So I decided to try this on my regular bicycle.It was easy to install and looked really comfy . I really wanted to like this seat and left it on my bike for a couple of weeks . Everytime I went to ride my bike I was miserable . My husband tried adjusting it and it just did not work for me . First , if you have ridden a bike for fifty years you get use to how a seat should feel . This is totally different and I was accepting of that fact . The seat is very slick and I felt I was constantly fighting it to stay on . Also , it is flat across the front and tilts down and you also feel like to you are falling forward and about to slide down . On each bike ride I felt like I was fighting to stay on my bike . I can not express how uncomfortable this seat was for me . My husband tried adjusting it several times and there simply is no adjustment for the downward tilt . There is nothing about the seat that helps you stay on like a conventional seat . I simply would never recommend this to anyone as I feel it is not safe . I have since replaced my regular bike seat with a gel seat which I prefer and is very comfortable .	-1
Tried several adjustments , just could n't make it work for me . It seemed that I was always slipping off the seat or sitting right on the edge of it . I ride my bicycle for exercise , but after riding my usual route with this twice , I was so exhausted and sore , I could n't do it anymore . Although I could feel it in my arms , I really felt it in my upper legs . I guess you have to pick your discomfort in cycling .	-1
I put this on my bike and it fell apart a week later . Apparently the chinese that made it had no idea what they were doing and just slapped it together and made it look good . I had to go find new bolts to attach the seat to the frame since the ones the chinese put in fell out likely on the first or second time I rode the bike .	-1
I 'm 6'6 and 260 pounds . My sit bones are between 155mm and 160mm apart . My wife is 6'0 and 135 pounds , and probably is slightly wider , but not by much.This saddle does not in any way fit either of our rear ends . Basically , if you have a narrow rump , this might be comfy for you . The edges curve up too much.If you have a wider rump , then I found some of the 10-11 '' spring loaded seats worked better , though beware of the Schwinn one with exposed springs . The left one unscrews .	-1
I bought this saddle because I sometimes wear skirts while biking , and normal saddles can ruin skirts . This saddle is way too big for me , and I could n't get it in the right position , it always seemed to hang either forward or too much to the back . Returned the item .	-1
I am , let 's say , voluptuous . I bought this to replace the current seat on my Schwinn stationary bike . First of all , if ONE of your buttcheeks is only 4 inches wide , it may work for you . Most people have a buttcheek larger than that , so the design that sticks up in the back will do nothing but dig into your rear the entire time you 're pedaling . No adjustment of the seat I found relieved this pain . My boyfriend ( who has no butt at all ) even found it very uncomfortable.The front edge of the seat dug into the back of my thighs where the cheeks join the leg , but that was n't make-or-break for me . It was just more uncomfortable than anything.This seat will definitely put more weight onto your arms , and after one ride it became apparent to me that I just ca n't do that on a daily basis . It was too tiring for me.I 'm returning and will try out more seats .	-1
I had just bought a new bike . The usual `` penal numbness '' from the saddle . All the other `` anatomically correct '' saddles that I saw on the market ( lots of them ) were way too expensive . This `` No Pressure '' seat was within my budget . Quick , easy sale ; quick , easy delivery . Schwinn was partially correct , there is no numbness , HOWEVER , at least in my case , my thighs kept rubbing against the saddle . After trying a variety of saddle-to-post adjustments , I finally put the original saddle back on , got out my trusty penknife and cut the padding out of the horn . This home made remedy did the trick .	-1
Let me begin by describing my bike . I have a Trek 820 Hard Tail Mountain Bike . The frame is 19.5 '' tall and this is just right for someone about 5'10 '' .First , installation ... the included brackets do not match my Trek 820 , so I had to screw loose my original seat post and more it over to the new Schwinn seat . Installation notes below:1 ) My original seat post does not allow tilt adjustment , so I am not able to `` tilt '' the seat forward unless I buy a new seat post.2 ) The seat is significantly higher . So , my Trek 820 , which was fitted for my height , suddenly became too tall . What I had to do was to lower the seat to the very bottom - that helped , but that meant I no longer can attach a rear reflector nor the mud flap.3 ) The seat is wider and I know that when I pedal , I am causing pressure on the seat post.During my first ride around the neighborhood for about 6 miles ( 25 minutes ) , I noticed the following:1 ) I am not able to push as hard on the pedals due to the angle limited by the seat.2 ) I had to shift my butt a few times during the ride . It is like sitting on a hard plastic chair.3 ) Although there were no pressure in the groin area , but the back of my thigh were pressed against the seat while pedaling . I wonder if there would be long term effects from this type of pressure similar to the groin area.I will give it a try some more ( and read more reviews ) then come back and continue commenting . *** OK , I am back . I returned this seat because it was too thick and I ma not able to sit on it and reach the ground comfortably - this is a safety problem . I go the Bell Mountain Bike Saddle instead - that worked much better and is cheaper . No more numbness between my legs ( stock seat ) or behind my thigh ( Schwinn No Pressure Seat ) . I think this seat would be great for recumbent bikes though .	-1
Think of this seat as a non-ergonomic bicycle bench . I tried every variation of adjustment that could be imagined , but with no luck . The seat does alleviate the pain for the intended area , but creates a rubbing on the back of the legs that is intolerable .	-1
Well , this seat design *does* relieve the pressure on your important plumbing , however , I found it incredibly uncomfortable to ride with . You lose a lot of control , and the pedaling geometry is just wrong . Because optimal cycling position ( for power transfer ) has your legs almost fully extended , this means you have to sit on the very edge of this seat , putting almost all of your weight on your arms . I find this to be a suboptimal solution for someone who wants to ride hard and also be safe . Hopefully there is another seat on the market that does a better job . I will keep looking ...	-1
Way smaller than it looks in pics , not comfortable or cusioned , save your money or try one of those cloud nine seats better than this one .	-1
Got 'em , placed batteries in 'em , ALL 3 failed within seconds of first use . It was n't the batteries , I tried replacing 'em , still did not work . The handles broke almost instantly . Also , they are NOT LED 's . Did n't pay a lot , but still may return them . Do n't waste your money . I 've contacted the seller , and guess what , no reply . Did n't really expect a reply anyway .	-1
These are cheap little lanterns , that , while appealing to ones frugal sensibilities , really should not be purchased . Why , becausethey , like all the other poorly designed and cheaply constructed products flooding out of China , will end up broken and in a landfill in way too short a time . A total waste of resources and energy ( and your money really ) . I would recommend that instead of buying 3 crummy little disposable lanterns , pay a bit more and buy one or two good ones that will actually last a long time . Really , its better for the environment . We need to get away from buying throw away products like these , it 's not sustainable . My 2 cents . Thank you . ( PS : China can also make very high quality products , so I am in not disparaging their manufacturing . They make whatever there is demand for . So if there is demand for quality products that last , you can bet that is what they will be making . )	-1
This set of three lanterns were purchased from another vendor for $ 9.99 . The lanterns arrived this morning 08.08.2013 , packing was great , no physical signs of damage , opened of the box of three lanterns , all were perfect at first perusal . A problem arose when changing out four sets of batteries , only one lantern was functional . In this case the blue one worked , red and yellow did not.Called company ( they receive 5 STARS for customer care ) they were order from , they are shipping out replacements , no return for defectives required . Because items do not require return . I opted to disassemble one of the defects -- they are very simple circuit devices -- soldering connections appear good , bulb is not blown , yet nothing works . When time permits this weekend I will rewire and convert to an LED lantern . The conversion will extend battery life and provide higher lumen output.Given these lanterns are for gentle casual use during power outages , camping etc ... .they are not intended nor designed for very vigorous rough handling . Remember they are plastic and given the pricing one should not expect more . That being said -- at any price -- products should at least function as intended.Once I detect actual cause of malfunction I will elaborate here to share that information .	-1
Had Santa bring these for Christmas this year . One did n't work from the get-go and we buried the second one the next week~after turning it on 3 times . The third one works if you shake it just right and hold it there . Would n't recommend them and certainly wo n't buy them again . Oh and it 's not like we were dropping them off the roof or anything , we just were turning them on and off	-1
Upon receiving these in the mail , one of the lanterns were already broken . A second one would not even turn on after inserting the batteries . They are very cheap and do not feel like they would last long . Do not waste your money .	-1
Accidentally bought these but I kept them for my emergency supplies . Very cheaply made and probably will never use them but I have them . Would not recommend .	-1
If you 're looking for toy lanterns for the kids , these are them . Other than that , spend some more money . These are cheap toys that work and put out a little light but that 's what I expected . Flimsy , cheap , typical overseas construction so very befitting of the price . These are not camping lanterns . These make great little night lights for the kids . One of them already stopped working after a month so keep that in mind depending on what you need them for .	-1
Pros : - cheap- functional- disposableCons : - incandescent bulb- relatively short run-time- incredibly bad build quality- falls apart ; not good for kidsThese are possibly the worst-made lamps I 've ever seen -- you probably could n't even find these at the street market in Hong Kong . The biggest flaw is that the lamp 's lid and handle attach to the base via compression only . If this had a simple twist-lock mechanism , it would have held up reasonably well.All that being said , you get 3 functional lamps for a Hamilton , so you ca n't complain too much .	-1
Pros : Casts a reasonable amount or light . Good in ablackout for bathroom use or walking around - but not asbright as a flashlight.Cons : Runs through batteries pretty quickly.Bigger issue is that after second or third use ( on all three ) the bulb burns out . Worse is that replacement bulbs are not tobe found anywhere.For slightly more money there are far better options available .	-1
I retract my original review of this exercise bike because of the awkwardness of use . The bike is well built but for the price but you can find better models cheaper . I also received a letter stating that reviewing the purchase I made , I would get a $ 20 credit that never showed up . Schwinn does make some very nice exercise bikes but for the price , you are better spending your money someplace else.I have been using this bike for almost a month and the seating on it is just awkward even after this amount of use . I had hoped that I would adjust to it but that is n't the case . I even spent money on a gel seat for the bike hoping that would correct the awkwardness but it does not as well . As I am well past the return date , I can not get a refund for this purchase due to my hopes it was me adjusting to the use of the bike . Now , I have a very nice overpriced paperweight that might get a couple hours use a month.Overall , not a very good design with seat/pedal positioning compared to other models and be warned you want to try this out before you take the expensive gamble if it is right for you .	-1
It 's a ten-dollar hatchet sold at department stores . This same hatchet is also marketed by Coleman , Ozark Trail , Land 's End , and many others . They 're all the same China-made hatchet , except the branding.The hatchet is 13 '' long , and except for the rubber grip cover , is all steel . The handle is solid tubular steel , and it goes all the way through the rubber handle cover . The rubber cover is black and slightly oval-shaped , a welcome addition to the circular handle . The handle cover is 6-1/2 '' long and has a slight axe handle shape , as opposed to a straight channel . A hard plastic disc is molded on to the handle to serve as ( I think ) overstrike protection . It 's not attached to anything , it 's just formed around the handle , and will slide around after the first few strikes . If you want to add a lanyard hole , you can drill one into the rubber handle cover . Go through the rear part and you 'll avoid drilling into the steel handle . If you leave this hatchet in the rain , or even outside overnight , it will rust.The head is attached to the handle with a metal fusion . It 's drop-forged 1045 carbon steel and weighs 1 pound , 4 ounces . I tested mine at 47 on the Rockwell scale . The edge is 3 '' top-to-bottom , and has a flattened butt for driving stakes or hammering . The entire head , except for the edge , is painted black . The edge is absolutely horrible ; it 's too high . I had to buy a 40-grit belt for my 1 '' X 30 '' sander to get the edge angle right , as all the other belts I had were too fine . With the edge angle established , final sharpening was easy . The hatchet will take a razor-sharp edge , but the steel is too soft to hold it for long . For splitting wood , it 's fine . The head has n't come loose at all . There 's also a small nail removal notch , but it 's pretty much worthless . To use it , the nail has to sticking out by at least 1/4 '' , and the opening slot is only 1/8 '' at its widest.This is typical of a department store hatchet for ten dollars . It 's serviceable once you grind the edge right and do some basic rust prevention . If you want a better hatchet for $ 10 , buy a used one at a flea market or yard sale and bring it back to life yourself . This Coghlan 's hatchet is okay for the average homeowner , but is hardly worth mention as a serious tool .	-1
Very upset with this . I was not expecting it to be this small , It 's great for lures but nothing too big . I cant even fit my fishing line holder in is .	-1
It says right on the packaging that `` BULK STORAGE AREA FITS FIVE 3500 SERIES STOWAWAYS UTILITY BOXES ( NOT INCLUDED ) . '' Yet it clearly states in the Amazon description , `` Two drawers and four removable utility boxes give you enough room to store all your tackle for the day . '' There is even a bullet on the product description `` Four removable utility boxes . '' I received the Model 7592-01 which is the correct unit . The Amazon description is not accurate , so if you want this tackle box to function properly be prepared to purchase separate utility boxes as an extra cost .	-1
This item arrived empty , without anything to ring the bell inside of the metal . I had to insert a penny into the item to make it functional .	-1

This is good if your rifle is seriously fouled and has n't been cleaned for 500+ rounds . It will scrub the chamber lugs just fine but you 're still shoving a metal brush into your bore , then pulling it back out the way it went in . Over time , it 's going to degrade the rifling at the chamber-end of the barrel . If you do n't think that 's a problem , imagine ( not 'try ' , I am NOT recommending you do this , it 's just rhetorical ) inserting a copper barrel brush halfway into your barrel , then pulling it back out and you 'll feel the kind of metal-on-metal stresses your putting on the inside of your barrel and the rifling.There are nylon versions of this style of chamber brush , and if you clean your AR15/M16 regularly , a nylon brush should work just fine .	-1
There was no way I could ram this patch down the barrel of a 22 rifle . Perhaps the container they came in had the wrong label .	-1
yeah well . this product did NOT work ... at ALL ! ! ! ! i mean it went into the barrel , but when it came out it took alot of the brass metal brush with it . so eventaully i just had a rod . what a waste of cash ... ...	-1
I have a 22LR revolver , and i bought this on here hoping it would clean my barrel . but when i pushed it into the barrel and pulled it out , all the little brass metal pieces came out with it	-1
What good is a & # 34 ; sniper rifle & # 34 ; that is only accurate for about 20 FEET ? These reviews here MUST be from kids.EVERY weight BB I fired from this just arc up and out of the line of fire ? I shoot one inch groups at 100 yards with a .223 , 30-06 , 30-30 , .17 and even a .22 all day long but with this ( dare I say rifle ) hitting the broadside of a barn at 50 yards would be difficult - if it would even reach that far at all	-1
If you tear the bag open where it indicates , the force separates the zipper lock from the main packaging instead of just opening the zipper . This is due to the bag being made from a cheap kind of plastic and having a poor opening design . So you 're left with an unsealable bag . And to compound the problem , the chemicals that are saturated into the cloth have a terrible smell that can no longer be sealed off . I think even if the bag would seal properly I would rate two stars because the smell is so powerful after using briefly on one knife , it made a large room in my house uninhabitable for a couple of hours . It has the same smell as if you were to douse your home with a barrel of gasoline . In addition , the cloth caused my beautiful shining knife to have a tarnished black appearance . It may be adding some protection , but at what cost ? I 'm sorry , I love the concept of this product , and am happy it has worked well for so many people , but my experience with it has been awful .	-1
I always try my equipment before putting it in my survival kit . We pulled this piece of junk out today in an attempt cut a small limb of softwood . Here are the problems with this useless cutting device:1 . Binds very easily2 . The finger rings are very small and impossible to use to grip appropriately , particularly in light of the binding issues3 . The eyelits that hold the wire to the grip rings are composed of weak metal and will bend and release the wire with moderate pressure4 . It just does n't workBy having this garbage in your kit you will have a false sense of security . A multitude of products and sawing methods beat this piece of junk hands down	-1
The case is is best part of the kit , although I 'll just throw the ALICE clip away . It should have some larger needles , heavier thread . I was expecting something like what I was Issued when I entered the military in 1967 . This is far inferior to that . This is more suited for a debutante to patch her panties with it than to make any field repairs to field equipment , uniforms , outdoor clothing , etc.. I 'll have to supplement the kit with some additional needles , pins , safety pins and heavier thread .	-1
I was expecting this to be military worthy , but even the & # 34 ; Military GI & # 34 ; pouch is a cheap knockoff . Not worth it , do n't waste your money .	-1
I bought two of these with the intent to use them to connect my dog 's leashes to their 50ft tie-line runs outside . When I originally purchased this the description said it was good for up to 80 pounds . The first dog I tried this on was my smaller pup . She weighs about 40 pounds . She broke this clip open ( while it was 'locked ' ) within 5 minutes of running back and forth playing outside . Thank the Gods above I was supervising her and could catch her before she ran off.The lock does not stay in place . It loosely screws up and then falls back down again . I do n't see much of a point in a lock that wiggles around so much . Had the lock actually worked , I do n't think she could have broken out of this lock . The strength of this carabiner was wrongfully advertised- but I see that description has now been taken down . For $ 5.00 I do n't know what I was expecting , though . Just something strong enough to use on a dog leash . That 's not what I ended up with . It 's good key-chain quality , but that 's about it . Do n't recommend it for anything remotely strenuous .	-1
These things suck and wo n't hold anything I used them to hold up a plastic Airsoft gun and the broke they do n't hold any weight	-1
This thing is terrible . The screw lock doesnt really lock , it just screws so far forward that it is able to flop around . I immediately screwed that off and now use it as a regular carabiner keychain . I wasnt going to climb mountains with this thing , but dang . Just get something else .	-1
Obviously this is n't rated for climbing , and in fact is n't really good for any application requiring strength . There are plenty of inexpensive carabiners that are rated for weight ( and climbing ) that start at only a couple of dollars more . This is n't worth much anything to be honest .	-1
Perfect size for a key chain , but the lock does n't function . It 's too loose to hold onto the thread and just unscrews itself . Please note that this product is not intended for sporting use .	-1
I use this carabiner when I hike to hang my bear bags . But 10-20 pounds is the extent to which I would trust it to hold .	-1
After sampling this product , I do not care for the locking mechanism . I would not purchase this overpriced product again .	-1
quality was not what I expected , some of the balls were shag ball quality . 2 of the balls had small holes in the covers and several had cart path rash . There were maybe 5 balls that met my expectations . Buy some new mid price balls you 'll be happier .	-1
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and it 's tight . I did n't give a size but if it 's not adjustable then one size does not fit all . She is tall but the sliding pad is just small .	-1
You need this for something very specific and nothing else will do.I sat there looking at my new Cabela 's soft fishing tackle bag with plenty of pockets , zippers , hook holder , strap and other features I just bought for only $ 10 . Then I look at this $ .25 cent compass pouch which is priced for nearly half that . IMO , it just is not worth it.I bought this with the intent of using it to hold .177 pellets . Not very good even for that . I would send it back , but it would just be wasting more money.Sorry , but I would not recommend this for any reason .	-1
At first I thought I had made a really nice deal on a really nice sight , compared to the one I was replacing . Good thing it came with extra light tubes ( for want of a better name ) because almost every time I used it the tube would disappear . The first time it happened and I did n't notice it right away , the small tension spring ended up flattening and that prevented the replacements from staying put . Finally had to put a spot of Super Glue on the front to try and hold this one in . I only have one left so if this one goes ... so goes my front sight .	-1
I do n't understand all the glowing reviews . This is one of the worst mats I 've ever used for hot yoga . It 's incredibly slippery when it gets wet , so I see no advantage to using it over any other mat . If you use it for a regular class , you should be fine . Again , nothing special .	-1
Strangely this lens is not tempered glass , so it is really useless . It will crack as soon as you bump your Maglite against any hard surface . This messes up the light beam . Instead you can just buy a couple Maglite brand plastic lenses for when they eventually get heavily scratched.The Mini Maglite glass lenses that Amazon is selling are less prone to cracking since they are much smaller in diameter , but it may still be the same cheap glass . I bought one of those for my AA-battery Mini Maglite and it has n't broken . I also put on one of the rubber sleeves from the Mini Maglite accessory kit to protect it from bumps .	-1
1 cent for item and $ 5.00 for shipping the item that would fit in an envelope for .44 cents . Screw this company and all like it doing business as they do here at Amazon .	-1
I purchased this tackle box to store and organize small hobby tools and fasteners , so usage was indoors and light-duty to say the least . Despite this , I found that the latches that secure the lid shatter with even the slightest bump . It 's thin plastic and there are toolboxes that cost half as much that are twice as sturdy . In light of the flaws , I would not use this for actual fishing and outdoor use .	-1
The good - Fit and finish are first rate . The blade is sharp , and the detailing is nice.The bad - The clip is too stiff . You should bend it to go onto , and grip whatever you are going to clip it to . The clip is removeable , but it 's obvious that it 's missing if you do that.The unsafe - The blade is spring-loaded to open like a switchblade with a little push from your thumb . While there is a safety , it 's easy to accidently release it when it 's in your pocket.The inconvenient - welded clamshell packaging means that when you open it and find out that it sucks , you do n't really feel right about sending it backPay attention , this knife is SMALL - maybe 2.5 '' blade , which makes it a little tough to handle given it 's spring-loaded blade designSo it 's a neat toy , but you 're probably not going to want this in your pocket every day . I clipped this one to my trunk lining in my car . It might come in handy sometime . I originally bought it as a gift for my brother , but while repackaging it for gift-wrapping , I played around with it and decided to buy him a Case like mine .	-1
I recently purchased a number of knives , and this one will be hitting the utility drawer and staying there . Like others , I bought this knife after many favorable reviews both here and on YouTube . Here are the issues : - Weak steel . Gerber uses soft steel . It keeps the costs down , but other manufacturers in the same price range use better steel.- Not sharp . Blade arrived `` sharpened '' , but not really . Try a cut test against a Kershaw or Spyderco and it 's plainly obvious that the Gerber steel ca n't hold the same edge.- Blade arrived with nicks . I ca n't understand why , but the blade edge had a small dent in it . Certainly not enough to impede use , but come on Gerber.- FAST ? Uh ... . no . The main reason I bought this knife was for the FAST opening . Not only does the knife not have a back thumb access to open it ( I hate thumb-stubs anyway ) , but I can push until my thumbs bleed on those thumb studs , and the knife wo n't open . I have to use two hands in order to open the knife . Complete fail.- Gritty . Ca n't tell if this is the spring or other manufacturing issue , but the blade action when opening or closing feel `` gritty '' . This is not the mark of a good blade . Even other blades with similar action are able to give the user a smooth feel.- The lock . I can understand the point of the lock , but this thing is a piece of junk . It feels as though it will not last long and the mechanics of opening and then closing the blade are ... frustrating.Other blades I bought : Smith & Wesson SWMP3BS Military and Police Knife with MAGIC Assisted Open Serrated Tanto Blade , Black - Great blade , good action , lock that makes sense , feels great.Spyderco Tenacious G-10 - Not an assisted opener , but man ... what a great knife ! The blade is long at 3.375 '' , so I 'm buying a Spyderco Persistence as wellKershaw OD-2 - Much smaller than I expected . More along the lines of a Gerber Mini Paraframe , but an excellent pocketable knife with a great edge and easy opening mechanism.Nice try , Gerber , but retire this one . It 's junk .	-1
I am very surprised that so many people are happy with this knife . I find the safety switch completely annoying , and hard to turn on and off . I agree that it is very hard to open with one hand . I bought this knife due to its length ( I 'm forbidden from carrying anything longer than 3 inches in public ) . Unfortunately , this knife is completely useless to me and I feel like I got ripped off . Oh , the price would be right ... if the knife was functional , but I feel no confidence when it comes to reaching into my pocket and opening this schlocky piece of cutlery . I think this is one of those products that tries to fix a perfectly functional wheel by offering up something useless in its stead . I say , do n't buy this one . My search for a good EDC continues .	-1
All the other Gerber products I have I love but this knife i bought broak after 3 days , the spring or switch inside of it broak and know it wont flip open or lock in place when opened .	-1
The spring does not do much help , it is still require to manually pull the blade out to open . I end up returned the knife .	-1
6 months after the buying the knife , and barely using it , it is already showing major use . Blade sticks . I have recently bought a HK automatic ( American ) and am much more pleased with that purchase even though it was 4x as a much . I would send it back if I could . I have sent 2 other Gerber knifes back this year as they were all of low quality . I grew up with Gerber , sad to see .	-1
Like many have said before , Gerber is usually associated with quality and good design . Unfortunately , this knife does not live up to that reputation for me . It somehow locked on the open position after one day of use .	-1
I ordered this knife for several reazons : Reputable brand , good blade length , acceptable materials quality , not so aggressive look , excellent price at that momment : $ 16.49 with free shipping , and most of all for the dual blade open way : with the thumb on the stud and with the index finger in the upper flipper , BUT my knife does not have the `` window '' in the rigth side of the body to give access to the flipper , as said the manufacturer specification : `` Or , if speed is the order of the day , you can simply trigger the blade 's sudden release with your index finger '' . In other website the picture of this item does not have that window , so I suposse the manufacturer change the desing under the same reference 22-47162 ; eliminating this IMPORTANT feature . Another point is that the open system was quite hard out of the box , so lubricating it and working almost some 100 time the blade manually is necessary , after that the knife open fine . Excellent warranty , for life of the original buyer in USA and 25 years outside USA . Good product for the price . Update review on september 26 . A week ago , after some 10 day on my pocket , the spring broked , VERY BAD material and I change my mind on this product . I contacted the customer service asking just for a new spring , not a new knife , and they answer I should send the broken knife . About this the shipping cost from my country is about 4 times the cost of a new knife . I throw it as garbage .	-1
I used this to mount folding plastic chairs on my fifth wheel ladder . This piece of junk bent from day one . I had to rebend it after every use . I lost one chair on the interstate although I had the chairs tied down with multiple cords/ropes . Pure junk . Would not recommend at all unless you want to launch a chair at an unsuspecting driver behind you !	-1
This knife is a good size , design , shape , etc . That said , it is flawed . The first knife I ordered arrived with a substantial crack in its wooden handle , which started at the top of the handle and connected to where the first ( brass ? ) connecting pin goes through the handle toward its top . It was not just a minor , barely visible crack , but a decent one which would likely grow over time , degrading the functional integrity of the knife . I sent my first one back through amazon 's generally good return policy , and requested a replacement . The replacement arrived with a nearly identical crack . The manufacturing process , or storage , I 'm not entirely sure , on this item is flawed and I can say you will likely receive a knife with a crack in its handle .	-1
I loved this knife . It looked , felt and worked great for a while . I thought the handle was very comfortable and it held a decent edge . My son was using it while we were on a hiking trip hacking at small trees and preparing kindling for the fire . Then it broke in half while he was chopping a small branch held in his hand . I saw it happen and could n't believe my eyes . The tang snapped where it meets the blade and the brass guard went flying . After inspection , the tang was surprisingly thin . I 'm talking about the distance from the finger groove side of the handle to the back edge of the handle - it was barely wide enough to cover the width of the brass rivets . It was cut at a 90 degree angle creating the perfect week spot . This is a poor design for such a large knife . Now , I have to say , my son could probably destroy an Abrams tank in a few short minutes but it was still a sad moment to see my beloved Winchester die . At least it left this world doing what it loved to do ! We cremated it in the camp fire . The blade turned red and we bent it all up . The wood handle burned away and the brass melted . Good-bye old friend . RIP ! I wo n't buy another one because the poorly designed tang is too dangerous and I could n't bear to lose her again . Oh , by the way , I bought it at Bass Pro Shops not Amazon .	-1
This knife is China JUNK ! ! .. It has nothing to do with Winchester and the blade is welded to the handle by a tack weld , that 's it , no tang at all just a cheap piece of garbage that Winchester put there name on , This knife will break if you try to use it ... ..just a big letter opener and the blade might snap off even doing that..	-1
I really liked this knife , for about 2 weeks , at which time the spring mechanism broke , rendering this knife useless as it wo n't stay open . I hate to leave a bad review on a product , but just wanted to let others know that if you purchase this knife , you 're kind of at the mercy of the assisted opening mechanism . If it goes out , the knife is nothing more than a paperweight . When you 're looking for an EDC knife such as this , you need it to perform anytime and every time . And this one might fail . Hopefully not , but I do n't want to take that chance .	-1
I ordered black , the sent me silver/blue . Seem to be OK biners , I wanted them for hanging a hammock but I do n't use shiny equipment . It would have been nice if they had actually paid attention to the order form .	-1
I have owned a number of Russell shorts through the years . They have lasted years . I ordered these to replace older pairs and these are so much cheaper and not price . Cheaper , thinner fabric . No hemmed elastic liner in the waste band . And a poor fit . Loved Russell , now am bummed I ca n't replace the shorts I once loved .	-1
It really is not as bright as I like it to be . I hung it in the middle of a 3 person tent during a late night camp-out and found out that it was n't bright enough for me to find my accessories in the gear bag . The light spreads outwardly and it is just good enough to shed light on total darkness . It also zapped battery life quickly when use continuous for more than 4 hours.Needless to say , it is not one of my favorite camping lantern .	-1
I just ordered this , or so I thought . I clicked to buy & the price went from SIX dollars $ 6.00 to NINETEEN NINETY NINE $ 19.99 . ... does n't show well for Amazon or this seller.The use of Amazon , for me , is convenience & price . I 'm sure the product is good & worth having , but how do I give ONE star for they seller , when the piece is worth a Five.So , one star for seller 's action & five for the product .	-1
Light distribution is n't horrible , but definitely uneven . Harsh color temp . The only upside to this lamp , now that I 've had experience with other LED lanterns , is the low price .	-1
I scrambled some eggs and poured them on the griddle and they all went down the side holes . It would be good if you could fry one egg at a time but if your camping and want to cook for a family , that is n't feasible . And yes , it was level when i put them on .	-1
I ordered this scope for my Ruger 10/22 . The reticle was crooked and the scope would not hold zero . Sent it back for a refund .	-1
I was not happy with the overall fit and finish of this knife . The blade had a little play in it ( left & right ) , and it did not open and close as smoothly as I would have liked.For what you spend on this knife , I was much happier with the Buck 110 .	-1
I was not quite pleased with the quality of this knife . There was a little bit of play in the blade ( left & right ) and the action was not very smooth ... For the price I payed for this knife , I was better off with the Buck 110 .	-1
Compared to the other knives from this company , the 55 seems like a toy . Not as happy as I was with the incredible 110 .	-1
After owning this knife for about a year the hanle broke off this cheeseball piece of Buck trash ! I paid alot for this unit just to have it break on me , and if you repair there knife so you can use it that voids the Buck warranty , it costs Buck almost nothing to produce this cheeseball pile of drivle , up yours Buck , I would not take this with me into the woods or steelhead fishing , you want a knife you can depend on and buck is not it ! ! That is the first and last buck I will ever own or purchase , I have a cheap survival knife from China that I paid $ 8 for and it has really held up with no problems whatsoever and it holds an edge very well for what I paid for the CHEESEBALL buck trash knife I could buy six survival knives that would last several lifetimes , BUCK SUCKS , lets repeat that BUCK SUCKS , this is the worst company I have ever dealt with bad warranty extremely bad products , and you still suck the big one Buck ! ! ! !	-1
recieved the wrong handle material brown instead of black as pictured and the grind was uneaven . I have many buck knives was not impressed for the price they should have better qc . grind was uneaven and the choil was notched where it hit the belt taking a notch out .	-1
This knife is the second disappointment I 've received from Buck recently . It does not have ANY LINER . it is simply a plastic handle with semi lose rivets ( so you can not disassemble , or adjust , ) and a framelock that I do not trust	-1
Meh . Its just your typical small cheap knife . I would recommend looking for something else . You can do a lot better for the price range .	-1
The image of the knife looks very impressive but this knife is much smaller than it appears . The biggest complaint I had was the handle was made of hard plastic and I never felt like I had a solid grip on the thing . Unless my hands were warm and a bit moist , it always felt like I could drop it or cut myself trying to open the thing . Other than that the blade is quality and sharp .	-1
I got this knife because of the look , it has nice lines and nice looking blade , but that is about all that it has got going for it . It does not stay sharp , it has play side to side , the handle wont take much abuse . This is a nice office knife good for opening letters , cutting some string , carving a desk . Its a good starter knife but its not a solid built . I have an older buck lite 442 and its way better than this knife . I am kind of dissapointed with Buck on this one .	-1
Made in China , unlike most Buck knives . Yes , I know that it has the forever warranty , but ... Returned both unused . The part that bothered me is that the web page in Amazon did n't note country of origin . I would have liked to know in advance.Buck Customer Service told me that you can look the product up on their web site and it will have the American flag next to ones that are made here . Trouble is , I understand that some models of the same number were made there and were moved back here.Love Buck knives , not a fan of Chinese made , although probably a good product . In the case of Buck , I want to know before ordering .	-1
I have been carrying this knife for about two months . It seemed like a well made knife , but after two months , the finish had already worn off the handle just from carrying in my pocket . Made in China . Not the Buck knife that was once worth seeking out .	-1
I received this knife and immediately knew that it was a knock-off . The blade flexes and loosely wiggles in the handle when open . I took measurements of the blade and handle and compared them to the Buck Knife Company product description and they all failed . Then I noticed that the original blade would be made of 410 or 420 steel and this was stamped 379 . The final absolute was the word China stamped into the blade ; all Buck products are made in the USA .	-1
First of all , these probably would have gotten a 4 star rating . Unfortunately , due to the packaging and lack of foresight ( or just wanting to make an extra buck ) , these barely rate a 2 . I 'm going to be helpful to anyone else buying this sight . First of all , when you open the packaging , get out a small knife or razor when removing all the parts from the overkill plastic/paper package . Cut away each area around the light pipes slowly and you may get them out without losing them . Otherwise , when you ( slowly ) peel away the back paper from the front paper/plastic bubble area , all the light pipe will go flying in different directions . There 's no way to remove the front from the back without curving the plastic area and having all the light pipes shooting out . Maybe if you worked turtle slow , but I was shocked at how fast they disappeared once I started peeling back the back board . In other words - their packaging sucks . So , I have 1 light pipe left . Perhaps in time I will find the other ones . It they gather light as well as they say , I will spot them immediately . Nope , spent 10 minutes with a I found a green one . That makes 2 left . Yippee . Now , to install the actual sight ... Went on easy . I blue loctited the screw . Odd that my standard Glock sight tool was n't quite right for this part , but the hex head is VERY thin , so I had to modify another tool to gently tighten it . Hmm . So there 's not way that they could toss in a cheap plastic tube style hex driver ? Really . If the people that engineering the packaging on this also engineered the sight - Whoa . Wait , let me first check the sight . All the lights on in the garage - check . Windows shades open - check . OK , I can see the sight OK. Let me try closing the shades - Well , I can almost see the dot ( red ) . Lets open the shades and kill the lights ... Hmmm . No dot . Ok , it is daytime dim in here , and certainly not dark . Going inside to spend the extra $ 43 that I should have spent on a set of Tritium front AND back sights . Goodbye H-Viz part . Expensive experiment . Could have ordered a really tasty XL pizza from Speedys for that wasted $ 25 . Silly me .	-1
This would be a great product if the collapsible sides did n't come loose all the time and allow it to collapse . Velcro attachments are n't big enough to hold in place and material is n't strong enough to hold the weight of the top section .	-1
The item was solidly built however it did not work on my Honda CRV . The left side of the hook that goes against the car sat right underneath my rear window wiper and put pressure on it . When I placed my bike on the middle rack slot , the entire rack came right off the car . Also , the straps that hold it to the bottom of the car are not very secure as a means for supporting one bike - let alone the three this can supposedly hold . I have returned this item.UPDATE : As I went to send my package back I see on the back of it that it says it was not mean to fit my CRV . Amazon should really post it - the back of the box is really vital info when making this purchase . it does n't fit many SUVs at all .	-1
This bike rack is actually very good . Easy to install , and take off . BUT , it will destroy the rim on your spare tire . I have a Jeep Wrangler , the tires are 17 '' ... the metal on this rack is not protected and it digs into the rim leaving very destructive marks .	-1
I bought this to go over the spare on my Jeep Wrangler 2010 . My tires are n't over-sized , but this carrier still did n't quite fit as it was advertised.I never felt safe driving my Jeep on the highway carrying my bike on this thing . The nylon straps unbuckle quite easily -- which is not what I was hoping for . And , you ca n't leave your bike on this and run into a store -- there 's no way to lock the bike to the carrier or the carrier to the spare tire.The carrier does n't hold the bike far enough away from your spare to keep it from rubbing on the rim or tire . And I had to place some rags between the carrier and the tire where it touched or it would scratch up my rim , as well.I used this carrier for a month before replacing it with a Yakima SpareTime bike carrier , which offers security locks and rubber strap downs.Kinda feel I wasted my money on buying this one first . But that 's my fault . I should have thought it through more carefully .	-1
I purchased this because many people had luck using it with their toyota rav4 . I have a 2012 rav4 and this DOES NOT work with the spare tire . I took the cover off , but the windowshield wiper prohibits it from sitting on the wheel fully . You can rest it at a slight angle , but it does not make full contact with the tire and then it rest the other `` foot '' on the body of the car likely wearing paint off . So much for it saying it fits this model ... . I am returning this	-1
This item would have worked well had it not immediately put a deep scratch on my brand new bike ! I saw the other reviews mentioning gauging , but I saw other reviews saying there was a new model . So I thought I 'd try it . Bad decision . I put it on my bike as carefully as I could because I did n't want it touching the painted surface . Somehow it still managed to put a deep scratch in from the time I put it on to the bike and tried it on the rack to see if it would fit.I have a Trek Navigator 2.0 and I would highly recommend staying away from this adapter to anyone else with that bike .	-1
I sent it back . Just like the other reviews stated . The product I received had bare metal on one end that would annihilate the paint on the brand new bike we spent many hundreds of dollars on . I could have made it work by cutting some garden hose and using some tape , but the manufacturer could make it work by designing it right too , so there you have it .	-1
Description need to be better . This was n't what i thought it was , and nowit 's too late to return . Be Careful .	-1
Claims to be able to carry two bikes at a time . And I do . But I 'm never over confident with it and will soon replace it with a Thule .	-1
This product works great as long as you go under 45mph in your car . Ideal for city life . It 's easy to put on and take off which beats dissembling your bike to put it in the trunk . It was fine when I had it for the first couple of months driving around the city to go the trails.However , I drove 5 hours each way to go on a biking trip , mostly doing about 70+ mph . The bike ended up scratching my bumper pretty bad as it was flying around . Furthermore , the rubber wheels of the rack that sit on the trunk ended up burning a hole through my paint as it shifted back and forth from the force of the bike flying back and forth . I even stopped 4 times to tighten everything down as much as possible ! ! ! I 'm glad I have an older car so this does n't matter so much to me , but I ca n't imagine the surprise people are getting on their new to 1-5 year old vehicles ! ! People were staring , and no one followed within 300ft of my car.The top of my trunk has two holes straight down to the metal and the bumper has skid marks/scratches all over it . Do n't be cheap and get yourself a trailer hitch installed . Then purchase the bike racks that fit into those that keep the bike away from your car and the product off the paint ! ! !	-1
First the Pros : Very easy to set upEasy to mount and removeAll one piece out of the boxFree shippingCons : Too weak to hold 2 mountain bikes , Forks have a terrible time with a full suspension frameSpring arms are MUCH too weak , they came out of place will holding 2 bikes on the 101 ... thank goodness for traffic ! Ruined the tire and tube that dragged for a mile . Would only recommend this for 2 kids or 1 men 's ( road/bmx ) and a women 's bike ... maybe : -/Sent it back and Amazon promptly refunded my $ , thanks Amazon ! !	-1
All I can say is Ugh ... if you just have a few bucks and want an okay set of gear ... then ugh.. this 'll work . They 're not great , they definitely do n't suck . The mask broke after a couple of dives , but I was treating it as though I had n't gotten it cheap ... my fault .	-1
The pins on which the strap pivots ( and connect the strap to the mask ) are cheap plastic and pressed-fitted into place . The first time I tried adjusting the mask while it was on my head a pin pulled loose and that was that . I finished that session holding the mast to my face with one hand.To keep it short and sweet : this is a cheap snorkel set for a mid-range price . If you are only the occasionally snorkeler while on vacation I suggest renting . It 's easier and cheaper than you might think .	-1
I brought this along with another pair just in case and its a good thing i did so . These were very tight on my foot even though i brought the correct size for my foot . They seemed to squeeze right on the bridge of my foot .	-1
The suit fit well and looked nice . It was used on two dives when the white stitching started to come undone . After a couple more dives it looked terrible ( though was still usable ) . I did n't return it since I had bought it ahead of time for a trip and missed the window of opportunity . Maybe it was just bad luck : (	-1
I agree with some of the other reviews . These are way too narrow . My toes are completely bunched up and there 's no give .	-1
When I bought this duffle , I was trying to decide between this bag , and a larger , slightly pricier Mares gear bag . I wish I would have spent $ 10 more on the Mares bag.This bag is barely large enough to hold one set of scuba gear ( large BCD , X-large fins ) , with hardly any room left for a towel.3-4 weeks after I got it , the stitching at one end of the zipper broke and I slid the zipper right off the tracks . I had to reseat the zipper and then sew the end down so it would n't come off again.There is a shoulder strap on this bag . The sewn sections on the end of the bag that the strap clips to are not holding up to the weight of my gear , and I can already see the stitching starting to tear away from the bag.The reason I did n't give this bag a 1 star , and almost gave it a 3 star , is that for the price I was n't expecting too much . But if I had to do it over , I would get a different bag .	-1
Like another buyer before me said . The neck is way too small ! I 'm an average build and I do n't have a big neck by any stretch of the imagination . I feel like I 'm choking the whole time . I hate to return the product because it was so uncomfortable .	-1
Just got 2 of these in the mail the other day . Put them on , went for a ride and all seemed good . Sitting in the living room i hear a loud sound in the kitchen ( where i left the bike ) and the tire is down . This is hours after the ride , no reason on apparent issue.I am positive that there was no sudden flat . I have actually never had a flat of any sort , and the area i ride is pavement and nothing else . This was defective out of the box . I dismounted the tire and checked things out . The tube has a leak because as it pumps up the slime is bubbling out but you cant see any hole- its that small . So i am not sure how or what the slime is supposed to do but fix and seal leaks it does not.Like i said , i bought 2 and only one leaked but at a higher price for its supposed leak repair abilities i think ill pass next time since i feel like i was ripped off .	-1
I ride a mountain bike two miles each day on paved roads . I bought two of these , and each one lasted about one month . This is TERRIBLE QUALITY . `` Comrade Wong , please find the worker who made this shoddy product , and allow him to donate his organs- he 's making the Glorious Revolution look bad . `` America used to make QUALITY PRODUCTS of all kinds . Let 's donate the organs of everyone in the White House : vote for CHANGE in 2012 .	-1
The new version of these tubes seem to have a defect around the valve stem.Do n't waste your money , find a different tube .	-1
Ever get a piece of advice from a friend and think , & # 34 ; Gee ... that does n't make sense . That product seems too awesome to be bad . I bet my friend is just more daft than I thought & # 34 ; ? Well , I thought that . Bought these tubes even after my friend said , & # 34 ; Man , that Slime goop craps up the valves on the inside . Good luck getting air into them . Seriously , stay away from those things. & # 34 ; A week later , my friend is sitting here watching me curse my tubes thinking , & # 34 ; Wow ... my friend is just more daft than I thought. & # 34 ;	-1
As noted by others , the slime plugs up the schrader valve occasionally on new tubes . I installed the tubes and within 24 hours one tube had deflated . This is n't a big deal if you have extra valves and a valve tool . If you do n't , it 's a bother.Either the manufacturer should include a spare valve or two and a usable removal tool ( the plastic cap tool broke within seconds ) or I would n't recommend this product to anyone without access to the spare parts and tools.The tube quality otherwise is quite good and I would have rated this product a 4-star if the valve problem did n't exist .	-1
I would not recommend this tube to anyone . It blew up on me when installing . I aired it up to 50lbs . and it blew up along the seam , green slime everywhere , what a mess . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I had to walk my bike home twice with these . And as if that is n't hard enough with a normal tire in the heat , the `` slime '' tires are slower than a normal one . I could hear a `` slosh '' sound and it felt like I was dragging lead . I 've had other tires that lasted over a year and are still going strong . Will never buy these again .	-1
A year and a half ago I changed my tires and tubes on my old mountain bike . The sporting store near me did n't have the greatest selection of tubes so I just grabbed these Slime tubes mostly due to their lower price compared to the more prestigious brands that the store carried . They install fine , just like any other tube but when I filled them I did notice that a bit of the slime would leak out of the valve when removing the pump from the valve . I wiped the slime off the valve and replaced the valve caps . I did n't really have any issue with the tubes that first year other than noticing a bit of slime residue around the valve after topping off my tires . Then come this year I noticed that my front tire was not filling properly . When I pressed on the valve there was only a small stream of air escaping . At that moment it became clear that the slime had sealed off a majority of the valve from the inside . Cleaning the outer area of the valve did nothing to increase airflow.Now I 'm not gon na say the problem is n't partly with me . Sure I could have searched for warnings about these tubes sealing their own valves and made sure that I always had the valve at the 12 'o clock position in the wheel when storing my bike , but honestly I am not that diligent of a person and these are not things I feel a person should have to worry about with their tubes . Also I imagine if you did get a flat this will do nothing more than make a huge nasty green mess inside of your tire and ruin it . My old inner tubes I had for 10 years ( yeah way longer than I should have had them ) without any problems , these Slimes I had them for less than 2 years and have to replace them because they sealed themselves off.Do yourself a favor and just buy normal tubes and repair them with a patch when you get punctures . These Slimes are nothing but a headache and a mess and they do n't even last as long as a standard tube .	-1
These look like nice goggles and I like the wide field of view and beautiful clear lens , but they leak terribly . I tried for an hour to adjust them to fit me properly while swimming laps today , but they still leak no matter how tight or loose I make the strap . It may be that I have close-set eyes and that 's why they do n't work for me , but I just ca n't wear these .	-1
Love the fit of these goggles , but when they fog on the second use it is hard to like them . Contacted customer service and was told to return them and maybe order one with a different lens .	-1
I bought these googles for my son who swims competitively . As soon as he tried them on he said that the lense was touching his eyelashes and it bothered him . He told his coach and she said let me try them and they also rubbed her eyelashes . I guess the latex is so soft if collapses so the lense approaches the eyes too close . He does n't wear them at all now .	-1
When I received these , I loved them . They fit very comfortably and when I used them they did not leak at all . When I went underwater in my pool , I saw everything double . I tried every adjustment I could think of to correct this as nobody else seems to have this problem from the reviews I have read . Looking underwater and seeing double gave me nausea and I had to close one eye to use them . I hated to return them as they were great except for the double vision . I am ordering a different brand and see if I will have the same problems.UPDATE ... I discussed this problem with my eye doctor and he believes the problem is that my eyes are inset more than most people and this makes the goggles wrap around more and this will cause the double vision . The fit and comfort of those goggles were 5 stars so do n't shy away from them just because you `` may '' have problems like I did . Give them a try , you can always return them.UPDATE ... . Just received Speedo goggles and no more double vision . They do n't feel as comfortable as the Aqua Sphere goggles but they are also great goggles .	-1
These goggles leaked no matter how tightly I pulled on the straps . They would leak within a minute of putting my head under water . I was just paddling around in the pool , not even trying to swim laps or anything ! Maybe it 's because I have an asian face with a flat nose ? Well I sent it back .	-1
These goggles are nicely made , flexible and stay put in the water but they 're very wide and made for men or for people with a wide face . They were so big that the edges of the goggle lens came too close to my eye nearest my nose and obscured my vision .	-1
I followed all the directions to a T , and did not have problems with the sealant until ... I tried to put some air into my tire sometime later . It had sealed my tubes , and I now have to replace the tubes.I would recommend just buying tubes that have slime and than installing them .	-1
I got this stuff at Wal-mart thinking it would prevent flats , but instead it caused a flat . I followed the instructions just like it said and the first ride I went out on it was flat by the time I got back . I looked at my tire and found the hole . All the slime did was ooze out like snot . I thought maybe it just needs to dry to seal it but even after a few days it is still slimy and no good . Now I have to by a whole new tire and throw out the one with the slime I just put in it . This stuff sucks . I posted a picture .	-1
Its a temporary fix not a permanent , I even patched my tubes and they leaked air when I left the bike stationary . It only works when wheels are spinning .	-1
Heavy , relatively expensive and messy when it splits open - I do n't know there 's any argument here.But that 's OK - if it really prevents a flat . I do n't know , I 'm staring at one now after biking through thorns last week . Apparently a slow leak that 's gone flat over a week . But , is n't that what the slime tube was supposed to prevent ? I guess the argument is it could have gone flat on the mountain . Kinda like the absence of something happening is the value statement for why you should believe in something that appears to accomplish nothing good . A faith-based belief in Slime.I 've used them on my MTBs for a long time , but I 'm done with their products .	-1
I bought two . One of them is great and holds air wonderfully . I do n't think I have ever encountered a flat-causing item in the road that this tube filled back in . But my second tube never held air and the valve never sealed . It was a waste of money and I had to throw it out . I might buy these again , but I 'd buy 3 for two tires and always buy them in pairs ... Disappointing . Especially since others have this same review ...	-1
Poor product avoid ! ! ! I purchased two of these tubes for my 29er MTB that I have been using as a road bike . Both of these tubes completely exploded and left a mess of slime all over my rims and frame . One exploded while I was inflating it and the other exploded while I was going around a corner at 16 mph . I highly advise anyone to purchase a normal tube without slime and a set of tire guards for $ 20 . This combination has now gone over 200 miles without a flat .	-1
This rating is preliminary . I have not yet ridden my bike with the new tube . However , when installing it I ran into a problem with the Presta valve ( 700 x 28 tyre ) . I have a hand pump with one of those rubber compression seals that goes over the top of the stem . The little threaded stem in the valve was so long that I had a hard time pushing the pump deeply enough over the stem to achieve a proper seal . After that I was finally able to pump to required hardness ( I do not have a gauge ; I use the good old fashioned thumb test ) . When I removed the pump the threaded stem was bent . Moreover , at the beginning the valve leaked audibly and I had to pump several times before it started seating properly . Not a good start , I think.Will add to this when I have some experience riding on it.Well , this did not last long : The first time I tried to put some more air into the tire I found the cap on the Presta valve stuck , probably from some green goo that had seeped out . I unscrewed the valve instead of the cap and green goo shot out of the valve stem ( not terribly much -- I had the valve at 2 o'clock ) . I give up . Presta valves are lousy technology anyway -- I ca n't put up with a lousy version of it . ( Whatever happened to the valves of my childhood with the little rubber tube doing double duty as a gasket and a check valve ? Those were easy to use and to maintain -- and could no be inadvertently unscrewed ) . Besides , I do n't think I could get the valve to work again with green goo all over its parts . It seems that the slime tube may work with Shrader valves , but not with Presta .	-1
Have had several of these tubes and they all seem to develop slow leaks around the stem . Also , I 'm not sure the slime works , it just got all over the inside of my tire but did n't actually stop the leak .	-1
I have used slime tubes on my 26 inch rims with some success . I installed one on my road bike and after a few months the valve got stuck open . The slime eventually fouled the valve . Essentially the valve is a hole in the tube and the slime did attempt to close this hole . I would NOT recommend it for presta valves .	-1
I tried using these on my Gatorskin tires at 110 psi and I went through 3 tunes in two weeks . They flatter for everything . Plus it was so hard to unscrew the valve tip to add air . I have to use vice grips . Left on in my bag as a spare and it ended up with some weird funk all over the stem . Worthless .	-1
I 've been dumb enough to try these 4 times and every time the result has been he same . With a normal flat tire you have to stop your ride and replace a tire . With a flat slime tire you have to stop you ride , replace a tire and clean sticky green ooze of your bike , your clothes and your hands . The tires I 've used have been the 700 x 19-25 road tires . These require high pressure to prevent pinch flats but at 100+ psi the air pressure forces the slime out with an impressive velocity and there is no time for it to congeal and plug the opening . It just sprays everywhere and makes a mess . It is also very difficult to remove once it dries . Maybe it would be useful on a low pressure mountain bike tire but they are worthless on a road bike .	-1
The first thing you will notice is how heavy these tubes are next to a standard tube , but that is to be expected for the most part . If you are concerned about weight , stay away from these . When filling or checking pressure , the valve must be rotated to the top or you 'll shoot slime out of valve and in your pump ( it is easy to forget this ) .So far , I used the tube for about 100 miles of very rocky single track MTB with no problems , even aired down to 25 PSI . All the cons noted above are worth putting up with if it prevents even one flat . I have yet to prove the self-healing feature , but I am confident it will work.UPDATE 8/12/12 - the tube was punctured and the slime did not work . I will not purchase one of these again .	-1
First time i used this the screw bent , though i filled it at an odd angle . I 've done this before with other presta tubes no problem . If you get these just be a bit careful .	-1
I have not had much luck with these tubes actually performing as they say . They do n't really seal small punctures like a mesquite thorn or cactus . I 've had way too many times where I have come out and found the tire down , green slime running out on the floor and all there was was a very small puncture . I 've finally switched to Stans No Tubes .	-1
I gave this product two stars because the tire levers work very well to pop the tire off the rim , and are much handier than , say , a pair of flat head screwdrivers or some other alternative for unseating the tire.However ... the patches are absolutely useless . I went through ALL of them trying to patch a small hole ( actually , more like a narrow slit about 1/16 '' long -- no larger than a typical thorn puncture ) in my daughter 's 12-1/2 '' x 1.75 bike tire tube . Although that tire only needs a relatively low 30 psi of pressure , the patches simply would not stay adhered . I tried roughing the spot ( with the included metal scraper ) more and more with each patch attempt until the tube looked VERY rough . No matter how rough the surface , nor how clean ( I even tried mineral spirits to ensure there was no grease or debris preventing adhesion ) , each time I pressed a patch in place , it would lift the instant I tried to inflate the tire . Usually , this happened before I could even pump 12 psi into it . I tried pumping in some air while plugging the leak with my finger and then adhering the patch ( as a reviewer here recommends , even though that flatly contradicts the instructions ) and it still did n't work . I tried letting a couple of the patches sit for an hour and six hours respectively , but it made no difference . ( The instructions suggest that you can pump up the tire immediately , but I thought some drying/curing time might help the patch stick better . ) I even tried two slightly overlapping patches , using one to cover the corner where the other patch was lifting . Nothing worked . Each time the patch , or patches , lifted somewhere to let the air flow freely out again.It gets worse ... on the last two attempts with these patches , I tried squirting Slime sealing fluid ( sold separately ) into the tube also . Even the two combined did not work , even though the bike shop assured me either product by itself should patch a hole as small as the one in my daughter 's tire ( they told me these are rated to repair up to 1/8 '' round hole , which is much larger than what I was attempting to fix ) . Ultimately , I ended up spending $ 5.99 to get a new tube , had to disassemble the rear axle , chain , and sprocket in order to put it on the rim . I had wanted to avoid that , which is why I bothered with two different Slime products . However , in retrospect , I wasted a lot of time and a little money on the Slime brand of patches and sealing fluid . The only thing I got any benefit from was the tire levers packaged with these patches , which were very handy for unseating the tire the six or seven times I took it off to try yet another patch.If you need a patch , get a more traditional patch with a large rubbery surface area and a tube of rubber cement or vulcanizing compound . If I had been able to find one , I know it would 've patched the hole in my daughter 's bike better and easier than fooling with this Slime product.For what it 's worth , I do n't usually review products I dislike because often I dislike it as a matter of preference , not because of some defect . But in this case , these patches were so inept at performing the simple function they were designed to do , that I feel obliged to warn people away from them .	-1
I 've used these lots of times . Never held , I always thought I was doing something wrong that I could n't figure out . The other reviews have told me otherwise - which is good because I got good at traditional patching when I was about eight years old.Where I have had one of these work really well is the inflatable dolphin pool toy my daughter has . The dolphin has a green wart on his skin that stands out , but at least it holds there .	-1
I used these to fix a flat , it held up a few days until we used the bike for basic street riding . After words it went flat . I noted the air was leaking around the patch , which had failed . I scraped off the glue as best as I could and cleaned the area with goof-off , stuck another patch on , again compressing it tightly per instructions , it held up while not being ridden , rode it to the park and it 's flat again . I 'll go back to glue patches .	-1
I would give this zero stars if possible . I 'll just cut to the chase , THESE DO NOT WORK ! Do n't waste your money . After patching a tiny puncture the patch failed immediately after applying only 30 lbs to the remounted tire . Removed tire and re-patched using another Skab . The exact same thing occurred . Failure of the patch . These may be cheap and light but they suck at what they are supposed to do , patch an inner tube . I 'll probably avoid any Slime brand products from now on .	-1
I was unimpressed with this tube , I was under the impression this was a heavy duty tube , it 's not , when you get a small hole in your tire is spews green slime that isnot very easy to clean off and is quite messy .	-1
Leaks . Bought 2 for snorkeling purposes because I and the lady could not care less about mouth breathing.We tried everything from pushing them in tighter , getting better suction , less suction , wetting the rubber , drying the rubber - nothing works . The flaw that caused the leak comes from the middle part over the nose . It 's a 2 piece design , just f-ing stupid if you ask me .	-1
I 've always been leery of these tubes ... my local bike shop swears by them so I had them installed ... I have a cannondale mountain bike & first ride I get a flat ... I check the tube & the stem had separated , I go to shop they replace for free next week a thin nail pops it ... I pump up the tire & spin the tire so the slime can coat it & goes flat ... The slime itself is too watery to stop anything but the most microscopic leak , this tube is not worth the more expensive price just does not work period ... .nothing against this seller though ... Shipment was prompt	-1
Unfortunately these did not work for me . The green slim completely clogged the valve stem which prevented me from checking the air pressure or putting more air in the tire , which needs to be done periodically even when you do n't have any leaks . It also prevents you from deflating the tube and changing tires should you decide to do so .	-1
Like the title says this is the same one they sell at Walmart . Which does not make it a bad product ... ... ... ..the product makes it a bad product . It did inflate the tire in decent time ( for as small as the compressor is ) . But ... ... .I purchased this to just leave in the car to use during an emergency . Today I had to use it : The bad things about it is that the attachment that goes on the tire is hard to get off and on . Also , THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THE 12V CHARGER SIDE BROKE OFF INSIDE OF THE OUTLET AND STAYED IN THERE . I needed to turn the car off and get needle nose pliers to get it out . Complete garbage . Spend your money on a better one .	-1
Was skeptical b/c the box seemed to have been opened , and there was a scratch on the side . But I needed it for bike and car tires , so I kept it . It inflated bike tires well and fast - mountain in about 3 or 4 minutes , road in less . Car or SUV tires were done after 5 - 8 minutes , although it was a little tricky to keep flat and stable b/c the hose was not that long , but it was fine . Never tried the ball nozzles . Used it 9x and the inflation feature just stopped after filling one mountain bike tire . the light still worked though , so i know it 's compressor related . for the cost , it inflated well , but it 's not acceptable to not last even a dozen fills . 1.50 in quarters is enough for 4 car tires and 1-2 bike tires . I would have done better filling up at the station at this price .	-1
I have a few sets of Speedo earplugs . They hurt , but they work.These are very comfortable in comparison . But one of them failed to keep all of the water out of my ear , letting just a wee bit in . I have a hole in my eardrum ... so I 'll take a little discomfort to avoid any water getting in there.Worth trying , as they 're $ 5 , and your ear may be shaped differently than mine .	-1
I used these with the slime thorn resistant tubes and I have had two flats due to this liner . The first flat eroded through the tire and caused the flat . Yesterday it sliced the tube . STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT . Best just to run with the Slime thick thorn resistant tubes alone which is a great product . I even carry a spare .	-1
I generally try to give a product the benefit of the doubt.Unfortunately , there 's just no doubt , and no benefit to give with this product.These liners absolutely slice tubes . As such , I consider them to be a hazard . We all contend with random hazards . The idiot who threw a beer bottle onto the street last night , the box of sheet rock screws that fell off the truck ahead of you , and all the other sharp , pointy things that want to make your bicycling life miserable.But you should n't have to expect that a product designed to prevent a problem should make that problem worse . These liners are like taking aspirin for a mild headache then getting a splitting migraine followed by a massive stroke.I did n't buy these from Amazon - I wish I had , because I 'd have seen the overwhelmingly negative reviews , and avoided this product . But I walked into a big store whose name rhymes with `` MallArt '' , and bought them with some degree of confidence . Misplaced confidence , as it turns out.The first tube failure was odd - a nearly-one-inch cut in the tube that looked as if it hod been sliced with a knife - But for the life of me , I could n't find any matching trauma in the tire casing . I chalked it off to a tube defect from a generic tube , went back to `` MallArt '' and bought a Slime tube.The next flat , two days later , was undeniable , a 4-inch slice in one part of the tube and about a two-inch slice in another part of the tube - exactly where the edge of the Slime liner was.But here 's what 's indefensible - Slime ( Illinois Tool Works Inc. ) has known about this problem at least since ITW acquired the Slime company - and has done absolutely nothing . Look at the dates on these reviews.That 's indefensible , and that 's why `` Slime '' and Illinois Tool Works , Inc. have seen my last nickel ever .	-1
I installed the liner on both the front and back tire . Since I had a major flat on the rear tire before I installed the liner , I also replaced the inner tube with one prefilled with slime . 30 min into the initial brisk ride on city streets , the new inner tube burst . I replaced it with a 2nd slime inner tube - 10 days later , burst again . Kind of wondering if the liner is rubbing against the inner tube . I noticed a 1-2 '' laceration along the tube slightly off center . I am now trying something else - buying a kevlar tire with a generic inner tube and did not install the liner on the rear tire - will see how this lives up . Bottom line , I suspect the liner causes the inner tube to slide around and eventually rub against the inner tube and cause it to tear .	-1
First trip into the water with this set and I knew there was a problem immediately . With the snorkel attached to the strap the left strap would not tighten enough to prevent leakage . Regardless of what I tried to do it just would not stay tight . The nose cup filled with water causing a lot of water up my nose . Cheap for a reason I suppose . Also , the snorkel is not a dry snorkel at all .	-1
Worst helmet ever . Incredibly difficult to snap ( extreme force necessary ) . I think it is caused by a combination of factors starting with the fact that the plastic used for the latch is very very stiff . In addition there is a plastic guard that was supposed to prevent pinching the child 's neck , however because it severely limits access by your fingers to squeeze the latch closed , it only contributes to the difficulty in snapping the latch and as a result we have pinched our child 's neck on a few occasions.The chinstrap always seem to be twisted as well and never fit straight against the sides of his face -similar to having a twisted up seatbelt.We bought a new helmet at a local bike shop and are shocked at how much easier it is to use .	-1
After couple of uses , the black plastic strap fell off.Upon close examination , they are attached to the helmet by couple of sticky pads.I 've uploaded the resulting image so please take a look before purchasing this item. [ ... ] Update 7/29 : Returned the Giro and purchased a `` Bell Toddler Sprout Bike Helmet '' . Verified that the horizontal black strap is embedded into the helmet , and not attached using sticky pads like the Giro . I highly recommend taking a look at the Bell instead . It 's also few dollars cheaper.Update 5/31/13 : It appears that amazon has taken down my picture of the failed harness . Shame on Amazon for their biased action , and shame on CPSC for allowing this helmet to be on the market . If you have this helmet , give it a good tug on the straps and watch the harness fall apart .	-1
The concept is good but the execution could n't be worse . The main issue is how the front of the `` sweat net '' attaches to the handlebars . It uses approx . 10 '' long strips of Velcro to attach to the handlebars near the shift/brake hoods . There 's no way to route the Velcro such that it does n't get in the way of your hands . Mount it one way and it 's in the way when your hands are on the tops of the bars . Mount it another way and the Velcro contacts your hands when they 're on the hoods . Mounted yet another way and the Velcro hits your hand when you 're in the drops . Would give it zero stars if I could . Sending it back and going back to a hand towel .	-1
I have had my Orange monster for 3 years and use it few times . It does not keep accurate time , it gains minutes a day no matter what . Also I can not set the watch accurately . The last postion of the stem , the hack setting does not work . Once I have worn the watch for a few hours the second hand will not stop when I pull on the stem . I even purchased an automatice winder to see if this would help , it did not . So for accurate time keeping and setting I have to wear one of my other watches . I do not expect the accuracy of a quartz movement , but minutes a day means I have to set it each day just to have a semblane of the correct time . I love the style , the face and the bracelet , but not the time keeping which is what I buy a watch for .	-1
I recently purchased one of these watches since I was impressed with its overall mechanical precision , weight and feeling of quality . Also really liked the clasp , including the wet suit , extension and the fact that it had the day of the week as well as the date . However , after using the watch for about a month I became very unhappy with the watch due to the poor timekeeping . While automatic movements are typically not as accurate this watch consistently gained 15 to 20 seconds a day . After reflecting that the main reason you buy a watch is to be able to tell time I reluctantly returned it and bought a quartz movement diving watch which is accurate to within less than five seconds a week , quite a difference . If you are willing to settle for the appearance of a watch and are into constantly adjusting it you might consider this model , but I found it too aggravating . I understand that there is a replacement model coming out with a much more accurate automatic movement . You might want to wait for this one .	-1
This compass is junk do n't buy when it arrived it had a big bubble in it and this is not a Silva from the Swiss company it is cheaply made in India	-1
I wanted a light weight sighting compass for backpacking and decided to try out the Silva Guide 426 . It is light weight but also has a very flimsy plastic hinge on the mirrored door . I mean totally plastic ! You ca n't really make it out in the picture . If I had seen that I definitely would not have ordered this compass . I 'm sure the hinge will be the first thing to fail . Beware since this item CAN NOT BE RETURNED ! Consider any other sighting compass with a clear base and stay clear of this piece of junk .	-1
I have owned an 8 x 8 tent made by Eureka ( Gander Mountain label ) for about 8 years and it is an excellent tent . I also own a 7 x 8 tent made by Kelty which is also and excellent tent . I take great care of my tents as well . I bought this tent with great excitement , for two reasons : It was designed more like my Kelty tent , which I love , and because it had the Eureka name , which is considered to be a great name in tents.After unboxing the tent , I set it up in no time at all . This tent sets up VERY EASY , just like my Kelty . After getting it set up and taking a closer look at the seams , etc. , I discovered that there were about 2 inches of missing stitches along one of the seams . I accepted this as merely a mass-production flaw and I stitched it up . I REALLY wanted to keep this tent . The next day , I began examing the surface of the tent fabric a bit more and discovered a couple small holes that were obviously original holes ( smooth edges ) . At this point I was becoming skeptical of whether this tent was REALLY any better than the cheap tents you can get at Walmart . I tried to ignore these flaws , becaust at this point , I still really wanted to keep this tent because of it 's ease of set-up and it 's great ventilation.The next week I took this tent on our annual Canadian adventure into northern Ontario , to be used for interior kayak camping . It set up easily , It held up good in the rain , but not great , and everything went fairly well with it for 3 nights . At this point , I had planned on keeping it . Then , upon returning home , I unpacked it to dry it out more thoroughly , and I noticed that one of the metal ferrules had just fallen off the end of one of the fly rods . I was so disappointed , as I knew I could not justify keeping this tent.It is my opinion , based on examining a LOT of tents , that this tent , as much as I want to say otherwise , is no better in quality than those that are half the price from Walmart or similar stores . From the crooked weak stitching , to the inferior fabric , to the horribly assembled rods , I saw no reason to pay twice as much as a similar tent.Either Eureka quality has dramatically gone down over the years , or they are having their less expensive tents built by some inferior company , and selling them with the Eureka name . One thing is absolute , this tent was not near the quality of the one I bought years ago for about the same price , not even close . I am guessing that if I kept this tent , it would n't have lasted more than 2 years of regular camping . I returned it.I would have given it 3 stars because that 's what it is , and AVERAGE tent . However , because it cost twice as much as the same size AVERAGE tent from Walmart , I had to deduct 1 star . If you want an average tent that will perform just as good as this one , you can get one for half the price . If you want a high-quality tent for more money , look elsewhere . I wish I could recommend this tent but I can not .	-1
My sister and I went camping this week , and we took a huuuuge tent with us , which we quickly grew irritated with ; it just took too long to set up , and we 'd planned to set it up and tear it down each day . So on the second day of our trip , we went to the store and bought this Eureka tent . It 's 7x5 ' and it uses clips instead of channels to attach the tent to the poles , so we thought it 'd be perfect . We brought it to our site and set it up in no time , and when the time was right , we went to sleep . When we woke up , we were WET ! Everything near the perimeter of the tent was wet . It was awful . The cloth itself is not waterproof , so it lets water through , and then , later , since the cloth has absorbed water , it 's still wet when you 're trying to put the tent away . The fly does n't zip over the door , so the rain can ( and will ) blow in there and seep through the zipper . We had to go buy a plastic painting dropcloth and stake it out over the tent so we would n't wake up rained on again . I 'm really surprised at all of the 4- and 5-star reviews for this , because we were really unhappy.Before it started raining , we thought this was a great tent with a couple of shortcomings -- cheesy poles and blousy fabric near our heads -- which are to be expected at the price we paid ! So I guess if you 're in a dry climate ( we 're in Oregon ) , it 's probably a good buy . I 'm giving this tent 2 stars , though , because the packaging says `` STORMSHIELD '' all over it , which is ridiculous . But for a predictably dry climate , I 'd give this tent four stars.Just want to mention again that the tent leaked through the FABRIC , not just the seams or around the zips , so we 'd have to have waterproofed the whole thing , not just the seams , to keep it from leaking.To be fair to Eureka , it 's possible that the tent we received was defective.We replaced it with a Coleman Sundome , which kept us dry . We put up the Eureka properly , but if you find that hard to believe , then I will condescend to endorse the Coleman Sundome as a tent that will keep you dry even if you are incapable of putting up a tent properly .	-1
The main body of the tent sags and makes contact with items inside . Makes a wonderful condensation wick . Does not breathe as no air circulated under the fly . Abandoned this on on the creek bank . Avoid -- -There are better choices out there .	-1
Did not receive this item had to use another place to get it . Cost me about twice as much as Amazon could n't get the order fixed . Box came with nothing but cardboard inside . Other than that I would give the item 5 stars as it is light weight can setup in under 3 minutes and be ready to go . Awesome backpacking tent , Think they could improve a little with a air up pad built in the bottom but that is just more weight .	-1
poor construction . bag 's belt ripped away from bag after a few uses . would not recommend this product under any circumstances .	-1
Did n't last ... .poor customer service had to file compliant with BBB Better Business Bureau until I got new one then it did the same thing budge on top on matteress and then leaked all the air out . I done with this crap company and they poor products . I bought memory foam matteress and and pleased so far	-1
With family inbound for the holidays , we realized that we needed more beds in our home . After weeks of researching inflatable beds , I finally came to purchase the Wenzel Insta-Bed . I have to say that the product reviewers were wrong in every possible way . I purchased two of these for quite a bit of money , but in this case , more expensive just means wasted money on junk.These beds are no different than any other raised air mattress . The first one I received , it looked like Amazon repackaged a returned one -- the box was opened , and the mattress was n't packed correctly . I thought , `` Well , maybe it 'll still work . '' The second one looked brand new , but after inflating , it was quite obvious that the upper part of the mattress was glued on crookedly -- the top was not in line with the bottom at any corner , which made putting the bed up against a wall impossible.Both performed about the same . They pumped quickly , but within the night of being slept on , both needed air to be repumped . I 'm not sure why -- there were no obvious leaks . Perhaps there were several slow leaks in both . When pumped however , they were much more comfortable than typical air mattresses . I guess there 's something to that 15 or so chambers in the mattress.Pros : - When inflated the first night , they are REALLY comfortable- Inflates quickly , within 3-5 minutes depending on how firm you like your mattressCons : - Expensive- Do n't hold air beyond 1 night- Beds can come irregularly shaped and may not be able to hold sheet setsBe careful when you get this . If you want to repump a bed every day , or spend a lot on a air mattress , then go ahead . If not , look for something else .	-1
I should have done my research better . I was planning on using this for camping , but then I realized that many people had complaints of it being easily punctured and it requires a plug in to inflate .	-1
I bought this bed on August 11 of last year . Today , August 10 , 2012 , I came home and found a huge bulge in the middle.This is the great curse of air mattresses : the internal baffles detach from the surface , rendering the bed unuseable . I 've been sleeping on air mattresses for 15-17 years now , and this has happened with every one . Why ca n't they figure out how make the baffles stay attached ? We just landed a space vehicle on Mars , why ca n't we make an air mattress that lasts for more than a year or two ? I 'm giving this product two stars , because it was pretty comfortable , while it lasted . But I think a product like this should last at least four or five years .	-1
Purchased the Wenzel mattress and returned two times . Used it for for two relatives ( n=2 ) who had to sleep on this product when they unexpectedly had to vacate their residence ( and live with us ) . They are not heavy people . The mattress is a great concept , but it loses approximately 25 % of air every night . Consequently , we had to add air before bedtime each and every day . By 8:00 AM every morning , the mattress was considerably softer ( less air ) than the night before . Within two nights , the air was half way depleted in each and every unit . Returned the mattress twice for replacements and had the same problem with each one . Every time , customer service was very helpful , but it became a pain to ship defective units back to the manufacturer.We did n't have the same issue of the mattress feeling `` cold '' as some other reviewers note . The third and final mattress found a home in a local dumpster as we could not give it to a homeless shelter due to the air leaking issue . Perhaps we got a bad production run ? We finally purchased an air mattress from LL Bean and did n't have an issue.The Wenzel mattress grips the floor well ( does not slip ) and accommodates a queen mattress protector and queen sheets well . If it held air for longer than a night , it would be great . Unfortunately , it 's not and we do not recommend purchase having owned three units.There is a reason this is currently being sold as the deal of the day on Woot.com ( Amazon 's worse of the worse graveyard ) .	-1
I bought this item two weeks ago , and it was not what I expected from it . I spent couple nights in a camp where the temperature was about 29 - 30 F during the nights . I was extremely cold inside even though the item says zero degrees . I would not recommend it to anybody . I am paying the price for buying cheap . Nice colors , nice material but not enough to be rated upto even three stars .	-1
I got this for a little something extra with my new Glock 27 . It is simple to install and does what it is suppose to but could not really see any reason for it . It gives you 2 extra rounds which is nice but I have mags for my Glock 23 I can use and it gives me 13 rounds . I can also use my Glock 22 Mags for 15+ depending on if I am using the ones with the extenders on them . I am currently using it with a G27 mag in the gun and carry a G23 mag for spare backup . I realize alot of people will not have the extra mags and this is cheaper than buying a new one so for you this may be a better option but did little for me . Another big selling point to this product is adding to the grip . Again , not needed as the Glock 27 has plenty of grip even for large hands . Yes your pinky does hang off of it or at least mine does but I never use my pinky even on my full size guns . I shoot them only with my two fingers as this gives me better control . I wish I could insert a photo for better description but my pinky sort of stacks accross my right hand ring finger or lays across it . A final note to is by adding to the grip you are now getting about the same size as a Glock 23 which is a favorite gun of mine but is bigger and defeats the main reason I feel most would be buying the 27 , for a small concealed firearm.This is not a bad product but will be tossing mine out . if you do n't have any extra mags from the larger Glock 40 's this may be a option for you if you are not wanting to buy them . Those who do already own them can just save ten bucks .	-1
OK , so I really wanted to like this product . The model I ordered and received was PG-39 , which , according to both the product description on Amazon and the packaging , is supposed to allow for three additional 9mm rounds when used in conjuncture with factory Glock 26 Magazine . However , I could only fit 2 additional rounds into the magazine , not three . I take that back , I could fit the last round in , but it took herculean effort and a magazine loading tool to do so . When in , that last round , round number 13 , was slightly nose up and bending the feed lips outward . Additionally , when the full magazine was inserted into the gun , the nosing up of the round prevented the slide from being cycled . I tried several times , but to no avail . So , I tried locking the slide back , inserting the magazine and then releasing the slide . The round was jammed into the magazine so tight that even the slingshot action of the slide could not completely dislodge it . It took me nearly two minutes to work the round out of the magazine without damaging the feed lips.Despite being disappointed , I was willing to look past that and still use the magazine with only 12 rounds , instead of 13 . However , I noticed something peculiar . With 12 rounds loaded into the magazine , the round under the number 7 hole on the back of the magazine was loose ; so much so that the slightest movement made a rattling noise . However , when the magazine was inserted into the gun , there was enough pressure from the magazine catch ( which happens to fall right near the # 7 hole ) to stop the rattling . Hmmm . Well , no noise when in the gun , and I intended to carry this magazine in the gun and not as a backup , so moving on . Then I noticed that there is a sharp lip on the front of the magazine extension that I could see pinching my pinky when shooting , as some other reviewers have alluded too . I suppose that could be rectified with a dremel tool if you were so inclined.But the final tipping point for me was when I measured the height of the gun with the upgraded magazine inserted . I own a Glock 19 as well . I measured the total height of the G19 with a magazine inserted and compared it to the G26 with the Pearce Grip extension magazine inserted . The G19 is exactly 1/16 & # 34 ; taller than the G26 in that configuration . That close together , why not just get a G19 magazine and rock 15 rounds with an X-grip magazine sleeve ? Plus you do n't have to deal with the potential pain of pinched fingers , inability to load 13 rounds , and the headache of removing the magazine floor plate . So , that is what I did . I returned the Pearce Grip extension and ordered a X-Grip magazine sleeve . There are a lot of 5 star reviews on here , so maybe I got a bad one . Who knows ? But this was my experience and I can & # 8217 ; t change that .	-1
This mag ext is basically the same as the mag ext for the larger Glock pistols of the same calibers . The difference is this one have a sharp lip where the mag ext is supposed to sit against the bottom of the grip . When firing at the range this sharp lip pinches painfully . I used them on my Glock 26 , I returned them and bought the mag ext for the Glock17 and they work perfectly . the Glock 17 mag ext are exactly the same but do n't have the sharp lip . I took picture of the two mag ext on the glock 26 and I would be happy to send them if asked.If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I 'll try to respond within a day or so .	-1
Easily to assemble if you have the right tools . The description saids plus two . But you only get plus one .	-1
When I first received these extensions for my mags , I really liked them . They added grip for my pinky and felt really good in my hands . However , I did not have a chance to shoot my 27 until today . When I went to the range and started shooting , my pinky kept getting pinched . I have fairly average size hands ( male ) and the pinky kept getting pinched because at the top of the extension there is a piece that protrudes out . I have read you can sand it down or put an o ring to make it not pinch . I do not want to do that , I paid for these expecting them to work out of the box . I am not Hicock45 so I can tell you that it does feel awkward without the pinky extension , but I am sure I can practice and get used to it . I will stick with the stock parts and just practice with this gun a couple more times and I am sure I will adapt . Think about this before you buy them . If Pearce is reading this review please fix this bug otherwise it is a great product . I gave it one star because I do not want to be bothered by a pinky pinch if my life is on the line .	-1
The product has reasonable clarity for the price point , but the objective is more like 50mm and I found it was n't any better than using my 8-32x50 rifle scope . The product was also difficult to focus . I have a 20-60x100mm Celestron spotting scope used for prairie dog hunting . I wanted something with the lower end magnification to make it easier to go from the spotting scope to rifle and find the critters . Purely from an opinion perspective , it was a mistake to get one with the straight vs angled eyepiece . I like to stand up ( and stretch some ) to use a spotting scope , then sit down at the shooting table to shoot . The straight eyepiece requires the scope to be very high on a tripod to look through it . If you like to put the scope on your shooting table and use a mini tripod , then the straight eyepiece is probably better . However , this spotting scope will be no better than a 8-24x50 rifle scope .	-1
These guns are pretty cool looking little toys . I was n't disillusioned enough to believe these would be useable . I bought them for my 4 year old nephew that loves to play with toy guns when none of the local toy stores had any toy guns in stock . Do n't worry , I filled the barrels full of RTV first so they can not be shot . I also took the tiny package of ammo and shot it so I could see how they worked . The are some of the weakest airsoft pistols you will run across , but would still sting if shot up close . They feel like they are about to self destruct when you cock them . One of them actually cracked a little on the second cock.The plastic is thin and cheap . When you cock them , they crack . You have to pull the slide back from the front end if you do n't want them coming apart in your hands . I would rate them lower for their shoddy quality , but they are so very inexpensive . At this price , they make nice toys even if they are n't able to be shot . My nephew does n't even try to cock them . He just runs around with them going & # 34 ; PEW PEW PEW PEW , & # 34 ; for hours at a time . If they fall apart , I 'll glue them back together and he will still love them . I almost broke the slides off just so I could attach them better , but decided to wait until they fall apart on their own . Surprisingly , that has not happened in the week he has had them.Get them if you are n't interested in quality and just want some cool looking toy guns . Do n't get them if you want to shoot them , since they will likely both break into pieces in your hands the first day you have them .	-1
I tried a pair of GP4 700x28c tires with a steel frame touring bike and found them to be very rough on the road . Besides general stiffness , they had a lot of road noise and rolling resistance , especially for such low tread . Also , like many road tires , they are not true to size and I believe the 28c tires we actually about 26c wide.I typically ride an aluminum road bike with 700x25c Continental Gatorskins and prefer those by a large margin . For my touring bike I ended up with a pair of Schwalbe Marathon Supreme tires and I love them . Very smooth , not much road noise , and low rolling resistance . More expensive , but definitely worth it .	-1
These tires are awesome for racing but for just everyday riding both tires lack sidewall protection . Got two side blowouts when I did n't hit any debrie . Would not recommend this for normal riding . Great feel , grip is great , but does not last long .	-1
Having owned several CS knives I was prepared for a similarly amazing product . Not even close . Typically , I am pretty thorough about researching blades I buy but did n't follow through this time and got burned . Look online a bit and you find the reputation for this model is terrible , even the more recent `` improved '' version ( which my recent Amazon purchase was n't ) . My issues : loose/rattling crossguard , slightly loose in scabbard and the scabbard 's fittings both coming loose . All told , only the blade seems fine ... so far . And another caution : factory seconds ( sub par pieces sold at a discount ) are common on Amazon/ebay making me wish I 'd gotten mine from one of several legit sword sites for only $ 10-15 more . However , I also have the matching dagger which is flawless so far but sees much easier use , as well .	-1
I bought these for our yoga and circuit training classes at work . The majority of the time the mats are used for yoga and some ground exercises in the circuit training class . They are only used 3 times a week at most . They tore within a matter of days and are of a very cheap , light and spongy material . As we do our classes outdoors on a concrete deck , once the mats were laid out , they would often blow away in the breeze ! This may be a good price , but the mats are n't worth it .	-1
So I purchased this mat for going to yoga with and it 's just not pratical . I find the thickness to be too much ( although I wo n't knock it too much for that as it is described as Extra Thick ) making it heavy . But an even bigger problem with this mat is that there is next to no grip with this at all making most yoga positions impossible to safely pull off . Really useless as a yoga mat however it 's making a great padding under our carpet and could be used for other things , just not yoga .	-1
I like the thickness ; I have bony knees.That said , I tried out a warmer yoga class , and this mat got ice-rink levels of slippery when it got wet . I 've never had troubles with it doing yoga at 70F , but at 85F+ , downward dog became a quick way to injury ; my feet took off , and I twisted my wrist trying to catch myself ... then did it again . Ow.Will keep using this for more relaxing stretching and yoga , but wo n't waste my money paying for a hot yoga class if this mat is all I have .	-1
I have been doing yoga for months now , putting off purchasing a mat because I just didnt know what to get . I thought I would go cheap as I have not had a problem with the mats at my studio . WRONG CHOICE ! I almost left class the other day because I was slipping so bad . Now I am at a point of having to buy a new mat that is stickier or a towel to put over this mat . I would advise not buying this mat , I am going to try and return !	-1
From description om amazon website I had an impression that this lid comes with a bucket . I think the description of this item is not accurate and misleading .	-1
This would work well for cleaning a fish after you 've been out of having to grab a struggling fish with a lure in it 's face or something . It 's very stiff , well made , but completely useless for actual fishing because of those reasons .	-1
The weights are great . The problem is the container . It 's a little difficult to turn the top to the desired bin . The opening is terrible because the weights are difficult to get out . I will NOT buy this product again .	-1
I purchased this for my girlfriend for X-mas this last year . She really wanted a lite but comfortable sleeping pad for when we go on hiking trips . So after doing a fair share of research and checking out reviews , I decided that this would be the air pad that would fit her needs..upon opening it , I read the instructions , opened the valve , and unrolled it so it could inflate . I noticed that it was n't really inflating very well , But I just left it alone for about a half an hour . I then came back to it and decided to just blow it up manually ( which worked ) but I did n't think that I should need to completely inflate a & # 34 ; SELF INFLATING PAD & # 34 ; manually , but i was n't that concerned about it . So after it was all inflated , I left it to sit over night , and the next morning it still had air in it , but it seemed a little low . I still was n't completely concerned , I 've had many Colman Air mattress 's , and ALL of them lose a little bit of air , even fresh off the shelf . So I just deflated it , rolled it back up , and stored it on the top shelf of our closet.Then two weeks ago we were finally on our first hiking trip for the year . We then set up camp , inflated her & # 34 ; self inflating & # 34 ; air pad manually , and went to bed . by the middle of the night , her air pad was completely deflated , and she was pushing me off of my & # 34 ; cheap , but still inflated & # 34 ; Glaciers Edge air pad so she could get some sleep . Honestly , I think that this Therm-A-Rest Air pad is probably a good one . I just think that I got a defective one .	-1
Had this watch for three years . It is extremely light with a very comfortable band . I love wearing this watch everyday . However , like many of the folks here have noted ... the watch is fragile . Mine has needed the movement replaced twice . Going for a G-Shock , I ca n't see putting anymore money into this watch .	-1
I 'm torn on this knife.Pros : - Fairly comfortable handle , perhaps a bit small , but it 's not supposed to be a big knife . Reverse grip also comfortable.- Very nice blade size/shape- Blade should sharpen easily , and take a nice edge ( relatively soft AUS8 steel/shape ) - Coating seems like it will be durableCons : - The handle itself does n't seem well suited to any kind of impact work- I do n't see any point in the notches on the top of the blade , as they only make it more difficult to extract the knife after piercing something- I 'd like to see it available in a rust proof steel ( like H1 or X15 TN ) for real marine exposure , or a more durable stainless steel ( like S30V or D2 ) for general usage . Yeah , price would go up , but oh welThat said , the kydex sheath really makes the knife I got unusable , resulting in it going back . I encounter significant resistance putting the knife into the sheath at about the halfway mark , and once it 's 100 % in , it 's very difficult ( in a dangerous sort of way ) to remove . Whereas the Ka-Bar kydex sheath features a nice clipping action , allowing for a relatively roomy fit inside the sheath , the SOG has no such action , and appears to rely on some friction between the blade/sheath , plus the button . Even with that apparent design issue in mind , I have to think mine is defective , because it 's impossible to do without two hands , and a good grip .	-1
great knife , i love it , returned a kabar because of the weak blade design and sheath problem , this knife fits all my criteria and will work good.Update : had the knife for a little while and reduced the rating down to 2 stars , i sharpen it and with very little easy use its dull again . The use is light - but it still doesnt retain its edge well . Outsourced metal from overseas - could mean they screwed up a batch or something . I love my kershaw china blades so - I dont know whats up with this knife and its crappy steel . It does take an edge easy , which I love , it just wont hold it as well as my others - kershaw , becker , kabar , gerber . Get another and dont be swooned by the cryo teatment , sure didnt help on the knife i have .	-1
I have a Chinese air rifle that 's about ten years old , I 've never had an issue with .177 pellets until these . They were too large in diameter to fit into the breach .	-1
This pack has issues with both the design and the construction/materials.I got one of these and also a 4000 series for some overnights in the Adirondacks.The design issues have to do with the way the detachable top bag and the straps fit , really I think they tried to hit a `` feature checklist '' and ended up without the usability really being as good as one would hope . Far too much inconvenience having to undo straps to get to pockets , etc. , to be really ergonomic.The materials/construction issues have already hit BOTH packs- and I have n't even gone on the hike yet ! ! ! The 5200 , the hem ripped off the water-bottle pocket when I was holding it to push the bottle down further . The stitching was just too close to the edge of the material , and the border just tore right off . The 4000 , one of the buckles just shattered when I was tightening a strap over the rolled-up sleeping pad . Clearly not nylon , some kind of more fragile plastic.So , I guess you get what you pay for ... maybe these are still a good choice if you just ca n't afford the higher-end brands ... a shame , as some skimping on ergonomic thought , careful construction , and good materials could I think have made these good packs . But I 'll probably end up with these both just being 'take a loss ' territory . I do n't want buckles to snap in the wilderness , or seams/hems/borders to just rip off hours from my car ! ! !	-1
This thing was cold , uncomfortable , and lasted 3 nights before the zipper came off . I would have been more comfortable sleeping in a poison ivy burn than this thing . I returned it as soon as i got back .	-1
This Barrel is 16 '' and works great for long range accuracy . The price is reasonable and the items that you receive are just fine.After a few uses you have to tighten the bolts back down because it starts to become loose and jiggle . The site starts to move around and the components on the barrel need to be re-adjusted . Not to mention when I got my barrel in the mail , I put it on and it was perfect upside down ... I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to impress their friends , but when it comes to function it requires too much fix.I got tired of it and took all the parts off the gun and now simply have a 16 '' barrel.When it comes down to it , thanks ... but no thanks .	-1
Just is not a good barrel it breaks the balls , the sights are so far off that you ca n't fix them , it does look cool but I need function	-1
Just a poor net when compared to the rest . Yes , it 's cheaper than most and there is a reason for that . If you are using it for hitting , even 5-6 year olds will occasionally hit the ball over . If you are 6'3 like me and get any lift on the ball you 'll never hit it in the net without actually hitting the net.Get the jugs if you want quick set up or the big mouth if that is n't as important .	-1
I bought this net for my boys and after 3 months fo use , the frames are becming weak and the net is not holding up . The height of the net is about 80 % of what is used to be and it looks terrible . As others have recommended , do not buy this product as it is a very poorly constructed product . Pretty dissapointing considering it is a Easton brand product . This product definitly puts a stain on thier brand image .	-1
I 'm looking for a good pocket sharpener . This is n't it , since it pretty much has no effect on the edge of any knife I tried with it . I have a mini ceramic stick type that works better , but it is n't my ideal , either .	-1
Worked okay for a few days , sometimes the ball return would n't launch the ball back . Let the 4,6 and 8 year old play with it and soon thereafter it stopped working altogether . Would not buy again	-1
I ask one of this used item NV and it arrived me with damage or bad . I returned it and I not yet my refund ... Thenk you ...	-1
First of all , this belt if HUGE . On the very last notch ( tightest notch ) it is so wide it is barely working for my 37 inch waist . If you are a smaller woman this will not work for you at all . I 'm not sure who this is for but you would have to be huge for this to work for you.Also quality of this belt is very bad . It is not one solid piece but 3 pieces sawed together . So it started to tears where the seams are . Very bad product do not recommend .	-1
Not a bad recoil pad but not what was pictured . The photo was changed after I purchased . Definitely was a & # 34 ; Decelerator & # 34 ; pad shown as I have now seen others with the same issue . Wo n't bother returning but not what I actually wanted .	-1
Should have spend the money for a better product . My son is on the golf team . He uses this bag quite a bit in the off season . Here 's the deal ... sure , he 's a teenager , but he was n't rough with the bag . I 'd watch him out the window and never saw him abusing the bag . Within a couple of months , the handle was bending . Now it 's a year later and the handle is so bent that he ca n't even use it . We just had to spend money on a new bag .	-1
Seemed fine at first , then adjestments seemed not to stick so well , then could n't even get into low gear , and realized screws affect no change . Must be internal components broken . Did n't realize it till 1 day late for return but Amazon honored the refund .	-1
I have these on my Surly LHT . When in for new cables , the tech told me that a washer ( probably cost $ 1.50 ) was broken and I had to replace BOTH shifters as they are NOT sold separately and NO replacement parts are sold by Shimano . He also had the gaul to charge me $ 127.00 when everyone else sells them for under $ 100 . I am fed up with Shimano and their uncaring attitude and poor quality control . A few years ago I was getting off from a stoplight and my Shimano front crank arm broke off completely ! Never had that happen before and my bike shop never had either . Next time I get SRAM all the way .	-1
These shifters are great when they work , but my rear shifter stopped indexing after only 3 years of fairly light use . They still shift in friction mode , but for the price they should last a lot longer than they did . I have thumb shifters from a 1987 mountain bike that still work great so I do n't understand why these are not just as durable . I will try Microshift 's bar end shifters next time .	-1
First off - I 'm ex military , that means I 've washed things over and over and over again . I understand how to wash things ( I 'm saying this because I know someones going to say bleach ... ) So I washed this hat a few times and its started to go pink - to the point where I can no longer wear it.No bleach people , washed with like colors and everything else was fine.I 'm really disappointed because I loved this hat - the fit is perfect which is hard to find .	-1
I did not realize that a metal version of this tool existed by another company . I am probably going to buy that . It is so difficult to get any leverage with this tool by using just your fingers . This tool is supposed to be used to pull the cranks together so that they seat onto the bearings . You are to adjust the amount with this plastic tool that you can not fit a wrench onto . I had to use a block of wood and a hammer to get the crank arms into place . How are my fingers going to pull the crank arms together ? I bought this because it was Shimano , and I figured it would work well with the shimano cranks .	-1
Bought the park tool an did n't realize this was also included . ..oh well it is what it is plastic an not so necessary piece.it sits in the tool box along with the other stuff I did n't need lol .	-1
The table top and legs seem to be well-made and I like the way it folds up so compactly -- but the support members ( the braces that extend from the table top to the legs ) are made of the thinnest and softest aluminum I have seen on anything outside of an aluminum beer can . I bent one of the supports , just pushing it back in place to fold up the table . I guess I had better start figuring out how to replace them when they break -- or get too badly bent to work -- after I have used it for a while .	-1
Crap with 4 legs . This table will sag in the middle 10 minutes after setting it up . Even with nothing on it .	-1
The cap is big enough to hold my long hair but it does n't keep it dry , my hair is as wet af if I wore no cap at all.It also like to ride up over the ears .	-1
I am on my fourth or so pair of Speedo Baja goggles . The first few pairs were wonderful . They were wide enough to fit my big head , they were amazingly comfortable , and provided a clear view underwater . However , at some point in the last year , Speedo reengineered the Baja goggle , and so when I replaced my goggles with a new identical ( but new ) pair again recently , I expected another great goggle . I got something that 's not that.First , the entire product is a shade smaller than it used to be . The eye pieces are noticeably smaller than before . Additionally , while the goggles were originally clear all over , there are now gray panels on each side of the goggle . Lastly , and most importantly , the goggles do not provide clear vision underwater . I tried two of the new version , thinking that it was just a manufacturing defect on the one pair , but the second pair did it , too . I can see well enough out of the water , but , as another reviewer said , it looks like you 're looking through someone else 's prescription glasses when going swimming . This is not a good thing , since I ca n't even read my watch held right in front of my face . For that , I might as well skip the goggles entirely and go without.My recommendation is that Speedo get rid of this reengineered version of the Baja , and reinstate the old design , because that was a solid goggle . This new version , not so much . The Amazon image , by the way , shows the old version of the product - not the reengineered version of the product .	-1
The goggles are fairly comfortable and large , in fact a bit large for me which was a bit of a surprise but they do seal up fairly well . My complaint with these , and the reason for the two rating is thus.1 . They fog up almost as quickly as my old Speedo goggles ( several years old ) which is after about one lap of the pool . Of course I do swim in cool water , that may render a different result than using them in the tropics.2 . For whatever reason , these goggles distort my underwater view . Could it be the tinting ? I do n't know , but what I do know , is that my old goggles are clear and even though scratched up , they still provide a clear view.For what it 's worth , I would not purchase these again .	-1
This cooler is big . It has rollers for easy transport . It even has cup holders at the top . But it fails to do the most important thing - keeping things cool . It must be an insulation de-fect or design flaw . Or perhaps it 's not produced to keep things cool for long periods of time ( like 12 hours or a full day ) . This barely kept things cool for four hours , with ice in it . Everything melted.The problem with good coolers is that someone manages to steal it from you . So I had to purchase a new one . This looked good , but upon using it once , will never use again.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .	-1
Did n't do a think for me . Gun range noise in as if they were n't there . I threw them away . Enough said .	-1
These are for the very small ear canal people out there . The material is soft and comfortable and great . If it were just a little bigger , i would love them	-1
and sometimes you get what you want . NOT in this case ! Do n't know what you might use these for , maybe lawn mowing , chainsaw , any loud tool , or like me wanted to have something to use other then the ear muff type of hearing protection while shooting . Bad idea , poor fit , poor sound reduction and not worth the four days of ringing in my ear when the seal broke and was exposed to the booming sound of a shotgun going of in the next stall . Went back to the muffs , but the damage was done . Harbor freight has a similar device and fits really well in the ear canal and is like wearing the muffs , also cheap BUT they work , stay in my ears and can wear for along time without any discomfort .	-1
Adequate price , but you get what you pay for it . The curved lens refracts the light and creates distortion , which could cause minor headaches ( in my case ) and minor eye irritation . I would recommend buying a quality safety/ballistic eye ware , if your budget fits the need . Otherwise , this glasses offer a great value for the price .	-1
I usually do n't complain about products , but I had to write a review . Seeing how positive all the reviews are , I decided to give it a try , order it sight unseen . I suppose my expectations were n't that high given its price , but I ca n't justify spending any money on something that 's this bad . Essentially , it looks and feels like a $ 1 shade that you 'd get from a gas station or something . I mean , come on people , how could you even consider 5 start for this ? The edges are all very rough , and I ca n't even call those `` lens '' . It really feels like it 's made from recycled plastic bottles at home ! Anyway , I hope this review will either encourage Radians to improve their product quality & design , or have potential customers from buying altogether . FYI , when I got curious and did some research on the company , it looks as though it 's a generic OEM that markets under different brands . Again , I 'm surprised other brands decided to associate with this manufacturer .	-1
I was initially impressed with what I was acquiring for the amount of money spent . But I 've worn the glasses for around 10 minutes and feel my eyes straining like I 'm wearing a set of reading glasses meant for someone else . I do n't know if other have experienced this but it makes them nearly impossible to use .	-1
For the price I can not complain too much but these fog up just like the other models I have purchased that are three times the price . They do feel well and are light	-1
For around $ 7 I figured I could gamble but I lost . I got & # 34 ; anti-fog & # 34 ; clear lens . Immediately I felt like was just looking through any type of clear plastic not plastic designed to be lens . These lens have lots of glare . Also they already had a small scratch on one side . Comfort was ok but these will just be in my bag as a last resort extra . Look else where .	-1
Came already damaged during shipment . Quality overall-not good , decided not to exchange.Plastic made in China , still price is too hight for that particular product.Thank you .	-1
These glasses distort my vision , causing blurriness and a headache . They are supposed to be neutral and protective but instead they distort .	-1
Scratched after 3 uses . I am not sure if i did n't clean it correctly but i cleaned it the same way i clean my sunglasses and my sunglasses do n't have a scratch on them ! I will be calling my credit card company to file a purchase protection claim .	-1
Very bad protective glass design , it does not cover the lower portion of your eye.It is OK for shotgun clay target shooting but it 's really bad to use with 10/22 or any other small caliber in the indoor range.I really regret my purchase.Due to the design you are getting a zero protection in the indoor range with small caliber ammo.You have walls in indoor range and empty shells are bouncing back from wired angles .	-1
These fog up on my face all the time . I can not keep them close enough to my face to protect my eyes without them fogging ... the search continues : (	-1
Blurry , blurry , & blurry . The 2nd most important thing after eye protection is visibility ! ! Right out of the package very blurry , and I want to clearly see what I am about to shoot . I 'm not even going to bother reviewing any other things about these glasses as what 's the point if they are not clear ? ? Maybe I got a bad pair but not going to waist more time & money to try again . Maybe a different brand for a couple more bucks will be an improvement . Guess they would be good for you , if your interested in shooting things with a 1/2 awake 2am view ...	-1
These things scratched on my buttstock almost instantly from colliding with it with when I was wearing them during a tactical rifle training class . The anti-fog worked to some extent but not well enough . They were nice glasses for the price and I probably would have worn them more if they did n't scratch . I ca n't blame them completely because I bumped them into the stock . But they scratched easier than cheap sunglasses .	-1
After only a few uses with earmuffs the ear arm broke . The ear piece is soft rubber that is bonded to a hard plastic arm . The idea is to make the glasses more comfortable ; and it is more comfortable.Unfortunately it also makes them weak . The rubber end fell off after only a few uses making the glasses useless.I guess if you always put the earmuffs on after the glasses are on and then remove the the muffs every time you need to take the glasses off then they 'd hold up . But if you forget and grab the glass and pull the rubber end will get yanked off . It only takes a few times before they fail .	-1
These look neat , but they fit tightly enough to my face that they fog up when I 'm trying to shoot . Fundamental expectation of glasses : to be able to see out of them . Fundamental expectation of shooting glasses ( this is a big one ) : being able to see out of them while shooting a gun.Ventilation or some sort of texture on the frame would undoubtedly help .	-1
Got the glasses for riding in the dark hours and shooting indoor range . The nose piece is hard , not soft . If you wear it for a long period of time the nose piece start to dig into your nose and makes the ride or shooting thinking about making adjustment instead of the adventure .	-1
Stay away from the 2 burner Fold & Go . I bought this stove around a year and a half ago . I have used it many times camping and I wish I did n't buy it . First I will say that this stove is a gas hog beyond my wildest imagination . It eats propane almost twice more than any other propane stove I have bought.If you camp anyplace that has wind you obviously would not buy this stove since there is no wind screen . You would think that putting a wind block up would solve the problem which I made but ANY little wind that hits this thing makes the flames not even come near the pan or griddle.The pot holders are also to high above the flame , this causes whatever you want to put on take a while to heat up out camping . Took me around 45 minutes for my GSI percolator to make coffee.Also do not take the holders off and put a griddle on ; it will melt the handle.The stove itself has 3 settings ; off , high , and full blast . No matter what setting you turn the knobs for the propane it just flies out and you can hear it.The ignition on this thing works great but i would suspect it would since so much propane comes out at once . It is compact and takes up very little room . I would get another model if you do any camping but for around the house if you stick this in your backyard you would be fine .	-1
only good for very little children . i would n't describe it as a junior product . maybe a 4yr old girl could wear it . for my 10yr old boy they were way too tight and uncomfortable .	-1
These are standard Remington shooting glasses , great quality , excellent protection . However the `` Jr '' size is misleading . I bought two pairs for my kids , ages 5 and 11 . These glasses were too small for my 5 year old son , let alone my 11 year old daughter . Both complained of the glasses pressing too hard against their temples and above the ear . Neither of my children have a large head , so that 's not the issue here . Both kids then tried on the adult Remington T-72 glasses I also purchased as `` guest '' glasses , and they fit both children perfectly . I will be returning the T-10 youth glasses .	-1
dont like it at all . has no anti- reverse . you cant troll or land fish one handed . the first fish i caught was a 40 inch pike . i lost it because of the lack reel not haveing anti reverse . i fumbled around trying to hold the reel handle and rod with one hand and the big pike entangle himself on the nose of my kayak and snapped my 30lb spiderwire and swam away with a 15.00 rapala probably to die . this was the first day i used the reel . it probably is a good catfish or saltwater reel . but is useless for pike and muskie and slinging baits . sticking to abu garcia 's	-1
the reel handle jams up against the pole once in awhile also the handle came off and I lost the washer and cap to put it back on ... .I could have ordered the parts but returned it to amazon .	-1
The reel is nice sized and looks nice . I bought the ABF-50.I have 2 main issues:1 . Turning on the baitfeeder switch is twitchy . Sometimes it gets 'stuck ' and you have to turn the reel a bit to get it to go . It comes OFF baitfeeder without issues.2 . ( MAIN PROBLEM ) : The reel handle did n't handle catfishing.I loaned my rig which had this reel to a rookie fisherman , and while they were reeling very hard to get the 'cat in , they were apparently also pushing 'inwards ' fairly hard as they reeled . The metal in the circular section where the handle and the spindle meet ( the part that loosens when you unscrew the 'bolt ' on the other side ) was apparently too weak and got rounded , and then the reel handle would easily fold down no matter how tight the bolt was . I tightened the reel handle bolt all the way down and the handle still easily folded in and out as you reeled . I used a side-cutter , and formed and strategically inserted a couple pieces of wire hook in that gap and taped it up and tightened the bolt , and now the handle *pretty-much* does n't fold down , so the reel is at least usable . But it 's still 'squishy ' and you have to be careful to avoid putting inward force on the reel handle when a big strong fish is on . I think a reel of this size is expected to be used on big strong fish , and that reel handle should be designed to take a LOT of inward force when reeling , as that is human nature to do that , especially for people not used to catching very big strong fish .	-1
I bought these shooting glasses about a month ago . They look nice , they fit well for a small face . But , They are n't very good for shooting.The angled lens distorts the view , especially looking through a scope . Maybe it is the cheap plastics lens having parallax.I recommend looking for better shooting eye wear . I currently am using my Oakleys ' , they work great , but costly .	-1
A great idea but lacks refinement . This rack is ideal if you live in a low crime area and do n't hall much very often . I do n't hall much but this rack screams take me . I would have loved to see a bolt on connection at least that would make the thief do some work . If you can get it tight enough to your post this rack will work well . I felt the quick release is wasted because I want the rack on most of the time . Good : functions well , and looks nice . Bad : Price a bit high for this price you could get a more sturdy 4 point connection rack , hard to get the perfect fit , easily stolen.Thanks to the two concerned consumers who felt my review was too low I decided to update my review and drop this product one more star . I was actually being generous . This product is far more attractive than useful . Again it is not secure enough to hold much more than its very own weight . Even when I got the clamp on tight enough . The slightest bump required me straightening the rack . You may also want to reconsider a fixed rack if you have a nice carbon seat post . The clamp is big and bulky , my inner thigh kept rubbing against the enormous clip , the same clip that does n't secure the rack very well.RECAP1 . Expensive2 . Hardly support more weight than its own . You are better off with a seat wedge.3 . The Quick Release is huge.4 . Despite being huge the QR does not secure very well.5 . Easily stolen . If you have to secure your rack every time you leave the bike is that practical.6 . Looks Great ! I like the design of this rack which is why I purchased it . It is a simple clean look but poorly executed form does not follow function . It does not work for me . A bolt connection would have been a better connection , more of a theft deterrent , and likely smaller . Additionally , it should be attachable to the frame or the seat post .	-1
It only mounts to the seat post so bonking it on the side makes it go off-center . I kind of knew this when I bought it but figured I could tighten the # $ % ^ $ out of it and it 'd be fine . It 's mostly fine . Zip tie a milk crate to it and you 're off .	-1
Unfortunately the fire steel received was not the oak version that was ordered . I ordered this item twice ( both times showed in stock ) . The first time it did n't ship for a month and ultimately cancelled . The second time they sent the version with the plastic handle . The steel itself is good strong and sturdy and will get the job done . But , when you order something advertised you should get what you ordered . I suspect if I send the one back that I received I would be without for another couple months . Guess I 'll settle for the plastic handle version . This was from Optics Planet who I have had good experience with in the past . A bit disappointed this time .	-1
This is much thicker than i expected it to be which is a good thing . I suspect I 'll lose it long before it wears out . It puts out a good deal of sparks , the thumb grooves on both the steel and the whistle/scraper make it very comfortable to use and secure in the hand . The attached whistle is decent but with it being a `` survival '' whistle I 'd like if it were louder.Update : After rather little use the fire steel fell out of the plastic holder and rope lock broke . I 'd look elsewhere at this price point .	-1
I purchased this Swedish fire steel ( 12,000 strike model ) along with magnesium fire starter bars . I tried all of them and pretty much they 're all useless ( Swedish fire steel is slightly better at one and a half star ) . I lit several fires using them in my living room fireplace . I had to strike it 50-60 times and it was a pain to get the fire started in a perfectly dry and comfortable living room.The whistle is a joke , I can use my fingers and whistle much louder , but it 's there if you 're not capable of whistling with your fingers.Imagine trying to work with this in sub zero freezing temperatures with rain and sleet falling on you . If temperatures were warmer you would be using an ordinary lighter instead of this junk . Make sure to test them and practice with them before you actually need to use one in a real emergency survival situation , or else you might regret you have n't figured out if this stuff really works . Why does it come with black paint coating ? It 's advised to remove the paint for it to work.Lesson learned , carry two small Bic lighters and do n't depend on Swedish fire steel alone . The second Bic for backup of the first one and the Swedish fire steel as backup of a backup as last ditch resort . Also consider looking at peanut lighter . It is essentially a very low maintenance sealed Zippo lighter , where you do n't have to worry about the lighter fluid evaporating for about a year or two . I 'm going to purchase one of those to test next , but overall it 's hard to beat a Bic . Over 4 million Bic lighters manufactured every day , they have almost perfected the art of lighters . The biggest draw back for Bic style butane lighters is they do n't work when they 're extremely cold . But , you can keep them warm by carrying them close to your arm pits or inside your boxer shorts in survival situations . Once you take them out immediately light them , once they 're lit they warm up with the heat of the flame . Finally , if you do n't have good tinder or fire wood , you are SOL , even if you have a flame thrower some of those branches wo n't light up if they 're not dry.THERE YOU HAVE IT FOLKS ; ALL `` EXPERTS '' AGREE WITH WHAT I SAY : CARRY MULTIPLE METHODS OF FIRE STARTING EQUIPMENT WITH YOU to use in various conditions . And make sure you PRACTICE with them to make sure they perform to your expectations .	-1
I could n't light a dry , rolled-up piece of toilet paper with this thing ! Nor a piece of paper grocery bag . I gave it an extra star because it might be good with a propane grill , but if I was in a survival situation , I 'd be dead ! I do n't understand why people make such a big deal about this product . Have these people actually tried it , or are they rating it after observing the sparks ? I much prefer the Doan Magnesium Sticks . This , of course , is assuming there is no Bic lighter within reach.This product is a sparker , and that 's it . In all honesty , I 'd feel comfortable giving this to little kids as a sparker toy , since I 'm so sure they ca n't light anything with it .	-1
I done cleaned off the paint and are following the directions . . . lots of spark but wo n't even ignite toilet paper ! Toilet paper ? More than one hundred strikes , spark most every time and not even an ember . I 'm supposed to light a barbecue with this ? Really ? I 'm sure it 's a matter of technique . Question is do I have the patience to discover the proper technique to get my steak barbequed or wilderness camp fire going ? I think I best stock up on weather proof matches .	-1
I would recommend the Army model as it produces more and bigger sparks which is easier to get a fire going .	-1
got what I paid for . this is very small diameter rod and it is fragile . Looks like more attention was paid to the lanyard and cute plastic handles . I will not buy this again .	-1
i would be glad i had it if i was stuck in the wilderness.it is n't easy to use , but if necessary it can work . i took it on a trip to try it and ended up using a lighter bc it took too long . you have to have super dry tinder for this thing to work correctly .	-1
The rod came off the cheap little handle after only a few uses . I did not abuse it , I was rather gentle .	-1
This helmet only lasted 2 years with minimal use and kept safely in the garage . One day we noticed the outer wrapping ripping and saw a crack in the top of the helmet . Not sure how well this would really protect someone .	-1
Not a very high quality football . Spend a little more and get something nicer if you want to play football with it . Maybe get this for little kids to mess around with in the backyard .	-1
My football started tearing along one of the seams after only a week of daily use at 15 minutes per use . I did not pressurize the football after receiving from Amazon and now the ball is severely mis-shapen . I will have to return to Wilson under warranty .	-1
My son broke one of these with ease while eating ice cream with it . Good design but they feel a tad awkward to use and I 've used biodegradable disposable cutlery thats stronger than this . Next trip I 'll be taking those .	-1
I owned three of these , the two plastic ones snapped . One while stirring oatmeal , the other while cutting a hotdog . How totally lame is that ! ! ! As for the serrated knife blade on the side of the fork , useless . It does'nt cut as well as the unserrated other side of the fork . I 've read the reviews that said some people have cut their lip on the serrated blade . If your mouth is that tender , stay out of the woods , or at least visit isle 4 at toys are us and get one of the safety spoons for toddlers . You & # 34 ; ll find some real tasty gerber baby food that will be easy for you to digest.As for the titanium spork , it 's fine , and the serrated blade is equally as useless as the one one the plastic job.Both the spoon and fork are fully functional . I personally have some sort of blade on my most of the time so I ignore the one on the spork , not even sharp enough to bother filing off.I feel fortunate not to have been to far off the path when the plastic ones broke . I 'm betting the titanium one is good for life .	-1
for a do all pot for bare bones camping I see plastic parts as a no way not okay part for the money the things should be all metal brand name should mean all quality parts	-1
I needed rings to mount a 30 year old Bushnell Sportview 4X scope to a recently acquired Marlin 25N that I am restoring.I did n't want to spend top dollar so I decided to give these a try.The problem I have , like other reviewers , is that they does n't mount all that tightly to the receiver . I had to replace them .	-1
I ordered this to try and avoid paying $ 80 for an original replacement . I should have just bit the bullet and paid once . I had to grind this tube for about 30 minutes before I could fit it on my Norinco SKS , and then it never cycled properly . It only ejected a couple times out of the 50+ rounds I fired.The screws that hold the rail to the tube leave four extra holes where gas can escape , and one of them has already backed out and is missing somewhere.If you want to have to pull the bolt for every shot , and want a place to mount railed accessories , then go for it . But if you want it to cycle semi-automatically , buy a different tube . I 'm probably going to chuck this into the garbage .	-1
Well every SKS is a bit different , my gas piston slid right in , and I could n't feel any suction/compression.then to install , you may have to file a good bit off the square end , take off a little at a time and try to fit , I used sandpaper . I got it on the gun , and noticed it had about 1/8th inch side rock to it , no way Id ever put a scope on it , sure it could be shimmed and made secure but Im not a gunsmith , but it looks good on the gun .	-1
First off one of the appealing aspects is that it opens with a quick pull of the handle and closes quick pull of the base . It does n't work for me . I have to fuse with it to open and close it . I 'm sure there is a minor defect in it that I have to find and repair . Second the burner is too small for the units size . Third , the the burner is not what is pictured or shown in videos . I have to place the burner inside of the unit , then run a brass pipe connector through an opening and twist it on the burning inside the unit . The connection is pretty close to the flame . Plus the pipe connector is attached to the hose and does n't come off , so the hose is flopping around as I 'm installing the pipe connector . Its like spinning an octopus . Very annoying . I 'm starting to suspect Amazon gets the discontinued items , or rejects , from these types of companies after the products have been improved upon . Its not worth trying to return it . I will contact the company directly for a new hose kit . Other then that its a good unit . I just wish there was better quality control at the plant .	-1
If you are using WD-40 ( which is NOT RECOMMENDED by the way ) ... then this is a much better alternative . Unfortunately I was not impressed at all . It is a decent lube if you need something in a pinch I guess , but there are far-superior products on the market that cost much less and you get much more . Best bang for your well earned dollar would be a teflon-based or teflon-infused lubricant ( if you are fortunate enough to find one ) . Just because something is designed for a specific use , does not mean there are n't better products available . Fair warning .	-1
We bought and returned 2 sets of Bones Reds Precision Skate Bearings and finally got Rush ABEC-7 bearings . Reds used to be as good as the Rush .	-1
Ive been skating for 28 years and I have always skated NMB bearings , no fuss , just go . Well I cant find them anymore so I got these cause I have always skated Bones wheels so why not ? The NMBs in my last set of wheels are eight years old with many sessions on them and still roll way better than these do . I want my NMBs !	-1
Do not get this trap it 's really not even that good . I did not buy this off amazon I got it from my gun club but it 's the same exact thing so I thought I might rate it on here . I am A competitive pellet shooter down in AZ and I got this trap . My gun dented this trap up so bad it 's warping on the back . 2/5 stars .	-1
The dueling tree seemed like a good idea , but it just did n't work . I tried it on 2 separate trips to the range.When I first got it , I read the instructions , then I carefully oiled the spring collars and adjusted all the spring cams so that they seemed to swing . I could not make them take a uniform pressure to rotate , despite some cams adjusted to maximum tension and others to minimum tension . I also noticed a lot of rust coming out in the oil as I worked it into the rotating parts . But I decided to try it anyway.The first range trip , some of the paddles worked ok , others did not , then they all started binding and not flipping . When I retrieved the tree , I found that all the collars had reverted to the most fully extended setting . The problem with that is that the tree does not have enough room for all the paddles when they are on the minimum setting , and it causes them to bind.I shot .22LR Federal High velocity HP rounds , ( blue box ) out of 3 automatic pistols , and 3 rifles . The choice of firearm did change the performance , but I did not have any .22 magnum or .17HMR to try.I took the tree home , oiled it again ( getting out more rusty oil ) , and re-tensioned all the hex bolts . I went as tight as I could go without stripping the bolts , and took it out again . The same thing happened , all the tension collars worked out to their loosest setting , resulting in the tree binding again.I considered taking the tree apart and reworking it to remove the spring mechanism , and tilt it farther forward to work the reset , but for $ 50 I should n't have to do that , and then I would not have been able to return it ( which I am doing today ) .I have used homemade dueling trees with the v-notch and post reset system , with a spring over the flipper , and I think that works much better than the spring-cam that this tree uses . I think it is probably cheaper to make as well.I gave this 2 stars instead of just 1 , because the paddles are actually a lot beefier than I expected . I think that you could safely shoot smaller centerfire pistol ammo at this ( 9mm , .38 , .40 ) , but I do n't want to test my theory since I am returning it .	-1
22lr will not budge the targets , and anything bigger goes right through it . This is just a waste of money .	-1
The flip targets are secured to the bar with a hollow piece of metal tube through holes on the bar . Secured by friction only . Not sufficient , as one of them came off in the box when I got it . Just imagine how it will hold up with rounds hitting it.Also , the reset system is missing a vital piece of rectangular metal . The one that clamps with the middle reset target so that the resetting mechanism would work . 2 voice mails and 1 email within 2 weeks , nothing.Do n't get me started on the instructions . So poorly written a drunken monkey can do better . One has to rely on the pictures of the completed item to get an idea how to put it up or what parts they are referring to . How about learn a few things from IKEA . Their stuff are far more complex , yet somehow they are able to produce very easy to follow instructions . Oh , that missing piece I mentioned above ? It is clearly on the parts photo , yet missing under the parts list of the same instruction manual.Returned it .	-1
The target that I received has three different sizes of plates . It Has a 4 inch , a 2 1/2 inch , and a 1 1/2 inch . The instructions were for two different targets , neither of which were the one I bought . It is front heavy and needs to be staked to the ground . The bullseye stickers only fit two of the plates . Not recommended . Not worth sending back . Look for something else .	-1
this thing is too small and flimsy to be much use ... .i thought it would be larger and more sturdy since its made out of metal , but i was very wrong ! better off spending 4x the price and getting something solid and sturdy and much larger ! ! !	-1
It is advertised to withstand 30-06 , but after two boxes of soft-nosed 30-30 @ 100 yds two of the targets had fallen and the rest were showing extremely heavy bending and indentations , just about to be perforated by the bullets , a 30-06 will for sure pass through these like cardboard ... . Guess it is only for .38 spl , .380 and alike ...	-1
I shot each of the targets 1-3 times at 125 yards with a .223 and then went to look . All of the targets held up to the shots great , but all of the welds on the swing arms cracked and 4 of the swing arm couplings split down the side . The targets now flop around a bit . I 'm afraid to shoot them anymore because they will come completely apart . I am going to have to have a weld sop do extensive reinforcement to these before I can use them as advertised . I go to shoot these targets a total of 20 times , that 's an expensive target . I highly advise to stay away from this product.Amazon says & # 34 ; We welcome your honest opinion about products - positive or negative . We do not remove reviews because they are critical .

At 25 and 50 years the 3 tagets are being battered so badly they will soon shatter , even after light usage . Also , you have to shoot down towards to ground all the time , reccommend purchasing one that is higher .	-1
Could not get the targets to swing up with .38 special ammo at 20 yds . Had to bring the target closer to 10 yds before it would work right . 30/30 ammo at 50 yds damaged the paddles badly . Needed to move the target out past 75 yds for that caliber . Both the yellow paint & target stickers flew off on the very first outing .	-1
It had 1/8 & # 34 ; soft foam filler . Advertized as Airsoft vest . Might as well wear a BDU jacket instead because this will not stop the sting at all . It might be good for a Halloween costume but if you use it for Airsoft you are going to get hurt ! A thin plastic sheet sewn in each pannel would have made this an effective & # 34 ; protection & # 34 ; vest , but as is , offers little more & # 34 ; protection & # 34 ; than a Tee Shirt . I 'd like to see the seller/manufactuer make a You Tube video of them being shot withh a Airsoftgun and show how it protected them !	-1
It keeps stuff waterproof but I do not trust it very much , it is worth probably $ .50 any more than that and you can get better bags in the hiking section of Walmart . Seriously $ 8.88 gets you a great hard water proof case , sure you can not take pictures through it ... ... .but who really takes pictures with a camera in a bag when a waterproof camera on Amazon can be had for $ 60 ?	-1
I 'm not a hearing expert or audio engineer . A rule of thumb however , is that any noise level that prevents normal conversation is potentially damaging to your hearing . Even short term exposure can cause permanent hearing loss . The noise level of this pump is so loud that any conversation with anyone within a few yards of this pump is impossible . In my opinion , this pump requires noise reducing ear plugs for safe operation . At the very least , there should be a warning label advising the use of ear protection . There is none provided by the manufacturer . Of course , my unit could have been defective . But I noticed many other reviewers commented on the loud noise this pump produces . I 'll stick with the inconvenience of the foot pump that came with my inflatable kayak , rather than risk my hearing .	-1
As many other people wrote , one of the two hooks would n't fit over the eyelets on the back of my boat . I had to grind down the top of the spring loaded flange with my Dremmel tool to allow it to be opened far enough to fit over the eyelet .	-1
The material seams very durable , the handles very well made , although I have it only 2 weeks , but feels made with very very strong materials ... ... the colors is great ! ! ! ! Price for me its very reasonable.But for some reason 2 ( bad ) of 10 ( goods ) rides while my kids where in it some times the buoy went like a submarine ( kind off ) so I had to stop the boat immediately ... ... .. this was not a good experience . We will use it some other days and see what happen . hope would not happen again to rate it better : (	-1
I had previously purchased these same shorts , size 36 , in the store , and they fit well . Upon comparing these to my old shorts , they were noticeably smaller . I ended up purchasing new shorts , size 36 , from my local store ( more expensive than on Amazon ) , and they were clearly bigger . I love the short , but these are much smaller than advertised .	-1
Purchased these for my son for swim team based on the reviews . Yes , the fabric is nice and it fit him perfectly , but after one wearing and swim meet the hole where the tie goes has already started to rip . Not a small rip but at least an inch . I am going to try and sew as he needs it on a daily basis . I am not sure if it was a defective suit to begin with , but I will tell you , when we received it the box was crushed . It may have been returned and re-sold . From now on this is something i will go to a store to purchase .	-1
These are not for the frequent swimmer.I average over 50 miles a month . These only lasted a couple months before the material got saggy and wearing thin.Just about see through on the back side.Bought the Speedo Endurance . If you are thinking about this TYR , DO N'T . Get the Speedo Endurance instead.I swim over 60 miles a month . The Speedo Endurance is keeping up with me just fine .	-1
I bought these specifically for the fact that they were the only ones I could find that were made in the USA . BUT they are not made in the USA , they are made in China . The packaging is also different then shown so I wonder what the `` sold exclusively by '' claim is for ? The item is fine but NOT what is being advertised and that is why I am giving 2 stars .	-1
UPDATE ! ! ! I have now gone through my second compass . Both compasses stopped pointing north eventually , both would settle on 3 different directions not matter how still or level the compassed was placed . I even had a group of people try it so I did n't feel crazy and nobody could get it to work . Suunto replaced them without a problem but I tossed them in the trash when they left me hanging in the woods .	-1
The Suunto Clipper Micro Compass is not accurate or reliable . It consistently failed to point in the proper direction which renders it completely useless . I repeatedly tested its accuracy against other compasses and it continually failed to point in the correct direction.When it comes to utilization of a compass reliability is a significant factor and this compass is not reliable . In addition , it is made of plastic and is easily breakable.I do not recommend this compass .	-1
I recently purchased a Crosman PC77 and bought these to mount a green dot/laser combo to my pistol . Read all the reviews and hoped for the best . After receiving the intermounts promptly from Amazon ( no complaints there ) I tried mounting them as is without doing anything to them . They seemed to be mounted pretty solidly , but after putting on the dot scope ( the smallest and lightest one I could find ) there was much movement to the set up . Took off the mounts and applied tape to the inside contact points per other reviews suggestions . Still too much movement , much of it in the barrel itself . Epoxied the barrel to the breach ( per another review suggestion ) . Remounted and still too much play , in the mounts themselves . Tightened as much as possible without stripping the bolt head ( which was about to happen ) and still slippage to the mounts . I ended up epoxying the mounts to the barrel and finally all seems firm . I really wanted to keep the cost of the mounts and sight under the cost of the gun itself and although I was able to do that , I do n't think the time invested to get a product manufactured specifically for my pistol by the same company that makes my pistol is justifiable . One thing I would highly recommend if you have the same problems I had is using JB weld for the epoxying chores . I always have it in my garage for many duties and it not only holds firm , the color matches the black look of the gun as well , if funtion and form are important to you . Live and learn .	-1
I bought this for my 1377 and found that it could n't be made tight enough to not have the scope move if touched . Worse yet , the allen heads on it stripped with very little torque ... If you really want to scope this gun , consider getting a new breach with the mounts built in .	-1
You can not use these mounts to solidly put a scope on a Crosman 1377C . The fit is so loose and wiggly that putting a scope on top of the mounts is useless . Spend the extra money for the steel breech kit that should come on the 1377C in the first place . I 'm returning this product immediately . I hope this helps some folks .	-1
These are too narrow to mount a red-dot sight that is designed to mount on a Picatinny rail . If that is your plan , you should buy another product .	-1
I got a set of these mounts for my 1377 and when mounted they move from side to side enough you can not set a scope or red dot sight zeroed ! ! Get you a steel breack kit and not this junk ! ! !	-1
The reason for 2 stars is only because I found these at the local wal-mart , 19.99 for 40 ! Co2 is Co2 why not get the better deal .	-1
They are great for the first 10 or so shots but power falls off very quick . When using one should expect to change ever ten to fifteen shots to maintain accuracy .	-1
they claim to be Crosman Brand cartridges , but what you will get is off-brand cheap cartridges . I am very familiar with CO2 Cartridges and I can tell you straight out that all Crosman produced Cartridges will say `` Crosman '' on the side . It 'll take many compliant apparenty to shut the seller down.the fact is that every time they doop someone they have committed a scam , and in most places in the word scams are illegal . I just wish someone would do some thing about it.hope this info helps you out : - )	-1
I 'm new to air rifles and made hundreds of shots trying to zero in a rifle using these pallets . Then I tried http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N49NMW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 ? ie=UTF8 & psc=1 and started laying in tight groups . Same gun , same shooter , different pellets .	-1
I bought these based on positive reviews , but my results were poor . I tried to use them in my Gamo air rifle but they fit very tight compared to the pellets I had been using . I was getting poor accuracy and was frustrated . A friend with a Gamo air rifle ( different model ) and I sat and fired off a few dozen side-by-side at a target and both of us got dismal results -- very poor accuracy . He was unimpressed ( I had been for some time ) and so we tried his pellets . We both immediately got tight clusters on target . His comment & # 34 ; I would n't put these through my gun for anything & # 34 ; and I agree . I do n't know what the problem is , but they do n't fit well and sure do n't shoot straight , at least with our two guns . Perhaps we just got a bad batch that was oversize .	-1
none of the pellets would fit in my Hatsan Striker Edge . These pellets have what appears like an outer ring which madeit impossible to load . They may work well for other air rifles but not a Hatsan Striker Edge .	-1
My Rifle Hated these pellets it was impossible to make any type of a shot grouping withMy Crossman M4-177 . That was surprising from Crossman when I was younger theWay they are made these days is somehow different . The shipping was lighting quick.It was not the sellers fault.ThanksWayne	-1
Plain and simple , if I had the money , I would buy Spalding just so I could shut down production of the Never Flat basketball . It 's that bad . If you are a real basketball player , a shooter , and have already used one you know exactly what I am talking about . Despite the best attempt by Spalding the pump does throw it off out of balance , hardly works to begin with anyway . If you can drown out the terrible *PING* it makes when you dribble the ball you still have to deal with the unpredictable return on the ball to your hand , both off the ground , and off rebounds . Parents do your kids a favor , spend the extra couple bucks and get a the most expensive ball Spalding offers . I think its only $ 50.00 , just get the good one .	-1
I dont care for this modle it did not fit the bike correctly and when i opened it up there were marks on it like someone had used this derailluer before and it was supose to be a new one . I sent the derailluer back and amazon has been great about that so far .	-1
This is NOT a man 's watch ! The watch and the band are so small they would not even look masculine on a Homunculus ! And unlike the picture , the band is not a cloth weave . It is that cheap nylon with Velcro `` fur '' all around it . Looks stupid and is uncomfortable as all get out !	-1
Velcro band has very small area of contact , so comes undone when swimming.I had this for about 6 months & it died . Only used in the pool , does n't appear to have any moisture in it , never depressed buttons underwater , does n't appear to be flooded or have moisture in it.Has features desirable for swimming & diving ( SCUBA ) such as large , easy to read dial , digital `` back-up ( yet again , digital , back-lighting & analog quit all at the same time , so glad this happened on land ) & that I never used it for diving.I 'm going to look for the old-style , single-button Casio watches that last roughly 5-6 years with extensive diving to 160 ' , routinely to 70'.I may have gotten a defective watch , but not impressed that both analogue & digital died together . I 'll be looking for a watch with a true back-up function or a very plain , simple watch again that 's more reliable for a back-up for my bottom-timer .	-1
I have owned many paintball masks but this one seems to be made for a child . I wear a large sized hat and this mask was way too tight . It left marks on my face from the hard foam around the goggle and the band was too tight . It is very uncomfortable and gives me a headache . I switched out the band with an old goggle and it is a little more comfortable but the foam that JT uses around the goggle is not comfortable and will irritate your face . I suggest getting something other than a JT . This mask does fog some in the summer but not as bad as one without thermals .	-1
It worked ok , but the batteries are EXPENSIVE and LASTED 5-10 MINUTES tops ! ! !	-1
These are great but be ready to go to your local hardware store and pick up some better wall anchors . The ones that come with them can barely support the weight of a bike .	-1
Works okay , but takes many passes to get the barrel clean.Okay , but I would buy BoreSnake if I had it to do again .	-1
Update June 2 , 2012 : I was initially happy with this product . You can rad my initial review below and see that it was an easy setup and I thought the product to be good at what it does . The 4th time I used it however the tray detached from the wall , taking some paint with it . The wheel had moved SLIGHTLY in a lateral direction while I was hanging the bike and that was enough.I notice now that there are some perforated holes in the tray that would allow you to pretty easily put 2 screws through them . That 's great and probably what I will end up doing to reattach it.Former title : Easiest possible install and it works . Having a friend help with the install saves your wall a couple of scuff marks.I purchased this as a companion to theRacor B-1R Solo Vertical Bike RackI purchased . Paired together you get an efficient way to store your bike . I can not possibly explain how simple the install of this product is . After you install the Bike Rack Hook , you hang your bike and have a friend make a mark on the wall where the bike 's back tire touches the wall . You use the sticky tape included with the Tire Tray to attach it to the wall , and then use the weight from the hanging bike 's back wheel to hold it in place.That 's it.My only complaint , if you can call it that , is that I have a certain sense of buyer 's remorse when it comes to theRacor B-1R Solo Vertical Bike RackI purchased . The product works fine ( as long as you can find a wall stud to mount it in to and I fortunately have a stud finder in my toolbox ) but I subsequently discovered theCycloc Popsicle Wall Mounted Bike Rack : Orange , which while being MUCH more expensive is aesthetically and space-wise more appealing .	-1
I have a snake for my 12ga that has the borebrush embedded into the cloth . This is a 2 piece snake which has a borebrush on a rope and the cleaning cloth on a rope . Does it work , yes . Is it as fast or convenient as others I am used to , no .	-1
I 've owned lots of different kinds of bike stands over the years and this is the worst ever.I 've got a couple of bikes stored on these , and they 're stored together in a corner of a garage where I keep my bike tools , accessories , pump , etc . Seems like I ca n't grab either one of my bikes or any other biking gear without knocking one of my bikes over . I realize that it would stay upright if I did n't hit it . But a bike standing in a rack ought to be able to withstand a gentle nudge without falling over.I 've examined these several times to make sure I 've assembled them correctly - I think it 's just a faulty design . The wheels help get the whole thing rolling , and once they slide just a bit after tapping the bike , the bike is history.Maybe the folks who like these racks are just less clumsy than I am . Well - that 's almost certainly true . But still , these are too prone to allowing my bikes to fall.Soon headed for the dumpster ...	-1
These people need to buy a tape measure . As others have noted , it is a 55 cm . TKO can print whatever they want on the side but it is not 65 cm . Further , it is not nearly as sturdy as a previous fitball . The only advantage is that this is inexpensive . Unfortunately it is also cheap .	-1
When I got it , it was nearly impossible to blow up . Had to use a air compression machine ( which they say not to ) . Never did get it up to 75cm fully inflated .	-1
Ball says 65cm but it is only 55cm . I have another exercise that is 55cm and is labeled as such , and the TKO ball is exactly the same size . I also measured it and it is indeed only 55cm.What a bummer . I inflated it for nothing and now have to return it . Otherwise , looks to be a decent ball .	-1
I could barely manage to get this scope to zero ... hopefully it holds . I have it maxed out on the left/right adjustment and I swear when adjusting it sometimes what was meant to move it left actually took it right ( after previous adjustment had worked correctly ) .	-1
The zoom control froze the first time I shot with it . My Mosin Nagant kicks hard so maybe this scope would work with smaller caliber rifles or pistils . The focus knob really does n't work but the focus is fine for 50+ yards .	-1
The scope I received had double cross hair lines in optics . I noticed this after I mounted it on my 91/30 Mosin rifle . The cross hairs were also too thin for me . I could hardly see them at any focus adjustment . Especially , the horizontal line . The lines remained doubled at all focus adjustments . Based on the majority of the positive reviews , I must have received a lemon . Anyway , I returned it to Amazon with ho hazel .	-1
did the whole mosin scout sniper set up . went to the range , could n't hit paper . adjusted to the max , was still two feet right and 3 feet low ... hunter guy next to me could n't figure it out either ... could be the mosin , could be the user , or maybe it 's an NcStar $ 30 scope ...	-1
install the scope on the mosin m38 . found the ring is too low and hard to adjsut the scope . may be good for handgun .	-1
I hate to give a bad review but Amazon wants all my reviews SO > > > > , The scope would not hold A zero and was unusable after 3 power , the picture was black . mabey I just got a bad one , but it was terrible and compleatly unuseable . Amazon gave me instructions on how to return it . I had a refund even before they got the scope back . they certainly make it easy to do business with . This is the only item i have had to return to date	-1
Cant figure out if scope works well or not . The included mounting rings come loose after every shot I fire out of my mosin nagant . If they intend for this to be used on lighter weight guns then they need to include that in the description and not lead people on .	-1
I purchased this scope in mid July 2013 but did not get to use it much . First off , when I opened the box and removed the windage adjustment caps the slotswere all chewed up , which leads me to believe this was not a new scope . I have zeroed this scope many , many times , and it will not hold to the settings . It will hit great for a couple of times , then it 's all over the target . I purchased this for use on a Benjamin 392 air rifle , and I am totally disappointed . I would not recommend anyone purchase this scope .	-1
I bought this like many others for my Mosin as a scout optic option . Well , the first one broke while zeroing it in . I took a shot , about my fifth or sixth of the day , and a peice of debris inside the scope completely blocked cross hairs . So I sent it out to NCStar for a replacement and they sent another one to me . Zeroed this one out and got a few good groups out of it , but after a while I was all over the paper . This problem persisted . I Loctited the Brass Stacker Mount , and Locticted the UTG scope rings I bought for mounting and those were all solid , but the scope has never held a true zero . It might be good for pistol applications it 's intended for but for my puropses I think a lower end red dot like a bushnell or something might suit me better .	-1
crummy litle adjustment caps . have rubber cover but no steel cap just a liitle rubber circle that pops over the steel ring surrounding the adjustment screw.easy to loose . the scop is fine , but the rubber coating allows movement and you loose the zero . buy the less expeive non rubber one and you will be happier .	-1
I bought this with the thought it would be a good replacement on the handle without adding more hardware . I saw mixed reviews but thought it might just be a bad 1 or 2 of them.Scope came very quick and packaged well . I have bought a lot of NcStar stuff and always had good luck . Not so much with this.To begin with it is not super easy to install . The way it clamps down it will scratch your handle . Not to mention the quarter size knob and a bit difficult to get it started ( could be user error though ) . Once on it was a tight and fit well . I put it in the vise and it was level . Good sign.Loves the idea of rubber coating for durability and liked the mirrored lens.The main problem , and reason for the low rating is I could not get it to focus properly past 6x . I thought it was me so I had my wife try , who has eagle eyes , and she could not get it to focus sharp after 6x.Too bad . Thought I found one . They were good with the return though .	-1
I purchased this scope for my Crosman Phantom ( a 1000 fps spring powered air rifle ) . At first all was fine and then after trying many things to improve the accuracy of my rifle I realized that it must be the scope that was giving me a hard time . During my most recent shooting at 20 yards the first 4 shots were decent and the fifth one impacted my target one inch higher than it should have ( point of impact changed ) . To see what the deal was I fired another four or five shots at exactly the same spot and they too were all about one inch high.In the end I concluded that it was indeed my scope because I had experienced trouble similar to this before and to correct it I have had to resight in the scope . It was pretty poor on my part not to realize that I needed a scope that is airgun rated but it does not say anything about this in the description . The way I found out that it is't airgun rated is because I found the exact same scope on airgundepot 's website and it says : `` Note : Do not use this scope on any spring air rifle with a rear recoil . It is not designed to take this kind of recoil and it will damage the scope . Any scope damaged due to use on a spring powered gun will not be returnable '' .So in short I discovered the hard way that you do infact need an airgun rated scope for any springer airgun . If I would have known this I would not have needed to spend additional money to get an airgun rated scope . The total I spent would have got me a very nice leapers 3-9x32 scope . So do go ahead and spend the additional $ 20- $ 30 bucks if you still want a variable power scope . If not you can find many 4x fixed magnification scopes which run about $ 25 bucks.I suppose this scope could be used on a low powered pump gun but still you will have to worry about it potentially getting bumped which may quite possibly move it off course .	-1
The product I received was not the one shown . The one shown in the main pic has a normal `` glass '' looking lens . The one I received has the `` ruby coated '' lens . This lens , as shown in the pic I 'm uploading , is mirrored orange and makes a bright orange glare that will surely get the attention of game or enemy combatants . If you want to ONLY shoot targets , get it , but if you are police or military , etc , or a hunter , then this scope will quickly give away your position and either spook game or get you killed . Too bad it 's too late to return it .	-1
ive used several ruby lens scopes and this one does not even come close . i did a little research on ruby lens 's and found that on cheap scopes the ruby is only used to make the poor colors from the other lens 's less noticeable	-1
The scope is super blurry above 6x.It zeroed easily , but I put it on a .22.It was only tested with 25 rounds , and seemed to hold zero once it was locked in.The optics suck and are extremely blurry.It may be better for an air-gun where inside 40 yards is where you are shooting.This review gets 1 star because SCOPES SHOULD NOT BE BLURRYUnfortunately , I waited longer than 30 days to actually test it . Now , I am stuck with it.Oh well ... .You live and learn ...	-1
I conducted a s earch for a & # 34 ; long eye reflief & # 34 ; scope and this NC Star scope was the main reslut with LOTS of reviews that were positive . I figured for the cheap price it would be worth checking out . The scope arrived on time and in good packaging , however the scopes eye relief is TERRIBLE . I would not reccomend this scope in anything other than an over-the-receiver mount on a 22lr .	-1
The ad reads as follows ... Product FeaturesShooter Series scope is ideal for hunting and target shootingFully multi-coated lenses with ruby finish provide bright , clear images3-9X magnification , one-inch tube diameter , and 40-millimeter objective lens ; 16-ounce weight and 12.2-inch lengthMatte black finish ; comes with lens covers , mount , and Weaver-style ringsIncludes limited lifetime manufacturer 's warranty ... ... WRONG ! There is no mount included ! I had to order one seperately . The scope is great , but the reason I ordered this one was because it came with the mount and rings .	-1
Scope was cheap , weaver rings pulled through when tightening.Scope was installed , reinstalled , adjusted 3 times over 200 rounds with an AK . After rings pulled out , I removed the scope and returned to iron sights . I was n't expecting much from this scope , and it did not meet the minimal expectations I had.Will not purchase again .	-1
Mounted this to my Remington 597 .22At either the 50 or 100yard range the scope view is distorted at the periphery on full magnification . I needed to roll back magnification to see the cross hairs sharp again . Eye relief is about 3-4 inches . Even at that point a slight deviation produces blur at the periphery or at the center depending on the distance from your eye.Comparing the scope to my Nikon BuckMaster 3x9 on the same day I think the ruby coating affects the clarity and reduces ambient light.If you are on a budget and want a workable scope save a bit more for a Nikon Prostaff which can be had for around $ 125 when on sale . You really get what you pay for in this case.I would *not* recommend this scope.In my opinion It 'll only take one range trip and 2 x 10 round mags with a side by side comparison with an actual decent scope for most people to realize that this thing is actually a piece of crap ...	-1
I purchased the Reliance Fold-A-Carrier II thinking that it would be a good idea to have a compact water container for camping or emergency use . However , this container has not been a good product and ultimatly a waist of money.Upon receiving it , I filled it up to try it out . Its lid sealed and worked well , but the plastic of the container itself is very thin and has a lot of `` sag '' with a considerable amount of pull on the handle area when filled . At that point it worked and seemed that it would be fine for the intended `` backup water container '' purposes . It was emptied , allowed to dry , folded and stored until needed.About two months later , we needed to use it for an overnight camping trip . Upon filling it with water for only the second time we noticed that it had developed a small hole on the side near the bottom beside one of the folds . Sadly , the Reliance container was worthless.While you might have better luck with this product , in my experience it was a big disappointment that I can not recommend .	-1
This pump head is a little hard to use and for the price your better of buying a good quality air pump .	-1
It worked OK on schraeder side , but Presta side was not good.1 . The yellow lever is awkward compared to standard `` flip-up '' lock.2 . More importantly , at high pressure of road tires the air starts leaking through the Schraeder side as you approach the peak PSI.I returned it and got Blackburn Air Tower 2 for $ 22 . It has two separate holes too , but the design is slightly different and seems to be working better with Presta valves .	-1
I could not get this pump to work . Too cheap to return , so I threw it away . I have the larger version , and it works well	-1
First off , I want to say that this pump is amazing and works great ... . If used for a a racing or road bike with very small tires that require a high pressure . My low rating is here to help those who might accidentally buy it for a hybrid or mountain bike.This thing is not capable of filling up tires in hybrid bikes or mountain bikes . Even using a skinnier tire ( 35mm ) this pump failed to pump at all even after several minutes of trying . In fact , I LOST tire pressure . I took it in to a bike shop , thinking the pump was broken , and the employee showed me the error of my ways.So if you are trying to fill up a hybrid or mountain bike , pass on this pump . If you want to fill up a road bike , this pump is amazing.I should mention that I now have a racing bike . For kicks , I pulled this guy out of the `` Donate to goodwill '' box that I started but never donated , and tried it out on my bike . It worked great , and I got up to a good pressure without much effort . The tires used Presta valves btw .	-1
it left me high and dry this past weekend so I had to hike a bike . stupid thing would n't even pump 5-10 lbs into my tire . lucky for me someone came up and came me a spare co2 that got me limping back to the trailhead .	-1
This is an okay pump but Lezyne makes a great pump . Love Lezyne products and found that they are more durable and easier to use . On this product dislike that the end slides on to the stem , it does not screw on securely . We had issues with the o-rings falling out . It was just a pain . I would not recommend unless you are used to using this type of pump and are not looking to put high pressure into your tire . If you are looking for something easy to screw on , high pressure , and smaller to slip into your pack , I would recommend the Lezyne Road Drive .	-1
I have liked a lot of Topeak 's products . They are not high-end , but they usually work well and are good for the price.This one , however , is awful ! Very poor design and hard to use . First , was figuring out how to switch it to the Schrader valve , which , thanks to fellow Amazon reviewers ( and not Topeak ) I was able to do . ( You need to unscrew the gray cap and rearrange the inner black pieces . ) After switching to the Schrader valve set-up , it was VERY difficult to get this on and off the valve stems . I was really worried I would damage the tube ( as I 've now read others have done , completely ruining their tubes ) . I found that it is easier to unscrew the gray cap , put it on the stem ; take the black rubber pieces out and put it on the valve stem ; put pump onto black pieces ; screw gray cap down ; pump tube ; reverse set-up instructions to remove ... . Very lame and difficult , but if I do n't do it that way I 'm pretty sure I would destroy my valve stem and tube like others have done.In shot , I 'm sending this back and getting a different one .	-1
It worked well enough on my mountain bike but fell apart when I tried to use it on my road bike . Just pop for one of the better Topeak bike pumps like the like the Road Morph G Bike Pump .	-1
I tried using this frame pump because my rear tire seemed a bit low . The valve fitting was tough to figure out without having read the packaging explaining how to reverse the inner fittings , but I finally got it to work.When I tried attaching the pump to my tire valve , it was too tight - it kept pushing the valve into the tire , and I could n't get a good seal between the valve and the pump . I eventually gave up and decided to fill my tire at a gas station , but I could n't get the pump off my valve . It took my a good five minutes of struggling with the pump , trying to force it off the valve before I figured to unscrew the cap of the pump.Unless I 'm using this pump incorrectly ( which I do n't think I am , but would be willing for someone from the manufacturer to correct me ) , I would not recommend this item .	-1
I ca n't get it to connect to the valve so that it actually pumps air into the tire to save my life . Construction and quality are very good and the small size is great , but if I ca n't pump up my tires with it , it 's useless .	-1
I 've owned this pump six months and have used it only about 5-8 times . I 've ruined two presta valves and deflated two other tires before I was smart enough to hold the pump so it pumped air into the palm of my hand . Nothing . No air . At least I know now why my tires keep deflating rather than inflating . In the trash it goes .	-1
I was pretty satisfied with this pump.Then it broke the valve off two of my tubes.This is a great little pump for taking with you for the occasional small pump-up on the road . However , BE VERY CAREFUL to hold the valve end still . In using it for pumping up tires most of the way , I had two unfortunate situations that the movement back and forth of the pump actually sliced the valve off my tube , rendering them useless ( with a big ol ' hole in them ) .	-1
The manufacturer advertises this pump will fit all three types of valve stems . That is not true . It will ONLY fit the very skinny type - not the standard ( Schraeder ) valve stems . Please be aware of this before purchasing .	-1
The plastic adapters are formed from low yield/tensile strength poly , so the device is only good for inflating a few times before it wears out . But so long as one does n't use it as a primary means of inflating tubes , it 'll function as an emergency inflating device a few times . It takes 200 strokes to achieve 50 psi in a 700x35 tube . This product is n't worth the money . I should have bought a CO2 cartridge inflation device for my bike tool kit .	-1
How to use this pump , based on my experience:1 . Buy the pump . Carefully follow previous reviewers ' instructions about converting it for Schrader valves.2 . Stick the pump in your bike tool kit without thoroughly testing it first . ( Hey , I said this review is based on my experience . I did n't say I was smart. ) 3 . Experience a flat tire.4 . Remove wheel and tire , patch or replace inner tube , put everything back together . Pull out pump.5 . Spend anywhere from five to thirty minutes , depending on your patience level , trying to latch the pump onto the valve securely enough to inflate the tire . Push , shove , pull , yank , twist , slap , bang , jerk , wrestle , grunt , sweat , and implore the bike gods , which is problematic because they do n't actually exist , all to no avail , because the pump WILL NOT seat on the valve well enough to actually pump in any air . ( It is possible to jam it down on the valve stem so hard that you 're afraid you 'll never get it off again , but not possible to force any air through said valve stem. ) 6 . Despite having followed previous reviewers ' instructions exactly , suspect that you have n't assembled the pump correctly for Schrader valves . Spend another five to thirty minutes , depending on your patience level , disassembling and reassembling the parts in every possible configuration , finally concluding that it was correct in the first place because no other configuration even looks like it might be right.7 . Spend another five to thirty minutes pushing , shoving , pulling , yanking , twisting , slapping , banging , jerking , wrestling , grunting , sweating , and problematically imploring the bike gods , all to no avail , because the pump WILL NOT seat on the valve well enough to actually pump in any air.8 . Give up . Walk the bike home . Get out your floor pump and inflate the tire in sixty seconds flat.9 . Get on Amazon and read the reviews for a bunch of other portable tire pumps . Order theBV 11 '' High Pressure Micro Floor Pump , In-line Gauge , 140 psi , Reversible Presta Schrader , Long Hose , Frame Mount.10 . Decide to be smart this time and test the pump before a tire goes flat on the road . Deflate a tire completely and pump it up again with the BV pump . Discover that it works beautifully . Dance for joy.11 . Get back on Amazon to write a scathing review of the Pocket Rocket and an enthusiastic review of the BV pump ... .Or , you know , you could skip steps 1-8 and just buy the BV pump in the first place . Granted , it 's a little heavier and bulkier than the Pocket Rocket , and a little more expensive , but I for one would rather carry a slightly heavier pump that will actually inflate a tire than walk all the way home with a lightweight pump and a flat tire I ca n't fix .	-1
The build quality is nice and it feels nice in the hand size and weight-wise but lacks where it counts : not being a pain in the behind to attach to a schrader valve and staying attached . Sigh . I should have gotten a gas inflator .	-1
This is the second time I fell for the `` one size fits all '' statement from these third-party bike part manufacturers . I tried to install this on my wife 's Giant mountain bike with disc brakes ... an hour later and a few modifications I got it to fit . If you are planning on using this rack WITH the Topeak basket ( `` MTX Basket Rear '' TB2005 ) on a women 's bike STOP NOW ! ( Women 's and small frames : ) The mounting holes on the frame for the rack are too low and , due to the angle of the seat post , the seat will hit the basket . Though the instructions state `` bend to accommodate proper installation '' , you will have to create a severe bend to 'accommodate ' the frame on a women 's bike or small frame . I also had to slide the rack far back on the rails in order for the Topeak basket to be able to slide all the way forward without hitting the seat.Also , once the slides are bent they tend to bend quite easily . I ended up having to marry-up another pair of slides to these in order to make them rigid after bending them . At this time is when I noticed that the rails from my D***a rack were 50 % thicker than the Topeak ones and much harder to bend.The post/standoff that clears the disc brakes was fine . We have the standard Giant-issued disc brakes and used the factory-bored holes int he frame . No problem there . I did , however , have to use two-washers on one side to keep the bolt from hitting the sprocket ( which is advised in the instructions . ) Other than that , the frame is well-suited for large frames and men 's bikes with disc brakes on the rear . If you have a quick-release seat post , I recommend using it to attach your rack slides . You will find you have to bend the slides less or not at all.Other points : - Instructions are in English , French , Spanish , Italian , Japanese and Chinese . It also shows great exploded diagrams and good illustrations of an installation.- Comes with two rear tail light mounts for the optional `` RedLite '' ( TMS004 ) and `` RedLite UFO '' ( TMS017 ) . The Tail Light mount has mounting holes 80mm apart.- Made in Taiwan , if that matters to you.- 6061 T6 Aluminum tubular construction with stainless steel fitting bracket ( which I have been calling `` slides '' ) - From placard : `` 1 Size fits all 26 '' or 700C frames '' I give it 2 stars for the sheer hassle of installation and blatant disregard for installation on women 's bike frames .	-1
I 'm a big fan of Topeak 's gear . I own two of their racks , couple of pumps , bags , etc . I use the MTX trunk bag/panniers to commute , and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover . I purchased this , and to my surprise -- -- Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie . Yes , the cover is yellow . Yes , there 's a reflective triangle . But that 's not the same as a blinkie . Gee , Topeak , do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain ? Stupid lack of planning .	-1
This pump has a very minimal design that mounts snuggly to a mens bike . I used zip ties instead of the included velcro strips to secure it.It did n't end up fitting my Schwinn mountain bike tires even after the bike shop mechanic showed me the & # 34 ; secret & # 34 ; reversible nib hidden inside the pump nozzle . Could n't find a work-around online for that .	-1
Gauge is pretty accurate . Pump works well . However , the mount is useless . Lost the pump on the first long ride - on PAVED roads .	-1
Using a pump should not be this hard . The pump allegedly comes in the Presta valve setting and you can change the pump head to accommodate other valves . My tire valves were Presta so I was set to go . However I was not , for the pump head would not fit on the valve at all . All you are given is a stupid diagram on the back of the box showing you the anatomy of the pump head . I figured a piece was missing so I took the head apart and only two pieces were removable . I emailed the company and they said there should be three removable pieces not just two . The company offered to send me the missing piece but instead I opted to send the pump back . I really did n't think , from the size of the pump , it can do a good psi , but that is just from the feel of it .	-1
Let me start out by saying I ride my bike 4000-6000 miles a year . So I get my share of flats . I thought this might help as a backup to my regular use of CO2 cartridges ( which really is the best way to go if you are in a hurry ) .There is a design flaw in this product . When strapped to your bicycle as directed the screw-cap that holds the rubber attachment to the valve stem comes off over time . Once it comes off , the pump is useless . Good luck getting Topeak to replace the part . I tried , and they basically said - it is out of warranty . I feel this is a design flaw.I only needed this 2 times in a little over a year . The first time I needed it I noticed the cap was loose , tightened it , and the foot pedal broke . That was not a big deal . The pump did get a nice level of inflation . The second time I went to use it the cap was gone . I had no CO2s , remember the pump is my `` failsafe '' backup - and it failed . Topeak would not fix it and I threw it away.I now use and love my Lezyne pressure drive . There is no design flaw . It can be used on both presta and schraeder valves . I have used it multiple times and never a problem or loose connection . see : Lezyne Pressure Drive Black Small	-1
I tried using this to air up my tires when I got it in as a test , and the pressure needed to air up my adult bike 's hybrid tires literally blew the nozzle off the bike valve . 3 times in a row.If you have a really low pressure tire like a child 's tire , it might work .	-1
Avoid this pump . It 's a plastic POS . If you have to pump > 50psi God help you ... .Sorry I bought it ... ..Dumping this RUBBISH and getting an old school ALL METAL full size frame pump !	-1
This pump was confusing to figure out which direction to plug the gasket . When I finally figured it out , locked it on my mountain bike , and inflated the tire , the pump then refused to let go of the Schraeder valve . I worked at it with such effort , it finally tore the whole valve off the tube . Returned the pump .	-1
I will be brief , and I will try not to repeat comments that others have said.First , the image that is presented is designed to manipulate one 's perception of size and depth.The pump handle , foot brace , and meter are much smaller than the manufacturer has suggested with their images.It is like deodorant manufacturers , who put their product into oversized packaging.Secondly , and most importantly , this gizmo came without any instructions ? Yes , a bike pump needs to come with instructions ; since many people do not know the difference between a scharader or a presta valve . I spent two hours the first night trying to figure out how to get the pump to work . The following morning I was on Youtube for another two hours , when I decided to take the pump to the park . I met an experienced biker , who builds his own bicycles , and it took him 1/2 hour to figure out how to assemble and use the pump.Finally , the pump 's instructions are just as important as having a functional device . The manufacturer seems to assume that everyone is mechanically inclined , and that everyone has been cycling for a while . The pump was useless without the instructions . It makes no sense to buy a product , and then is unable to use the product . If you a mechanically inclined , then this pump shuld not be in an issue . Otherwise , please feel free to get some assistance . I do give the pump a recommendation for purchase , but beaware of the missing manual , and the smaller than what the image has suggested . The pump is sexy , and then it looks good on my bike .	-1
Bought this to hold the Alien tool ( it did n't come with a way to attach it to the bike ) . It dropped the tool so many times that the tool broke from impact . Yet another piece of fine Topeak engineering . Buy it for looks & expect it to fail .	-1
I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I HAVE TOPEAK BAGS AND I CA N'T TELL IF IT IS MADE FOR THE STEM OR WHERE THE WATER BOTTLE GOES ? ? ? ? ? I KNOW I CAN USE IT WITH SMALLER BAGS LIKE THE CELL PHONE BAG WHICH I ALSO PURCHSED . SOMEONE PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE ... ... ONLY ONE STAR CAUSE I 'M NOT SURE WHERE TO USE THIS . NO DIRECTIONS IN PACKAGING .	-1
I have had many portables over the years and trust me and buy the more expensive 50 or 70 dollar type.. they have there own water that you fill the tank with and its own little pull out lever flusher and kind of work more like home.. this one is for number one and looks like number 2 could be done.. yes , it can be , but not worth your time.. having said that , you real survivalists out there will be more than happy with it.. lets just say , it gets the job done ... lol.. Cheap price and when ya got ta go ya got ta go.. so , I guess average for the money .	-1
i recieved this one hour ago . the bucket itself is fine ( more later ) where they break off the lid mold , three spots were never cleaned or finished and other edges were not smoothed.the inside of the seat had three pointed , sharp , hard plastic miniture knives sticking out , one was dead center where the penis rubs , think children , these were about 1/8 '' long.after removing these three super sharp points , i spent another 15-20 minutes smoothing other semi sharp edges ... .the seat fits the bucket fine ... .the seat needs to be heaver duty ... .. i do not think a person over 150 should sit on the seat lid ... .the seat lid swings up 90 degrees then stops i think one person leaning back , or heavey person and the lids a gonner ... . the bucket has a large label stuck to the bucket and a note about free sample of deoderant bio-blue there was no bio-blue , there are no directions or literature but its labled a chemical toilet.i live by a major fault line , i do not recomend this item , this is the lowest grade i have ever given.problem is the other like items look just as bad.p.s . with seat on bucket , bucket handle will not go all the way up -bangs into seatso a full bucket would angle like starting to pour .	-1
Lesson learned . MTX fender does NOT fit the explorer rack by topeak nor the MTX trunk system . Not sure why this is marketed as MTX as it only fits on the post mounted rack . Topeak products are better than this , poor marketing strategy ... or good marketing strategy ? Seems solid though , but I can not use it for my application .	-1
I believe that this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon . Looking at a few of the more positive reviews , I can only imagine that those who mention packing clothing or shoes in this bag must be super-petite . I could n't get a decent-sized lunch in this bag , let alone any clothing-okay , maybe a case for my glasses . I 've had middling-sized handlebar bags that were more useful . The MTX bag is bigger , but still hardly worth it . Skip this item .	-1
The bag was nice but just did n't last . This bag seemed to be well made and looked good under my seat . It was relatively water resistant for my stuff on the inside and if cinched tightly , it did n't have an excessive amount of jiggle . The medium bag easily fits a tube , bike multi tool , keys and a cell phone . I used it solely off road for 2 months before one of the straps pulled its stitching loose which also ripped the side of the bag . For the duration , it only held a tube , plastic tire tools , multi tool , and occasionally a cell phone , so it was certainly not overly taxed with weight.For perspective , I should say that I ride on fairly rough trails and average 200+ off road miles per month . However , I have a Cannondale seat bag that has lasted for 15 years under similar conditions and is still functioning . I 'm sure I 'll never find a bag to top that but I want more than 2 months out of it . For road riders , I could recommend this bag . For off road , it is not up to the task . **UPDATE**I contacted Topeak and they suggested I send it back and they would replace it . The replacement was the same model bag which will have the same problem , but at least the customer service was good .	-1
This product is well constructed , however , I am not impressed with the zipper location . In order for me to open the compartment , I have to loosen the straps on the side because the zipper is pressed against the underside of the seat when the straps are tight .	-1
Tore easily around the straps after not even one season of use . A friend of mine also has one of these and it has done the same thing . The attachment on the zipper also broke off and made it very difficult to use the zipper . This is crap , move along , nothing to see here .	-1
I did enjoy this bag while it lasted . Unfortunately , all my bike rides are 8-30 miles of fast rocky New England terrain and all the movement apparently caused my bag to rip at the seams in two different locations . Pretty lame but I now use an Osprey hydration pack and carry everything in that so I am happy .	-1
Used this twice.Worked once.The second time I went to use it , the hose popped and I lost all my pressure in my fork . I used some packing tape to try and close up the hose so I could get some air into the fork . No go , I could still hear some air hissing out somewhere . I checked the head and it came off in my hands . It totally separated from the hose itself.Piece of crap . I threw it away . Wasted $ 30 .	-1

This rack works great , except that the eyelet connectors are bigger than other racks . This covers the second set of eyelets on the frame so I ca n't put fenders on . Might work on your bike , might not . Wo n't work if your bike is a Redline Conquest Classic .	-1
It does n't work on my motorcycle . It wo n't engage the valve sufficiently to let me fill tire with air . Topeak kindly sent me another but design problem obviously prevents its use for intended purpose .	-1
I was n't going to use it as intended . I wanted to make the valve for my air shocks more easy to fill . I failed to research this a little more.However it will be great for it 's intended use . I ended up using my head and ordered a valve extender for RV 's and trucks .	-1
I bought this to use with my Bontrager air shock pump . It still allows air to escape upon removal . Waste of money for bicycle air shock inflation .	-1
I ca n't figure out what the benefit is here . It loses more air upon removal than just using my pump does . Upon setting it and giving it its first pump it is supposed to allow my pump gauge to display the contents of the tire . It does , but nowhere near correctly . Not worth the hassle of returning . I will stick it in my son 's Xmas stocking and let him be the one to throw it out . Useless .	-1
What more is there to say ? I bought this because trying to thread my compressor onto the rear tire of my motorcycle is a nightmare . After only two or three uses the tip will no longer thread down far enough to put air into the tire . It 's definitely not the valve stem . I ca n't get this to thread enough on ANY of my tires now .	-1
I got these to try to work around the small amount of space that is available on motorcycle wheels . Great idea , but I just could n't get these to work with either a compressor or with a hand pump . Oh well . They do work for bicycles , so Ill keep it around for that .	-1
I get about a 25 % seal rate on the internal check valve . I like the design and compactness/functionality in concept , however it 's bothersome to not have consistent results . Have n't seen anything else on the market that performs this job of accessing my bike air-shock so this is what I 'm stuck with for now .	-1
Purchased in July '12 . Worked nicely for some time , but on a ride today I hit a bump and the stem snapped at the mount along the weld . An attached light and cell phone went skittering over the pavement . Maybe I had it overloaded , but I do n't consider a bare Samsung Galaxy Nexus 2 and an LED light overkill . I 'll try the Minoura next and see how that fares .	-1
The concept behind this bag is a good one . I like the idea of being able to quickly remove the bag when I lock it up somewhere . But the plastic bracket that secures the bag to the underside of the saddle broke less than a month after I started using it . I 'm going back to using a `` low tech '' bag that just uses a simple velcro strap to secure the bag so I do n't have to worry about this happening again .	-1
I bought this at the LBS , which is great because I can take it back . I wanted it for my wife 's bike , but the Bontragger seat that came with bike does not have the more vertical rails that this bag would fit on . They are just straight out . The bag clip has about a 30 degree or more angle , so wo n't fit at all . So , I tried it on my mountain bike , the rails on that saddle are too close . I tried it on my Brooks saddle , their too far apart , I tried it on the Scott saddle , again , it wo n't fit . So , what saddle will it fit ? I suggest taking your saddle in to the shop to see what will fit before you buy one . I 'm going back to the strap and hook , simple system , no worries about if it will fit . Other than that , I do like the bag style . Looks like it would have been very useful system . Too bad it wo n't work .	-1
Purchased this because it said it works with all valve types . The cardboard that came attached to this item had vague , hard to find Heiroglyphics explaining how to switch pieces to make it work on a Presta valve . The Topeak website and support were useless . Luckily I had seen other ads about other brand pumps with a similar design to figure it out what to do . It still took a couple of weeks and multiple flat tires to realize that one of the parts that had to be removed was not going to come out without some force and proper `` locking handle '' positioning . Even when it is working the gauge is difficult to read and does not give a reading unless pumping . Pumps ' internal valve also seems to allow the withdrawing of some air backwards into the pump creating more work than necessary . The mount also sticks out a little too much causing your leg to hit it occasionally while pedaling .	-1
Be careful with this pump . The locking system is counterintuitive and not user-friendly . To lock the nozzle , lift the handle . To unlock it , lower the handle . And twice my skin got caught in the lock hinges as it was snapping shut . Also , the gauge is difficult to read . I will be returning this immediately .	-1
Do n't buy if you have a bike that uses presta valve tubes and/or requires tire pressures greater than 80 psi . I bought this pump for my old bike which was a hybrid and used shraeder valve tubes ( the one you see on cars ) . It worked great and even bailed me out a couple times on the road . Since I switched to my most recent bike that uses presta valves , this pump has been an utter failure . The pump puts too much physical pressure on the valve . You have to kind of force pump 's head onto the valve . More than that , it 's a small handpump so it 's fairly weak . You 'll have to put in a lot of effort to get the tires inflated to a high psi . All the yanking and pulling you 'll be doing while pumping will spell disaster for the already frail presta needles . I went through 5 tubes in one week with this pump . They all had their valves broken off . I honestly ca n't recommend this pump for presta valves in any scenario .	-1
This bottle cage just did n't work on my bike . It requires a bike that has screws already in place for bottle cages ( my bike is too solid to drill holes in -- I tried ) , and it 's not shaped so that you can use clamps . This took me awhile to figure out , as it comes with no directions at all . I took it to a bike shop and ended up just buying a different kind .	-1
If it stayed on it would be great , alas . It 's fallen off three times while riding and the problem seems insoluble . The attachment mechanism is inherently flawed . It 's a little expansion wedge that seeks to exert enough pressure on the hollow stem it expands into to resist gravity , which is always pulling down against it and gets augmented by every bump you encounter . So it 's just a matter of time until you 've run over enough bumps until the fender falls off again while you 're riding.Tightening the wedge tighter is no solution . In fact , if you tighten it too tight , it fails immediately because the wedge pushes itself right out of the stem . And if you tighten it too loose it also fails . And if you tighten it 'just right ' , it will fail in a few weeks . So it 's hopeless JUNK !	-1
Bought it for a 23 '' frame 2007 Specialized Rockhopper . Unfortunately , the rubber insert that expands in the front fork stem to hold the fender on is too small for the hole in my bike 's stem . I could n't find any way to make this fender work and gave up on it . I gave it two stars because the construction seems OK , and it might be fine if it actually fits your bike .	-1
Most days this sits at home while the comparable RaceRocketHP goes in my jersey pocket ... much easier to use and worth carrying a few extra grams for	-1
Great little pump BUT its for presta valves only please note that . Other than that 5 star 's for grade a material used in making this pump.Made me want to pick up some presta valve tube 's but i got to send it back .	-1
This is a great pump . I like it because you can push against the ground since it has the adjustable hose . I was going to buy in the local bike shop , but Amazon had it for about $ 12 less ! Update : This pump was great until it broke on me only 10 months later . It is an emergency pump , so I hardly use it . I needed it yesterday and it started getting hot as I pumped it . I let it cool tried again and felt a great resistance ... .until there was none and it broke .	-1
I 've not been so disappointed/disillusioned on anything that I 've bought on Amazon prior to this purchase . Sadly I ws n't able to ship it back within the return period.This product is so thin & flimsy , not to mention so low to the ground you almost fall trying to sit on it , if you dare.I bought this to take camping since at times you do n't know how far away from the potty 's you 'll be . Needles to say ( from above ) it never made the trip.My opinion , unless you 're going to use this for a male or a child , I would n't waste my money ! ! ! I 'll go to Lowes/Home Depot get one of their high buckets , put a bag in it , an old toilet seat from my basement & have a much better porta-potty then this . Which is what I 'm going to do for my next trip .	-1
I RETURNED IT ! In my opinion , this toilet is cheap . Cheap as in poorly made , and too expensive for what you 're getting . The only thing going for it , is it is lightweight and portable . The plastic mold is two pieces glued together , then you have another piece of cheap plastic that goes on top that you sit on . There are too many moving parts to this unit . This design is not going to hold up over time . This may be a good choice to use for small children while on a camping trip , but as an adult female , I would not feel comfortable using it . It is n't sturdy enough . I would rather try the Luggable Loo . It 's just a 5 gallon bucket and a toilet seat . Period !	-1
This saddle bag is in the trash . I mounted it on the bike . Put some tools and a spare tire in there and closed it up . Then I opened it up to add a spoke nipple and everything flew out all over the place . The back door opens up much too far and everything just slid right out . There 's no way I want that happening by the side of the road . This is useless.I tossed it in the trash and put an older saddle bag back on until I can find something better.I figured out why this bag did n't work for me . It 's designed for the body of the bag to be almost vertical but to do that you need a 6 '' seatpost at least . My Serotta only has about 4 '' of exposed seatpost so the bag sits at the wrong angle and as soon as I open it everything spills out . My wife 's Trek Domane and my new Trek 520 both have very long seatposts and the bag works great with them.If you mount it at the angle shown in the marketing photograph you will have the same problem I did . Take a look at your seatpost before ordering one .	-1
Topeak The Mini 9-Function Bicycle Tool do n't know why i have this in my review do n't have this tool someone must have updated the wrong account looks to small to use	-1
It would be impossible to bike with this tool . It is very heavy . I wanted something simple to bike with . However , this tool would be good to use around your garage for fixing bike .	-1
I do n't carry this with me ... .lots of stuff but too heavy so it stays in my garage and is not used much . Thank you .	-1
The tools are pretty useless and it wont go back together because the clip broke the first time i took it apart . Its heavy and bulky . Go to your bike shop and find something that works .	-1
You 'd think a pair of pliers might be on the list of 26 tools this thing has , especially as there are so many other things that are useless.Its not a bad idea : tool strong enough to use all in one handy place , but the tools included are things I never need , and the ones I do use ( pliers to adjust cable tension ) are missing.Also large and very heavy , so you 'll not be taking this on a ride as an all in one tool.But it does include a church key so not completely useless .	-1
Gripping this to break sticktion on a hex nut will release the clip holding the two halves together.It 's easy to accidentally poke the knife point into a fingertip.The pedal wrench is a joke . It ca n't remove a pedal , but might be able to tighten one just enough to get you home.The allen wrenches are long and straight , so they only work where you have major clearance . If you 're in a tight space where you might use the short elbow on a normal allen wrench , this wo n't do ( remove handlebar clamp ) Basically , someone said `` we have this toolbox part for allen wrenches , and people want a bike tool ... Let 's see what we can stuff on here . I know , a bottlecap remover too ! `` Really , this is a pretty poor tool , and if the finish did n't scuff so much on the first use , I would return it .	-1
This tool is far too expensive for what you can do with it.We put my son 's bike together with this tool , but we had to supplement it with other tools .	-1
I do n't know what it 's for but I hope it 's not important . Reminds me of the springs attached to V-brakes .	-1
Neat design and probably great for Practice Rides , but I would never haul this much extra weight on a Century or Double-Century ride . Made in Taiwan , not China - looks like good Quality of the tools .	-1
The tool 's pin bent out of alignment on only the second time I used it . This is not a cheap product so there 's no excuse . I tried to bend the pin back with a pliers so that it would line-up again with the chain pin , but I just could n't do it . Luckily , I had a back-up chain tool on my EyezOff Multitool and was able to get the chain back together again . VERY DISAPPOINTED in Topeak !	-1
I 've had this pump for about six months and it blew apart below the handle where the Topeak logo is . Looks like a weak point in the construction to me . Also the smart head is hard to get on and off and puts a lot of stress on the valve stem breaking it and causing premature failures . Forgot about customer service from Topeak after buying their products . They already have your money and they do n't care . Read all the reviews here and you will see alot of people reporting similar issues and poor customer service.Try the Lezyne floor pump instead which is better quality and rebuildable .	-1
This is in general an excellent pump . We used it for a couple of weeks with no issues . However with the guage up top this pump is extremely top heavy , particularly when given its narrow base . If you have it sitting in your garage it falls over with the slightest touch , if its bumped or even with a slight gust of wind outside . After it slams in to the concrete a few times the guage no longer is accurate , no surprise . If you buy this pump make sure you lay it down , or hang it up when you are not using it or its guage is going to be worthless in short order . Topeak makes other pumps with much wider , more stable , bases , I recommend one of those if you want your guage at the top . If you want a narrow base pump , I suggest you get one with the guage at the base , then falling over will not put so much force in to the guage when it falls over and hits the floor.Update : My wife now hates this pump , since it bit a chunk out of her finger . Apparently the lever on the head snaps back with a lot of force and the slot it goes back in to has a very sharp edge . Another aspect of bad design .	-1
I 've used quite a few pumps over the years . I must say I am very pleased with this unit . I 'm not sure how long it will last . It 's mostly made of plastic so do n't abuse it but functionally , it works great . It gets a tight seal with little effort and releases smoothly.Update : after having used this pump for several years I can report it still works okay ; however , the plastic threaded fitting where the tube connects to the pump has failed . I managed to get it back on but it 's very weak . If the fitting was made of more durable material this would not be a problem but as it 's rather soft plastic it 's a failure waiting to happen.Update # 2 : As predicted the fitting has failed completely . I tried using some pipe thread tape to make it work but the tube kept blowing off the fitting when under pressure . It is now history after less than 3 years of light use .	-1
It comes with attachments , but they do not work . I thought I was buying a decent pump and paid a little extra , but am very disappointed . It comes with a ball attachment ( basketballs , volleyballs , etc ) and a stabiliy/exercise attachment , but they do not attach to the pump . At first , I thought it was me , but I have had several of my friends try it , and they all agreed it is useless .	-1
Originally bought this pump for my mountain bike and it works fine . Have also used it to fill my car tires and works well on them too although takes a ton of relatively easy pumps . Last month bought a new road bike and after my first ride and a few days in the garage tried to bring the tire back up to 100+ psi . OMG , I weigh 200 lbs . and after the first 95 it is so hard to get anything else its almost not worth the effort . If I put all my weight into it and literally lift my feet off the ground with each pump I can get a additional 1 lb . Multiply this stressful effort times 25 pumps and I can finally get 125psi . This pump is garbage for road bike needing anything above 100psi . DONT BUY ! ! ! !	-1
Called the company when I had trouble getting more than 90 PSI from this pump . They told me that the label was misprinted ! This is a 90 PSI MAX pump , not the 120 PSI printed on the label . These pumps should be recalled ! Also , the connector is a pain . It 's difficult to connect a presta valve compare to others I 've used ( Cannondale ) .	-1
This pump requires excessive pressure to pump , even at low pressure . At first I thought I had a bad presta valve on my tube , so I did n't return it . Sadly , it exhibits this behavior on all bikes . I 've used the next model up ( friend owns ) and it is much easier to pump . I wish I bought that one . Big disappointment with this . Two stars because it is functional .	-1
It works when you are able to successfully insert the presta valve in place.Success if you did n't tire yourself out trying to use it . Success if you did n't hurt yourself apply all that pressure and forcing the presta valve to go in place . More success if you did n't break your valve stem in the process . Just saying !	-1
Frist of all this is a big pump , your going to have to use the mounting kit that comes with it or move your water bottle and mount it on the forward bar . That being said overall the pump is well made except for the most important part the piece that attaches it to the valve stem . I have a masters in mech engineering , manufacturing no less and been in the business for 40 years . It 's easy to see some cheap Chinese supply replaced the flexible nipple that is suppose to be on the valve connector with a hard plastic one . It should be something that collapses and compresses on the valve stem , very common on the cheapest of pumps . Instead it is a hard plastic piece just lets the air go out . I would love to get one that worked , but I think it 's a crap shoot and I could get another one with wrong part . Some Chinese supply made an extra .4 yuan a part and cost me 7 dollars in return shipping fee 's . No thanks just return what 's left of the money and I will find another pump on Amazon , Topeak normally is great , really sad to see them puts these out there .	-1
Broke the first time I tried to use it . Made of poorly made plastic parts .	-1
I got this product in hopes of using it with my very heavy , very large 45lbs downhill mountain bike . After trying for a while to make it work , it would turn out that this stand is n't sturdy enough for a large bike . The instructions state not to put something more than 30 lbs on it , despite advertising it as a stand that can be used with a mountain bike . It also states it can not handle wheels larger than 26 '' . I tried using it with my hybrid bike , which is much smaller and lighter than my mountain bike , and the stand still struggled to work with it . I then finally tried it on a female friend 's hybrid bike ( which is s considerably smaller than my hybrid ) and the stand worked fine.So if you have a heavy bike , or a bike with a large frame , this is n't going to work . If you have a smaller bike , it will probably work , but there are better and cheaper options . Topeak normally makes great products , but this one is a dud .	-1
I bought it from a cycling distribution rag even before Al Gore invented the internet . At first I liked it , but it started to bug me after a while . First is that it stands the bike up too high even on it 's lowest setting -- the back wheel is several inches up in the air . Not a big deal , but somewhat of a pain . The next issue was when I graduated from my steel frame bikes to carbon , the `` cradle '' that holds the bottom bracket is just plain not big enough . It allows the BB area of the frame to slip and slide all over . The last thing that really sent it over the edge was the plaastic piece that joins the main body to the single arm that goes around the downtube , split in half . I was just putting a rack on the bike , so it was n't like I was really wrenching on it . I called Topeak who is usually excellent in CS , and they said they do n't offer replacement parts for this device . So , I would stay away since the design is a bit old ( small tubes ) , and it could have the tendency like mine to break . I 'm going to try to epoxy it back , but we shall see.I own many , many Topeak products , pumps , racks , bags for racks , you name it and they are very well engineered . This is by far my least favorite of the Topeak lineup .	-1
Had this for 15 months and this is not very stable . Maybe due to the seasonal contraction and expansion in my garage , the spring tension in the pole has given way at least 3 times , twice the stand slipped off the ceiling joist stud on its own . But once it is installed , it is great but if you live in a zone where the temps in your garage varies greatly with the season , watch out ! ! !	-1
THE SHORT : It 's hard to secure the bike stand tightly , and the risk of it falling makes me uneasy . However , if you must absolutely have it , buy at a physical store and not from Amazon . Amazon does n't pack bulky , non-book items well before shipping , and the stand can arrive in a bad shape and/or with missing parts.THE LONG : The idea behind this bike stand is excellent , but the product itself could have been designed better . First of all , installing the stand is intuitively simple : [ 1 ] erect it , [ 2 ] adjust the extension tubes so the pole fits the height of the room , and [ 3 ] step on the locking stepper to secure the pole in place . However , getting it installed the way you want it is rather annoying ; it 's hard to secure the bike stand tightly between the floor and ceiling . After I erected the stand , extended the tubes , and made sure that the pole was perfectly perpendicular to the floor and ceiling , I stepped on the locking stepper . However , because it 's so hard to to get the locking stepper into its locking position , I had to apply a lot of force . Doing that ended up moving the pole around , and when I finally got it into the locking position , the pole was tilted , no longer perpendicular to the floor and ceiling . ( For safety reason , you do need to make sure it 's perpendicular ( that 's common sense , I think ) . By the time I got it to work , I must have sweared at Topeak a zillion times . Getting the bikes on the hooks was also a pain for me because I have mountain bikes . I guess if you have light road bikes , this should n't be a problem for you.The part that made me give this product one star was that it fell on me and my cats . Luckily , they were fast and escaped safely . I was n't injured , but all three of us could have been . I followed all the instructions when installing and made sure that both my floor and ceiling were solid . I think the extension tubes slid down over time . After all , the mechanism that keeps the tubes extended seems to rely only on simple clamping tension ; there 's no foolproof locking mechanism in place . The locking stepper does n't help either . I know that if I just kick the bike stand lightly , it will fall . That really worries me because as my cats get bigger and bigger , they can knock it over if they bump into it fast enough . If Topeak could fix the extension tubes and somehow make the locking stepper a `` locking pumP '' ( i.e. , pump the mechanism with your foot to gradually tighten the pole into place , perhaps by incorporating a hydraulic system ? ) , instead of a push-really-hard-once-to-lock mechanism , I think it would be a much safer product.Last but not least , Amazon did n't pack the item well when shipping . The package arrived in a bad shape with holes all over the box . And guess what , one of the screws went missing ; it must have fallen off from one of the holes . I tried to contact Topeak to buy a replacement part from the company , but I got no response whatsoever . Fortunately ( if you call it that ) , it was n't a critical part . If you think the bike stand is safe enough for you and will buy it regardless of anyone 's review , I think you will do yourself a favor if you buy at a physical store , not Amazon .	-1
This is n't a terrible bike cover , but it is expensive and comes with several caveats . First , I have a 17.5 '' MTB and it barely fits over it . The front portion only covers about 1/2 the front tire and it 's the same with the rear tire . If you 're hoping it will protect against anything other than dust , you 're kidding yourself . Second , since it is such a tight fit , it takes too long to fit over your bike . It 's like trying to fit 30 '' jeans on a 36 '' waist . Good luck with that . Finally , if you plan on putting any after market accessories on your bike , such as a fender , rack , or mirror -- you can forget about this cover . It barely fits a bike without any accessories . It 's worth about $ 12 , costs $ 30 , and does n't cover well at all . I actually bought an inexpensive motorcycle cover to fit over my MTB with accessories . Half the price of this and double the coverage . See review here : http : //www.amazon.com/Pilot-Automotive-CC-6323-Silver-Motorcycle/dp/B0031I209W/ref=cm_cr-mr-title	-1
Initial review is below . I have 3 of these . Inflating my tire this morning and the extension popped off the valve ! There is a little threaded rubber insert that threads on to the valve . I would guess this is glued into place . It is inserted into the valve stem and allows for the secure attachment . I should say I was pumping my tire to 120 PSI but I would n't think that to be a problem . In any event , for 8 bucks and less than 2 months of use , I will likely think twice about buying another.Bought a set of 44 deep HED wheels and the HED valve extenders included would n't seal . Had to use teflon tape initially . These hold a great seal ; no problems opening and closing the valve . The standard length worked for me which is about 40 mm . If you are use valve caps , they will fit once the valve is screwed back down .	-1
As a few other mentioned , after a few washes , the chamois is loose and bunching to one side or the other coming out of the drier . Takes a few minutes to fix . Bought a pair of Pearl Izumi bib-style and I 'll never go back . Not bad for what you pay , but I 'd rather spend 2x the $ and have PERFECT .	-1
I got 8 ' MH rod . The rod broke in 2 places on my first trip and the fish was gone . I do n't recommend it . One star is too much for this product .	-1
My family has several of these , and they 're great right out of the package . The problem is , the lids do n't seem to hold up too well , and you ca n't buy just a new lid . E.g. , the backstop valve in the center has come off of one ( so it spills through that hole ) , and on another , the drinking valve feels there 's something stuck in it ( so you need to be a professional horn player to actually get any liquid out of it ) . On other ones - and this is pretty common - the 'hinge ' of the drinking valve has gotten loose , which , again , leads to leaking.So , at this point , I have about 7 bottles , and only 2-3 working lids . If you could buy new replacement lids , this would be 5-stars , easy .	-1
The CamelBak BetterBottle is a hard plastic , BPA-free reusable water bottle . It comes with a bite valve , where by biting down on a plastic nub , you can suck water up through the included straw . The assembly can be disassembled for cleaning.The plastic bottle is comparable to a Nalgene bottle in strength . It even has the same screw threads , so you can attach an MSR Miniworks water filter to it . Cleaning it is a cinch with any normal-sized dishwashing brush.But the problem for me , and it 's a serious one as you might lose the precious fluid within the bottle , is the top . The bite valve leaks , and if you have it on the outside of a backpack , and the backpack gets turned upside down -- for example , you turn it over as you shove it into a car trunk -- then water will dribble out . If the bite valve is lost ( which can happen during washing more easily than you 'd think outdoors ) , then water flows out steadily and there 's no way at all to keep the bottle sealed . Furthermore , the bite valve gets dirty if you are using the bottle outside much . Now , CamelBak does offer thebite valve coverandhydrolock topwhich seal the top , and the former keeps dirt off , but when one has already spent so much money on this piece of hard plastic , it 's objectionable that the company would have you spend so much more on another piece of soft plastic.The bite valve having been lost , I need to replace my Better Bottle , but this time I am going with the competition .	-1
I have had three of these and I have one left . One had the straw crack . The other two failed where the bite valve attaches to the lid there are two small plastic pins . The one of the pins sheered off on two of my bottles . I got them free through work but would not pay for these .	-1
The sturdy construction is great but it sweats when you have ice in it and it is really hard to drink water out of it compared to our other water bottles that have really large open straws , so the main problem is that the bite valve needs to be much larger to be able to get more water out easily .	-1
So it has come to this ! We throw away our water bottles and stop buying bottled water for the fear of ingesting estrogen like plastic , or BPA . Then we go to the internet in desperation in search of a safe water bottle just to buy crap that is made in China.BPA is added to polycarbonate plastics to enable plastic bottles to be clear and shatter proof . It is also used to coat the inside of cans and aluminum products to prevent the metals from eroding into the food . I do n't care if there is a sticker on the bottle stating its BPA free , most likely the bottle leeches less BPA than standard bottles , or they started adding another plastic resin that is even more deadly than BPA but lacks scientific research on it.I urge people not to be fooled buy this marketing rubbish and not buy a `` safe '' water bottle from China .	-1
Should A Water Bottle Come With Instructions ? The Answer Is Yes When Refering To The Camelbak 32Oz . Better Bottle . The Bite Valve Is And Still Remains A Mystery To Me . I Bite And Have Flashbacks Of A Baby Bottle Nipple . Not Enough Liquid Entering The Mouth . I Took The Valve Off And It Works Better For Me . Although Without The Bite Valve The Bottle Loses Its Spillproof Lable . Inovative Handle Molded Onto The Bottle Cap . Plus Bottle Appears To Be Very Durable .	-1
There are a couple reasons I would not buy this again . First off , having a flip top design means there are lots of crevices for dirt/dust to gather . It 's nearly impossible to clean it properly because of that . Second , the tip cracked open making it impossible to suck up any liquid through it because the opening was so big . The bottle itself is pretty durable , that 's about the only positive thing I can say about it . Otherwise , this just is n't a good design and I 'd urge you to go with a klean kanteen , much better design and quality .	-1
This was a good water bottle for about six months , until the mouthpiece started leaking all over . I 've dismantled the whole thing to look for a crack or some other reason for the leakage but could n't find it . I have other Camelbak products that I 'm very happy with , but this one did n't work out .	-1
`` Spillproof '' bottle leaks every time . If you 're looking for a bottle that you 'll feel safe leaving in you pack , setting on the seat of your car or leaving any other place where it will not be stored 100 % upright at all times , look elsewhere.This `` spillproof '' bottle is anything but . Have gone through 3 of these ( under impression first 2 were defective ) . The bottles are not defective , just defectively designed and marketed . All 3 have leaked all over my pack , car , etc ... No point in paying extra for the `` spillproof '' lid if it does n't work as advertised .	-1
The bottle is overcomplicated . It is full of bits and pieces which are difficult to keep it clean especially the bite valve.I stopped using after a couple of days because of the bitter taste it had.I reverted to my simple mineral water bottle ( free ) which is also much lighter as well .	-1
I got this because FeulBelt is so well known in the industry . Here is my breakdown : Pros : + The small pouch is small , but I was able to squeeze by iPhone 4 into it , so my Nike+ could record my run.+ Bottles are the right size to balance the load and not flop around too much . ( compared to my 22oz single bottle belt which I hate . ) + Good padding ; Light weight.Cons : - I am a big big , getting back into running , and this belt would just Velcro with the buckles at their max . 40 '' waist . Big boy could use it , but it was tight.- The bottles are a pain to put back in with one hand . I had to spin the belt around to the side to get it to work . Not like my other belts that they slide in easier.- Overall , the pouch is cramped ... my iPhone stretched the fabric to the max ... just like my waist did ; - ) Overall - this is a good belt if you need water on the trail or road while running . For a smaller frame , it might do very well . I personally hate do mot like having belts on when I run.. so it was not as comfortable for me .	-1
After trying this knife in a knife store , I really liked it and wanted to get one , I bought it here and it arrived in 2 days , but after I opened the box , I realized that the tip of the blade is bended , so I returned it and the next day they sent me another one , and this one came with the same problem , so if you are looking to buy this knife , go somewhere else , I believe all they have right now are blems , I 'm going to return it and get my refund.The one star review does n't mean that the knife is bad , I gave such a review only to warn the people who plan to buy it from Amazon , I really suggest you guys to find it somewhere else .	-1
The emergency ration bar is hard as a rock and terrible taste.Once you open the bag you get one large piece instead of pre-cut bars.I suggest purchasing something else	-1
Very dissapointed . This was a birthday gift for my 3 yr old nephew . It arrived in awfull shape ! the box it was shipped in look like it went thru a schedder , the scooter looked USED it was so damaged , the spring was broken off , and it was dented and mangled looking . My sister is in the process now of sending it back at her OWN EXPENSE . Cant wait to see how that goes ? ? As it stands now , I would not buy from this place again . I dont think my sister should have to pay to ship this damaged product back .	-1
Handle bars stem went on after slamming my fists to it . It is a POS and will return it or give it to my kid . Not for an adult as some folks suggest in these posts .	-1
For the first month the e300 was great , then one day it stopped moving and starting making a grinding noise . I took it apart and found the chain tensioner was broken . When I went online to try to order a new one I found that everywhere I looked was sold out of that specific part - while every other part was readily available . Obviously Razor has a defective part that needs a redesign .	-1
Nice looking knife , well machined parts . Now the bad . Knife is WAY too stiff to even think about one-handing it . It 's too stiff period . Apparently , Gerber used the permanent type of Locktite on the axis screw , because it stripped before loosening . Also , the frame lock barely overlaps the blade in the open position , making my digits very nervous . It 's all academic though , since this blade will occupy my junk drawer until needed for a nasty job . I 'm glad the other reviewers had better luck ...	-1
I loved this when I first bought it . As time went on , the stones wore out . New stones are way overpriced . Right now , the only part of the stones that sharpen are the extreme ends . The middle 80 % of each stone does not sharpen any more . The clamp is weak , too . I am afraid to tighten it too much for fear of it breaking . So , it does not hold the blade firmly , and a very delicate touch is required.Despite the weak clamp , I could live with it if the stones lasted .	-1
The picture gives the impression that it is a watch and so I was surprised when I received it and it actually goes around your index finger . Ok , so now I understand how it is hands free . You press the large ( compared to what might be on a watch ) button with your thumb.As suggested , I practiced with the unit pushing the button and going through the menus until I was familiar with the unit . On my first swim with this interesting little gadget I was not able to consistently press the button with my thumb . If I rotated it just right on my index finger and positioned my thumb just so I could actually feel the little click when I pushed the button then I knew that the unit had recorded the press . Out of 75 laps for its first use I probably did not get the button pressed well on 12 laps . So I thought ok , practice some more on dry land . But then I also realized that the digits were not big enough without a back light to read without my reading glasses . And so I could not consistently see the numbers . If I rotated it just right with the light reflecting off of it then I could see the number.So I will give it several more tries until I will either master it adequately enough to have 98 % confidence that the button recorded the lap or I will give up on it and realize that I am going to have to spend more money to get a unit with more features .	-1
This is handy but that 's it.Pros : Small and easily fits in a pocketCase includedCute little thing , good color , and might be good for kids to play with.Con 's : No eye relief ( one has to take their glasses off and lashes brush on the lens ) Tight focus ( maybe narrow is a better term ) very small focus positionRequires two handsIt is a 7x but objects seem much farther awayNot very clear to me . I expected more from BruntonNot well packaged . Hard-to-open heat-sealed plastic package ; dangerous.This item looked like a good travel monocular but it is not . I do not recommend , would not buy again , and , I hope this helps someone .	-1
Let me just say , I know optics . I know quality when I see it and WOW , this aint it . The optics on this Brunton were like looking through a plastic kids toy . I thought maybe I steamed the lens with my breath . I did n't . But in the reflection I could see one of the elements looked like it got into a fight with a metal Brillo pad and survived it just long enough to crawl into this `` monocular '' . Quality Control ? Now , I 've read the reviews and I 'm sure I got a rotten apple , but , I knew this was a mistake when I picked it up . It 's light , I mean too light . The plastic is n't space-age , it 's just toy junk , and that part is not an anomaly . With perfect optics housed in this housing , I 'd give 2 out of 5 . FYI , It 's made in China . Brunton has recently begun manufacturing compasses in the US again . Apparently it does n't apply to everything they put their name to ( and I 'm grateful , at least I can say this product did n't `` ooze and PLOP '' out of a US factory ) . Unless ultra-light and extreme dainty use are called for , take a chance if you must , odds are you 'll probably get better glass . Otherwise , go with anything else.UPDATE 6/6/13 : Despite my contempt for this , I still needed a light , cheap capable monocular . After returning the above item I exchanged it for another . Brunton got a second chance . Result . No scratched lens element , but the view was very hazy . I examined it by looking through it objective first . Inside , a big smudgey greasy fingerprint . Hard to tell , probably on the prism . It 's internal , no hope wiping THAT off . In this price range I 'm just asking for useable optics , so I 'm not expecting a Leica for twenty bucks . Anyway , thoroughly frustrated with nothing to lose I ask to look at a Carson Close Up 7x18 ( about same weight and materials-a tad bit shorter w/ a 13 '' close-up view ) . It 's only about $ 13 and carries the `` Carson '' name so at this point I 'm looking through it for laughs . Guess what ? Optically descent , no junk inside the tube , no smudged lenses inside or out . It was so cheap I bought TWO . Both optically descent . One had a tiny fleck of something inside but could only be seen objective first . It 's cheaper looking than the Brunton but the view for a few bucks is what 's important . Unfortunately the ultra-light aspect of toy-like cheapness still exists in the Carson as well . Despite this , if you keep your expectations within reason at this level the Carson might be a better alternative . Good luck ( and cross your fingers ) .	-1
The day I received this item I tested by looking at the skyline outside my window and everything looked fine enough ... unitl I accidentally dropped it on the carpet . The short fall made the whole insides of the scope come apart and next time I looked through it there was just a blur .	-1
This thing barely magnifies at all . The picture is clear but it 's magnification is n't very strong , like toy binoculars for kids . If you really need a monocular , I 'd save up and spend more money on one that 'll actually magnify a distant object .	-1
If you do n't live in a high-crime area and all you need is a light lock to dissuade a kid from joy-riding , fine . But if you need any kind of protection from thieves who know what they 're doing , get a u-lock , not something like this .	-1
This is one of the cheapest bicycle locks on the market . It is very small and lightweight ( about 6 ounces ) . However , the amount of protection it provides is very low . The cable can be snipped pretty easily with bolt cutters . The combo lock can be defeated pretty easily by feel . If you 're going to run into a restroom or convenience store for just a minute of if you 're watching your bike from a nearby cafe table , this lock may be enough to slow a thief down . I would not trust this lock if I 'm going to be away from my bike for an extended period of time .	-1
When first buying a bike lock I fell in the trap of spending less money buying this compared to a Kryptonite lock . You definitely get what you pay for- this one lasted me about a year before the locking mechanism failed on me and I could not get the key out despite using wd-40 . The lower end Kryptonite I have now is still going strong after three years and has even resisted a theft attempt in downtown chicago .	-1
This lock was kept indoors or in my backpack when not in use but , I only got to use mine about 8 times before the key got stuck in the lock & broke . The lock is often hard to turn . Also the key will often be very hard to remove after locking OR unlocking . I was at home spraying it with lock lube & working the lock back & forth when the key gave out.If you ever notice the key is hard to remove & your key tip starting to twist out of shape , JUST-TOSS-THAT-KEY-AWAY & use one of the FOUR remaining keys that are included with the lock . Do n't EVEN try to use it `` just-one-more-time . '' I was just about to swap keys out when mine broke . No wonder they give you so many spare keys ! A friend of mine had a more expensive On Guard model with the same key design & it was permanently locked . In that case the key would easily turn & turn but the lock would never open.On the plus side , it seems secure , it 's not expensive & it 's light weight .	-1
The lock itself is great ; it 's sturdy , compact , and easy to use . Multiple keys are handy , it unlocks without much trouble , and it 's just the right size to go around my road bike frame and tire . Google `` Sheldon Brown bike lock '' for a good technique , this lock works perfectly for his recommended method . 5 stars for the lock.The mounting bracket , however , is terrible . The cinching strap never tightens enough to keep the lock from moving all over the place , the tightening bolt strips out entirely too easily , and the most recent issue is that the actual slot that the lock sits in broke out , rendering the entire bracket useless . Now I either have to hook the lock around the frame and listen to it rattle around and scratch up the paint , or put it in my backpack . 0 stars for the bracket.Bottom line : if you have an alternative method of carrying the lock ( ie backpack , cargo pocket , or do n't mind it rattling on your frame ) this is perfect . The additional security cable is a nice touch too , makes locking the front tire to the frame a breeze . But OnGuard really needs to get their act together when it comes to the mounting bracket.UPDATE : Down to 2 stars . Lock exploded into multiple pieces on me after freezing up ... see picture I uploaded . Looks like another reviewer had the exact same thing happen . It 's now completely unusable . OnGuard customer service is great - they replaced and upgraded my bracket when it broke the first time ( the new one also failed spectacularly , although it lasted a little longer ) . This lock got regular use for a few years , and finally died . But it does n't inspire much confidence when the lock breaks by itself without tampering from a thief .	-1
I got this for my Ontario 18 & # 34 ; Machete and it does the job after i modified the belt loop . The built in blade sharpener is carbide though , if you used a stone to get your edge the first time you use it you WILL trash your edge . In a pinch maybe but I do n't care for it .	-1
You ca n't see mold growing inside , until you look in it . Even then , it is dark in there without proper lighting . I could n't believe I saw a decent amount of brown/black mold inside . Thought I would really love this bottle . Sadly a waste of money & I bought all the caps too . I now use a plastic see-through bottle FREE after buying health supplements . And so far that is not growing mold at all . Dunno how Klean Kanteen has all those good reviews . I should use it as a vase !	-1
I have an all stainless one myself , but bought this one for my fiance.The top is sooo annoying . If you ever wanted to sound like a loud tweetybird and have people stare at you whenever you drink , get this . The way that it seals yet lets are in when drinking is not a good design . Its a transparent rubber plug with notches . If it gets pressed while turned on its side it will leak . So My fiance could not leave this in her purse , or use it in public . After she droped it , it dented a bit on the bottom as to be expected however the paint started pealing from where it dented in.I never had any of these problems with my all stainless screw on lid . Simplicity is apparently much better with these .	-1
I bought 2 120z bottles with the sports tops for my daughters to bring to use for snack and lunch . I read a bunch of reviews and was excited about these bottles because they were n't supposed to leak . We got them quickly , Amazon is great that way , and the girls brought them to school on Monday . Within a week I was getting reports of wet backpacks because they were leaking all over the inside of them . I was not happy about this and still have n't decided what to do about it . For now they are still using them , but are making sure that they are upright at all times and only if there is no other resort . I have found that the cheaper plastic versions seem to work better and will probably stick with those .	-1
Wanted to like this bottle , but it has a major flaw . When you drink from it it makes a werbling noise , kind of like a chipmunk or squirrel or bird . I think it 's kind of funny , but in reality , it 's not excusable . Other reviewers have mentioned the same thing . How difficult can it be to design a good water bottle ?	-1
Bought two of these . Amazon packaged them together with a thin sheet of plastic separating them . Paint was scuffed on both bottles .	-1
I really wanted to like this bottle , and bought two of them , one for myself and one for my wife . However ... when you put ice and water in it , it becomes too cold to hold onto , and has a metallic taste . If you try to put coffee in it , it 's too hot to hold onto . You can also forget about squeezing it to force liquid out , since it 's a solid metal bottle . You have to suck on it . Also , the air vent whistles when you try to drink . I 've since gotten rid of them and gone to a basic plastic sports bottle that works perfectly fine .	-1
The bottle I received makes a weird noise when I am drinking from it . The sound gets a chuckle from my husband and my kids each time I use it , but I do n't want to risk stares from people outside of my house , so I never take it anywhere with me . Additionally , it gathers a lot of condensation ... it kind of needs its own attached coaster to solve this problem , or to be more insulated , but it lacks in both areas . The only thing I really like is the size ... I will be replacing this for something more carefully designed .	-1
I just received my Klean Kanteen - probably the 15th I have purchased . I own a couple , and have given many as gifts . But alas , the company has done a bait & switch with the caps . What happened to the stainless steel caps ? ? ? They used to come standard . The whole idea was to have the internal part of the screw top to be steel , like the inside of the bottle - so there 's no plastic touching your liquid . The exterior grip on the lid was always plastic - that 's fine . But now , you have to buy the original stainless screw cap , as an accessory , that costs more than 1/3 as much as the entire bottle product . This bottle if great , but now go buy the staibless steel cap for $ 5.45.Shame on you Klean Kanteen .	-1
I got the largest size kleen canteen because I just did n't want to drink out of plastic anymore . I have every intention of living to 100 as opposed to dying of cancer at 60 . So I bought one . First ... .they are VERY overpriced for what they are . I bought mine on Ebay for a semi-fair price . The factory direct price was something obscene ... I think it was $ 28 ! ! The product itself also has several flaws that you 'd think they 'd be aware of before mass producing this thing . 1 . ) It is not insulated . Cold stuff gets warm quick . Hot stuff gets cold quick . Also , when using it for hot liquids you will burn the hell out of your hand every time you pick it up and burn your lips with every sip . Again ... it should be insulated . I put one of those foam things around mine ( I still wind up burning my lips ) . 2 . ) Because if the way the mouth is shaped there is a lot of `` splashback '' What do I mean ? When it gets to be about 1/3 full and you take a sip a huge amount of the contents will splashback as you lower the container . No matter how slowly I lower it I always wind up with at least one facefull of coffee every day . 3 . ) It 's very thin ... .one good drop and it 's dented for sure . 4 . ) The cap is PLASTIC ! ! WTF ? ? ? What 's the point of buying it to avoid toxic plastic when the cap is plastic ? Where 's the logic .	-1
Ok , they get one star for being attractive . And one more for using safe materials.But they are horrible beyond that . I am shocked that anyone thinks they are any good.They let more air than water in through the nozzle , and they make a loud , bizarre whistling noise . And if you try to remove the white stopper to get better water flow they will leak water all over you.Yes , they do fit bicycle bottle holders , but if you buy the painted ones the paint will scrape off immediately when you take them in and out of the bottle cage ( unless your cage is plastic - not sure about that ) .AND - the little nozzle WILL NOT STAY OPEN ! If you try to drink it will slide shut when it is barely touched . If you are standing very , very still and not moving and concentrate very hard , you can kind of hold it open with your teeth or lips and try to suck the water that way . Then it will probably stay open.But of course , you are just going to get mostly air anyway , especially when the bottle is not completely full.Sending ours back .	-1
We have 4 Klean kanteens ... use them daily ... a 64oz , 27oz , and two of the 12oz ... we have a 3.0 and a 2.0 ... the 3.0 is working fine ... but the 2.0 started leaking within the first week ... the little piece that allows air to enter the bottle is loose , and because it is located directly beside the spout , as soon as you turn the bottle back to drink , you get soaked ... no wonder they built the 3.0 ... they moved the air inlet to the top of the cap , so that even if it fails , you should be able to drink without getting wet ... they should stop selling the 2.0 immediately to avoid further bad reviews of their product	-1
I 'm tryin to drink more water , and I thought a Klean Kanteen would be better for me than some plastic water bottle . I could n't even use it . It tasted and smelled like metal , even after a few weeks . I guess some of us are just more sensitive to the metallic taste than others.I eventually got a Sigg and I much , much prefer it . No funny taste or smell . Also , a little cuter .	-1
Why bother ? Get one that has a stainless steel cap and skip right past this . It even leaks sometimes if I have it laying on the seat in my car . There are much better buys out there .	-1
this was a bad purchase , after using a month for water , something grew on the stainless inside wall . and after using this side by side to the camel water bottle , this is not a very good water bottle . The mouth piece can leak and it does n't have the protection like the camel bak .	-1
These carrying straps are too small . They are a pain to put on and take off of the metal bottles . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Lasted for almost 1 year before one of the sides fell off . Nice pattern and good tool . It was used on a keyring , so it saw daily handling and banging around in a purse . I still would expect this to last longer than it did . If the durability is going to be this low , than I think a sub-ten-dollar price is in order .	-1
On our second night of camping and using the pie iron , one of the cast iron squares fell off . After looking closely we saw 2 of the rivots that are supposed to hold it on were missing . I called Amazon for a replacement , and I recieved the new pie iron the next day . I immediately checked to make sure all four rivets are in , and they are . I will add more to the review after I 've used the new one .	-1
For a bug out bag , i have n't had to use but looks good and hopefully they just stay in a backpack for many years to come	-1
I use to go thru these cans alot until they started using something that makes it milky white like 2 % milk ) . Now I have to go over it again to clean the haze off . I wo n't be buying this anymore . Double work ! Why mess with it if it was already a great product !	-1
First off , sizes run very big . I normally wear an XL and when it came it was Huge . Returned it for a large and it fit just right . Now for the bad news ... ..the quality of this shirt is awful ! ! ! ! After 2 washes and dries on delicate setting for both , this shirt has started to show snags in 3 or 4 places . I also bought 2 other colors from Sierra Trading Post and they are doing the same ! This is not a coincidence , the quality just stinks ! Buyer Beware ! ! ! ! Do n't waste your money on this shirt !	-1
I ordered a medium polo . It is labeled a medium , but it has to be an X-large ! It was not all white . It has Columbia written in front and back . Finally , I gave it to a friend who is much larger than me . Ca n't recommend the shirt or company .	-1
Primary problem is it is not sufficiently adjustable . Does n't fit my Trek 8.3DS as the brakes take up too much room . There 's no good reason it could n't be built with more adjustment range , or a separate piece , etc . to allow this.Also , no loctite on the screws , so I assume it would fall off eventually for normal folks , and since it threads steel into aluminum will blow out if you over-tighten . I did n't , but it 's a truth of physics . Came with no frame covers , so aside from scratching up the frame would be much less stable . Get some friction tape or something else to serve this purpose .	-1
This product costs $ 6 for only ONE wire . Bell sells aBell Bike Fix Cable Setfor about the same price , but it has 2 brake and 2 gear cables . That set also comes with the outer plastic coverings . In my opinion , for everyday normal use , the Bell package is much more bang for your buck than this .	-1
Purchased these to go on my normal pedals for a little extra power . They weight the pedal to the front , so when you take your foot off , the pedal drops nose down . It makes finding your footing difficult after coming to a stop , and they are long enough that taking a curve with the nose down will scrape the pavement . I plan to get some fishing weight or something to glue into my pedals to balance them better . They flex , but do seem durable enough ( considering I 've scraped them off the pavement a few times going around a curve ! ) I 'd give this product 2.5 stars .	-1
I bought these for my spare ATB , and the cage height is far too short to accommodate the toes of my size 10 riding boots . Might work for sneakers or dainty little riding shoes , but if you wear a hiking boot for offroad cycling like I do , avoid these . I have some old Specialized toe clips of a similar design , and they are plenty tall enough to accommodate my boots , so I guess these will go into the `` unused/unsuitable '' bin ... .	-1
Generally speaking , I prefer half clips over ones with straps , but found these to be very flimsy and too weak to adequately pull up on when needed . Alternatively theZefal `` Cristophe '' Mountain Bicycle Half Toe Clipsare much stronger and a bit simpler design.MKS Half Clip Mini steel toe clip , chromeare also nice half clips , though they run a bit small .	-1
No directions , did n't fit bike pedals . The `` plastic '' may be useful elsewhere.Normally no directions is okay but when I could n't install them , this was odd . Besides , most items have directions in 10 different languages . What product lacks ANY ( there were ZERO directions ) . Shampoo has frickin ' directions . The most ridiculous things have directions . Preposterous these had no directions nor specs . What were these imbeciles thinking ? They just ( erroneously ) assume they 'll work for all bike pedals ? Very sloppy and unprofessional they did n't even denote which pedals they 'll work for and which ones they wo n't .	-1
These clips are decently solid but quite short . I wear a men 's 11.5 shoe and I never felt like I was able to get my toes far enough forward to be comfortable on the pedals . I took the clips off some time ago and am no longer using them .	-1
I got it as a package deal it is cheaply made . I would n't buy it by it self . Nope not worth the money	-1
Pros : It 's a good looking knife and a great size.Has a great hard sheath to store it in.Cons : DULL ! ! Wow , I likely could n't cut myself if I tried.Overall , I would not buy this knife again . I do n't know if they forgot to sharpen it in the the plant or what , but this is incredibly dull . I will try to sharpen it up myself but I 'm not really all that great at sharpening knives . I guess I will get to learn with this one !	-1
I am not a novice fisher woman . I purchased this line for Muskie fishing . This line was the worst line I have used . I had more wind tangles than any other line . I tie a uni-knot with all lures so have not lost lures , but the tangles were frequent . This was NOT user error . I know how to spool a reel and use proper tension.I also tried the 20lb mono and had the same results . Solution ? I switched to 15lb power pro ( braided ) and really like the line . The spiderwire line gets an F- try power pro instead . Better results even when using plastics with no weight !	-1
I would have chosen to give this watch zero stars , but that was n't an option . This watch did not keep the correct time , it was delivered with smudges and dirt under the glass , and within 2 months of owning it , the watch fell apart . I am extremely disappointed and feel cheated . DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH . spend a few more dollars and get a well known brand that stands behind it 's product . OR , keep your receipt when you buy this piece of junk , as you will most certainly be needing it .	-1
