love it bought back wonderful memories of when I was a kid and watched archie on tv thank you very much	1
I always loved Archie comics and TV series . I especially liked the TV series The New Archies . I hope they will have that on dvd soon .	1
I just love the Archie 's Weird Mysteries . I am so glad that they are on DVD . I remember watching them on Saturday mornings and then at one time they were coming on in the mornings during the weekday . I miss cartoons like these . I am very pleased with this seller and intend on buying more from them .	1
This is a great collection ! If you enjoy fun cartoons then you should pick this up . Enjoy watching archie and all his palls come across some weird things in their hometown and the ways they go about trying to solve the mysteries behind them . Lighthearted and funny this series will keep you very entertained . The dvd quality is amazing . The picture looks great and this series is very colorful .	1
I read some reviews that made it sound like this was your average Simon Pegg film . I disagree , but not in a bad way . I am a huge fan of his work , and was looking forward to his usual brand of comedy . Athough his comedic timing is similar , and he still has a slapstick kind of charm , this is so much darker than his other films . It 's very dark , albeit creepy at times , a comedy that did n't have me in stitches like his other films , but I still quite enjoyed it . I think the best way to enjoy this film is to know that you are not watching the ilk of Hot Fuzz or Run , Fat Boy , Run . This is a good film , and I can see watching it again - although , I do n't think it 'll be among my favorites of his work .	1
I like Simon Pegg . I think he 's a natural talent and has a great comedic presence . Here he strays from his usual course , but not too far.Here 's the scoop . Pegg plays a failed children 's book author now working on writing a TV series on serial killers . He 's so steeped in he process he becomes paranoid to the point of being agoraphobic . He figures he 's being stalked by a killer . But he needs to make a meeting with a TV producer to pitch his project . Can he overcome his issues to make the date ? This is a bit of an odd set-up . You do n't see him in the process of degenerating into his madness . You see him when he 's fully 'round the bend , so the rather clueless Simon from previous films is not here and I do miss him . He does play the character well though he takes a time out to up the entertainment level with his lip-synch to a gangster rap tune . It 's a lot of fun but a noticeable departure from the proceedings . There is also a medium share of farce and physical humor which he handles well . It gets a bit odd in the third act but it rounds out seemingly loose stuff from the first two acts.This IS a fun flick . Maybe not quite worth the four stars I gave it but Pegg is always a hoot to watch so it goes down easy . If you like your comedy with a bit of thrills this should suit you fine .	1
I love anything Snoopy related so I bought this wanting to see more of Snoopy 's funny adventures.If you like some of the older stuff then get this . I loved it !	1
Let me first say that I have been a Three Stooges fans for decades . Since my childhood , I remember some of the funniest lines from the Three Stooges . My favorite has always been the Shemp episodes and for whatever reasons I 'm unsure of , near impossible to find.On some occasions , certain networks show the Three Stooges rather randomly but they always been Curly episodes and a whole lot of repeated episodes almost every time you watch it.Throughout the years I came across various dvds and partials of the Three Stooges , none of which features Shemp even if the cover has a picture of him . My main way of ever hoping to watch the show was to record it on vhs and hope that I can re-watch it sometime . I sometimes see Three Stooges collections at the movie stores , but it was very unclear how to complete such collection.So in comes this ultimate dvd collection . Let me say I was very skeptical at first . My thought were exactly , & # 34 ; No way this could be the complete ultimate collection that features every Curly , Shemp , and Joe films. & # 34 ; Sure enough it is , and I 'm very glad to have purchased this . I do n't know when this DVD was released or for how easy it is to access Shemp episodes . I 'm just glad to finally come across the dvds and am very glad I can watch it . I found many episodes I completely forgotten about including the one where Shemp was in a stolen box car and had a drunken vision of a bird . Other funny episodes include where Shemp had this fishbowl stuck on his head after attempting to get his inheritance money.To my surprise a lot of Three Stooges episodes are rehashes of other episodes but in various formats . To me the Three Stooges are the funniest but also some of Hollywood most tragic actors and certainly shows the evil and corruption of Hollywood . I know some writers of the shows actually committed suicide after going bankrupt . All the Stooges had broken bones and Curly and Shemp both suffered tragic , sudden deaths . As you all know Shemp came on the show after Curly and a lot of Shemp 's episodes are remakes of earlier Curly episodes . Even more surprising after Shemp died , they simply re-used a lot of his films for future versions until Joe came into the picture . All that is within this Ultimate Collection of Three Stooges . You also get some very nice missing episodes that are very rare . You get 3d glasses , which I have n't tried yet in fear of losing the glasses.Overall I am very happy to own this . I am very thankful that finally the full collection has been released and I enjoy every minute of this collection . It 's one of my most prized item and I certainly hope that everyone can experience the Three Stooges .	1
He loves the three stooges and will be excited he will have the complete set I 'm sure I will be waiting then for a few weeks at least , fast shipping	1
This DVD set has outstanding picture and sound quality . It also has very excellent packaging . The DVDs are organized by year . Each year has its own sturdy cardboard sleeve . And each sleeve contains two sturdy plastic covers that house the individual DVDs . There is an episode guide on each plastic cover that lists the individual Stooge episodes . Very high quality in all respects ! !	1
I do have many complete TV series at home and the Three Stooges - Ultimate Collection is a very good box set for any three stooges fan .	1
Great to see Columbia release the entire `` canon '' of the 190 Stooge shorts in one set ; it is an iconic body of work , and automatically gets the five-star rating.Also great to see Columbia 's 3-disk supplement , which will give the general public ( who only know the Stooges as a team ) an idea of the OTHER comedy shorts that were being churned out by Columbia during their heyday . You will see the same directors , writers AND supporting cast members that we have come to know and love through their work with the Stooges ... and it 's cool to see them in all of these unfamiliar efforts ( three of the Shemp appearances are in films starring the wacky but sad-sack Andy Clyde , who was Columbia studio 's 2nd-biggest comedy film-star after the Stooges ) .HOWEVER -- -BE ADVISED : there 's a reason that only the Stooges shorts have survived in the public consciouness for the past 80 years ; for even when an excellent director like Ed Bernds , who did such great work with the Stooges , worked with Shemp as a solo comedian ( or Joe DeRita ) , the results were ... .well , you 'll see for yourself . The chemistry , the PACING ( as you will painfully become aware ) and that special Stooge magic just IS N'T there . Still , it 's fascinating to see what the old studio days were all about via these relics from the past.You will undoubtedly come away from these 3 Bonus discs with a greater appreciation of the Stooges and just HOW GOOD THEY WERE ; they were a brilliantly talented team that really lit up the screen with their unique brand of insanity.LRPS ; Want to read/own a great BOOK , excellently researched , that covers ALL of Columbia 's comedies in great detail ( w/lots of photos and COMPLETE plot synopses ) ? ? Get `` THE COLUMBIA COMEDY SHORTS '' by Ted Okuda , published by McFarland Press ; you 'll be amazed .	1
So glad I stumbled onto this collection on Amazon . All the stooges ( that can be easily obtained ) in one boxed DVD set ! The Stooges never received the attention they deserved when they made these shorts and they are classic comedy . How many of today 's comedians will be this big eight decades from now ? When you see Moe whack Curly on the head with a hammer , one of two things will happen . Either you 'll say `` Oh my God , how violent ! '' or you 'll get it and laugh hysterically . I 'll take it you are in the second group and instead of hating them you love 'em ! I 'll have to save the review of the quality of the remastering for later . Either way , they are the Stooges ! I used to watch these as a kid on a black & white TV with a old UHF loop antenna and I 'm sure the funniness will still be there !	1
What can I say ? Its the 3 Stooges ! You either love'em or hate'em.A superb edition of their complete work for Columbia . The digital restoration is first-class as is the packaging . For the sheer size of the collection and its quality production , Amazon 's price is ridiculously low.This is simply a `` top-flight '' collector 's edition which I highly recommend . But I 'd expect that from the likes of Sony .	1
Exactly as described , I bought this for a Stooges fan who loves them , she is really enjoying the collection . So for me to say anything about them would n't be right cause I am not a fan .	1
I have not yet watched this item . I have visually inspected each disc and have not found any blemishes on any of them .	1
Whether you 're an avid fan or casual fan , this makes a great gift for anyone , even if it is just to one 's self	1
This 1973 film was an excellent candidate for remastering and Blu-ray enhancement , having a freedom of movement and spaciousness that astounds in this newest version ; I believe it was originally filmed in an enormous aircraft hangar . Many agree that Nureyev was at his peak during this time , and his charismatic brilliance is most apparent here , backed by a superb cast . Nureyev closely oversaw all aspects of the filming ; it bears his stamp . Not many films merit the trouble and expense of conversion to blu-ray ; this performance however is one for the ages . Excellent bonus features as well .	1
One of the funniest movies starring Larry the Cable Guy , just looking at him dressing up like the tooth fairy made me laugh so hard that I had to run to the bathroom . This movie was much better than Tooth Fairy starring The Rock he 's nowhere as funny in this role as a fat hillbilly is .	1
I bought my granddaughter Tooth Fairy , and Tooth Fairy 2 . We enjoyed Tooth Fairy , but Tooth Fairy 2 has been replayed over and over the past two days . We all need a chance to laugh , and this movie is it ! It even has a happy ending ! Who could ask for more ? ?	1
my granddaughter wanted this movie although i did not like it she loved it and watches it all the time	1
If you like movies that have & # 34 ; Larry the cable guy & # 34 ; in them then you 'll love this one ! ! I mean him with fairy wings ( ha , ha )	1
this show is fun and i was so happy to find it complete on DVD . clever and fun , though unless you 've seen this before it WILL seem dated and has bits where you can see that it was not made with a realistic future in mind , nor the idea of how Holmes , would process being brought into the future , but it really is fun and , in my opinion , a great show !	1
Fun rethink of the detective and his crew . if I were doing a revamp and setting it in the future , I would do this . not for those who are purists , this show is for those who like to have a little fun with a classic character and see where you go with it . Not bad and great fun .	1
I have always been a fan of sherlock holmes so when I first saw the series on tv I loved it . I had to get it for my collection .	1
I bought this disc mainly because of the title and the price , I am a fan of both Sci-Fi and Sherlock Holmes . I had never heard of this series before and it was a pleasant surprise . A lot of the stories are based on the original Sherlock Holmes stories but updated for the `` 22nd '' century .	1
Just wish it was available on blue ray as it would make the picture and sound just that much better .	1
This show has great charm , and brings Sherlock Holmes to an interesting , if not always *entirely* believable , future time of England . I enjoy the characters and their interactions , seeing the cases present themselves and become solved , and the twists and turns within each episode . Nothing new hat , but still well done.However , I would n't recommend this show for everyone . It can feel corny sometimes , and the animation is occasionally buggy or ( specifically during the few CGI segments ) somewhat repetitive . While not a pain to watch , it can become slightly distracting while watching . But for a Saturday morning cartoon on DVD , it 's a pleasant watch and enjoyable in its own right .	1
While there are numerous Tai Chi DVDs on the market , there is always room for one more , especially when the DVD is from Dr. Yang , Jwing-Ming , an extremely accomplished martial artist and prolific author of books and DVDs that share his vast knowledge in the martial art and Qigong areas . `` Yang Tai Chi For Beginners '' with Dr. Yang is an excellent DVD for anyone wanting to learn Yang Tai Chi . Yes , the DVD is for beginners , and beginners will definitely learn a lot from this program , but even those who already practice this style of Tai Chi will benefit from Dr. Yang 's years of experience and knowledge.The program begins with a short introduction chapter that shows Dr. Yang performing Tai Chi in a wooded area while a voice over , combined with subtitles , introduces the viewer with Tai Chi and its benefits . Next comes a chapter about Yang Tai Chi with Dr. Yang , at his retreat in a wooded area , talking about Yang Tai Chi , and explaining about this form . While Dr. Yang speaks English , there are subtitles throughout the entire DVD . After these preliminaries , there is a group demonstration with Dr. Yang and a number of his students performing the form.After this demonstration , Dr. Yang 's instruction begins . He goes through everything , teaching to the camera . It is like you are there with him . The only negative is you ca n't ask him questions or have him come and correct your form . This DVD really is the next best thing to being there . He teaches and allows you to view from different views and he points out common mistakes and provides tips throughout the program . At times he brings students out to demonstrate applications that are found within the form to allow the viewer to better understand the movements . After the instruction , Dr. Yang performs a demonstration of the form by himself . ( Subtitles across the bottom of the screen allow you to see which movement he is performing , and they are all numbered when teaching , and there is also an insert in the DVD package that lists all the movements by number and name . ) Next , there is a rear view of the form that you can follow along with performed by one of Dr. Yang 's students . ( Also with subtitles of the numbered movements . ) Finally , there is a conclusion where Dr. Yang provides additional information about the form , martial arts , history , and concluding comments . I have seen quite a few Tai Chi instructional DVDs and this is without a doubt the most detailed program I have viewed . It 's 293 minutes long and contains a wealth of instructional information.Obviously , learning live from a qualified instructor is always best . However , sometimes this is not possible , or sometimes you want additional instruction at home to compliment your class instruction . This DVD program by Dr. Yang , `` Yang Tai Chi For Beginners '' is an exceptional home learning tool for anyone practicing or wanting to learn the Yang-style form of Tai Chi Chuan.Reviewed by Alain Burrese , J.D. , author of the `` Lock On Joint Locking Essentials '' series and others .	1
I like just about any video/DVD Dr. Yang produces , but I was looking for the Yang style 24 posture ( short ) form , and this is some other Yang form . Maybe this is the long form ? So before you order , make sure you 're getting the right DVD .	1
YMAA has set a terrific price point for the information contained in this fantastic production . This DVD offers nearly 5 hours of explanation of a Yang-style long form consisting of 113 postures , an unsurpassed value . A list of postures is included in the DVD jacket . Previous reviewer ravings indicate the quality and utility of this YMAA publication . There is no need to repeat previous comments , so I will just make the following comment : `` Believe what they say ! `` The only `` negative '' ( and not really a negative comment as much as a head-scratch moment ) that I could come up with is that while the DVD provides a great instructional tool for the beginner and a must-have resource for the experienced practitioner , first-timers should start with the Simplified 24 and 48 posture book and DVD , by Liang , Shou-Yu and Yang , Jwing-Ming ( also highly recommended publications ) . In 14 years of practice , I have yet to encounter a `` beginner '' group or student that is practicing a 113-posture form . The Standardized 24-posture routine is the most widely practice tai chi form in the world for good reason and should therefore be the first stepping stone for the beginner . However , I do not want to discourage those wishing to dive in head first into the health benefits of practice of tai chi . Why start small ?	1
IT ALL CAME TRUE ( 1940 ) is a unique film for it puts Humphrey Bogart 's gangster persona in what can almost be called a musical setting . Here he 's a hood who 's hiding out at the mansion-like home owned by the mother of one of his employees ( Jeffrey Lynn ) . She ( Jessie Busley ) and her best friend ( Una O'Connor ) have turned the stately old place into a boarding house seemingly for the eccentric . In fact both these ladies are a couple of Irish-accented characters who quickly take to Bogie as if he were a long-lost son.It 's in this picture that we hear him say in resigned exasperation , `` Now I have TWO muddahs ! '' ( You have to see the moment to fully appreciate it . ) Zasu Pitts plays the nosy boarder down the hall , and she 's great ! There 's also ex-vaudeville magician `` The Great Boldini '' ( Felix Bressart ) and his undying dream of making a comeback . Best of all is Ann Sheridan as the other old lady 's daughter . She 's a nightclub chanteuse who knows the truth about Bogart 's shady past , but is n't saying.. at least for now . Sheridan in her vocalist role does two songs that any Boomer who grew up watching Warner cartoons will instantly recognize : `` Angel in Disguise '' and `` The Gaucho Serenade . '' ( Check YouTube for a movie clip of Ann singing the latter . ) This would not be the last time Bogart had a film part that combined comedy and his `` tough guy with a soft spot '' image . Much ofALL THROUGH THE NIGHT ( 1942 ) , a fast-dialogue comedy with a Nazi spy angle reunites dapper man-about-town Bogie with Peter Lorre ( Joel Cairo inTHE MALTESE FALCON ) . The rest of the cast , including Bill Demarest , Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers , is outstanding . With its unique mix of humor and noirish intrigue , this film often reminds me of the Firesign Theater LP side , `` The Further Adventures of Nick Danger . `` Again we have our favorite actor playing a sentimental tough in the perennial holiday filmWE 'RE NO ANGELS ( 1955 ) . In this Michael Curtiz-directed French stageplay adaptation , Bogart , Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov are three Devil 's Island cons who take it on the lam and hide out over the Xmas holiday at the home/shop of a local merchant . They soon get involved in the lives of this man 's family . Another top-shelf cast here includes Leo G. Carroll , Joan Bennett , Gloria Talbott and Basil Rathbone , who 's spot-on as arrogant Andre Trochard , an overbearing boor who 'll soon pay for the heartless treatment of his relatives .	1
AS USUAL , WARNER BROS. PICTURES PUT THE WISE CRACKING WRITERS TO WORK ON A SCRIPT FOR ANN SHERIDAN AND IT WAS ABOUT TIME SHE STARRED IN HER OWN PICTURE WITH OTHER HEAVYWEIGHTS , LIKE BOGART ! UNLIKE SOME ACTRESSES , SHE REALLY DID HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ( NOTE : 'TORRID ZONE ' WITH JAMES CAGNEY ) .	1
Bogart in a comedy - who knew ? ! It is a comedy of a style that is no longer as popular as it once was . But it surely gives this gaggle of stars a chance to & # 34 ; chew up the scenery. & # 34 ;	1
At Christmas time , we tivo 'd the Christmas Pac Man special . We loved it so much I looked into the original cartoon & was very thrilled to discover the first season for sale.The show is corny , there 's barely any plot , and after a while each episode seems the same as the last , but it 's Pac Man and his family & it 's classic at it 's best , and still beats any of today 's cartoons by hundred .	1
It 's here , the original 1980s cartoon based on the then-wildly popular arcade game , Pac-Man ! ! Produced by Hanna-Barbera , the show brings to life many elements of this game as well as its successors , Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.All three characters - Pac-Man , Pepper ( Ms. Pac-Man ) , and Pac-Baby - and their pets Chomp-Chomp and Sour Puss pull together as a family as they fend off Pac-Land 's five Ghost Monsters : Clyde , Pinky , Inky , Blinky and Sue . ( Pinky , Inky and Blinky appeared in both the Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man video games ; Clyde appeared in Pac-Man only , replaced by Sue in Ms . Pac-Man . ) The Ghost Monsters - each with their own unique mob-like personality - work for Mezmaron , whose mission is to seize the power pellets , Pac-Land 's power source . Most of the show 's plots center on these battles.The first season of Pac-Man , which did not feature Super-Pac or Pac-Man 's nephew P.J. , aired on the ABC network from 1982 to 1983 and contained 13 episodes . Their titles are listed below , along with their original air dates.Episode 1 ( 25 Sep 1982 ) Presidential Pac-Nappers / Picnic in Pac-LandEpisode 2 ( 2 Oct 1982 ) The Great Pac-Quake / Hocus-Pocus Pac-ManEpisode 3 ( 9 Oct 1982 ) Southpaw Packy / Pac-Baby PanicEpisode 4 ( 16 Oct 1982 ) Pacula / Trick or ChompEpisode 5 ( 23 Oct 1982 ) Super Ghosts / The Pac-Man in the MoonEpisode 6 ( 30 Oct 1982 ) Journey to the Center of Pac-Land / Invasion of the Pac-PupsEpisode 7 ( 6 Nov 1982 ) Sir Chomp-A-Lot / The Day the Forest DisappearedEpisode 8 ( 13 Nov 1982 ) Neander-Pac-Man / Backpackin ' PackyEpisode 9 ( 20 Nov 1982 ) The Abominable Pac-Man / The Bionic Pac-WomanEpisode 10 ( 27 Nov 1982 ) Chomp-Out at the O.K . Corral / Once upon a ChompEpisode 11 ( 4 Dec 1982 ) The Pac-Love Boat / The Great Power-Pellet RobberyEpisode 12 ( 11 Dec 1982 ) A Bad Case of the Chomps / Goo-Goo at the ZooEpisode 13 ( 18 Dec 1982 ) The Pac-Mummy / Nighty NightmaresWith Pac-Man : The Complete First Season in your collection , you can relive the days when Pac-Man fever was sweeping the nation . In addition , the cartoon is good clean fun the whole family can enjoy .	1
This is a movie that is cute with a little of everything in it ..Gangster , drama , romance , a little comedy and a feel good ending . my only wish was that they would remaster it ..to make it better ..these old movies are so much better then the movies they make now ... I watch a lot of TCM , if not for them ..most of these movies would go unseen by a lot of people . Glad I was able to get a DVD of this movie .	1
Earlier Cagney films always cast him as a punchy Irish guy fighting his way to where ever he wanted to get . Taxi is no different . Cagney 's earlier films helped mold him into the tough character actor that he became . If you are a fan of his like I am you will enjoy adding Taxi to your collection .	1
If you loved the TV show , then you will definitely love the movies ! Would recommend to anyone ! A must watch	1
I have seen both movies and I like them both . It is a nice continuation of the series . It was a good deal getting both movies .	1
As someone who covers her eyes when expecting violence on the screen , I generally avoid spy flicks . There 's enough else going on in the MI5 series to keep my brain occupied even when I try look away from the violence . Good plots , good acting . Star Trek fans will find it a bit distracting , in season 10 , to have the unforgettable haughty face and carriage of the Queen of the Borg ( Alice Krige ) show up as a Russian spy .	1
Sorry to see this is the final season of MI-5 ... Sherlock may fill the void.The season is up to the usual quality of the past seasons . Was sorry to see it be only 2 discs . For the final season , I would 've thought they 'd go out big or something.For those looking for another series like MI-5 : Sandbaggers ( British series ) or Alias ( American series ) .	1
I 'm sadden that this series is over and I just hope it comes back one day soon . I loved every minute of it !	1
Classic looney tunes with some new humor ! I love the classic looney tunes , but it nice to see the come back . My husband and I laughed all the way through these disk , and cant wait for the rest to come out ! Even my 19 mo son was watching it , something besides mickey , tigger and pooh , and the penguins of madagascar to watch ! My husband got ours @ wal mart as well .	1
Best of the Daniel Craig Bonds without any doubt . Personal , risque , funny with an excellent script , and just all round well thought through yarn . Ca n't wait to the next one .	1
It 's 007 I love . You can change the actor , but you ca n't change The character , although Connery and Moore were the best .	1
I thought it was almost as good as the original ones . It was a welcome relief after they really messed up several more recent ones . Not perfect , but quite good .	1
I 've always enjoyed James Bond movies , but honestly , there are some that are little too complicated , even after multiple viewings . Skyfall is much more straight-forward , but it does n't lose any of that Bond charm . Terrific action sequences , good acting , and a fairly streamlined plot make this one of the best spy movies out there .	1
Let me first start off by saying that I 'm not old enough to have been around when Bond first hit the bookshelves or the big screen . Far from it , in fact ! I think Roger Moore was about on his way out when I was first forming memories . And I was n't a big fan back in the day , either , not until college when I started collecting the films on VHS.I 've been through the Bonds , though , and was there for each of Brosnan 's releases on video . Still not huge on Bond in the theater , though ... not even when they rebooted the series with Daniel Craig . Not after I fell in love with Casnio Royale and decided to become a fan ... not when Quantum came out , a movie I very much anticipated ... Skyfall : that was the turning point for me . IMAX the Wednesday night it was released ( 12:07am Thursday morning ) and the next night ( 12:07am Friday morning ) for the regular screen release . The wait , the anticipation , the past two Craig performances , the build up , the cast , the trailers ... I was finally hooked . And Bond did not disappoint.As one reviewer already said , the first 10 minutes are pretty epic . They went on to say the rest of the film was take-it-or-leave-it , which I wholly contest , but everyone is entitled to their opinion . I concur with the first part of that review , though , that the opening up to and including Adele 's haunting intro was , by far , the best opening to any James Bond film ever.Why do so many dislike the new Bond , both the man and the films ? I think it is the humanization of a very fictional caricature . We turned to Bond to provide us with some silliness and fun at the expense of our very real Cold War fears . Hot wars were still raging across the globe , but never fear , England and America ! James Bond is here to patriotize your day ! This was very necessary ... back then.Now , the world is more globalized , and technology that was once amusing and farcical is very real and tactile . As such , Bond became more human , more 'defictionalized ' in a world that is harder to scare anymore by the goofball antics of Odd-Job , Jaws , and Rosa Klebbs . Instead , real villains that we do n't ever see , covert and secret organizations that `` live and operate in the shadows , not on a map '' ( to paraphrase a quote from Dame Judi Dench 's very wonderful monologue in the courtroom scene ) . These are what scare us now ; terrorists , random acts of violence , enemies that we can not compartmentalize and clearly point out.This is the modern movie villain , so Bond has adjusted accordingly to be more modern in order to fight this threat . Instead of falling into the trap of scaring us with real-life horrors , though , the films have been keeping enough fiction ( science fiction , in some cases ) to ensure that we do n't take Bond 'too seriously , ' that there is still enough of the fiction left in him to be entertaining and not shocking . I think the recent films work beautifully on that level , and the pinnacle thus far , in my opinion , is Skyfall.I think there are enough reviews to give you the plot elements you 'll need to get by , along with the special editions included , of which there are plenty . It 's not the best Blu-ray I 've ever seen in my entire life as far as bonus content is concerned , but there is more than enough by most standards . Besides , I do n't want to distract myself too much from the content of the film itself.I will say , too , that they added some very fun homages to the 50 years of James Bond , including casting Finney as the gamekeeper . The car was an awesome touch , too . Will all Bond fans fall in love with this new breed of MI6 secret agent ? Probably not . If you 're one of the Connery/Moore hardcore fans , yeah , you probably wo n't dig Craig as much , which you already know from the prior two films.From an objective point of view , though , this is what you can expect : - high-octane action and stunts- lovely femme fatales and sultry scenes- beautiful cinematography of exotic locations- fast-paced plot that keeps moving , with very few pit stops along the way- classic , jovial , dry wit from so many different colorful characters- outstanding performances by the main cast and supporting playersCraig , Dench and Bardem absolutely shine on screen , and surprising performances are turned in as well by newcomers Fiennes , Harris and Whishaw . The script has been polished to a near perfect shine ( one would hope , given the amount of time we waited between films ) , and the interaction is flawless . The scenes are lovely and beautifully filmed , and the cinematography creates a palpable environment for the audience.If you enjoy action movies , if you 're a Bond fan or not , if you like suspenseful thrillers , then you have to give Skyfall a viewing . Perhaps you 'll fall in love with the legend as much as others have , perhaps you wo n't . But by itself , Skyfall stands alone as a work of art lovingly crafted by Mendes . I hope you enjoy it as much as I did !	1
Very entertaining and lots of action . Some of the car chase scenes are a bit much . How many people get run over ?	1
Good development of the Bond character and mythos . Gives new insight into Bond 's backstory . Relationship between Bond and M explored . Reintroduction of classic character , along with satisfying update of Q .	1
You ca n't go wrong with James Bond movies - they are always full of action and intrigue every step of the way - I had to have this for my collection .	1
`` Skyfall '' is the third James Bond film starring Daniel Craig as 007 . It 's got one of the best villains in the Bondverse with Javier Bardem , an Academy Award winning actor , playing Bond 's foil . This film more than any other Bond film I can remember makes M a much more developed character . How can you go wrong when the director is an Oscar winner and a great deal of the crew have been nominated too ? If you love James Bond , you wo n't be disappointed with this movie . I think casual fans will also enjoy it , and it should win over some new fans to James Bond .	1
After having seen most of the Bond movies , I discovered that this was one I had missed . Wow , am I glaf I decided to watch . Daniel Crag was outstanding , although not my favorite Mr . Bond . The story line was exciting with no dull spots.Also , thr story line wad smooth and easy to follow . I also liked the music in the movie . If you want an action based , well acted movie , give this one a look .	1
Even though Sean Connery is my favorite Bond , Daniel Craig delivers a wonderful performance as 007 . Also , a memorable performance by Judi Dench in her final Bond movie ! ! Another one in a long line of great Bond movies ! ! I highly recommend it ! ! !	1
I never thought there could be a Bond greater than Sean Connery but Daniel Craig is the best since Sean . Judi Dench is superb , as usual . The best Bond movie since Goldfinger~ !	1
This movie starts out with a boring old motorcycle chase ; but gets considerably better ; so I was n't disappointed with most of it . It was delivered in a timely manner and case and dvd in great condition ; thank you , seller .	1
This film caught me by surprise all the way through to the end . The end had a surprise ending . You must watch 100 % excitement .	1
I have yet to watch a & # 34 ; BAD & # 34 ; James Bond 007 movie ! ! I own ALL , save the very latest movie of this TIMELESS CLASSIC set of movies ! ! ! Daniel Craig gives another timeless performance ... ... . Keep 'em coming , I love every one of them ! ! ! BF II	1
Been a Bond fan for 30 years . This , in my opinion , is the best one ever . GREAT to see MoneyPenny and other classic Bond characters get reintroduced into the ongoing series . Also nice to see them show a side of Bond that makes him look a little & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; and tired ... but still the coolest guy on the planet . If you like Bond , you will love this movie .	1
I hate to see this one go but age dictates such I guess . I really liked the theme song for Skyfall .	1
Although different from many of the previous Bond films , Skyfall had much of the elements of Flemings ' Bond and held my interest throughout the movie .	1
I was so disappointed in the previous Bond film because Casino Royale was such an exciting reboot of Bond that I was let down . However Syfall takes Bond to new heights . The movie was intense , fun , full of action and good acting . The big bad in the film works because he 's slightly insane and he Bardem makes him believable . If you love Bond you 'll love this film . If you 're not a Bond fan but do love action/espionage films you will love this film anyway .	1
Lots of violence as you would expect from a 007 movie . Good thriller . Not for the faint of heart or easily upset by all the violence .	1
With action and beautiful landscapes surrounding a thriller , the movie held me captive , except for pop corn breaks . I 'm in .	1
This was the best 007 movie to date ! It was more realistic in the way that people feel and react to being hurt and growing older . My favorite !	1
This is essential for any Bond owners collection Daniel Craig is the best Bond since the Orignial Mr. Sean Connery	1
I like the action right out of the start it opens up in the adventure I thought it was well made	1
The very best movie that has to be part of your collection , it is better than any of the other Bond films that I have which is the whole collection .	1
Good movie , lots of action , surprised by the ending . another good Bond movie ! A must see on a cold winter night .	1
This was pretty good for an action movie . The plot made sense . The Cinematography was excellent . Loved the scenes shot in Turkey . Was a good experience . But not as good as the old , old bonds.i	1
Skyfall was the first James Bond movie that explains the background of 007 . The movie takes it 's time to develop the storybut it certainly delivers a violent punch at the end . no reason to comment on the DVD quality because it is excellent . If yousaw the film in the theater then the DVD will give you the same experience .	1
Another movie I 've watched more than a few times - One part I did n't like but you 'll have to watch so I do n't spoil it for you .	1
Helps complete my James Bond series , some I enjoy more than others . This bond I do n't particular like but I love the series .	1
Daniel Craig 's James Bond is perfect for the times . This fits right in with the best of the genre action movies . Gone is the overly suave James Bond replaced with a tougher , more athletic , but still extremely cool persona . The story line still pays homage to the Bond of old , so fans of the older Bond movies should appreciate it . I 'm 55 and watched this with my college aged daughters . We all thought it was one of the best movies we 've seen in awhile .	1
Until Daniel Craig took over the role with `` Casino Royale , '' I was never a big James Bond fan . I enjoyed some of the films , but I never found him to be a very compelling hero . At times , he even seemed like a parody of male fantasy - an infallible , oversexed , entitled alpha male . Craig brought new life into the character , making him a scrappy , visceral hero , and with his piercing gaze revealed a depth to the character I had never seen before.Whether it 's a response to the tough times we 've living in , or strictly a matter of creative direction , James Bond 2012 is no longer living a male fantasy . Sure , he still has the ability to seduce and bed beautiful women , but aside from that , things have gotten tough . In the beginning of `` Skyfall '' , Bond is accidently shot by his own team while on top of a moving train , where he falls hundreds of feet into a body of water . Thought dead , he takes the opportunity to disappear for a while and enjoy the anonymous life . It 's only when MI6 is attacked on their own turf and the results are so overwhelming that it makes the international news that Bond decides to reemerge.Upon his return , Bond is no longer in top form . Craig is far from the oldest actor to play the character , but his superiors and co-workers seem to think he 's too old to be continuing as a field agent . His injuries have left him with an unsteady trigger finger , and his heavy drinking and pain medication have made him a liability . M ( Judi Dench ) only clears him to return to action out of a mix of desperation and loyalty . 2012 's James Bond is no longer a superhero . He 's tough , stoic , and brave , but he 's no longer the alpha male - he 's the underdog.Bond goes about tracking down the man who both blew up MI6 's headquarters and is now revealing the identities of covert field agents ( guaranteeing their deaths . ) When he does come across Silva ( Javier Bardem ) , that 's when things get really interesting . In the case of `` Skyfall '' , not only is the hero a much more interesting character , but the villain is fascinating . A disgraced and destroyed former MI6 agent himself , the character seems to want nothing more than to destroy his former boss M by first destroying everything that means anything to her - her reputation , her co-workers , and her country.In the film 's final act , Bond takes M to `` Skyfall , '' the Scottish estate where he was born and raised . The most logistically safe place to do final battle with Silva is also Bond 's most emotionally dangerous territory - the place where he lost his parents as a boy . It 's here that the three damaged , strong central characters - Bond , M , and Silva - have to face themselves and each other . `` Skyfall '' is an example of an elevated action film . When I grew up in the 80 's , action films were mostly populated by hack actors , with weak storylines and mediocre directing . Skyfall utilizes a talented filmmaker ( Sam Mendes , the man behind `` American Beauty '' ) , powerhouse actors ( Craig , Bardem , and Judi Dench are all wonderful ) a strong script and lush cinematography to prove , once again , that any genre of film can be elevated when the people behind it have the talent and skill required .	1
If you like James bond movies , you 'll enjoy this one as well . Unless I missed it , , the movie does n't explain how Bond escapes death after being shot and apparently drowned in the beginning . Takes you to the old Bond estate , Skyfall , in his native Scotland for the final conflict .	1
Really enjoyed this movie , while Sean Connery is still my favorite James Bond , this just maybe the best Bond movie yet .	1
This is James Bond at its best ... bad guy was campy ... but otherwise Bond is at his Bondiness . Good rental	1
Outstanding script , acting , and special effects . DANIEL CRAIG IS FANTASTIC as Bond - all the Bond actors have been terrific but Daniel Craig is the best since Sean Connery . Sorry to see 'M ' leave , but the new Moneypenny is adorable and we are looking forward to the next Bond film ... ..	1
The movie was good not great . The Bond movie 's have a lot of action and this one was a little slow .	1
I am not a James Bond fan , but I really liked this movie . My daughter and I went to see it at the theater several times , and we have watched it many times at home as well . All of the characters were fun . I really like Bardem as the bad guy , and Judi Dench was outstanding as & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; .	1
What `` SkyFall '' offers to its audience is Bond , James Bond , as an espionage agent ... not as a cardboard character or a flawlessly dressed superhero . Back in the 1950 's and 1960 's , that 's how Bond was imagined by his creator . Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough , loyal , hard-edged spy . Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back . Sean Connery was glamorous , Roger Moore was silly , but Daniel Craig acts , moves , and thinks like a spy.And the villain in `` SkyFall '' was once an important asset of MI6 ... perhaps a friend of Bond once . He is the enemy today because he wants revenge . Why ? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured . He was traded for 6 other British agents . See the film `` The Spy Who Came in From the Cold '' to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents . When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory . Can you really trust your own side , when you live in the shadows ? And so Raoul Silva ( Javier Barden ) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal . Governments do create their own Frankensteins.Both the flawed psychological , hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller . As Judi Dench ( as M ) puts it , orphans make the best spies.Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film , gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble . He has to use his brains , not only his courage , to win this showdown . I love the part when he goes back into time , and drives his `` Goldfinger '' vehicle again . The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses , is one we live with everyday - the computer . For he is an expert in cybercrime.Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it . Although I must confess that this Bond is someone who does n't smile or enjoy luxury wines - something I miss from the Sean Connery days .	1
It seems the British take great pride in producing Bond . A great thrill . The action explodes into more action . A great treat for the senses .	1
Note : I will not say much about the plot here . If you really want to know , it 's easy to find out . But I believe you will enjoy the movie more without knowing what will happen , especially what happens leading up to the showdown at Skyfall - you do NOT even want to know in advance WHO IS THERE at Skyfall , trust me , or you will miss some of the emotional punch . So here goes ... My first impression , right after the movie : not enough spectacle.The opening chase was pretty good , but otherwise there 's not much in the way of thrills in the middle apart from a couple of brief scuffles ( and a poorly-chosen mode of vertical travel ) . The action is not that interesting , but thankfully it is not shot in the idiotically shaky `` Bourne-camera '' mode . And there is a ridiculous thing involving a , uh , diverted train , which does n't really add much . The finale is a mixed bag - more complexity would have been nice , but it 's interesting because Bond is preposterously outgunned.But a little later it sinks in : this is not the heart of the movie . Yes , surprisingly , it 's about heart.This movie is about depth , in more ways than one . It is about creating and experiencing a deeper , emotional connection with the characters , especially Bond . And in this it truly succeeds . You feel for the poor guy , from his opening plunge , through his feelings of betrayal and duty , and to the deep , terrible loss that is embodied in one of the movie 's most important characters , Skyfall Lodge - Bond 's childhood home . It is a genuinely moving , touching , darker and deeper Bond . When I watch it again , it will be for those moments.Everyone is top-notch - Bond , M , the new Q , and of course Silva , played by Javier Bardem as a strangely sympathetic monster you ca n't stop watching . His meetings with Bond seem anticlimactic , and their final face-off not too satisfying , but his connection to M is well-played , disturbing and affecting.M has a greater role here , explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make , her connection ( such as it is ) with her agents , and her dedication . Her hard-nosedness and her professional and physical vulnerability are nicely juxtaposed . One of the most moving moments is her quoting Tennyson -Though much is taken , much abides ; and thoughWe are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven ; that which we are , we are ; One equal temper of heroic hearts , Made weak by time and fate , but strong in willTo strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield.- while we see Bond , a broken and betrayed Bond , a seemingly outdated relic , rushing to save her . It is quite a powerful moment , one that you will want to see again.At the end , the movie takes an unexpected turn which ties it into the whole Bond mythology . Although tinged with sadness , fans will rejoice.The title song , which seemed weak and forgettable on first listen ( before seeing the movie ) , turns out to suit the movie quite well along with the brooding visuals of the opening credits . Both take on more meaning and emotional wallop after having viewed the movie , and I find I could watch them again and again : Let the sky fallWhen it crumblesWe will stand tallFace it all togetherThat last line really hits home , in the context of the finale.So - I wish there were more spectacular action . The middle drags a bit . But it is compelling and engaging on an emotional level , giving us a Bond we can feel for and even cheer on .	1
The cinematography in this is excellent ! Daniel Craig brings a steeliness to the Bond character that Sean Connery never had .	1
M made a decision in the past that hurt someone ? Yes , and that tough call complicates matters for MI6 ; even James Bond 's loyalty is put to the test . However , with world class villains ( and his own death ) to contend with , there is n't a moment to reflect on her misdeeds.Director Sam Mendes ( `` Revolutionary Road '' ) is working for the first time with the Broccoli family , who has owned this Bond franchise for 50 years . There is no doubt Mendes knows exactly what the fans expect , he delivers non-stop action , wonderful reminders of past Bond films , lots of gunfire and fisticuffs , plus oodles of blowie uppie stuff ! We recognize the regulars , but watch for some new ones , too : * Daniel Craig ( `` Defiance '' ) is back as Bond , resurrected from the dead and furious that M gave the order to shoot him ( he was wearing an ear bud ) . Now he must cope with a damaged body that does n't do quite what he wants . * Judi Dench ( `` The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel '' ) is still M , beleaguered , bedeviled and besieged . Of course , her quips are almost as funny as Bond 's . * Ben Whishaw ( `` Cloud Atlas '' ) is the callow youth who personifies this generation of technophiles . Yup , to Bond 's dismay , this mop-headed geek is our new Q and we love him from the get-go ! * Naomie Harris ( `` Mandala , Long Walk to Freedom '' ) is Bond 's sidekick in the opening scenes in Istanbul . Wait until you hear her last name ! * Javier Barden ( `` Biutiful '' ) seems to have SUCH fun playing villains ; this flaxen-haired bad guy is almost as persistent as our hero ; he just does n't know when to quit ! Revenge is a powerful motivator.This popular franchise illustrates what we mean when we say `` sensory overload . '' It is n't necessary to suspend disbelief in these things because we know as we walk in the door that we will be bombarded with PG-13 cartoony violence , hair's-breath escapes and quippy dialogue . It 's what we want , it 's what we pay for and it 's what we get ! With this one , even though it satisfies the target audience , I must admit that I was shaken , not stirred.When I get the DVD from Amazon , the closed captions will make up for the missing dialog , then I can love it like the rest of the audience !	1
I like the old Bonds , but also enjoy this new Bond by Craig where he is n't really superhuman . He overcomes by tenacity and determination . The new Q is great as well - look forward to seeing the next installment .	1
Thank you Mr. Craig.Good watch.I wish there would have been a little more back story on how his parents died . If it was in a different Bond movie I do n't remember it.And how much am I loving Javier Bardem - excellent Bond villain . Although the bleach job was a bit much . But then again , he was crazy .	1
Did n't expect it to be anything special - not really plugged into the movie industry PR since we pulled the plug on our satellite TV service a while back and stopped watching commercials . Gave this movie a chance and really , really liked it . I still like all the Bond movies but this one is hands down my favorite . Other favorites are the early Connery Bond movies . The movie was full of creative twists and turns . Good meeting of the old and the new . Anxious to see the next one .	1
I have been anxiously waiting to get this the third Bond film with Daniel Craig as Bond . After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace this was a total surprise . Craig is still the very physical Bond and is incredible as always . The storyline is out of left field and you have to pay close attention to what is going on or you 'll get lost . I 'm not going to spoil anything but there are more than a few surprises and endings for some people we 've gotten to know in the other two films . It is not as action packed as the previous two films , but this is still a 5 star film and I do encourage Daniel Craig Bond fans to get it . I 'm not downplaying the film , it is excellent , it just is n't up to the expectations , the previous two films gave us . Seller was fantastic , had it in my hands in under a week . Pick it up .	1
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE A JAMES BOND MOVIE . ALWAYS FILLED WITH ACTION AND SESPENS . GREAT FOR THE JAMES BOND IN YOU .	1
Skyfall ( 2012 ) is a solid James Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty ) . It has exciting action scenes , an interesting story and a dark tone . It 's closer in spirit to an Ian Fleming novel . Daniel Craig returns as James Bond . Cyberterrorists are hunting down MI6 agents . 007 has to prevent Silva ( Javier Bardem ) from assassinating M ( Judi Dench ) . Q and Miss Moneypenny return to the series . The Skyfall theme song sung by Adele is very good . There 's a fair amount of fan service . Bond drives his Aston Martin DB5 in the last hour of the film with the Monty Norman/John Barry James Bond theme music on the soundtrack . The music score composed by Thomas Newman is quite good . Skyfall is one of the best 007 movies .	1
dont forget it is a movie about spies . bond always behind and the evyl wining till the end . but i like it a lot . will watch again .	1
Not the best Bond , but well worth watching . Probably one of the best bad guys though . If you are a Bond fan , you will not be disappointed .	1
Loved the 007 movie . It was well written and good plot . Characters were interesting . Plot was suspenseful and fun to follow .	1
so far the best Daniel Craig 007 film . A good story with an interesting twist although the end was sad .	1
This is one of the most action packed Bond films ever ! The special effects are pretty good and there is a ton of great stunts . The storyline is a little over drawn at times but Bond films sometimes are that way .	1
Loved it . A Classic to be . Movie plays out well , fast , blunt to the point as James Bond is .	1
A 23rd James Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes , produced by Michael G Wilson and Barbara Brocolli , starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.A rich , high budget film , with sexy ladies , as usual with James Bond 's movies , comes with a story line based upon hunting down the secret information of worldwide undercover agents of MI6 placed in different terrorist organizations across the world , which is lost by MI6 , the employer of James Bond . The thief was Raoul Silva ( Javier Bardem ) , also an ex-MI6 agent , gets access to the internal server network of MI6 and tries to destroy the entire organization and kill its chief , ` M ' as a vengeance to an old treachery of M when he was in service . James Bond traces down Raoul in Shanghai ( China ) and captures him . But Raoul escapes from MI6 prison in London , by hacking into their security systems , and also attempts to kill M , in her office . Sensing danger , James escorts M to his childhood farm house `` The Skyfall '' in Scotland , deliberately leaving a trail , for Raoul to follow , so that he can kill him there . Raoul attacks Skyfall as per Bond 's plan , but Bond will not be able to save M , in the battle with Raoul , though he kills the later.The special effects , screenplay and cinematography employed in the movie are simply superb and absolutely extravagant . They are said to have used the latest technology in capturing the moments with Arri Alexa cameras . One can see how money is spent on some scenes that are mind blowing . Particularly the chase on the train , chase in the underground London tunnel , chase on the rooftops in Istanbul , Shanghai and Macau exotic locations and the splendor of Scotland 's countryside where Skyfall is located are worth watching and a real value for money . . Overall , a film with no slang and truly English.Ensure watching it in big screen with equally good sound system.Daniel Craig , a more of a serious faced and less of a tomboy unlike previous James Bonds we have grown up with , seems to be sure of the retirement from the service and it 's time to see a new James Bond , very soon.My rating is 4.5/5	1
My review is completely biased because I am a huge 007 fan and have seen all of the movies NUMEROUS times . Skyfall has a great twist to it and follows suit with the more dark Bond . The action scenes are typical of Bond and just when you think enough ammo has been spent , more follows . Great ending .	1
I am one of those who feel there are only three Bond pictures ... the first three . After that , the special effects , and reality stretching overshadowed the plot . But ... .this one is a real Bond movie ! Plot is excellent and believable , acting is excellent and it was just a good flick to watch . Highly recommended .	1
I have always love 007 story and I have seen all the shows . The good , bad and the handsome actors . The storyline . Although I had seen this in the movies , I love seeing it again and again . It is gripping .	1
It was a long four years but the wait paid off . Skyfall is everything I love and expect in a Bond film : great action sequences , witty dialogue , exotic locations , and an engrossing story for a template . This continues the tradition of grittier films set in motion by Casino Royale and once again Daniel Craig does n't disappoint , giving a great performance , as does everyone else . There were a few twists and surprises that I did n't see coming and the ending was very satisfying , especially as a lifelong 007 fan.Plus , the DB5 makes its return , complete with all of the classic Goldfinger attachments . How can you not love that ?	1
This movie was entertaining , but not one I would want to watch over and over . It was n't my favorite 007 movie .	1
One might think , but in actuality , it does as all other Bond films do , leave it open for more . Daniel Craig is becoming the quintessential Bond and I look forward to seeing more .	1
This film has a complex plot that wo n't let you down . The bad guy is amazing and very hard to describe here . The Bond series comes full circle with this plot . Bond purists will be pleased with the ending . Worth more than I paid .	1
I saw this movie in the theatre with my youngest child/son & did n't care for it . My son said it was because I do n't like change & he 's right . This movie touches on a lot of subjects . No spoilers here . I did n't like the ending.Bought this as a Christmas present to my son & of course I had to screen it to make sure it was okay lol . My 15 year old grandson watched it with me . I liked it better the second time around [ not the ending ] .Daniel Craig has become my favorite Bond . I have read some of Ian Fleming 's books & Craig is spot on as Bond especially in Casino Royale.Javier Badem [ sp ? ] is quite the understated & # 34 ; bad guy & # 34 ; .Should be enough action for the adrenaline junkies & there are spectacular visuals with the location shots . Makes me want to visit Scotland , but not Shanghai .	1
I have seen every James Bond movie , and I think this one is the best . If you have a good subwoofer , the sound track will give it a great workout .	1
One of the best James Bond films I have seen ! Daniel Craig , in my opinion , is the best Bond since Roger Moore . Classic Bond film with action , car chases , and plenty of twists and turns . Bond at his best !	1
Like most Bond movies , this one was entertaining and had a lot of action . But , despite current-day capabilities in move-making , I will probably always prefer any of the Sean Connery Bond movies .	1
What a great Bond movie and Daniel Craig certainly brings the darker elements of the character to life . I 've watched it twice and think this Bond version , without too much cheeky commentary , but great interactions with the women , continues to increase the brand value of the character .	1
I love James Bond all of the movies but this is by far one of the best I have ever seen ! The story and acting are right on and bring a different tone to the movie just one of the best bonds out there !	1
I like the way that Bond has been re-invented with Daniel Craig in the lead role . I think that Skyfall truly has captured the magic of the old James Bond movies . At the same time it both pays tribute to and even pokes a little fun at the old series . I have always liked You only Live Twice and The Man with the Golden Gun . I think that Skyfall is better . I think that the character Mallory is a great addition . While I think John Cleese is a great comedic actor , I think that he was not a good fit to replace Desmond Lewellyn as Q. I like that they went with a young actor rather than trying to replace the late Mr. Lewellyn . The plot is intriguing . I love what they did with the villain . It was fresh to see a villain whose motives are valid even if his actions are over the top . I highly recommend this movie .	1
To give the reader some perspective , I never understood everyone 's love affair with the first Daniel Craig Bond movie and the second one was a disaster . Skyfall is a return to the Bond movies we know and love and consider it to be much better than the previous two . Three and a half stars.Spoiler alert.Despite the unrealistic conclusion to the the opening sequence ( where the agent only shoots Bond but does n't take another shot at the evildoer ) and the overly long climax ( is there an editor in the house ? ) , this Bond movie was very enjoyable . The opening credit sequence was extraordinary , well orchestrated with the song by Adele . I 'm glad they continue that tradition . It could have had a few more gadgets and a tighter script and pace , but that 's Hollywood these days !	1
4.5 stars . Making the 23rd James Bond movie is no enviable task . Make it in the traditional way and it looks like retread and parody , like Brosnan 's last two . Depart from the traditional and it 's not really a James Bond movie , like Quantum of Solace . This is a series that has had to be remade several times to fit in with the era and to make Bond 's exploits interesting . Skyfall is n't so much a remake as it a back to basics . Much of it has an old-school feel to it . Q & Moneypenny are reintroduced and a new M is introduced . The Bond villain is n't part of some absurd global criminal organization . He 's just a cackling madman From the Connery/Moore days played perfectly by Javier Bardem . Bardem is the best Bond villain since Sean Bean in Goldeneye . Craig 's Bond is n't some tortured antihero . He 's a professional killer w a smart mouth . The beauty of James Bond movies used to be how they were pure escapism . Bond 's psychology was n't explored , much less considered . He was more of a cypher through which the viewer could live his or her fantasies of jet-setting and saving the world . The eternal sunshine of 007 's spotless mind . Skyfall edges closer to that . We get some personal stuff but not nearly the tortured angst of the last two entries . Skyfall runs well over two hours but does n't feel too long like most movies do these days . There 's no Bond girl this time around and that is disappointing . Bond movies tend to work best when there 's an element of sexiness to them . Some of the plot and action sequences are obviously borrowed from other movies like Batman and Die Hard . Bond works best when he 's setting the pace and not keeping up . Other franchises should imitating Bond . Judi Dench was always pressing for more screentime and here she gets to be the focus of the entire movie . Fortunately , she is an excellent actress , so I did n't mind too much . I like Craig as Bond . He 's a talented actor , so that gives the brain trust a flexibility most of his predecessors did n't . I 'm heartened by the changes they made . Exactly the kick in the pants this often moribund franchise needed . I 'm looking forward to Bond 24 .	1
Possibly the best of the & # 34 ; Bond & # 34 ; series.Incredible non-stop action , with the best cinematography and action in film that I 've seen since & # 34 ; Lawrence of Arabia & # 34 ; .	1
Daniel Craig is , once again , utterly compelling , convincing , focused . The movie 's direction is almost perfect . The sets , tone and coloring are marvelous . I simply loved this latest Bond .	1
Once again this James Bond movie with Daniel Craig in the starring role is fantastic ! ! ! Your eyes never leave the screen because you do not wish to mish a scene .	1
Like all of the James Bond movies , this one does not disappoint you . It is fun with lots of action and humor throughout the show . It also gave more back ground on Bond and M. Loved watching it .	1
It was an excellent James Bond movie . Lots of action and a terrific plot . Will watch this again in the near future .	1
I bought this as a gift for my dad but I also saw it in theaters and liked it . Although it had a different feel to it than a normal bond film it was still good . I think this film lives up to its name and I noticed they added it to amazon prime streaming so I might watch it again .	1
Itbis always hard to like the new bond , but this movie lives up its reputation . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
It was a little long , but overall a good movie . The other reviews are in depth so I wo n't get into all of that .	1
I really liked the way it keeps you on the edge of your seat . It has great CG 's , which is one of the reasons I love the modern movies .	1
Now we get to know what makes James bond , ..well put together , ..from the soul of the man to what makes him the best secret agent , ..go 007 ! !	1
This was a great movie . Daniel Craig makes an excellent James Bond . I hope to see some more in the future .	1
The Aston Martins seen were all 3D fullsize produced models from 1 DB5 modelNow I want my DB5 Aston done that way too IE mass produced to Rent , own , etcHuge new industryIf one can do Astons , why not Ferraris , Benz , Porsche , Audi etcBest Bond , good locales , settings & love the new M .	1
I enjoy any James Bond film . They are action movies with twisted humor or irony interspersed . The film quality was great . I recommend it .	1
James Craig is my favorite James Bond since Sean Connery . Casino Royale was just a bit better than this one with its very physical and very gritty portrayal of physical violence . This one comes pretty close and is worlds better than Quantum of Crap was . Javier Bardem is definitely my favorite Bond villain ever . His performance was riveting . As much as I enjoy Craig 's performance , Bardem 's was even better .	1
this movie rocked the house . This was one of the best bond films I have seen . It was practical but not as far as the borne movies . Everything made sense and important characters died . Bonds bad guy was ( spiller ) another 00 like in goldeneye and captured him but did not torture him in the traditional way . It was great . I do n't want to spoil anything but if you liked Casio Royal you will like this one . Also ( spoiler ) Eve ( Moneypenny ) is finally sexy enough so that you can believe they have or will have sexual tension . Great Bond movie . Loved it !	1
This was an interesting movie as long as you tried not to compare it with the original James Bond cast . However , on its own a great movie . Nothing can compare the the original cast even though they did bring in glimpses of the past .	1
I think this was one of the best with Daniel Craig . Some good twists and turns as well as surprises . More insight into how James Bond came to be who he is . I thoroughly enjoyed this one .	1
Not your typical Bond movie . This was fabulous . I loved how Judi Dench is the real & # 34 ; Bond Girl & # 34 ; in this one . The plot was really wonderful . This is the movie where you really see the angst that drove Bond into the MI-6 . Awesome fight scenes , great dialogue . Loved the new Q ! Even though it was n't the typical Bond movie , it had everything that you love and want from Bond .	1
Very good Bond film , with all the requisites . Daniel Craig certainly plays an excellent James Bond . Judi Dench is the quintessential & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; . Javier Bardem takes his place among the long line of Bond villains .	1
Bond finds himself at a crossroads.SPOILERS : After being shot by his partner on an assignment , Bond ( Daniel Craig ) plumnets from a speeding train into a river . Believed to be dead , MI6 finds their last , best hope to prevent information exposing agents embedded in terrorist organizations worldwide almost as dead in the water as Bond.Bond stays out of the public eye enjoying `` death '' but returns to offer his services to a very surprised M ( Judi Dench ) when MI6 is blown apart by Silva ( Javier Bardem ) a terrorist determined to take revenge against M and the agency at all costs.Bond unexpectantly finds that he has far more in common with Silva than he ever thought.END OF SPOILERS : When it was announced that dramatic director Sam Mendes was going to tackle the latest Bond film , there was a mixture of surprise and trepidation as he had never tackled an action film before . Mendes ' experience as a director of stage and screen came in handy allowing him to develop a Bond film with more dramatic depth and heft than might have occurred otherwise.Many Bond films rise or fall ( Skyfall ) based on the set pieces in the film i.e. , the action sequences embelished with plenty of stunts . `` Skyfall '' opens with an exceptionally good one that measures up to the stunning opening for `` Casino Royale '' . Bond films also rise and fall based on how complex and interesting the villian is in the piece . Bardem does a good job creating a fascinating bad guy whose grip on his sanity is slippery at best . Bardem makes Silva much more interesting than your standard Bond villian and , perhaps , almost as colorful as Goldfinger or Blofeld . Now that EON productions and United Artists/MGM/Sony ownNever Say Never Again ( Blu-ray Version ) and the rights to Blofeld , maybe we 'll see that character reintroduced in the next installment.The script by Joshua Logan with Neal Puris & Robert Wade effortlessly incorporates elements of older Bond films ( in a nice tip of the hat in one scene toGoldfinger ( 50th Anniversary Repackage ) [ Blu-ray ] ) , as well as , introducing new variations on old characters.Featuring ( for the first time ) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen , `` Skyfall '' sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature CraigCasino Royale ( Blu-ray + DVD ) and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong , detailed presentation . The audio is equally impressive with an immersive mix.The special features are another thing entirely . While the commentary track by director Mendes is terrific ( noting tributes to other films and directors ) and the one featuring producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli provides nice detail as well , the featurettes ( which can be viewed as a single documentary if you choose ) are a bit on the superifical side particularly when compared to the terrific ones for the classic Bond films . Still , they are n't bad -- they do cover interesting material just not in depth by comparison to what we 've seen in the past.We also get a standard DVD included with the Blu-ray as well as the option to watch the film via Ultra Violet.Bond 's latest adventure returns luster to the series as the so-so reception forQuantum of Solace [ Blu-ray ] . Actor Daniel Craig who has added a primal edge to Bond is signed up for at least two more outings . I 'm hoping that they will be as good as this one and continue to develop the material that we see here in `` Skyfall '' .Highly recommended .	1
Good movie	1
Not Moore 's tongue in cheek approach , or Connery 's super suave Bond . A slightly more tragic Bond . I would say he is not as invincible , where as the others never get hurt , you get the feeling he really can get hurt .	1
As someone who has followed the 50 years of James Bond ( 007 ) movies , and saw his first film ( Dr.No ) at the theater with his girlfriend long ago - we have all watched the progression , and cycling of actors portraying the James Bond agent character , and storyline plots . With the inclusion of actor Daniel Craig in his third film as James Bond , his portrayal takes the role to a new high . James Bond is NOT infallible , he 's getting older , British Intelligence ( M.I.6 ) is under deep scrutiny by the British Government as to their continued effectiveness , existence and costs , while & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; ( mom ) has those ( the bad guys ) who want to ensure great harm comes to her . This movie is absolutely packed with action , suspense , terrific special effects ( that are not CGI ) , and a storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat . Best Bond movie ever made - and that says a lot .	1
Good bond film , but not his best . not much story line , just a lot of action . The settinfg was very good .	1
Great film , with Bond being Bond . I loved the storyline , except for the character of M dying . I suppose with her health issues that have been public and her wishing to move on to other projects , this was to be expected . But sure will miss her in the franchise nonetheless .	1
Skyfall played fine over the internet - no problems ... The movie is good - showing that Bond can make a come back after a nasty experience/layoff , and fought a pretty badASS high tech villain ... Good action , good dialogue ...	1
I 'm sure his sexiness and confidence alone make it such a great movie . He 's soooo resilient and I can never tell the path that the movie is going to turn . Teared up with him at the end ! Did n't know he had feelings !	1
These were a present for my daughter . She loves them ! How great that all three movies are sold together ! Much easier than storing three separate cases !	1
Not one , not two , but three fabulous Cindarella stories in one package ... It was almost too much for our princess-mad child to endure ! This is a perfect gift for girls of any age , even us girls of a certain age . Warning to parents : Be aware that you may find yourself watching these Cindarella stories over and over again . You may also find yourself enjoying it as much as the younger girls do.Lots of fun and recommended for family viewing .	1

A very good film . Good suspense and good story line . This is my favorite Stanwyck genra . She is great in all her films but I love her sweet yet tough roles best . Would highly recommend to all classic movie lovers !	1
The film was not Stanwyck 's best but I enjoyed it . John Lund is usually good in his roles . The plot could have been better , but it was okay .	1
Lyle Bettger is the real villain here , after thowing out pregnant .Stanwycvk from NY apartment and leaving her on her own to travel to mid-West . Stanwyck meets married couple Phyllis Thaxter and Richard Denning and agrees to try on Thaxter 's ring when train wreck occurs . A case of mistaken identity , pregnant Stanwyck moves in with husband 's family ( he dies on train with his wife ) and is immediately accepted , falls in love with John Lund , Denning 's brother only have Bettger follow her and begin to blackmail herl Excellent noir plot.Re-made 3 times as I MARRIED A SHADOW ( French,1982 ) , WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING ( 1995 ) & MRS. WINTERBOURNE ( 1995 ) .Viz . NOIR , NOW & THEN by Ronald Schwartz Greenwood Press 2001L	1
My 4 1/2 year old loves Jake , and this DVD did not disappoint . My little one ( 2 1/2 ) likes it too . I found the best price for this on Amazon.com ...	1
Got this one as a gift for a nephew but my daughter loves this dvd as well . She is 18 months old right now and watches like she is glued to the screen . Disney Jr. is top notch in my book .	1
LOL , combine film noir and Jerry Lewis buffoonery , and you have It 's Only Money . What elevates this from other Lewis films is the writing and directing by Frank Tashlin ( who directed other Lewis features , including The Geisha Boy ) . True , Lewis is the complete idiot savant here as Lester March , a TV repairman who is very talented with electronic gadgets but , otherwise , always a clumsy one-man wrecking crew otherwise . It turns out that he is the long-lost son of a deceased millionaire , but does n't know it . Unfortunately , bad guys who are trying to get the fortune for themselves try to kill Lester . Silly stuff ( subtle it is not ) , but it 's strangely appealing.Besides Lewis , the cast also includes 1940s bad guy Zacharcy Scott , and a darling Mae Quesdel , famous for being the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl in 1930s cartoons.The picture quality is excellent , with a fair amount amount of grain . There should not be any complainers about the video.Audio is also excellent.Extras ... nada , zip , zilch.I would recommend this as a perfect example of a 1960s Jerry Lewis but you might want to rent it first before purchase to see if it is something you like .	1
I have been very confused by the listing of this dvd but finally read a review of it in the New York Times which answered my questions . When this is referred to as the `` season of the show '' , as it would be when it airs on tv , this IS SEASON 13 . However , if you have been buying sets of the shows in America , it is referred to as SET 20.The picture on the box is also confusing . The figure on the left is John Nettles who has starred in all 13 seasons . He stopped at the end of the season 13 and the actor on the right took over the Barnaby role as his cousin . This actor is shown in this season but it is Ben who remains Barnaby 's partner and who should really be shown on the box . The actor on the right has played the lead in the rest of the series which has already aired in the UK as season 14 and two episodes of season 15 . These numbers have nothing to do with the sets of dvds numbering as they are being released in the USA.You may find this useful as it can be very confusing if you are following this show in more than one viewing resource.This concluding season for John Nettles is every bit as good as the prior seasons . The high camp humor continues throughout . The concluding one is rather poignant as we learn then that John Nettles is retiring as Chief Inspector Barnaby . The show as a whole has cast a satiric gaze on the UK murder mystery which features the grisliest murders in the most bucolic and idyllic village settings . Throughout their polite , purpose filled days in leading proper lives , these people are capable of quite compelling bits of violence and the detectives find them out with their own inventive and amusing ways .	1
The product came without any problems . It was on time.I have loved this series and have all the sets now withBarnaby ... ..but I cried as I learned he is retiring andthis was his last video . I hope the following videoskeep me watching ? ? ? But I so loved the series with thefirst Barnaby !	1
Good stories and John Nettles is as likable as ever . I 'm so sorry he is no longer in the series .	1
I have every set so far and watch them over and over . No matter the changes in the cast , the show does go on .	1
Another great addition to our Midsomer collection . especially at an affordable price . We look forward to adding more sets as well ...	1
I have purchased every set of midsomer murders and I 've been completely satisfied with every one . The best part is I 've never been able to guess any ending .	1
John Nettles character always shines . I never get tired of him . I am amazed how many series they have produced . I only hope that one day I will have them all .	1
HAVE READ MOST OF THE SERIES AND AM NOW TRYING TO COLLECT THEDIFFERENT SEASONS FOR A COLLECTION OF GOOD ENTERTAINMENT .	1
I truly enjoyed this series and I am so looking forward to 3rd Season . Wonderful presentations and the story is well written : ) Thank you .	1
When there is discussion of the oeuvre of an Italian filmmaker , it is easy to mention the names of legendary directors Federico Fellini , Michelangelo Antonioni , Vittorio De Sica , Luchino Visconti and Mario Monicelli.Mario Monicelli is known in Italy as one of the masters of Commedia all'Italiana ( Comedy Italian style ) and received Oscar nominations for his screenwriting for `` The Organizer '' ( 1963 ) and `` Casanova '70 ' ( 1965 ) . As well as a Grand Prize of the Festival nomination at the Cannes Film Festival ( `` Guardie e ladri '' , 1951 ) and Palme d'Or nominations for `` For Love and Gold '' ( 1966 ) , `` Vogliamo i colonnelli '' ( 1973 ) , `` An Average Little Man '' ( 1977 ) and `` Le due vite di Mattia Pascal '' ( 1985 ) .And while he is known outside of Italy for his comedy films such as `` I soliti ignoti '' ( `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' ) and collaborating with talents such as Toto , Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni , Mastroianni also directed films that contained humor , but were tragic or futile . One of the most important films Monicelli is known for is `` La grande guerra '' ( `` The Great War '' , 1959 ) , which he was nominated for an Academy Award and considered as his top masterpiece , and also directing `` i compagni '' ( `` The Organizer '' , 1963 ) and `` The Girl with the Pistol '' ( 1968 ) . Both films , he would also receive Academy Award nominations . Fitting films for a Marxist who accepted reality and its failures.In his lifetime , he won 27 awards worldwide and won an Honorable Mention at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival and a Golden Lion for Career at the 1991 Venice Film Festival . His final film was in 2006 in which the filmmaker directed `` The Roses of the Desert '' at the age of 91.A man full who lived life to the fullest , unfortunately his final years with prostate cancer would become too much of a burden on the filmmaker that he committed suicide in 2010 at the age of 95.While many people are familiar with Monicelli 's comedy films such as `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' , which was released by the Criterion Collection back in 2001 . Criterion Collection will be releasing `` i Compagni '' ( `` The Organizer '' ) , one of his more serious films ala `` tragicomedy '' for the first time on Blu-ray and will also be released on DVD in April 2012.VIDEO : '' The Organizer '' is presented in 1080p High Definition ( 1:85:1 aspect ratio ) . The whites and grays are well-contrast and black levels are very deep . For the most part , I detected no film damage or any white specks , artifacts or banding issues . The quality of the film is very good , does n't look soft and viewers should be pleased.According to the Criterion Collection , this new high-definition transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a new 35 mm print . Thousands of instances of dirt , debris , scratches , splices , warps , jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI 's DRS system and Pixel Farm 's PFClean , while Image Systems DVNR was used for small dirt , grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES : '' The Organizer '' is presented in LPCM 1.0 monaural Italian with optional English subtitles . Dialogue is crystal clear and I detected no pops or hiss during my viewing of this film.According to the Criterion Collection , the original stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack positive . Clicks , thumps , hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD . Crackle was attenuated using Audio Cube 's integrated workstation.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' The Organizer - The Criterion Collection # 610 ' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features : Mario Monicelli - ( 10:53 ) Featuring an interview with director Mario Monicelli recorded by the Criterion Collection in 2006 . Monicelli talks about Commedia all'Italiana and his career.Theatrical trailer -Theatrical trailer for `` The Organizer '' .EXTRAS : '' The Organizer - The Criterion Collection # 610 ' comes with a 4-page ( dual sided ) fold-out leaflet , featuring the essay `` Description of a Struggle '' by J. Hoberman.JUDGMENT CALL : I simply adore the films by Mario Monicelli and when it comes to `` The Organizer '' , it 's rather fascinating because when it comes to films about workers going on strike , in many modern films , the outcome has always been in the employees favor and always positive outcome of how labor laws were changed.But not so much the case in cinema past , especially films from Europe.From Sergei Eisenstein 's 1925 film `` Stachka '' ( Strike ) that showcased Eisenstein 's theme of collectivism versus individualism and showcasing how employees work themselves to death while owners and management are wealthy and could care less about their employees , Eisenstein 's film was grounded in Lenin belief that , `` The strength of the working class is organization . Without organization of the masses , the proletarian is nothing . Organized it is everything . Being organized means unity of action , unity of practical activity '' .We fast forward to 1963 and similar to `` Strike '' , Monicelli 's film is set during the turn-of-the-twentieth century Turin . As Eisenstein 's film preached Leninism , Monicelli believed in Marxism , which literally is a society in which burgeois or idealism do not exist.In today 's world , specifically here in the West , the idea of long work hours , employment of children and literally no breaks can not be fathomed . But yet this mentality still continues in other countries . The reality for some countries today and how things were back then is that people accept their working condition and the fear of the harsh realities of not making any income is enough for one not to stand up and become defiant towards their management . As a collective , not many are willing to do public protests , strike back in the media nor are they in a position financially to do so.This is the reality today.And back then , a lot of these individuals had no means to strike back , especially as a collective through media or political means . In Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' , the reality of the employees and their organized strike was violence . Violence towards the management , violence towards any other employees who were not able to hold out from the strike and were willing to return to their jobs . And unfortunately , all that is left is tragedy.Fortunately , Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' is a film that showcases Monicelli 's belief that the reality is what it is , and the employees of Turin need to realize that going on strike may have hurt the management but in the long run , the reality is they have the means to outlast the workers , because they have the money to survive.And another juxtaposition with Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' is that the people were ready to fight and die for what they believe in . This was the Leninism perspective of working as a collective . Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' featured a collective that was held on a string , courtesy of Professor Sinigaglia , but it was evident that these workers have families , children that depend on them and while some maybe able to fight , the outcome is much more different , despite their being a tragedy.Another key difference is the inclusion of comedy . Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' was primarily focused on the strike itself and the differences of lifestyle with the factory workers and the wealthy and how the financial impact was hurting families.In Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' , times are tough but yet there is humor . May it be a man who tries to flirt with a young woman , the stocky long-time employee Pautasso during his lunch break as he holds a huge circular bread to chow down on , or may it be a young boy who is not afraid to talk back to his elders ( and also admonishing his younger brother who is attending school but would rather be an employee at the factory ) or the local prostitute who tries to entice Professor Sinigaglia.There are many of these moments that help the viewer get closer to various characters and see that despite how difficult the times are , they try to make the best of it.So , for me , `` The Organizer '' has always been a fascinating film as it is an intriguing juxtaposition when compared to Eisenstein 's film . Both have similarities but yet are very different.Actor Marcelo Mastroianni is often seen playing a suave , charismatic character that always gets the lady and come to think of it , I suppose nothing has changed as the Professor also manages to find a woman but in different circumstances . But Mastroianni does a good job playing Professor Sinigaglia and being the spoken leader for the workers.But as Marcelo Mastroianni is the lead actor , what I enjoyed most of the film are the workers who attract the viewers through their feebleness , their humor or directive . Renato Salvatori , Gabriella Gieorgelli , Folco Lullu , Bernard Blier , Raffaella Carra and many more , its the supporting cast of the film that makes `` The Organizer '' come to life . The performances are honest and humorous but also feel realistic and natural , and because of that , it does add to the engaging storyline.As for the Blu-ray release , the video quality of `` The Organizer '' is fantastic and the interview with Mario Monicelli included on this Blu-ray was also enjoyable to watch , considering it was shot during a time when he was in good health and a few years before he died . Although I wish there were more special features included , especially audio commentary , I 'm still grateful that this interview with Monicelli was included on this Blu-ray release.Overall , `` The Organizer '' has always been one of my favorite Monicelli films and I can only hope that with this release , it will pave the way for more Monicelli films such as `` La Grande Guerra '' ( `` The Great War '' ) , `` The Girl With the Pistol '' or `` L'armata Brancaleone '' ( `` For Love and Gold '' ) to receive a video release . `` The Organizer '' is highly recommended !	1
Infinite Stratos is by far one of the best action-harem comedies i have seen . Even though it 's a harem show do n't black list it thinking it 's some low brow show only for 14 year old boys . The animation was awesome and so was the english dub . I loved all of the characters . Even the story was good which I had n't really been expecting . I was laughing almost all the way through this anime . I only have one complaint about IS . It was n't long enough ! There really should be more than 13 episodes . I wanted it to keep going .	1
good anime but product is wrongly named . this is the 1st season , season two is already out . Season 3 is in development .	1
This anime is awsome , way beyond my expectations as a mecha anime as it adds unqiueness even if it does have a harem aspect as well.definitely would recommend this if your into mecha animes	1
I saw this on Youtube . I really like this series . The only thing I do not like about the dvd . It dose not have all the episode on the dvd.The Youtube has it all . If they ever made a new dvd with all the episode . I will buy it .	1
I fell in love with this series ! ! Total fanservice to be sure , however if you like girls , you ca n't go wrong with this one . I Love the artwork that was done , they did n't rely too heavily on CG animation ( which can def take away from the overall aspect if used too much in my opinion ) . Good harem show , of course one inept guy surrounded by beautiful women lol The comedy is great , the bonds that form are also great . I think this is designed for you to fall in love with one or two characters ( mine were definitely Charlotte and Laura ) and hope that the main character ends up with one of them : ) There is n't as much IS action as i would have liked , but there 's enough action to keep even action fans drawn in . Worth every penny and a great addition to my collection , I just hope they do more seasons as they leave it slightly open ... . ( what anime does n't : ) )	1
this is a harem anime , but the concept of the IS really stands out , when compared to other anime , for being only 12 episodes the series stands tall . there is fan service but nothing like sekirei or rosario + vampire.the story seems romantic and lots of comedy , while balancing out with action scenes.the story is basically introducing all the characters to the viewers and their romantic ties to our herothere is to be an ova release , and hopefully a season 2 as i feel its left on a cliff hanger , and we as fans want it to continue.what you get with b-raycd soundtrack2 blue rays1-9 disk 110-12 & ova disk 2	1
The overall quality is great , however im going to focus on the smaller things that may make or break this blu ray for you.First , when it comes to sentai products they have a habit of rolling a long list of credits at the end of every episode . So if you 're like me and you have it turned on and are just listening to it the end of the episodes may start to annoy you.Second , be aware that the voice acting emphasizes the multi cultural aspect of the plot ... by that I mean the voice actors really emphasized the accents of the individual characters . You get used to it but this could be a make or break , until you realize that the original audio is still on the disk as well as subtitles.I would recommend this for people who watched it when it first aired , are into harems , and even robots . The quality is great and the item is packed with some extra bonuses like an soundtrack cd that has primarily has all the versions of Super Stream and a couple other songs as well as commentaries from the original japanese cast.well worth the price	1
OK , it 's predictable , but it 's also laugh out loud hilarity ( mostly with the situations between our clueless guy and the ever widening harem ) , cool battles and great animation . The voice work is good , but not great . I swear the German chick was voiced by a person who learned the accent watching Hogan 's Heroes , the French accent from watching National Lampoon 's European Vacation , and the English accent from Austin Power movies . They were too over the top and not close to accurate . But you soon get used to them and learn to ignore that idiocy.Bottom line , it 's a fun , entertaining series that goes by way too fast . It really could have benefited from several more episodes . Nothing was really wrapped up , too many unanswered questions , and the viewer is left wanting more . I guess that 's good in a way as you do n't feel cheated . All the characters are almost tragic , and a few has his or her own episode covering their back story . I wished there were more of these , as you really got a handle on the character . After the back story on Laura Bodewig , I switched from `` what a b**ch '' to liking her . Cecilia Alcott - I could take or leave this British royalty scion . No back story , too two dimensional . That 's where more episodes would help.Anyway , it 's a worthwhile view and one you 'll not regret adding to your collection !	1
Try to watch others anime they look really great because I been only watch bleach and Naruto and it is time for me to move on to others anime series I been really missing out ! So yeah it about time I do that ! So yeah having watching yet ! I would give it a try !	1
BRILLANT RESTORATION FOR A MASTERPIECE ! BOTH THE FILM AND THE RESTORATION PROJECT SHOULD BE SOME AWARDS WINNER . A PRECIOUS BLU-RAY PACKAGE !	1
This film is a gritty realistic portrayal of the modern war on terror from a fresh disturbing view point as well as the all to real possibilities that all this mayhem is & # 34 ; just business & # 34 ; . What lays below the surface is much scarier than even imagined in this piece . This film reminds me of a modern day & # 34 ; Taxi Driver & # 34 ; or the real & # 34 ; Expendables & # 34 ; . Very well done in my opinion and a worth watch for anyone into this genre of film ! But do n't come looking for hero 's ! ! !	1
The star of this film , Toby Kebbell , does a knock-out job playing a Solider whom just returned home to London from Afghanistan.He meets up with his best mate , whom was in Afghanistan with him , and the story begins . Twists , deception , drugs , terrorist cells , action galore and a ride of a film.I wo n't go into detail for I see other comments have basically given the movie away by telling you scene to scene.Want to see a great film with an incredible under-rated actor ? This is it !	1
This series is so entertaining , and believe me , I love series . This is funny and I love the way they take everything in stride .	1
Frank , sexy comedy . Flies safely under the censor 's knife . You could be forgiven for thinking Mike & Molly are n't in fact a married unit .	1
One of the neatest new comedy 's out there . Thoroughly enjoy every episode . Melissa McCarthy is comedic gem and I 'm so glad they gave her a television show !	1
I LOVE Mike and Molly 's television show . All the characters ensure lots of laughs , empathy and entertainment . I 'm anxiously awaiting Season 3 's delivery !	1
Don 2is a sequel to the 2006 film , which itself was a remake of the 1978 Amitabh film . The plot in this film picks up 5 years after the earlier Don ended . SRK wants to dominate the European underworld , to set his plan in to motion he must seek the assistance of his arch enemy Vardhan ( Boman Irani ) , but Vardhan is in prison . So SRK gets himself arrested and lands up in jail to get him out and set his plan in motion . The plan : steal the money printing plates of the German Central Bank . Don 2 has several things in it favor , a witty script laced with Donisms , one liners which are already a rage . An example Mallik : Tumhari talaash toh duniya ki har police ko hai ... kiss kiss se baat karu ? Don : Aaj yeh sunkar meri maa kitni khush hoti . Mallik : Apne hathon se hi tumhe goli maar deti . Don : Mr Mallik , aap meri maa ko nahi jaante the . The engaging script has several moments which keep you hooked , such as above , great script , the locations , acting , cinematography and did not let up during the entirety of the 2.30 run time . I personally thought that the following scenes were superb : Jail Break in MalaysiaHrithik Roshan 's cameoThe car chase in BerlinThe fight scenesThe plot to stealThe final minutes of the filmSRK has completely transformed his body and has a physical presence that suits this role , he is buff and intense in the physically demanding scenes . After 20 years on the scene , not many actors can entertain and keep you interested like SRK does . Priyanka Chopra looks pretty but somehow lacks the physical presence that is required of the character . As is , the film does not have a lot of things for her to do . Kuanl Kapoor and Lara Dutta are perfect in their mini roles.Hrithik Roshan is funny ... ... .Jawwab Shah ( Jabbar ) has a towering presence bit is dwarfed by the leads.The weakest link of the film was the music , the 1978 had some of the best loved music which is popular even today . The music of the 2006 remake managed to impress as well . This soundtrack is a utter and complete disappointment , how on earth did Shankar - Ehsaan-Loy manage such a below average soundtrack . Shame on Farhan Akhtar ... ... ..Besides SRK , the cinematography of Jason West raises the bar to make the film come alive ... ..I highly recommend this film and enjoyed it . I enjoyed the 2D version , the film was shot in it as well and do not see the point of watching it again in 3D . Please notice the final frames of the film as the stage is set for Don 3 ( hint , notice the number plate of Don 's bike ) SRK reaffirms my faith in him again , his past few film have not been up to the mark for me . DON 2 should easily make him the king of the block once again . 4 stars . 12/23/2011	1
Great to see Shahrukh Khan back in the bad guy character ! Loved him in the first Don , and love him in everything he has done !	1
This is a really good film . I watched it because it was listed under `` thrillers , '' not because I expected a horror flick . It is NOT a jaded horror flick about some cheesy 20-something-year-olds in a cabin fighting a serial killer . Instead , it is a much more complex and entertaining story . It is hard to describe it without giving away the plot . Just watch it . Trust me -- you 'll probably like it .	1
My wife and I were looking for a movie last night , I read the reviews on Enter Nowhere they all said it was very good to Excellent I read them decided to watch the movie excellent movie the reason I am writing this is to thank the six that wrote their reviews about the movie and they did not give away the fantastic twist to the movie . Out of six people writing I thought with such a fine movie somebody would have slipped up . If anybody reads this it is one of the few movies right now well worth the 4-5 dollars watch it you will not be dissapointed . Thanks again , Larry Jones	1
I thought it was very good , it was exactly what I wanted a movie without extreme violence & terror . Just mystery & suspense . Surprise in movie that I did n't expect , def worth watching !	1
The previous reviews cover the cartoons well.I agree that the restoration job is top-notch . I want to focus on the fascinating supplements . There is a gallery of promotional materials from the collection of Jerry Beck , a set of storyboards for the debut of Baby Huey , `` Quack a Doodle Doo '' , which run alongside the final cartoon in synchronization , comics featuring the characters , and an audio commentary about the replacement of the original theatrical titles by those used for the TV re-releases , which plays over examples of the re-release titles . ( The main shorts have restored theatrical titles . ) My favorite is an amazing set of production drawings ( pencil with color guides ) showing the drawings , in sequence , one drawing per screen , for the Jack-in-the-Box rising from his box and extending the `` Noveltoons '' sign , from the original titles . This is preservation of the history of animation at its best .	1
When these three get together , there are no limits on conversational topics or crazy thoughts . Best medicine for the blues .	1

This Canadian television show about a supernatural world ( the Fae ) that exists in secrecy among humans is so different from the typical fantasy TV show that it grabbed my attention immediately . It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores ; however , they are the `` Lost Girl '' version of myths and legends . It has characters , action , and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining . The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo ( Anna Silk ) , a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents . A succubus is a creature that must feed on the `` chi '' ( the life force ) of humans and Fae to survive ; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal . Being the modern version of the mythical succubus , Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it 's all sexual healing to her . Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted . Thereafter , Bo fled from home and everything she had known , living a friendless existence , accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies ; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.Bo saves a human woman , Kenzi ( Ksenia Solo ) , from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her , the two become instant friends ( with Kenzi as Bo 's streets-smart sidekick ) . This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans . The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization , despising and using them for their own benefit . Their world is divided into two clans , the Light and Dark , with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two ; however , although the Light Fae are more diplomatic , both sides use humans as slaves , servants , and food . Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader , The Ash , for interrogation . It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is ` different ' . It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers , the wolf-shifter and police detective , Dyson ( Kris Holden-Ried ) ; and Lauren ( Zoie Palmer ) , the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash . When the Ash orders Lauren ( Dr. Lewis ) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is , Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that , if she wanted to , she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive . Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other , but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial , Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is . Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick ( Richard Howland ) , owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern , `` The Dal Riata '' ; and Hale ( K.C . Collins ) , a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson . Minor characters include The Morrigan ( Emmanuelle Vaugier ) , vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo ; and Vex , a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan , and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.The women of Lost Girl are strong , resourceful , and live their lives on their own terms . The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences . Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson , the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame , but it is nevertheless intense . ( Fact : The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1 , and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren . Regardless of what naysayers may say , from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo 's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson . ) Along with the creatures , adventures , rolls in the hay , cleavage , and Bo 's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way , Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged . The core nature of Fae and humans , and their interconnections , are not affected by any one of them being bisexual , heterosexual , or homosexual.Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada 's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States , United Kingdom ( UK and Ireland ) , and Australia . The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television ( Season 1 has 13 episodes ; Season 2 has 22 episodes ; Season 3 has 13 episodes ) . Episodes running time : 44 minutes.Lost Girl is rated TV-MA ( Mature Audiences Only ) L-S-V ( Language , Sex , Violence ) and may be unsuitable for those younger than 17 years of age . ( Unhappy news about the Blu-ray I received : when I opened the package all three discs were covered with dust , with the third disc having the most on it . I dusted them off and played the third disc first and the sound quality of the first episode , particularly the voices of male actors , was slightly distorted in several scenes . )	1
Lost Girl is a great show ! The story line keeps you wanting to see more , and the setting is just amazing ! If you 're into Syfy shows , this one is a must see ! Arrived on time , and in great condition !	1
this was bought as a gift . the person receiving it loved it . i really have nothing more to say , was a gift	1
The show itself gets 5 stars . I love it . The blu-ray gets less mainly because of the picture quality . Sometimes it was crystal clear and stellar . Sometimes it was muddy and full of artifacts.The special features are pretty thin too . Fans are mainly buying this one because of the show itself , but do n't go into expecting awesome stuff , because you 'll be disappointed .	1

i loved it , I always been a great fan of the dark shadows and when this came out I could n't help but get it for myself , I said , & # 34 ; What a birthday gift & # 34 ; and brought it could n't for anyone else to buy it ! It was a great deal and the whole set is beautiful	1
This was the first vampire series that I can think of on TV . It starts out in black and white , then eventually goes to color . it has a very interesting story and shows yet another aspect of vampirism.I started watching this when I was in high school , but my mum and I could n't keep up . This past fall , I found this collection and found the price I paid to be very worth it . Now we can sit down and watch the entire series right out of the coffin !	1
The Dark Shadows set is for a friend , I ope that she enjoys it as much as she did when it was on tv . I have watched the series yet , I am waiting to watch it with my friend.Chris .	1
Had looked at other sets , but this one caught my eye . Excellent quality , additional interviews with the stars , excellent packaging presentation - all thumbs up ! !	1
Long before vampires were turned into sparkling emo teenagers , they were imbued with a sense of old-world romance and mystery.And for a lot of people , that came from `` Dark Shadows . '' This gothic soap opera had its cheesy moments here and there , but it had that rare quality of being addictive and entertaining even as it had vampires , ghosts and werewolves . Even better : it drips with traditional gothic atmosphere , with a young woman afloat in a dark , gloomy house filled with secrets.Victoria Winters ( Alexandra Moltke ) arrives in Maine to be a governess to the reclusive Collins family , intending to find out about her past ( since she seems to have some kind of connection to them ... or something ) . Instead , she finds a big stew of weird -- the mansion of Collinswood apparently has ghosts and magic , as well as a vampire in the mausoleum.Yes , Barnabas Collins ( Jonathan Frid ) is in the mausoleum ... and his entrance ( and subsequent transformation into the primary character ) is the point when the show went from `` okay '' to `` awesome . '' From then on , the story unfolds into a long , complicated tangle of lost love , amnesia , time travel , witchcraft , MORE ghosts , reincarnation , golems , body-swapping sorcerers , the ancient Leviathans and a parallel universe -- all centered on the Collins family.It 's really quite hard to summarize the entire series , but suffice to say that `` Dark Shadows '' is a pretty delicious series -- it drips with romanticized gothic atmosphere , with plenty of classic tropes ( vampires , ghosts , even a Frankenstein monster ) . And for a soap opera of any type -- be it supernatural or mundane -- it 's actually very well written , with distinct plot arcs and ongoing plot threads.The slowest part of the story is actually the beginning parts , which were fairly low on supernatural events and focused on Victoria . But once `` Dark Shadows '' embraced the supernatural , it blossoms like a black rose . Does it have cheezy moments ? Yes , sometimes -- but unlike the cheeziness of a lot of vampire-themed TV/movies , there 's a dignified , almost classical quality to `` Dark Shadows . `` And it has a pretty decent cast over all , with Lara Parker , David Selby and Grayson Hall as a few of the most prominent standouts . But the best one is undeniably Frid as Barnabas Collins -- his character was such an intriguing one that he not only became one of the primary characters , but evolved from a tortured villain into a selfless , heroic anti-hero.As for the layout of this series , nobody is 100 % sure at this time of the content , but if it does have 131 discs it almost certainly has the complete series , both with and without the vampire subplots . But do n't expect any special extras , probably.For people burned out on current vampire stuff , `` Dark Shadows : The Complete Series '' is a refreshingly classic look at vampire/supernatural soapiness . It might take awhile , but it 's worth watching .	1
The package is great - the DVD 's are great - and anyone who remembers watching Dark Shadows will believe that the entire package is worth every penny you pay for it ! A definite collector 's item for a true Dark Shadows fan !	1
I had n't watched `` Dark Shadows '' since it was originally on the air . I was a preteen when it debuted . I , like millions of other kids , rushed home from school every day and plopped myself in front of a black and white TV to watch the show . I loved it back then but wondered if it would still hold my interest today . I saw the movie , which was OK , but the best thing about it was that it brought me back to the TV series . I purchased one of the 40-episode sets , and guess what ? I fell in love with it all over again . As cast member Marie Wallace ( Eve , Jenny Collins ) states in an interview , `` Dark Shadows '' is true theater '' . This is warts and all television . There is nothing like a videotaped series . It has an intimacy that can not be achieved through film . Lots of closeups of actors , sometimes with their faces just a few inches apart while they are speaking . It is utterly fascinating stuff . The dialogue often will make you smile and sometimes laugh out loud , as it is delivered so sternly that it often comes across as funny . `` Dark Shadows '' is a joy to rediscover , or discover for the first time . Unique and tons of fun .	1
Always loved this show , so had to have it once the complete collection was available . Only dislikes are that some of the dvds floated around loose in their containers ( the things that hold them in place wo n't work ) , and these tended to be scratched and difficult to play properly ; occasionally skipping in annoying places or refusing to play at others .	1
This is a great set for those who have never seen the complete series . During its Initinal run on TV , I worked nights , so I never missed an episode . It had some production faults , but to me its an All Time `` Classic & Always Will Be the # 1 Horror-Thriller Soap '' . No Doubt , The Introduction Of Mr. Frid as `` Barnabas Collins '' Made it so.. The casting of Dark Shadows was Brilliant . No 1 now , could ever come close to filling the original acsts shoes . I have only seen the Trailer of the re-make & anything Burton & Depp makes is Pure Simple # RAP . I wouldnt dis-honor the memory of those original Dark Shadows Actors now deceased & Living also , by spending a red cent to view it . Just My Humble Opinion .	1
I want to thank you at Amazon for giving me the opportunity to buy this dvd becausesince I used to watch Dark Shadows as much as I could but there were no VCR 's in my life at the time , then Dark Shadows came to the SciFi channel and every day I would tape every morning , even when I went on vacation I had my friends do the job.Then Dark Shadows came on compact disk , but they were too expensive ! I cried so much because I could not afford each set ! So now Amazon offered the Dark Shadows : The Complete Original Series ( Linited Edition ) .but when it was offered there was no price listed , so I had to gamble to get the most beautiful , crafted , luxurious DVD set ever created ! the coffin is marvelous and each DVD set ditto ! So I checked every price on the net , but I took a chance wjth Amazon to get the set that was under the 2500 limited edition , well anyway I received the set got $ 24.00 off the price of $ 413.00 ! and I now have Jonathan Frid as Bsrnabus Collins , the most incredible vampirein History and his signature too ! I want to thank Amazon and MPI for this wonderful deal ! I will never forget the box , the increduble quality of the dvds and all the great actors and actresses for their porformances ! This truly is a treasure for me now and always , Thank you , Susan Anderson	1
Dark Shadows was a show my father used to watch when he was younger and when the Johnny Depp movie came out they also put this bad-boy on the market . Expensive ? Yes a little , but look at what all you get ! All of Dark Shadows , literally all of it in a coffin no less , you ca n't get cooler than that ! You just ca n't . This product was a secret we kept from him for months ! We bought it super early , knowing full well , this is Christmas , and kept if from him up till that day and oh ! How his face lit up when he saw this , amazing ! Also I have bought things for friends before they see me get something this cool and say , my parent would love this too , can you get me one and I 'll get you back , so I ended up buying two of these , one for my Father and one for a good friend 's Mother , who was also a huge fan . From what I 'm told she went completely nuts when she got to open her present ... Fun stuff ! If you ai n't got a lot of money I can see where this might be a bit much , I sympathize , but man , it was so worth it for that look on my Dad 's face . As a review of the actual product itself , from what he 's told me , it 's just plane fantastic stuff . Thanks for reading and have a nice day !	1
I have been considering buying this for months but the price was daunting . However it was the Amazon deal of the day this week at a considerable discount ( $ 279 ) , so I finally pulled the trigger . I was still a little leery about spending so much money until the set arrived . I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews about damage during shaping , but it was very well packed in a thick , stiff box conformed to the coffin shape . That box was packed by Amazon in a larger box and well cushioned with packing material . The coffin itself was further protected in a plastic bag . So mine was in perfect shape . The coffin is quite nice and well constructed of sturdy cardboard with metal hinges . It is larger , heavier and more solid than I expected . The DVDs are in perfect shape and none had come loose during shipping.I have only watched the first 5 episodes , but the quality is better than I expected for such an old show shot on videotape . The production values ( camera , lighting , music , etc ) are also better than I expected . I am hooked.To sum up , I do n't regret this purchase at all . It is well worth the price I paid and I have probably a year or more worth of material to watch . If you are leery of the price , keep an eye on the amazon deal , it will probably come up again .	1
This show is as great as I remember it . I am enjoying watching a program that I watched way back when .	1
This is a very satisfying collection of 9 of the most memorable Dark Shadows episodes , encompassing almost all of the different eras of the show ( or should I say some of the most pivotal plot points in the ongoing story ? ) . We start in black and white , when Barnabas introduces himself to Elizabeth Stoddard as her English `` cousin '' ( very suave move ) . His manners so charm the Collins matriarch that discrepancies in his story are forever overlooked . Everyone is instead worried over the disappearance of the threatening Willy Loomis , little realizing he 's already become the vampire 's minion . We quickly move to color , sitting in on a very 1960s-style mod seance that shockingly transports the governess Victoria Winters back to 1795 , to solve the mystery of Barnabas ' ghostly sister Sara . There follows our first meeting with Angelique , the witch who bedevils Barnabas across time , played perfectly by one of TV 's best-ever ice queens , the blonde beauty Lara Parker.Jumping ahead , Dr. Hoffman figures out that Quentin Collins is a werewolf , and as Julia and Barnabas become cohorts at solving the mysteries of Collinwood , they travel to Parallel Time , where familiar faces act out a version of Rebecca ( with Grayson Hall excelling in the Mrs. Danvers role ) , and to the future where Collinwood lies in ruins , and Caroline and Quentin have gone insane . A very young Kate Jackson appears as the mysterious ghost Daphne , another governess with a secret , enlivening the show 's later years.Through all , we see the famous Collinwood set , the medieval staircase that frames so much of the action , and you can watch each numbered episode with informative introductions by Kathryn Leigh Scott , who played Maggie Evans through all her perils in past , present , future and parallel time . The show takes itself so seriously , you 're instantly immersed in its dream-like world , and you almost do n't mind not having the cliffhangers add up ; you still get a full picture of what made the first ever gothic soap opera so appealing , and so enduring .	1
She loved it as I did and what a great price ! Amazon rocks with so many Dark Shadows DVDs to choose from !	1
I got Scooby-Doo : 13 Spooky Tales Around the World for my grandson who loves Scooby .I all so love Scooby .	1
The episodes selected for this compilation are great ! ! ! ! and it was especially refreshing to finally see episodes from the first season of `` Scooby and Scrappy-Doo '' on DVD ! ! ! I do hope that Warner Bros. releases the first season of Scooby & Scrappy in the near future . All in all , this is a must-have for every Scooby-Doo and/or Hanna-Barbera classic animation fan ! ! !	1
After waiting for brand new releases of more Scooby episodes , I was initially excited when I found out this particular DVD included at least five previously unreleased adventures , some from 'The Scooby-Doo Show ' ( formerly apart of 'Scooby 's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics ' ) , and some from 'Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo ' ( the original series , the Richie Rich episodes from season two , and 'The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries ' , from season six ) . Here 's a breakdown : DISC ONE:1 . The Fiesta Host is an Aztec Ghost ( Mexico ) 2 . The Harum-Scarum Sanitarium ( Canada ) 3 . The Spirits of '76 ( Washington , D.C. ) 4 . A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle ( Atlantic Ocean ) 5 . To Switch a Witch ( Salem , Massachusetts ) 6 . A Menace in Venice ( Italy ) DISC TWO:7 . Shiver and Shake , That Demon 's a Snake ! ( Florida Keys ) 8 . Lock the Door , It 's a Minotaur ! ( Greece ) 9 . The Ozark Witch Switch ( Ozark Mountains , US ) 10 . Jeepers , It 's the Jaguaro ! ( Brazil ) 11 . Moonlight Madness ( Austria ) 12a . Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts ( South America , never specified ) 12b . Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts ( South America , never specified ) The entire first disc contains episodes of 'The Scooby-Doo Show ' , from season one and season three . The next disc contains almost entirely new episodes from 'Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Doo ' , 'The Scooby-Doo Show ' , ( season two ) , 'The Richie-Rich Show ' , and 'The New Mysteries ' ; It 's a little upsetting that there are only twelve episodes here instead of the advertised thirteen ( I do n't care what anyone else says : Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts , Parts I & II , does NOT count as two different episodes . The same could be said for Moonlight Madness , seeing as how it 's a standalone segment ) , but whatever . They also could 've picked more exotic episodes , like 'A Highland Fling With a Monstrous Thing ' ( 1978 ) , 'I Left My Neck in San Francisco ' ( 1979 ) , and 'Scooby 's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper ' ( 1978 ) . But beggars ca n't be choosers , I guess . And if this review does n't explain much , I 'll be back and edit as soon as I get the actual DVD.UPDATE : 5/21/12Yep , just as I figured . The prints on the episodes look fantastic for a first time release ( not perfect , but fantastic , nonetheless ) : they 're just as clear as the discs they came in ( so do n't go and scratch it ) ! For under $ 20 , this is definitely worth every penny . Keep it up , Warner Bros !	1
I give it a 5 for beginning soaps on DVD ! ! ! ! ! 5 for Guiding Light ! ! ! 5 for some good episodes ! ! ! BUT ... and this is a BIG BUT ... For the third release I am now getting a little discouraged . Weddings ? Villains ? Vixens ? Scandals ? ETC.. None are interesting , complete , fulfilling , or hopeful for the understanding of soaps , the appreciation of soaps , or the hope for the future of Soap Classics . I really got excited on the first ATWT release - even knowing it was some randomly plucked episodes , few of which were CLASSICS by definition . I love anything Christmas from soaps and think what a waste it is that SOAPNET never once has taken advantage of holidays by airing marathons of holiday episodes that any soapfan would love , so that set was appreciated . But now we get another randomly plucked set of episodes , few of which are classics ... AGAIN.Do n't get me wrong - I will buy whatever I can possibly get from any soap opera from any era , especially before `` my time '' or when I was a kid in the 1970 's aand 80 's . AND will never ever buy a soap set that is recent episodes only ( 1999+ would not be worthe the money , as they recent enough that I have seen them ) - Guiding Light is great because I have only seen episodes from the Tammy Jonathan years through the end of the show so having many I have n't seen is fabulous.ANYONE who loves soaps or understands soap fans MUST inherently know that we love the people , the characters , the stories , the buildup , the history . If you want anyone other than diehard fans to buy it - you are on the wrong track . I want to watch STORYLINES , how they got together and ended up getting married , how they fell in love , what happened after ... .what made her a vixen or him a villain ? Who killed who and why - who did they think killed who and why ... None of these stories are told in one or 2 episodes , they lasted months , or years even . I WANT STORIES - that 's why they were called STORIES in my mother 's time , because that 's why everyone loved them.You want new people to buy them ? Release the STORYLINES as complete as possible , you want SOAPfans to Buy it AND love it , AND save up our money for the next release ? RELEASE THE STORIES ! If you are giving us multiple quick releases to get momentum , at least give us hope that we will get something more than Weddings and tributes and plucked episodes in the future . Give us news that you are working on SOMETHING MORE even if it takes time.PLEASE I BEG OF YOU ... ..Peyton PLace was such a terrific Soap release - I got a set for me and then mom wanted a set , then Grandma wanted a set , none of us had ever seen them but we all LOVED watching the 2 sets with full storylines.SoapsClassic needs to give respect to the genre by releasing STORYLINES and following characters with full episodes , over time . Soap Fans will pay and if it has storylines that can be followed and characters to connect with , others will follow . Tributes are for diehard , single show fans , and fans of ANYTHING SOAPS but that 's about it . And if you do n't give us hope for anything more , we 'll stop checking to see what 's coming next.BUT - Thank you so very much for whatever I can get .	1
I always had watched Pokemon since i was young and I liked how all these 4 movies were all put into one blu-ray disc .	1
Love the collection 's ... . only bummer part is 3 of Hellraiser collection is n't in it . But all that are there are in excellent form to watch and even with the 3 missed Hellraiser Collection it is well worth the 7.99 I paid for it . I love having the variety of movies and collections of the movies I buy here . They are in excellent condition and well priced and are delivered in a timely and safe manner . Thank 's for the wonderful offer .	1
I was originally looking for the Prhophecy films , but this was a huge bonus for me to find this set instead .	1
This collection contains some great spaghetti westerns in decent quality . I recommend watching any of these old westerns on a HD tv in a blu ray player that has DVD enhancement . If you watch them on the old fashioned tv they wo n't look as good . This collection has some great lost classics in them , as well as some more comedy orientated ones like Buddy Goes West , Blood Money , and Life is tough Providence . Yes these are old movies since this era was from the mid 60s all the way to the late 70s , but the entertainment factor is still there and holds up good . Great value for the money , and if you are fan of the genre I would n't hesitate to snatch this compilation pack up .	1
Love the action sequences on Equilibrium , for sure the Wachowski brothers would have seen this film and took reference of those scenes and mixed it with Hongkong action cinematics then applied it on The Matrix . A very good film with a nice idea behind it.I have Renaissance on DVD which I think is one of the best underrated CGI animated film out there . So having it now on Blu Ray is just a bonus . Because this animated feature is done in black and white it 's very clear people wo n't be able to tell any difference in picture resolution between the DVD against Blu Ray .	1
I wish they wouldofmade this a long time ago when I was watching all seasons on bluray . Movie was great but wanted more fighting in space and against the cylons . Young odama could ofbeen a better character .	1
Just finished up watching the last installment of the web series . It was good to see a Galatica spin-off that came back to the action-adventure roots , not that Caprica is n't good but it was a drama take on the universe.Blood & Chrome by no means is as slick as a the reboot . Lots of green screen shots , lots of CGI that does n't match up to the budget of the SyFy show . All in all , a good start . The story has some holes and some predictable twists along with some others you do n't see coming . Luke Pasqualino as Adama seems to settle into things and could develop into a strong lead . Ben Cotton 's portrayal of the warworn veteran , Coker , who ca n't stand his new rookie pilot is probably the strongest of the lot . The side characters are really good as well . Some of the writing is really good . While I wo n't write them here they are both toward the end of the last web episode , one for each side . They set up the rest of potential series very nicely . They are also pretty poignant in their own right.All in all a good pilot for a show I would watch week in and week out should it be picked up as a series though I 'm not holding my breath . Maybe a web series ? It would at least be something.ETA : if you would like a taste , check out a few minutes here [ ... ]	1
I hope this is not the last of BSG aka the post Stargate , B5 movie . The CGI is amazing and you forget just how much is VR .	1
Several of the reviews mentioned on how the Sy-Fy channel has seiously lost it 's sense of direction.Caprica and Stargate Universe were excellent sci-fi genre shows and both were left unresolved and wanting.This `` bridge '' movie is a fabulous idea and hopefully not the last in the Battlestar genre.How did the Cylon revolt begin ? how did the republic begin to falter ? who were the ancestors of the 12 colonies ? -some suggestions for further movies.SG-U left us with a ship speeding out of the galaxy and with many unresolved story lines and one never tires of SG-1 followupsI do n't know why Sy-Fy changed it 's focus.True there have been several outstanding additions such as `` Being Human '' and `` Face Off '' but they have let go of some excellent sci-fi genre series with tons of potential pre/post series special movies.Instead of airing increasingly ridiculous new movies on Sat evenings with laughable special effects , acting of H.S . production calibre and absurd story lines I hope they rediscover the definition of sci-fi and return to warping us back to the original definition of the genre	1
I feel your pain my friends but the only way this could 've become a series is if it were sold to TNT or perhaps AMC ! They are the only channels showing anything bold or even remotely considered sci-fi . That would be a show called `` Falling Skies '' , the single closest thing to sci-fi on American television . Shame.The actual SYFY channel has completely abandoned all things science fiction . A few years ago MGM was taken over by new management and they immediately decided to cancel the following : SG : A , SG : U , the new SG-1 movie ( SG : Revolution ) , and the new SG : A movie ( SGA : Extinction ) .As long as this current bunch of skin-jobs is in charge we will never get real sci-fi . Instead we get a steady diet of rediculous monster movies with horrible acting and direction . We get fed one ghost hunting show after another . We 're up to 5 of those shows now right ? Oh and my personal favorite - wresting . Wrestling ? What the fraaaaak ? I just cant wait to see steroid injected men all greased up in baby oil throwing eachother around for a buck . Yup . That qualifies as sci-fi now folks.Unfortunately for us `` real fans '' , we will never see a full blown BSG : B & C ; series . Not while those circle jerkers are in charge ... ! ... ... ... ... ... UPDATE ( 3-20-13 ) ... ... ... ... ... ..I finally got a chance to watch this pilot/movie for the first time and mow im pipping mad ! I cant believe America has given up on all things science fiction and let this one go . BSG : B & C ; is nothing short of spectacular . The story is compelling , with a bit of a callback to G. Baltar of the origanal series . They really know how to perfectly cast the BSG universe with the makers recasting many BSG/Caprica alumni . Us real fans will identify them immediatly . The new faces are top picks as well including the guy playing young ( and dumb ) Adama.The picture quality is brutally sharp and crisp on Blu-ray disc . The audio is big and precise , as I expected , especially for those of us with surround sound systems ( Definitive Technology 8.2 ) .The CG effects for Blood & Chrome are only rivaled in the movies ! A small gripe for us computer animators - we 'll instantly notice the underdeveloped dynamics programing and very quick decay rates on those effects but other than that it 's all top grade stuff . I understand that the action-packed nature of the pilot/movie is to give the viewers a glimps of the kind of quality and intensity the show has to offer with following episodes . To bad that 's not going to happen.I will forever be se stunned at how something this amazing will never get off the ground . We have screwed ourselves out of truly brilliant story telling . Again . I was hoping for Bryan Singer 's BSG movie to get going but I suspect after he sees this he might give up on it . Blood & Chrome is just that good !	1
I also have all the boxed sets of BSG and Caprica . This could n't be left out . It 's a great story about Commander Adama in his early years as a fighter pilot . It 's a great show and you can watch it on YouTube first to see if you want to buy it .	1
Trying to piggyback off the success and cult following of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series from Ron Moore , Blood & Chrome gives us the story of a young William Adama and his first mission as a member of the Colonial fleet . Fresh out of the academy , Adama ( played by Luke Pasqualino ) is assigned to the powerful battlestar Galactica , where he 's met with contention from his co-pilot Coker ( Ben Cotton ) , and is assigned to escort a beautiful but mysterious woman ( Lili Bordan ) on a secret mission.Originally shown in small `` webisodes '' online , almost every shot from Blood & Chrome was done on green screen . The result is A LOT of CGI , most of which looks really great . The space and aerial battles especially look marvelous , and the few Cylons you see look really good as well . There were a few action and landscape shots I thought looked kind of cheap but overall , when you consider almost the entire show was created in post-production , the effects rival a lot of shows on TV today and look very similar to those seen on the BSG series.Blood & Chrome was created with hopes of getting a series order in mind , which probably wo n't happen , and because of this the story and character development felt rushed to me . There 's really only the three main characters , none of which I really got attached to , and a few other supporting characters that had a few lines . Perhaps because the creators thought they would get a series out of the show , they were going to save some of the backstory and further development for later . However , as it stands the 90 minute show does n't really tell you much about who these characters are or what brought them to the Galactica . It also did n't help that the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors who , thought they try , do n't have the chops to keep up with the actors from the reimagined BSG series . The story was fun and engaging , I just wish there had been more depth.The Bluray set comes with DVD and digital copies , as well as a few extras including a bunch of deleted scenes and a making-of featurette that delves into the visual effects created for Blood and Chrome . This behind-the-scenes feature is quite interesting to watch as it interviews most of the people involved in the creative process behind the special and gives some awesome insight into the development and creation of making a show that 's most computer generated.If you 're a fan of the Ron Moore , series I would definitely check this out . It 's not quite up to par with the series but is still a fun adventure that will make you want to revisit the sci-fi series.On a side note , the 188 minutes Amazon lists as the running time is inaccurate ; the feature itself is around 90 minutes and I think Amazon added the Bluray and DVD discs together .	1
Blood and Chrome should of been made into a series . I saw this on sci fi channel and I believe this is a missed opportunity	1
I like the Battlestar Galactica series and this was the story of the early career of the future Commander of the Galactica .	1
`` Battlestar Galactica : Blood & Chrome '' Originally presented as a series of webisodes , `` Battlestar Galactica : Blood & Chrome '' is a tense , stylish prequel to the super-faboo `` Battlestar Galactica '' series , featuring Luke Pasqualino as a still-green William Adama , fresh out of the academy and eager to battle the Cylon horde . `` Blood & Chrome '' is well-written , well-paced , and has surprisingly good graphics and special effects for what was essentially an on-spec pilot episode . It plays well as a movie-length film , and the only downside is that the powers that be at Sci-Fi ( or any other cable/digital/broadcast entity ) did n't green light this to become an ongoing series . Yes , the `` Caprica '' prequel turned out to be pretty dismal , but this show looks much better and more tightly focussed , and raises a number of interesting , unsettling issues about the history of the Human-Cylon conflict . Fortunately , Pasqualino is pretty baby-faced and young : I suppose it 's possible he could still take up the role later on if the BSG creative team can get this series off the ground , even if it takes a few years.Anyway , if you 're a Galactica fan , have no fear : this is exciting , satisfying , intelligently written and well-made . It 's no `` Caprica '' ; you will enjoy watching this show . The only problem you 'll have is when it ends and you realize , that 's it -- that 's all she wrote . Sigh .

If you the new Battlestar Galactica this is a good movie Good story line and great special effects . If your a BGfan then you might want it for your collection .	1
story held close to writting of new tv series . shows adama in a new light as a young officer just arriving on thebattlesta gallatica	1
I enjoyed the film . It was worth the time and money . The film retains some of the best aspects of the series while improving in the special effects area .	1
If you love BSG , you 'll love this preview into Adama 's entry into the wartime fleet . Must buy so you can watch more than once ...	1
They did a good job of integrating some of the story lines . There were a few weak moments in the plot and a few weak moments in the acting , but overall I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it . Not perfect , but they are awfully big shoes to fill , after all .	1
I sat down and saw that there was this new Battlestar Galactica , and , having seen all of them , was excited . I got just what I 'd hoped for ... straight fracking Battlestar fighting and drama . Win .	1
my only downside to this is that I saw it on TV a week BEFORE my DVD arrived . So mine is still wrapped up on the shelf . Still thinking about returning it .	1
This is a great movies to follow-up with the Battlestar Galactica TV Series . If you love the TV series you got to get this one . I would recommend this to all my Battlestar buddies .	1
This tells the story of a young Adama , and one of his first missions after being assigned as a pilot on Galactica . The story takes place after the events of the Caprica series and long before the Battlestar Series picks up . You get a bit of insight into what he was like in his youth . They very much portray him as a hot head who is always looking for a fight . You do not see any of the characters from the original series . At this point the Cylons are still just the chrome versions , although see the beginnings of the `` skin job '' versions at the very end.It seems people fall into a couple different categories about this . Much like the Caprica series they either love it or really hate it . I liked the series , but was not so devoted to seeing just those characters that any kind of spin off would be awful . It is really just an extension of the universe that was created for that story . It is like a long episode , telling a single story and that is it . It does have some twists and betrayal going on much like the series had . In the beginning of the story it makes it seems like the war could end , but of course there is no big resolution at that point . No you are not going to get Edward James Olmos as Adama , but if you can get past that and just enjoy the story and the fact that you are getting new Battlestar stories in some form , then this is worth adding to your collection .	1
Cool add on to BSG wish there were more.good story and well done graphics .Mabe a new scifi channel will get up and going and take this story and go with it..	1
I was hesitant at first to view this , but I am glad I did . I thought the movie was well done and exciting . I recommend it .	1
I 'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the Unrated Cut and the Machinima Webisodes , so here are the differences between the two ( NOTE : SPOILERS FOLLOW ) .Note , the Unrated cut runs around 7 minutes longer than the Webisodes , including nearly 4 minutes of credits . The Unrated cut also includes some extra choice swear words , such as a-hole and s -- - . In summary , it 's a much tamer unrated cut than unrated BSG DVDs that SyFy has previously released . ( 1 ) When Adama , Coker , and Dr. Kelly first come aboard the Osiris , they are treat hostilely by Commander Ozar 's 2nd in command ( played by Ty Olsson , formerly Captain Kelly on BSG : RDM ) and his Marines . ( 2 ) Adama sleeps with Dr. Kelly but nothing explicit is shown , minus some shedding of clothes . ( 3 ) Coker attempts conversation with Toth , who proves to be quite the misanthrope.I thoroughly enjoyed the prequel and it 's a godsdanged motherfrakkin ' shame that SyFy decided to sit on it for so long and air quality programming like Ghost Hunters instead . Luke Pasqualino as the cocky , young Adama and Ben Cotton as the war-weary Coker played off each other nicely , even though there was lessened tension from viewers knowing that Adama obviously survives the First Cylon War . B & C ; writers still managed some interesting twists in the storyline.It was nice being reunited with beautiful CGI shots of starship battles ( the Viper/Raider sub-atmospheric battle over Djerba was a visual treat ) and Bear McCreary 's hauntingly familiar score . Some of the CGI shots of the Galactica 's bridge clearly looked green screened , but not bad considering that the BSG sets had already been torn down at the time of filming B & C . ; Frak Caprica . All you BSG fans out there , pray to the Lords of Kobol for continued life to Blood and Chrome !	1
It came in the mail fast . The special effects are awesome , but the story line is not that good . I am a big Battlestar Galactica fan , but would not recommend this video to other fans .	1
Iloved the Battlestar Galactics tv series and was very disappointed to see the series end . However , the blood and chrome provides just enough background information into William Odama to keep you interested .	1
Some back story into the career start of William Adama on Battlestar Galactica . I am a huge fan of the entire series . I even caught the original broadcast back in the day .	1
it must have take a lot of money to compute all computer generated stuff for the background . it was a great film	1
I have watched a lot of British television and this is one of the best movies I 've seen in a long time . Inspector Morse is great and so was the overall plot of the movie . The suspense left me guessing until the end of the movie .	1
I have been a fan of Inspector Morse for years , eagerly awaiting the next series on PBS . Now we have Endeavor on Amazon Prime Instant Video and it is amazing . This is the beginning of Morse when he is a new Constable with the Oxford police . His brilliant detective work once again gets him in trouble with his superiors , but he does n't let that stop him . His immediate boss is Inspector Thursday and he is brilliant as a teacher , mentor and admirer of Endeavour Morse . I highly recommend this series and ca n't wait for more .	1
Wow . I did n't realize that we have the sequel : Lewis , which by the way I HIGHLY recommend and Endeavour the prequel . Because I love all things PBS and BBC Mystery and particularly related to Morse I was fortunately not disappointed in this show ( and I do n't know how many are or will be in the series ) . Very good .	1
This Pilot/Pre-season show was terrific and a treat to see after fearing that we 'd have to wait for season 2 before seeing young Morse in action again.Well screen-played and acted , this show and the seasons to follow should be near the top of a good cop/mystery lover 's list of shows to watch .	1
One of the only mystery movies I was not able to solve half-way through . I Loved it !	1
I am outraged by the garbage presented here by NBC . I pre-ordered this and will never do so again . I was hoping to see the opening and closing ceremony as they ruined them when shown live . All you get is a couple of minutes of each - but hey you do get all of the beach volleyball final ! ! ! ! ! ! I mean who really gives a hoot about beach volleyball ? This is the worst thing I have ever bought from Amazon , NBC need to hang their collective heads in shame.As I am a British ex-pat living in the US I do own a multi-region DVD player so I guess I have to go and buy the BBC version.Please do n't waste your money on this junk , NBC do n't deserve to make any money out of this.BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD	-1
It absolutely shocks me how bad NBC screwed up coverage of the London Olympics and now this . It makes absolutely NO SENSE that the FULL opening and closing ceremonies will not be included on this blu ray ... but this is NBC , I really should n't be that shocked . Nice job dropping the ball once again ...	-1
NBC result were way delayed when the Olympics happened . It will be another 7 weeks after release date before you get the DVD/B-Ray results . HAHA ! ! ! Nothing like NBC being greedy with the rights ... Not even John Stewart or Colbert was even allowed to show footage from the Olympics for their news coverage ... Although Colbert did his own interpretations with dolls that admittedly was even better than what was worth waiting for from NBC .	-1
This film puts a new level on deadly ! Deadly to your brain cells ; probably more dangerous than crack , coke , meth or heroin ! Proceed at your own risk ~ You have been warned !	-1
The movie is a real waste of time and money , poor actors , poor story , poor locations ... really awful movie . I waste my money with this piece of crap .	-1
I have every previous Lewis Black DVD . They are very entertaining . I do n't know what happened during this performance . It was not funny at all . It was painful to watch . It seemed as if his remaining remnants of sanity were running away from him . If you are a Lewis Black fan , it will break your heart to watch this . Do yourself a favor ... .do not watch this ... hold on to all your positive memories of Lewis Black . This performance will leave only negative imprints .	-1
It is Biblical fiction ! ! ! No matter how good the intent , the movie is just plain wrong according to the Bible.I know the movie was intended to be pro-life , but please base it on true theology , not false popular trash . The Bible says , & # 34 ; The dead know not anything & # 34 ; , They do not lead an invisible life in this world . The Bible NEVER speaks of immortality of the soul . Immortality is used only in reference to God alone.The acting , script pace , and content was poorly put together . The continuity of the film seemed unrelated with many scenes used only as unnecessary fille . There were no scenes of violence , crime , and solicitous sex , but that still does not make it a good movie.DO N'T BUY IT ! !	-1
This company has released a number of Christian films that are better than this one . I found it boring , unbelievable , and fell asleep many times in it . If your looking for a good Christian film , you might want to try something else .	-1
In a post-apocalyptic America , a young woman toting a firearm and accompanied by a mute boy goes in search of her brother . There 's little action or suspense along the way , the use of voice-over narration becomes a bit grating , and the occasionally surreal touches create more muddle than interest . The cast and crew probably had great fun during filming but it all comes across as nothing more than a home-movie trying to palm itself off as a feature .	-1
Terrible , dreadful and incredibly boring . This movie is about as interesting as watching paint dry with all action and pacing of molasses .	-1
Combine Reservoir Dogs with torture porn and you get Sushi Girl , a sadistic and idiotic flick about five criminals reuniting six years after a diamond heist when one of their accomplices gets out of prison . The other four are convinced that their recently released ex-partner hid the diamonds before being arrested and torture him for most of the movie to find out where . To break up the monotony of bad writing and pointless violence there are also Reservoir Dogs style flashbacks showing the heist . This desperately wants to achieve a Tarantino-level mix of smart dialogue and over the top violence but the script is witless and stupid , with characters doing things that are beyond idiotic . One example is when a character stops the torture victim from speaking just when it appears he is about to give up the location of the diamonds . Since the whole point of the torture is to find the diamonds this character 's reaction makes absolutely no sense . Another involves the twist at the end so I wo n't give it away -- but if I was the last man standing there is one thing I most definitely would not do -- and it 's exactly what the character does . Actually , the twist is n't much of a surprise given the title of the movie , but whatever . Sushi Girl 's ending is complete nonsense if you think about what came before for more than a few seconds . If you 're nostalgic for the 90 's when bad Tarantino wannabe 's were abundant then you might actually enjoy this . Otherwise I would stay away .	-1
After spending six years in jail , `` Fish '' ( Noah Hathaway , returning to screen after a hiatus of 18 years ) is invited to a party where sushi is served on the body of a beautiful naked girl ( Cortney Palm ) . At the party `` Fish '' meets a host `` Duke '' ( Tony Todd ) and three guests Francis ( James Duval ) , Max ( Andy Mackenzie ) and Crow ( Mark Hamill ) all eager to know one thing . Where are the diamonds ? Kern Saxton 's debut film `` Sushi Girl '' is like homage to `` Reservoir Dogs '' with a heist in flashback , gory tortures and a few more similarities that are clearly intentional , but lacks Tarantino 's deft storytelling , sharp dialogue and clever choice of music . Actors are all fantastic , with Mark Hamill as sadistic Crow who is quite impressive , but their effective performances are largely wasted on the weak storyline.Sonny Chiba ( `` Kill Bill Vol.1 '' ) plays a sushi chef . Michael Biehn and Danny Trejo ( with a machete ) briefly appear as a cameo . Danny Trejo 's scenes are so brief that you may miss them if you blink . `` Sushi Girl '' concludes with a neat plot twist , but spends too much time reaching there .	-1
Save your money . If your a space cadet that 's into LSD and hard drugs you might like this movie ? This movie is a long drawn out mess with no plot . I saw no poetry in this movie . It sucked , would rather sit on the deck . The person that created this movie is unstable . A nightmare to watch . Just throw your money out on the street instead of paying for this . A strange demented mess I 'll never go through again .	-1
I like zombie movies , even low budget movies but this one is slow , and the ending was just as slow . kind of like , drifting off into the sunset slow . but still better than the lesbian horror movie , W ( women )	-1
I thought this movie might be something interesting but I have to admit I was very disappointed . The acting was amateurish , bland and emotionless ! 45 minutes into the film I fell asleep ! I 'm really surprised that Ken Foree took on this role . He was great in Dawn of the Dead ! This totally sucked.I gave it two stars because I felt the zombies were good . This could have been an exciting film considering they had the best atmosphere to do it in , but I could never care for any of the characters or really get involved in the film . What a waste !	-1
Monogram Pictures says it all they have a habit of making B movies seem like a luxury.Be sure to watch the 1932 version first then this may be a fun alternative . The fun comes in noticing the stilted sophomoric dialog . The cardboard acting . One line dialog that does not fit the story . See the holes in logic , and the shocking acting.The story may be a tad different in the remake . A man knows he is probably not going to live through the night . So he gathers his ruthless scheming , and downright nasty relatives for a last meal . The 13th chare is empty . The chair is alluded to but does not seem to make any real difference in this mystery.His family is to meet back again in 13 years for the reading of his will by his granddaughter . Looks like she was dispatched before the meeting . It is up to private detective Johnny Smith ( Dick Purcell ) who was hired however earlier to protect the girl , to find out want went wrong . But hold the phone there is more .	-1
Not really funny stressful to watch and made no sense story line could have been intresting poor acting and had no point . I like a comedy that either makes you crack up or has a point .	-1
Based on a rave review by a local entertainment critic , I recently viewed the first two episodes of this series . Unfortunately , I was left with an unpleasant sensation of , `` Mayhem , cursing and unfunny jokes . '' The portrayals of high ranking government officials and their aides come across as cartoon caricatures . The hand-held camera also makes for a jerky production and may induce vertigo in some viewers . Most damning , none of the political material seems particularly topical or relevant . Needless to say , I would n't go out my way to watch this one	-1
It would be a funny show except for all the : f bombs & # 34 ; thrown . I used to like her but for her to play in a show with such filthy language is discouraging.I will not watch any more of this season	-1
Let 's just dive right in from the start shall we ? VEEP is one of the most unfunny shows ever created . Yes , it really is that bad . As I watched the entire first season I think I honestly laughed perhaps once and that was just a small chuckle , not a belly laugh . Having just seen THIS IS THE END and actually finding myself laughing out loud about 15 times in the middle of a theater , this show never inspired that once while sitting in the comfort of my living room . It really is unfunny and displays in so many ways how out of touch Hollywood is with the real world.Julia Louis-Dreyfuss , an actress who has shown time and time again that she knows how to be funny , stars as the title character , Senator Selina Meyer who has just taken on the role of Vice President . But what she thought would be a position that would provide her with some power and a direct link to the White House ends up being nothing of the sort . Selina is given little more to do than the bidding of the President , helping him to shore up votes he needs for projects while never getting credit or the chance to forward her own ideas.Through it all she plays the political games where back stabbing is a virtue and keeping a smile plastered on your face while twisting the knife is the norm . This same theme is used quite well with Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS but here it falls flat.Meyers has surrounded herself with complete idiots or career builders who are more inclined to take care of themselves than her . Some have the potential to be funny characters but are never given the chance to show it . Instead they seem to think that the more they drop the F bomb the funnier they are . This made me worry about how much input Louis-Dreyfuss had in the scripts as I thought back to the time period when Saturday Night Live became a show that was unfunny ... and when she was a cast member . At that time they seemed to tell jokes that they thought were funny but that no one laughed at . I found this series to be much like that.I had heard this series was funny . I even remember several people involved being nominated for Emmys . After watching it I found my feelings about the Emmys and other awards given in Hollywood to be vindicated . Rather than honor anyone for true talent and ability it seems as though they give out awards for simply being someone they like or for trying to portray anyone they dislike in an unfavorable way . Anyone connected with this show who would win did n't deserve it and should immediately give the award back.I was stunned to see that a second season of this series has already aired and that a third is on the way . It makes me wonder what shows that delivered pilots to HBO were turned down . Surely there was something else that deserved the funding that this show gets . The only thing this show made me want to do was turn back to television to see if a rerun of SEINFELD was on . Now that show was funny and so was Louis-Dreyfuss when she was in it . Unless the only thing you find humorous is how often and how creatively a person can swear it you wo n't enjoy this show .	-1
I 'd heard good things about this series so came to it with high expectations . What a letdown ! Corny acting , a waste of Julia 's talent , stupid so-called humor that is far from funny , and brimming with f-words that contributed nothing to the script . It was like they were trying to sound hip and it fell flatter than a pancake . Wasted my time and money .	-1
The acting is excellent , the irony and cynicism funny at times . There is , however , too much profanity for me to continue watching it .	-1
If you like politics you will enjoy this show . I was very disappointed as I enjoyed Dryfus in both Seinfeld and Old Christine . I had high hopes for this show . I did n't even find this show to be funny . Not recommended .	-1
It is a short miniseries that not only ridicules the office of the vice president but makes it appear that each staff member is incompetent . The writer uses profanity for dialog and reduces talented actors to nincompoops . It was a shame to take a good subject and give it very little style or meaning . Each character becomes a chess board piece waiting to insert a jibe at either each other or an official in Congress or the White House . It needed the touch of Aaron Sorkin .	-1
I actually really enjoyed Cinderella III , but Cinderella II is horrible ! Cinderella II is a collection of shorter cartoons , and ca n't even really be called a movie . The animation is poor , and the story lines are kind of ridiculous , ( Cinderella has to have a party , one of the mice wants to be human , and one of the step-sisters wants to date a townsmen . ) Alone , Cinderella II would get one-star , and that would be generous.Cinderella III is an actual full-length movie about what would happen if Cinderella had no magic . It starts on their first anniversary , but then Lady Tremaine , ( the wicked step-mother , ) gets her hands on the Fairy Godmother 's wand , causing them all to go back in time to the morning after the ball , and causing Prince Charming to forget he danced with Cinderella . She remembers , and tries to get him back . It 's a good story , and had a strong girl power feel to it . The mice provide great comic relief , and the characters are well developed . The animation is n't that bad for a sequel either . It 's nowhere near as good as the original , but it is entertaining enough to watch more then once.I would suggest looking for a single copy of Cinderella III if it 's available at all , but save your time and money with Cinderella II .	-1
I guess this is n't really to my liking and I do n't think I should donate it to the library ... it is porn , pure and simple but with a storyline.It was n't what I was expecting when I ordered it . Buyer beware .	-1
PROS : - great black and white quality ... I ca n't believe it was made in 1942.CONS : - story drags on and on- I speak French but the subtitles are inaccurate.I love foreign movies but this is NOT it . It is soooo boring.There are way better foreign movies like- La Femme Nikita became The Point of No Return- Leon The Professional- The Seven Samurai became The Magnificent Seven- Three Outlaw Samurai- Train Man became The 40 Year Old Virgin- Japanese version of `` Shall We Dance '' was remade as an American version.- Ringu- Audition- Departures- Tokyo Sonata- Piche Entre Ciel Et Terre	-1
The plot idea was intriguing at first , however , the twist was predictable , I saw it coming with Mona 's biological mother.I have some advice for the producers/writers for their next project . DO YOUR RESEARCH . How did the psycho biological mother become a social worker ? There 'd be background checks , fingerprinting , etc , and this lady already has a record from abusing her other children , so there is no way she could get a job like this with the access to her daughter . Just implausible , if this had been addressed , the movie would have been a lot more convincing .	-1
This was a total waste of time , I would rather listen to monkeys belch than watch this terrible movie again .	-1
First of all , the music is so laughably bad that it makes this film seem more like a mockumentary . This is only partially Rodriguez 's fault , since judging from the tracks included , those first two albums were horribly produced , taking a semi-interesting folk singer/acoustic guitarist and larding up his music with sappy strings and other ill-chosen instrumentation ( think of the worst of Nick Drake , but even that is much better ) . As a film , it 's so-so , hitting very familiar notes . Mostly this just made me lose whatever respect I might have had for South African musical tastes . It 's a Bizarro world to be sure . There 's a reason why Rodriguez did n't sell in the U.S .	-1
I love the movies . The packaging was disgraceful ! ! Four discs crammed into a single disc holder . The fourth disc was not attached to the others and just rattling around	-1
I 've no doubt that there 's a story somewhere buried in the heart of KING OF THORN , but I have to wonder if the unsatisfying end result of this production is n't due in large part to the problems of adapting a larger work : as I understand , it 's based on a manga that might be quite good ( there are certainly some wonderfully exotic elements given cursory exploration here ) , but there 's no way to know based on the film . What starts out as a cautionary tale about contagion and survival descends in its later half into a curious misfire , almost as entangled as the vines featured so prominently on the product packaging.Somehow , mankind is slowly being driven to the brink of extinction by the Medousa Virus , a lethal plague that ( you guessed it ! ) turns people into stone . Before life itself comes to an end , a mysterious corporation concocts a grand scheme : select 160 virus-free participants to be cryogenically frozen and placed in stasis until such a time that a cure is developed , at which point they could be ` thawed ' and given the task of repopulating the planet . While the selection criteria remain a bit nebulous , the plan is launched , and young Kasumi ( but not her twin sister , Shizuku ) is chosen . The computer program running the facility promises to wake everyone up in 100 years OR whenever a cure is assured ( whichever comes first ) , but , to the participants surprise , they are re-activated after only a scant three days ! The processing center has been overrun by massive , serpentine plants and man-eating dinosaurs.Their new mission : save themselves in time to figure out what went wrong ? Certainly , it 's an interesting premise , one that veers into some reasonably creative territory very quickly if not all a little too perfunctorily . There are shades of greater influences here - THE MATRIX , JURASSIC PARK , TRON , etc . - all whipped up into the narrative frenzy . It 's all backed with some great themes - the risk of survival , the loss of family and loved ones - but , sadly , the first hour only sticks to a marketable formula . Eventually , the high-tech facility becomes a decidedly low-tech castle , and our participants discover they 're not so much racing to prevent the extinction of man so much as they are trying to master some vivid video game brought to life by powers much more ` magical ' than they are ` scientific . 'That said , I 'm comfortable admitting that , had the writers and animated stuck hard and fast to the more scientific elements of KING OF THORN , they might 've had a winner here . It 's the risk of tinkering with adaptations - losing some of the author 's message in favor of presenting the entirety of the work - that bubbles to the surface here and tears the film in half . The latter half is repeatedly plagued by dreams and , then ( even worse ) , dreams within dreams ; from a stylistic standpoint alone , it 's hard to tell where each characters ' story begins and someone else 's ends . Moments that should 've been revelatory end up being vastly more confusing due to the finished product . It is n't until the ultimate ending that , as a viewer , you 're assured of what you just saw . While that may work for an episode of ` The Twilight Zone , ' it all feels loose , forced , and inadequate here.KING OF THORN is n't a total disappointment . Instead , it feels rushed and insignificant . I can only hope that manga on which it was based makes more sense.KING OF THORN was produced by Bandai Visual Company , Sunrise , Enterbrain Inc. , Dentsu , Kadokawa Pictures , Sony PCL , and TV Tokyo . DVD distribution is being handled by Funimation . It all looks and sounds pretty solid - I did experience some audio distortion in the second half that required me to turn up the levels a bit , but it was a minor inconvenience . The DVD comes with a handful of extras , including some press briefings , a director interview , and the usual assortment of trailers and TV spots . I did n't explore them , mostly because I found the film unsatisfying , but they 're there for the interested audience.RECOMMENDED only for serious fans of anime and/or manga as there 's really very little else here that would make sense to the average viewer . Some clever animation and storytelling trickery just is n't enough - or strong enough - to elevate KING OF THORN to a respectable adaptation . The last forty minutes becomes largely coherent - that is , until the ultimate ` reveal ' is revealed - making the viewing experience mostly an exercise in frustration . What starts out feeling an awful lot like ALIENS ends up feeling so ` alien ' itself that I 'm not sure some folks will even finish the disc , but , as they always say , it is what it is.In the interests of fairness , I 'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Funimation provided me with a DVD screener of KING OF THORN for the expressed purposes of completing this review .	-1
Not the greatest in the genre , but ok to have to add to collection . They are good family fun movies ! Thank You , Claudia Silver	-1
The random case cover , disc & DVD menu art work that has nothing to do with the movie really bothers me . The 'chapter selection ' reads `` Chapter 1 '' , `` Chapter 2 '' , '' Chapter 3 '' , etc- but no pictures or titles to tell us at which point of the movie these chapters will lead too . The CD is just really unnecessary , and the movie itself does not look much better than if you recorded it on your DVR or even a VHS whenever it aired on TV . I gave it two stars because I really love this movie and was glad people decided to release it , no matter how lacking the release is , and it 's cheap ... but I advise people to , if you have it recorded or can find it online , to burn it to a disc yourself and buy a cheap case , because that 's really all it is , and would cost less . I actually ( with the help of my label maker ) made new covers for the case & DVD with pictures from the actual movie , and quickly typed up where each chapter leads on a piece of paper to just stick in the case ( like some DVDs actually come with ) . I also took the CD & it 's holder out , it was easy enough . Unfortunately I ca n't change what it looks like when the DVD menu comes up on screen , but I am just glad to own the movie , so maybe I should n't complain so much ? = )	-1
I did n't like it because of the bad language and the sex scenes . This seems to be a trend in the movie world and it stinks	-1
I was really bored the whole time.Did n't make me laugh . Did n't make me cry . Did n't make me care . I am left emotionless .	-1
Bait , a shark movie with a cool premise and a lousy payoff . I should 've quit ahead when the shark bursts through a surfboard ( cracking it in half ) and jumping 30ft into the air roaring . So a tsunami hits Australia and a grocery store during a robbery gets hit and floods partway , and when the survivors get together and try to figure out a way to the surface a big great white shark is stuck in the grocery store with them and terrorizes them . Sounds like a winning formula right ? Well it was pretty entertaining if you like shark attack movies , so the scenes with the shark and people avoiding the shark were sorta fun , but what was anything but good was the other 95 % , the human drama.We have a few different kind of characters in this movie . We have generic looking white heroes who say positive stuff like `` c'mon guys stop fighting , we need to get outta here '' and do almost everything themselves . We have the negative survivors that sit around and bitch saying stuff like `` We 'll never make it '' or `` why do n't we just give up now '' . Finally we have neutral martyrs that decide to help at the last minute and die , and are promptly forgotten about . Such is life of a neutral . A police-father in this has a leg injury and grabs one of the generic white kids by the shoulders and grunts `` help ... my ... daughter ... '' or a criminal-turned gruff good guy who says `` I 'm foindin ' us a way outta here '' . My point is the characters suck.Also by the end it turns out that the great white shark was also a part time relationship counselor : -a girl was in a relationship with a jerk , so the shark ate the jerk and let her and her dog live so that she can ponder why she chooses the men she does-An estranged ex-couple are brought back together when the well-meaning new boyfriend dies , and they would n't have likely sat down and talked if it were n't for the whole tsunami/great white situation-great white teaches one of the robbers that he does in fact have a heart of gold , and hooks him up with one of the store clerks while he 's at it ! Yowza ! -Also the shark teaches a selfish girl to be self-less by the end of it and appreciate her fellow man , as well as allowing her father to witness what a good person she 's becoming.Wow , move over Dr. Phil ! So yeah the shark parts were fun but the 95 % of people talking was mind-numbingly cliche . If you really want to watch this I suggest you get some friends together , have a few cold boys , and laugh at the blatant stupidity in BAIT .	-1
Terrible movie , so bad I had to fast forward thru a lot of it . Acting bad , plot bad , cgo shark bad .	-1
Saban is doing what even Lord Zedd could n't accomplish , destroy the Power Rangers . So , after all the times the rangers saved the world , whose gon na save them ? Who among us will risk it all to rescue the ultimate rescuers ?	-1
Happily it was free on Prime Instant movies , however just the time spent accosting my eyes , such as they are , how can I put this ... was n't pleasant . Do n't get me wrong , it was n't the worse I 've seen by a long shot , But I can not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I had seen part of this movie previously but was n't aware of it because I never knew the title . After watching for 10 minutes I realized I had seen parts of it before and why I had only seen parts of it before , so I stopped watching .	-1
Seen this in theaters a while back , waste of time . I mean it 's an okay film , but compared to the previous two with Morgan Freeman it does n't even hold a candle to them . Perry has been in dresses to long or something . Should never have recast it and went in such a direction .	-1
I had read the book before watching it . It 's completely different story . I prefer the book instead of the movie .	-1
I would not recommend this product . The movie lack story line and it did not captivate the story . Wish I never bought it in the first place . I watched the movie one time and one time only will not watch it again .	-1
I think Patterson forgot who his character is ... a smart doctor who is also a great detective . Tyler Perry was believable as a dramatic actor and I think he could have played Alex Cross as we all know and love him . Too bad to waste good actors on a template 'blast the smithereens outta the bad guys & # 34 ; . Fox is outstanding as the demented villain . I 'm sad that Patterson has reduced Alex to this level .	-1
Tyler Perry plays Alex Cross , a Detroit police detective with a doctorate in abnormal psychology . Created by James Patterson , Alex Cross is a unique person , a family man and highly trained homicide detective with Sherlock Holmes-like abilities of observation and deduction , and in the new film he is pushed to the edge when a sadistic serial killer `` Picasso '' ( very chilling Matthew Fox ) with a penchant for torture arrives in the town . This sounds interesting , but in reality `` Alex Cross '' is just another run-of-the-mill thriller.Tyler Perry ( nominated for Razzie for this role ) is not that bad , but he is not that good , either . The film 's biggest problem is its weak screenplay that does n't offer us anything fresh or original , and the lackluster direction of Rob Cohen , who did far better jobs in `` The Fast and The Furious '' and `` Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story . '' With the film 's sluggish pace and lack of suspense , it seems he is not really interested in making the story compelling . Supporting players including Edward Burns , Jean Reno and Cicely Tyson are all wasted . `` Alex Cross '' is an attempt of Hollywood studios to reboot the Alex Cross series , but the result is only a dull and generic action movie . Two previous Alex Cross movies `` Kiss the Girls '' and `` Along Came a Spider '' were not particularly great , but with charismatic Morgan Freeman as the protagonist they were not boring , which `` Alex Cross '' exactly is .	-1
About 45 minutes in I was starting to almost want to fall asleep & I only started watching it at 5:00 . That 's not good at all . Once Robert Englund showed up the movie got better . It seems like they only had maybe an hours worth of decent material & stretched that out to 90 minutes . I actually did like the ending . The Werewolves were plain disappointing looking . Think Hugh Jackman as Wolverine only a little messier with fangs . I say it 's a rental at best . Strippers vs. Zombies was no prize movie but it has this beat .	-1
I bought this movie knowing it was probably going to be really bad and it did n't disappoint ! One word , cheesy ! I 'm a sucker for B horror movies and this one suckered me in , do n't waste your time or money on this stinker ! !	-1
Freaking 7 establishing shots , all of the same sign . And an additional 2 to Stillwater , in case no one knows what town she was approaching on her way home from work every night . Sorry , I lost my mind for a minute . Rose McGowan is Sonny , a radio shrink , who has to contend with a psychotic , nursery rhyme-spewing paperboy . Detective Briggs ( Ray Wise ) and his partner are particularly dense . Quite infuriating . A solid 8.5 on the Silly Meter .	-1
I do n't have much to say about this film other than it is boring tripe ! ! It is mostly about 2 guys bitching about the end of the world . Got so bored and frustrated with it that I stopped it twice and waited a few days until I could try to watch the damn thing again . I gave it a chance but it still was garbage . Not much in the gore department but when it was present it was n't great . I know it was low budget but I 've seen horror flicks that could produce better effects with an even lower `` shoe-string '' budget . Only notable yet bizarre thing to point out is the existence of `` rednecks '' in Italy . Go figure ! Terrible import from Italy , stick to Fulci ! ! !	-1
Well , I saw the danger sign of `` Uwe Boll '' on the cover and still I bought this movie ! ! ! I was thinking that since he had no part in the making of the movie , just responsible for it 's distribution , that it might actually be a good film ... I was wrong and have FINALLY learned my lesson ... I will never waste money on any movie that has Boll 's name on it ! Like so many other hum drum , bad zombie movies , Eaters suffers from a poor script which makes for a lack of character development . Instead of a handful of hopeful survivors trying to survive , we are given a cast of characters , who for the most part , are just annoying stereotypes that pop up during the movie with no rhyme or reason , but to just add time and shock to a poorly written movie ... the mad scientist who really LOVES his work , the macho military `` G. I. Joe '' who likes to live dangerously , the weird artist ( who should have went by the name Dali instead of Warhol ) , the inbreed hicks ( who ` s idea was it to allow these fine specimens of life into their safe haven ? ) , the crazy religious cult leader and a group of ridiculous neo-Nazis led by a `` Mini-Me '' Hitler . Sure , there might be a lot lost on the fact that the movie is dubbed with heavy melodramatic voices , but the movie 's dialog was super weak and for the most part unrealistic ! ... It seems the writers of Eaters was more interested in making a movie full of weird characters and gore ... It 's got Uwe Boll 's name on it so I should have known better ! Now , with all that said ... this is a budget movie that does n't really look like one . I though the story was interesting , just not written or thought out to have an even / realistic flow ! The special effects and makeup was top notch and the actors were great actors ... again , maybe it was the dubbing that really turned me off from this movie ... well , that and the majority of bizarre and needless characters ! If you are in need of a zombie movie fix , Eaters is worth a CHEAP rental , but after watching it once , I do n't think you would be interested in seeing it again !	-1
As I was watching this particular volume ( vol . 5 ) I noticed some things that made no sense at all . Showing excerpts from previous episodes that had n't occurred . Then going back to air dates on IMDB , I realized the episodes were out of sequence.Great animation and story lines . You just need a list of air dates and then select one episode at a time in order for it to click . ( make sense ) The air dates are as follow ; The Private War of Dr. Doom - Apr . 1 , 2012Alone Against A.I.M . - Apr . 8 , 2012Acts of Vengeance - Apr . 15 , 2012Welcome to the Kree Empire - Apr . 22 , 2012To Steal an Ant-Man - Apr . 29 , 2012Michael Korvac -May 6 , 2012Who Do You Trust - May 13 , 2012The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill - May 20 , 2012Nightmare in Red - May 30 , 2012Prisoner of War - May 31 , 2012Infiltration - Jun . 4 , 2012Secret Invasion - Jun . 5 , 2012Along Came a Spider ... - Jun . 6 , 2012Behold ...

I think those responsible for making this film were trying too hard and in the process , just went overboard.The acting was bad , the plot was bad , all but three of the actors were bad , the general movie idea was bad . These movies just seem to gain more and more stupidity as they 're made.Okay , I understand setting the plot as some `` rambunctious teens '' in a cabin in the woods . Its worked before with lots of `` scary '' movies . But putting teenagers in the woods , while some people in a building somewhere bet on the scenarios that are about to take place , that in itself was not the deal breaker for me . However , meanwhile the teenagers ca n't leave the area because there are invisible computerized walls keeping them in a confined area while they are being chased around the woods and roads by zombies with knives , tree saws , and bear traps . At the same time , some pot head is using his gigantic bong to bash zombies in the head and re-wire random elevators in the woods which lead to glass boxes full of random monsters , an underground SWAT team , a white unicorn which runs through the halls impaling people in the stomach with its horn , and a ritualistic sacrifice room which keeps ancient gods from destroying the world with their giant hands . This was just wayyyyy too much . I sincerely wish I could get that part of my life back .	-1
This movie was so ridiculous and over-the-top corny . There were some entertaining parts , but not many . It 's not horrible if you like this kinda stuff , which I usually do n't mind . But this movie had me like & # 34 ; Huh ? & # 34 ; most of the time .	-1
I went to see `` Cabin in the Woods '' at a Saturday matinee on the second weekend of its release . There were a total of six people in the movie theater . I told myself that it was probably because most people saw it opening weekend . However , after sitting through it , I think maybe word of mouth has slowed its progress . Despite the number of 5 star reviews the film has received here on Amazon , and the 92 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes , this may be the most overrated film ever . Recently , there was an article in Vanity Fair by James Wolcott in which he lamented the dearth of quality movies and the lowered expectations of many filmgoers ( presumably including film critics , themselves ) and praised the high quality of television 's current offerings . `` Cabin in the Woods '' , in my opinion , only reinforces his argument . Produced and co-written by Josh Whedon , `` Cabin '' is no `` Buffy , the Vampire Slayer '' , by any stretch of the imagination . More a combination of `` Evil Dead '' , `` Resident Evil '' , and `` Doctor Strangelove '' ( without the first and third film 's imagination ) , `` Cabin in the Woods '' tips its hat too early , whispering its little secret to us without completely spilling the beans , although many will have it figured out long before the ending , which feels cribbed from the ending of another film written by Drew Goddard , `` Cabin '' s co-writer and director . The writers have obviously also harvested some of the more esoteric internet conspiracy websites to gather some of their material.With the exceptions of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as two project managers , the actors are neither better nor worse than any others in movies of this genre . Chris Hemsworth ( `` Thor '' , `` The Avengers '' ) is the college jock who leads his small group to the titular cabin in the woods that allegedly belongs to his cousin . Enroute to the cabin , the group stops at a rundown gas station attended by the requisite nutjob -- think the nutty alcoholic in the original `` Friday the 13th '' film -- who drops ominous hints at what awaits them . Ignoring all this , the kids are n't at the cabin long before all sorts of horrors begin to unfold . But , as the film basically shouts from the beginning , THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS . Neither is it as surprising , innovative , or as interesting as it is given credit for being ( it 's really a lazy man 's movie that combines scenes from other movies and adds a little twist in order to appear to be more clever than it is ) . And , finally , the cinematography is often murky and the CGI effects are n't that impressive , either.In fact , if you 've ever played a video game , this movie is basically the same type of experience , only much less fun . At least that 's how it felt to me.I give `` Cabin in the Woods '' a star for its sometimes fleeting , loopy humor ( particularly in the performances of Jenkins and Whitford ) , and a star for the fact that it somewhat resists the temptation to get overly grotesque . Otherwise , there 's not much else to recommend it over a rerun of `` Buffy '' or `` Angel '' , which are free and about a hundred times more entertaining .	-1
This has got to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen . I cant believe I even finished it ... not to mention I hate when every other word is a curse word , seriously , what 's the point ?	-1
This movie had nothing to do with what I thought . I did watch the trailer but it did n't entail what was actually in the movie . I did n't mind the movie being engineered by some command center having the whole place rigged . I dislike how they were having to appease some greater gods that once rules the earth and they have to sacrifice somebody for them to stay below the earth . Keep it scary and original , do n't add fantasy land in it with some Greek God Bologna . Lost my 3-4 star rating once I saw that .	-1
so , so incredibly lame ! ! if you are seriously older than like 12 you should probably steer clear of this . while it is creative in design , said design was horribly executed ! !	-1
Interesting idea for a horror flick . Hit all the cliche 's . See if you can recognize all the references to other horror characters . Glad I did n't pay $ 10 to see it in a theater .	-1
I enjoy horror movies and was expecting this to be good or at least watchable , but wow what a pile of crap . This feels like something lower then a B-movie , the acting is among the worst I 've ever seen and I 've seen plenty of different horror flicks . The only redeeming factor to this movie is the last 25-minutes where all hell breaks loose , prior to that this could be among the worst movies all time . Still the crazy killing splatter of the last 1/4 of the movie is n't enuff to make me recommend the film ... but worth watching that last section just for the fun of the CGI ! _ !	-1
Down right ridiculous.The premise for this movie is so out-there , that it 's just plain stupid.And to think I actually anticipated seeing this movie , and pouted when I missed it in the theater.I am SO glad I 'm only out the rental cost.This movie is definitely NOT for true horror fans .	-1
I really did n't like it very much . the story line was n't very good and was really boring . I only was able to watch about thirty minutes before I turned it off , was a waste of money to rent .	-1
i do n't know why i bothered watching this , i 'm not a creepy movie fan . as far as scary , it was ok i guess .	-1
We streamed this a few nights ago . The movie starts out with a premise that 's hard to buy into but the occassional good scare and production values keep your attention . However what seemed plausible and enjoyable to watch soon turns predictable - and it get worse . By the end of the film they 're throwing anything and everything we 've seen doxens of times before at the screen it 's tiersome , repetative and nothing new nor fresh.Perfomances are forgettable at best . As I watched the film derail I spent more time looking at the clock than the screen .	-1
I did not like this movie at all ! It was poor quality , poor story line , and poor everything . I do not recommend this movie .	-1
This is a prime example of getting suckered by ads.Unfortunately I bought this thing blindfolded , it was SO BAD - I just tossed it in the garbage on bluray.This is one of the most ridiculous films put out , it ranks with the Blair Witch , Killer Clowns , Killer Tomatoes and all those overwhelming `` Reality Shows '' , like Paranormal.Just plain bad and I wish I could give it a negative rating , but I ca n't so 1 star it is ! Sigourney Weaver is either desperate for money or else does n't care about her name !	-1
I do n't even know who came up with the script for the movie . I still do n't see how they can check the scary creatures in and out of the elevator and still maintain control over them . If you like to watch blood flow , watch this movie . Otherwise , skip it and watch something else better .	-1
Thumbs down . Such a corn ball movie . Without spoiling themovie , I was disinterested in the entire movie but ploddedthrough it just to watch it . UUUgh .	-1
Although I was nailed to my seat and surprised with the twists and turns in this movie , I was never really scared . The script is not great and the horror scenes not very convincing . Rather give me the old horror movies of the 20th century !	-1
What can I say . I was hoping that the series would get better . It was better than Wrong Turn 4 , but just a pale shade of the original movie . I have noticed the make-up and sets are just not as grissly or hard core as the original movie . The story was better than Wrong Turn 4 . But the make up on the hill billy trio looked terrible . The only redeeming quality was adding in their normal looking relative played by Doug Bradley ( Pinhead from the Hell Raiser series ) . He was the best part of the movie .	-1
Fox takes another wrong turn with this failing Slasher series , this time bringing the inbred hillbillies out of the woods and in to the Mountain Man music festival , where they have their pick of plenty of drugged-up , over-sexed teenagers to mangle and destroy as they see fit . Why this is being called WRONG TURN 5 when all of the teens end up exactly where they intended to is beyond us , but that is the least of our worries . Declan O'Brien 's script could have supplanted any other group of deranged killers and the film would have remained just as pointless and unnecessary as the last sequel . Once the audience has given up on the annoying lead characters , the only thing to look forward to is the gratuitous sex and gore , but even the effects department fails to deliver any memorable moments of bloody violence . The continued decline in quality and entertainment that this series poses is beginning to outweigh the fun of the first two films , and it is time to either bring back Joe Lynch for more absurd exploitation or kill off the mutant mountain men once and for all.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies	-1
Curiosity made me watch it . That , and stupidity on my part because I knew full well what this movie would be like and yet watched it anyway ... ... ... .as I have the entire series ( only kept the first one that started it all ) . I wish I could say I was pleasantly surprised by this installment but it was pretty much business as usual . At this point , they 're following a worn-out formula ; they do n't deviate from it one iota . On one hand , you have the three maniacs running around giggling . On the other hand , you have the usual accounting of fodder . ( The body count was as high as the cast of non-hillbillies . ) The deaths were n't particularly inspired . Apparently , at this stage of the game , this trio of nitwits can kill with impunity , with no one the wiser . This means running roughshod over an entire town that left for a nearby music festival . I do n't know how this can be accomplished in any known universe . Bodies were left strewn about hither and yon ( maybe their meat locker was full ? ) . The only dubious honor involved in this effort was the casting of Pinhead ( Doug Bradley ) , as Maynard Odets . Unfortunately , without his iconic makeup he 's just another bald geezer.At this juncture , I do n't see how they can breathe life back into this franchise , especially if they keep basing everything on the same story with the same results.It was too dull to muster any hatred for , but for ratings sake I 'll try .	-1
I am a huge horror movie fan , I even like some of the pretty bad ones . I own every Wrong Turn movie and I cant stress enough have much I regret buying Wrong Turn 5 . This was a the biggest piece of crap movie I have seen in a very long time . My fiancee who loves horror movies as well looked at me half way through and said `` this might be the worst movie I have ever seen '' .The kill scenes where nothing special and they should have been great , this is why most of us buy Wrong Turn movies right ? The makeup was terrible and the whole movie just had a really low budget look and feel to it . The town where pretty much the whole movie took place looked like a bad cheap movie set . Im all about atmosphere in horror movies and this had none . I was pumped months ago when i first read about this movie and it sounded like it might have a little bit of a Halloween vibe to it ... nope ! Some festival is supposed to be going on but all of a sudden the town is pretty much empty . If your going to have a bunch of people in the streets then all of a sudden everyone is gone why would you not have the killers wipe out a bunch of people , there is plenty of ways you could have done something , lazy , lazy ? I get these kind of movies have bad acting but this was really bad . Im all for sex scenes but one of them was just randomly thrown in the movie and had nothing to do with anything.I could go on but I will stop there , just trust me on this one , rent before you buy , this director needs to get a clue because this movie was complete crap and ive been excited for it to be released for a few months now . I cant believe im saying this but these movies need to stop unless they make some big changes next time , lazy cheap looking movie , so disappointed.I rank the Wrong Turn movies 2 , 1 , 4 , 3 , and 5 a very distant 5th	-1
Alright first off , I 'm not going to get into how much of an epic failure this movie was with the plot and everything . So lets just start out by saying the movie in my opinion was terrible because everyone pretty much dies . So to the people who made the Wrong Turn Films let me start off by saying for the umteenth time THIS IS N'T THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING THE CANNIBALS/WEST VIRGINIA BACKWOODS HILLBILLIES KILLING EVERYONE DOES NOT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THE GOOD GUYS LIKE IT DID IN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING WITH LEATHERFACE AND HIS FAMILY.Now with that being said lets start off by getting into the plot of this movie then comparing it to the epic failure 4th installment of the Wrong Turn movie sequence since it is the only other installment of the Wong Turn movies where everyone dies . The plot of this film is simple it takes place in a town known as Fair Lake located in Greenbrier County West Virginia home of everyones favorite backwoods redneck cannibal family . Fair Lake according to the plot is a town that was established in 1814 and de-established in 1817 because all the cannibals who were the first people on the land before it was a town establishment and before West Virginia ( originally part of Virginia ) was even established as a state ate everyone and turned Fair Lake West Virginia ( technically Fair Lake Virginia at the time ) into a ghost town . Basically every year outside the forest area of Fair Lake West Virginia there is a music festival known as the Mountain Man Festival and a group of 4 senior college kids and one college drop out ( Billy ) saying he 's taking a break from school for longer then 2 semesters even though his parents do n't know about it decide to camp out in the woods of Fair Lake West Virginia where the fearsome 3 sum of cannibals ( 3 finger , sawtooth , and one eye + Maynard ( the old man in the first 2 wrong turns ) live . After being set up in a trap designed to crash the college students car on their way to the music festival dug by the cannibals involving the college students camping out kicking Maynard . Right when the students are kicking Maynard after their car crashes from Maynard jumping in front of it when he 's down and the cannibals are getting ready to strike their prey , the Greenbrier County Sherif and a few deputies show up and take the kids along with Maynard to jail for assault ( mainly on Maynard ) and illegal possession of drugs on the college kids . And since Billy brought the drugs he takes full responsibility for them and the rest of the kids go to a near by motel . Then the sherif finds out Maynard is guilty of multiple killing crimes and when she tries to report him to a higher police authority through radio the cannibals shut off all the power in the jail and motel . Then Billy 's girl friend Cruz brings him supper and is followed by one of Billy 's college companions Julian . Cruz gets killed by 3 finger on her way and Julian gets to the jail where the Sherif deputizes everyone in the jail cels ( basically the 2 college kids + a drunk ) to hold down the fort and get Maynard to a more secure facility due to death threats involving the other 3 cannibals from Maynard.Now comparing Wrong Turn 5 to Wrong Turn 4.First off Wrong Turn 4 was a worse movie , at least Wrong Turn 5 did n't go take place in this past decade ( see prev review on Wrong Turn 4 ) even though it should have because Maynard is killed in the second Wrong Turn ( created in 2007 ) . And the makers of Wrong Turn 5 did n't go take out all the fun of allot of parts in the plot like they did in Wrong Turn 4 . The creators of the film do n't leave the viewer wondering how the cannibals got some of the things they did as they did in the fourth installment of Wrong Turn . Plus the cannibals in Wrong Turn 5 acted more like killers rather then sissies like they did in Wrong Turn 4 . The good guys in Wrong Turn 5 did n't blow off killing the cannibals when they had the chance like the did in the 4th installment since they never really got a chance at killing the cannibals . And at least Wrong Turn 5 Bloodbath/Bloodlines has a more suitable name and does n't look like a poser film to the first wrong turn like the 4th installment did.However everyone dies in Wrong Turn 5 just like they did in the 4th installment and that 's why it only gets one star . But if you do n't mind horror films where everyone dies and the bad guys win , you may like this movie even though it really should have taken place somewhere between 2004 & 2006 . However , in my opinion the creators of the Wrong Turn series of films with the 5th installment have shown pretty much a failure to make up for their god awful creation of the forth wrong turn , are getting pretty desperate for ideas , are starting to feel they should have left the wrong turn series at 3 films , and most importantly feeling like someone else needs to re-make their 4th and 5th installments of the Wrong Turn series . Just like the people who made Starship Troopers feel about the second and third films they made ( well I guess Starship Troopers 3 was n't really that bad ) . And just for the record , you can add a reporter , the sherif 's boyfriend , and a deputy to the list of people who are killed in this film .	-1

Alas ! It pains me to say it , as I support the decent and wholesome film industry . But so often they do fall short . And this one falls short . The story line in and of itself , is promising . A young Yankee widow finds a wounded Confederate soldier in her barn . The Confederate being an escaped prisoner of war and they eventually fall-in-love . The main drawback of the film is that they make the mistake of simply taking modern people and putting them in old timey clothing and thinking that is sufficient . The dialogue is decidedly modern and not at all historical in nature , such as greeting each other with `` Hi ! '' . The young girl actor who wear pants throughout the film has very modern looking hair . And nobody felt `` old timey '' in their acting . It does n't work to just put on different clothes and think that is enough . There is a certain getting into the feel of the historical time period being represented that is called for in a good historical film and it is that element of quality that is lacking in this movie . I 'm not disappointed I saw the film , but I would n't buy it again knowing now what it is like .	-1
Directed by Peter Keglevic , whose greatest claim to fame was a comedy about magic drumsticks 25 years ago . Competent actors wasted on an absurd script ; the wonderful Michael Nyquist is thrown away in practically a bit part . Main lead Suzanne Von Brosody does her best but ca n't overcome the ridiculous plot in which Swedish police are colossal idiots , everyone speaks German , even in Nevada , Sweden and China , and the main character impulsively chases a Chinese mass murderer to China with no plan or resources . Amy Cheng , as the sister of a sociopathic corrupt Chinese businessman , is compelling but ultimately she 's undone by the mindless plot as well . Almost everybody dies , but not soon enough . Decent production values , but who cares ? The whole thing is a mess , except for some intercut flashbacks of 1800s America , which are gruesome and over the top , but at least the story is compelling . The first half starts out well , but the whole thing is ultimately hopelessly disappointing , if you value logic in any quantity .	-1
I run a mobile babysitting service from my van.I was at the local Mexican grocery store picking up some treats for the kids . As I was exiting the store , I passed a folding table setup where they sell the latest movies in the theather or about to be in the theather.When I saw the Resident Evil cartoon I was pretty excited ( I almost dropped my groceries . ) Cash only transaction , I immediately bought a copy . To be honest , most teenagers and young adults know who or what 'Resident Evil ' is , but not kids . In a brilliant moves by the powers involved , this animated movie seemed like a great introduction to a younger audience.Locking the van doors in a dark and abandonded parking-lot , we planned on having a fun summer spook fest watching the movie.This did not play out exactly as I had hoped.The animation was good , but it just was n't a kid-friendly movie in hindsight.In fact , most of the kids had soiled themselves and damaged the door of the van trying to get out . A couple of them threw up ruining the carpeted walls and floor ( guess I know who wo n't be coming back after I send their parents the cleaning bill . )	-1
the story line is very VERY ! ! ! ! ! boring you will hate this movie bigtime im a fan and the only thing thats good is when the lickers fight the tyraunt	-1
This movie had a good idea but poor execution . The movie starts slow and really does n't build any momentum . The acting is subpar and the story does n't make alot of sense.The characters acted like no normal person would . I wasted my money buying a movie I would't watch on tv . Avoid at all cost .	-1
If your going to do something , do it well . This does not.The animation is poor ( except when showing boobs and butt of the Asari ) . The voice acting is poor , with the exception of the one or two characters who made an appearance in the game . The story and dialogue is poorest.All of this is made even worse by virtue of the fact that the concept was good : Give back story to one of the upcoming characters in the video game trilogy , emphasizing choice and consequence , which is a key part of the game.To add to the pile , this release was hyped A LOT on gaming websites . A lot of the fans hoped that this could open the door to a Mass Effect series . They even included an in-game item in the box ( which is not worth it ) .Anyway , take it from this Mass Effect fan : Not worth the money , no matter how hardcore of a Mass Effect fan you are .	-1
In true Mass Effect fashion it was violent at times . The story line was fine , but if Shephard is n't in it who really cares .	-1
All In The Family was a great show ! I own all the season sets released by Sony and Shout . I was so happy when Shout picked up where Sony left off and completed my library of All In The Family . To my surprise now it will be released as a box set with extras . Shame on Shout for doing this ! Now those like I that have the whole sitcom on dvd are left wanting the pilot episodes and extras on the box set with only option to double dip and buy the set all over again . I would have Shout rather release the remaining 3 season that were left with extras which I would have bought . Let 's hope there is a way we ( those who have the complete set ) can get the pilot episodes plus all the extras on a single or double disk release . Until then this release gets one star . Shame on you Shout !	-1
Series 1 , 4 real DVDs ; Series 2 , 3 DVD-R 's -- a real terrible , very pixellated transfer of 13 episodes , each hour at about only 1.4 GB each , a VERY un-dense and thin transfer , so the show looks blotchy and fuzzy and grainy and pixellated . Still , having this thirtysomething/House-like drama is better than nothing , but get it from your local library or through ILL instead and transfer it yourself rather than buying it from SONY .	-1
but not working on every player I tried ... .keeps stopping after 10 minutes in each episode ... very bad transfer indeed ... way too expensive for something like this ... shame..This is one of the worst quality items I ever bought on amazon and it is really almost like a rip off.If it was as cheap as season one I guess I would not complain and swallow it .But for this price ? You should really look into that Amazon because a lot of people will definitely not be happy ...	-1
Perhaps the most horrible video of the rock era , .Terrible video quality. , insipid camera angles , cheap packaging , newsreel quality footage , non-remastered sound , no special features , no information at all.Cheapo cheapo production.The performances sound ok in a muddy mono mix , but the video is so out of sync it is impossible to watch without gritting your teeth.Has the rare performances of Bye Bye Johnny and All Aboard , but that 's about all it has going for it , Unless you are a hardcore Kinks collector and need everything , avoid this mercifully short turkey at all costs .	-1
I was really disappointed in this one guys ! What really bothered me was , look at the four guys on the back of the package . It 's not THE KINKS . Besides . I heard from other reviews that the quality is poor , and the sound is just as bad . My honest opinion . Get & # 34 ; ONE FOR THE ROAD '' . Got to be THE KINKS Best ! Good luck .	-1
This storyline is the sort of story one would see 40 years ago . The acting is poor , the characters are not interesting and the only good part is some of the dialogue . Still that is not going to save a movie so halfway in , I had enough and turned it off .	-1
I thought the storyline was desperately desperate ! Eva Mendes is better than this movie . It 's one of those where you keep watching it hoping that at some point the storyline is going to get better and it just does n't !	-1
This is one of those movies that I want to like because of what it is . It 's a movie directed by a woman , starring Hispanic women and dealing with a teenage girl coming of age - which involves a lot less pie-related sex . Hollywood is essentially a conservative place that ca n't even be bothered to make movies that pass the Bechdel Test most of the time so every movie made by and starring minorities becomes a test case for whether they will do these movies in the future or just go back to white dude movies.And this is awful.It 's a self-congratulatory mess about a girl who is checking off the tropes of a coming of age movie . Presenting a list of tired coming-of-age cliches ( drugs , going to parties , betraying the fat friend , etc . ) is not the same thing as subverting them . The movie goes through the list , checking them off and being generally annoying . Ten minutes from the end of the movie and the only question I have is whether the boy that she wants to lose her virginity to is & # 34 ; not really a lady 's man & # 34 ; because he 's actually gay . I do n't think that question is going to be answered . But that scene where she orders him to have sex with her - it feels like the echo of a braver and better movie that could have been made .	-1
It seemed like this movie I had seen many times before as far as the plot goes . I just didnt see anything new and interesting about this movie . The main villain didnt impress me too much . He just came off as a disturbed screw ball .	-1
I could n't believe even the little boy ( s ) in this movie was allowed to use the F word and other swear words . PEOPLE LIKE US , is sadly not that normal of a family . Seriously how many producers who make these movies would actually allow their OWN children to swear and act like the kids and adults in this movie ? You have the kids swear and flip people off and this was to portray a single recovering alcoholic mom who is raising a poor child and he is allowed to use this kind of language cause his life sucks ? I watched it , but was so disappointed that they took a great story line and trashed it with the language . Shame on them . This is n't what America wants . Not the America I know.I actually just cut it in half and threw it in the trash . I just re-read my review and realized no matter how sentimental this movie was suppose to be , I am ashamed to say I watched it . If my grandsons talked like that at 11 or any age , I would be horrified and ashamed and would sit them down , not shake their hand .	-1
Not people like me -- warped sense of what is family . I looked forward to getting this after seeing the preview but was sorely disappointed .	-1
SAVE YOUR MONEY THERE ARE BETTER OUT THERE	-1
Oh , my . I watched this with very low expectations , of course , but I enjoy the Underworld franchise as far as it goes , so I thought this spiritual cousin might provide a modest dose of entertainment . This , however , is an astonishing failure on every level . It is hard to know where to start while criticizing it because there is so much wrong here . Lasting around 90 minutes , the entire film , which places the title Swiss doctor 's itinerant creation in the center of a centuries-old war between gargoyles and demons , plays as a frantic trailer for itself . Explanations are condensed or disregarded entirely . Characters leap into action without justification or motivation . There is not a single pause in the name of atmosphere nor character development nor even a basic level of coherency . There are deadly earnest lines such as , & # 34 ; I am a demon prince , and you will kneel before me ! & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; I , descender of the demon horde . I , my father 's son . I , FRANKENSTEIN. & # 34 ; It is downright sad , cringe-worthy even , to remember how great Aaron Eckhart is in , among other films , In the Company of Men , The Dark Knight , and Rabbit Hole and then to see him here as he growls , grunts , flexes his stitched-together muscles , resembles the aging singer of a bar-circuit Alice Cooper tribute band , and otherwise refuses to emote . As for the aforementioned action sequences , do not expect them to be the sole redeeming quality : staged in warehouses or on the urban-generic streets of a city with no visible human population , they become monotonous in the worst way , a bland cycle of of smashed concrete and digital demon fireballs without notable choreography or even a hint of tension .	-1
Even though most of them flop , Hollywood just seems determined to cram the glossy , witless supernatural thrillers down our throats . Consider : & # 34 ; Legion , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Constantine , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Van Helsing & # 34 ; and everything & # 34 ; Underworld. & # 34 ; And at times , & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; seems like a massive crossover fanfiction of all those -- we have demons , angels , an ancient feud between warring immortal factions , a conspiracy to bring the undead to life ... and gargoyles . It feels like a post- & # 34 ; Underworld & # 34 ; fanfic based on Mary Shelley -- cheesy , plodding and derivative , but it 's also oddly harmless.After burying his maker , the Frankenstein monster ( Aaron Eckhart ) is immediately caught in a clash between demons and the angelically-assisted gargoyles . The gargoyle queen Leonore ( Miranda Otto ) declares that his name is Adam , and asks him to help them save the human race from demons . He refuses , but grabs a sanctified weapon and starts sending the demons back to hell.Fast-forward to the modern day . Adam is still hunting for the demon prince Naberius ( Bill Nighy ) , who has begun scientific experiments to recreate Frankenstein 's revivification techniques -- and is hunting for the monster and/or Frankenstein 's notes . With one of those , he can unleash a new horde of demons on earth , which the dwindling gargoyle forces can not hold back. & # 34 ; I Frankenstein & # 34 ; feels like a massive crossover fanfic . The style is very much & # 34 ; Underworld , & # 34 ; the main plot and villain motivation are from & # 34 ; Van Helsing , & # 34 ; and the angel/demon thing somewhat reeks of & # 34 ; Legion. & # 34 ; And of course , the Frankenstein monster is a tortured , angsty soul with abs that you can grate cheese on , who is redeemed for love of a bland scientist he just met.There is a certain charm in the movie 's clear admiration for the original Mary Shelley novel , though . There are many nods ( Adam 's name ) and references to the book , rather than to the more famous monster movies loosely adapted from it.However , & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; is still a mess . The wafer-thin plot manages to be both simplistic and overcomplicated , with no twists or hidden layers . So it loads itself down with glossy slow-motion action sequences and flashy CGI ( both gargoyles and demons expire in massive eruptions of light ) . The dialogue tends to be cheesy at best ( & # 34 ; Now all I see is darkness. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; I am not human , nor gargoyle , nor demon & # 34 ; ) , and whenever the action dies down , the story lapses into a plodding , awkward pace.Aaron Eckhart seems to be showing us how he would have played a Christopher Nolan Batman -- lots of brooding and angsting ( sometimes on rooftops ) , and talking in a gravelly monotone . He 's not giving it his all , but he 's putting more effort into it than the sleepwalking Nighty . Yvonne Strahovski is so blandly generic as a contrived love interest , she might as well be made of compressed Wonder Bread.Honestly , the only actor who seems to be really throwing herself into her roles is Miranda Otto , who puts a lot of trembling passion into her cheesy dialogue . God bless Otto , she 's working hard on this , and she does add some moments of much-needed subtlety. & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; is a pretty bad movie that derived almost everything from other movies , but it does have a little sliver of heart that makes it hard to hate . It 's not offensively bad ... but it is bad .	-1
So the film has the start of a & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; and has special effects that range from quite good , to downright awful caused by running out of money or by being way too ambitious for their limited abilities . The gargoyles in flight are ok from a distance however up close , well SNL would be proud.The cast is acceptable but saddled with a script of actions and dialogue that gets progressively worse.I think the filmmakers tried to create an & # 34 ; Underworld & # 34 ; type of film and lacked the talent or budget or both to come anywhere near.The premise is as good as any in this video game/Gothic fantasy realm i think it could have been a better film had they invested their money into a good writer and scaled the effects back to what they could pull off correctly . They didn't..Be warned ... ... .	-1
Lame story line , very adolescent , very disappointing as I like the lead actor , very surprised he took this role , what a shame !	-1
What a pile of crap . The comic books is crap , the movie is crap , the writing , artwork , dialog , etc is crap . They ripped off the name & # 34 ; Frankenstein & # 34 ; simply for marketing purposes . I got sucked in , being a Frankenstein fan . If you have n't already , do n't bother . If you are a Frankie fan , this will only piss you off.Too bad they ca n't be sued for trademark or copyright infringement . I guess you could make a home movie in your backyard , use the name & # 34 ; Frankenstein & # 34 ; in the title , and suck a few people in.They are also going to suck people into the upcoming mini-series . This junk does n't deserve a book , movie , mini-series , etc ! It 's all marketing hype . More untalented people getting rich off the masses .	-1
District 9 was great , different ; it took an actual political issue ( apartheid ) and twisted it into a compelling , allegorical scifi . Small budget , big effects , cool aliens , terrific acting . Lots of action . You would think the writer/director of District 9 , given a chance at Hollywood resources , would blow you away . Well , he did n't . Instead , he gave us a propaganda film for the 99 % . But I knew that going in and figured I 'd still have a good time watching it . I did n't . I was bored . The movie is slow , action starved , and not very logical . Even the premise is a stretch -- the wealthy elite live in a ringworld-esque space station visible from Los Angeles with the naked eye . This space station would be the envy of anyone in the Star Trek or even Star Wars universes . And they have these Medical Bays that apparently can cure any sickness or disease . These bays look like tanning booths , and you can see the person in them while they 're being worked on , which only takes a few seconds . These machines can even reconstruct a blown-apart face through a process we 're given to assume is called re-atomization . Pretty impressive , huh ? And it 's all going to be available in 2154 . Just 140 years from now . So that 's the basis for the story : the uber rich , pretty people living in ringworld with their miracle health machine , and everyone else living in filth and poverty and sickness on the planet below . What happens is Matt Damon gets hit with a lethal dose of radiation , and his only salvation is to get into one of these machines . To do this , he must partner with , and do a favor for , a local gang leader geek warlord coyote type who seems to live above everyone else and who has a pretty good stock of high tech gadgets and weapons . The favor is that he needs to have Matt Damon download some programming from the head of Damon 's old boss , a guy who owns and manages a robot factory where Damon used to work and where Damon got his lethal dose of radiation . This download is to be done after Damon surgically acquires some cyborg prosthetics . Two subplots complicate or compound this A-story . The first involves an old girlfriend of Damon 's who ( of course , can you say plot device ? ) has a sick child with Leukemia , and the second has to do with Jodi Foster 's character plotting to overthrow the ringworld administrators . Btw , Jodi Foster speaks with the most bizarre accent in this movie . It 's actually quite jarring.So , what 's wrong with the picture ? Let 's count the ways . WARNING : Some Spoilers Follow1 . Damon works in this factory . It looks like a cross between a UPS shipping facility and a junk yard . The only clean place in the whole factory is where the boss stands and looks at computer screens . So , why are they irradiating robot parts ? I assume it 's to decontaminate them . But then why would you decontaminate them and then roll them back onto the same factory floor they came from ? 2 . The local warlord geek gang leader coyote has lots of resources . He has sophisticated weaponry , cyborg prostheses , lots of electronic stuff . He even has access to shuttles . Yeah , space shuttles . So why does n't he have one of the Medical Bays ? Would n't they be sort of a hot item on the black market ? 3 . Why build an enormous space station in low earth orbit ? Why not just buy Chile and live there ? Why would a space station be safe ? If you consider the direction space engineering is taking today , you see private enterprise and also smaller countries getting into the act . In 150 years , almost anyone will be able to shoot a rocket into space . A low Earth orbit space station visible with the naked eye from Los Angeles would be like hanging a water balloon on a tree limb at Camp BB Gun.4 . If you need to shoot down unauthorized shuttles trying to enter your space station , why do it with some guy on the ground using a bunch of shoulder fired missiles ? Why would n't a space station with a 1500 mile diameter have its own sophisticated defense system ? You mean to tell me , the defense of a multi-gazillion dollar space habitat depends on a single guy who lives in a rathole and does n't own a decent pair of clothes ? 5 . This is a future world in which intelligent robots serve as cops and a process knows as re-atomization can fix any known human disease or injury , where a space station has been built that looks like a modern version of Rome . Re-atomization ! Think about it . Scientists have figured out a way to create things at the atomic level . If you can re-atomize a human face and head in seconds , how long will it take to make a hot dog ? And why are people starving and living in filth on the planet ? This movie would make Gene Roddenberry roll over in his grave.Here 's what I think happened : The director failed to assert himself when the talking heads in Hollywood took control of the story and said to him : `` Do n't worry . It 's a movie . We do n't need to be logical . Just tell the story . `` Wrong .	-1
I see 2 good actors ( Damon & Foster ) and a superficially interesting plot . I fall for the bait ... Then I watch a movie with a twisted liberal political agenda in it 's undercurrent . I 've never seen such terrible acting - especially by Foster . I did n't even know she was capable of such bad acting . The psychotic bad guy with the Australian ( or is it Kiwi ? ) accent was the most laughable of all the characters . A super-lame plot and not a surprise anywhere - watch at your own risk ! A waste of time and money - I have nothing good to say about this movie - NOTHING ! I expect to see this up for a Razzie as one of the worst movies of 2013 .	-1
For a science fiction film this movie is rather unimaginative . However the special effects are good . I especially liked the way that they gave the robots such fluid non robotic movements .	-1
I like science fiction and the preview for this one looked sort of promising . Five minutes into the film , I suspected this was all overblown hype . Thirty minutes into the film , I knew it was . I finished watching the film ( I kept thinking it would get better ) . I 'm no movie critic , but if I were , I 'd say , & # 34 ; Do yourself a favor and pass on thins film ... it just is n't worth your time & # 34 ; .	-1
Some good action scenes do not compensate enough for the heavy-handed left win agenda of this utterly predictable , rehash of a plot stolen from H. G. Wells -- poor people live below a world of rich people . The bad guys are & # 34 ; Homeland Security & # 34 ; and are very brutal to illegal immigrants.It all reminds you of other , much better movies.And a great actress , Jodie Foster , is awful in this film -- that 's hard to accomplish !	-1
I really tried to give this movie a chance . It was so boring and predictable . Jody Foster 's french accents was horrible . I could n't tell if she was trying to be French , British or just annoying . Matt Damon usually does so much better . It was like he could n't get into his character . Plus he is supposed to be dying the whole entire time and taking pills to keep from being sick , yet he is kicking ass and taking names ? ? ? ? Not even any good special effects to distract from the boring script and plot . I want my time back I spent watching this .	-1
Too much like other futuristic movies I have watched . Dragged on for too long . I liked Jodie Foster 's hair style .	-1
In the year 21something the world is trashed and the only ones living on earth speak English/Spanish and they are all poor . In the skies above in some sort of orbiting space craft thingy is rich white folks who are oppressing the earthlings . Jodi Foster must have needed the money to play in this parody of the present day Mexican/American alien issue . Matt Damon who clearly has an agenda must have seen this as his chance to make a statement . Rah . Fancy special effects for a simplistic craptastic movie .	-1
Perhaps I can see where Damon thought he could go with this charactor although it just was n't that interesting when compared to his prior work . He is perfectly capable of being brilliant although it was just too much of a & # 34 ; Blockbuster & # 34 ; sort of movie than anything else . Not really worth the time if you are expecting anything like Bourne or Ripley for instance .	-1
very predictable , same old story..I found it boring and repeditive of the poor against the rich story , and I also found it boring that all the oppressed were hispanic looking..boring and not true , especially if you live outside of the Hollywood LA area , the Southern California are.. there is a whole other world out here Hollywood , just a thought you should consider ? ? ? Renting it was a huge waste of my money .	-1
When the director of this film brought out District 9 a few years ago , I was quite enthusiastic . An imaginative , meaningful , powerful story filmed in new ways.Now he gives us a crude , simplistic , violent and essentially boring scifi story . Main themes are a class struggle in space , not exactly original , and some kind of Affordable Care simplification.What a let down . Jody Foster in possibly her stupidest role ever . Matt Damon as a non actor , impersonating an action hero , or some kind of high tech Mad Max , with a substantial lack of madness . The only similarity to District 9 is the seediness of the earthly environment , as opposed to the Elysium , the residential planet for the better class people.I have tried to find a reason to give more than one star , but could n't find one .	-1
It was okay , I fell asleep half way through and woke up before the end . 2 stars . Would not go out of my way to watch it .	-1
One would think that creating a film and spending $ 100M ( mostly on cast fees ) that a movie that well advertised would be something special.It is n't ! ! ! Same old story line that mimics 100 different science fiction films . Zero plot and often VERY boring . Bummer .	-1
Interesting story line , great actors , great action sequences ... . but horribly put together and terribly directed . The movie had so much potential but whoever directed this has produced the worst possible movie with the best possible cast and a great story to tell . Jodie Foster was awful . Matt Damon and the rest of the actors were terrific . No wonder this thing bombed at the box office.Bloody awful . I have watched some pretty bad movies ... . this was one of the worst .	-1
I can only really see one reason that this movie was made - as a social commentary of the & # 34 ; us against them & # 34 ; theory that is being pushed so heavily by today 's politicians and liberals . Rich against poor . The haves and the have nots . The whole point of the movie is to say - look how horrible & # 34 ; they & # 34 ; are . & # 34 ; They & # 34 ; oppress the poor . & # 34 ; They & # 34 ; do n't want you to get medical care . & # 34 ; They & # 34 ; think they 're better than the rest of us . & # 34 ; They & # 34 ; want to keep you out.That 's a pretty political theory , and certainly one that seems to trump up votes by disgruntled citizenry ... but as a movie , it does n't work too well . Besides the & # 34 ; us against them & # 34 ; theme , there is no reason or plot for this movie . The movie never explains how the division of earth citizens and elysim citizens occurred . There is no history , no back story to put things into context . Nor do they give any coherent explaination of why the people of Elysium are so hell bent on keeping the others out , or not providing even basic care . A race that could build a space station as advanced as Elysium , build the space ships , the robots and the health chambers that apparently can cure any disease in under 10 seconds - that race could certainly also turn Earth into a paradise as well ... the fact that they do n't , or ca n't , does n't make any logical sense . ... .so again , the whole point is nothing more than a morality play about how evil & # 34 ; they & # 34 ; are . The writers do n't even attempt to give the people of Elysium a personality or character build , they are only there to be & # 34 ; the enemy & # 34 ; .And very similar to politicians and liberals , the movie does n't ask you or want you to actually THINK about the & # 34 ; whys & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; how comes & # 34 ; , they do n't want to introduce a true two sided debate or discussion ... they just want you to hate & # 34 ; them & # 34 ; . Because that 's the point of the movie .	-1
This movie could have been great , but the messaging of us vs them is awfully repetitouis with Obama 's class warfare . Premise is Matt Damon , the & # 34 ; ok neighborhood guy & # 34 ; who spent a little time in the slammer has gone straight , and is trying to make it in a down-trodden world . Of course the evil corporation poisons him and he has no choice but to pick up some futuristic guns and start shooting people that are in the way of & # 34 ; him & # 34 ; getting better ... .which is acheived by theft of medical technolgy/access that the & # 34 ; rich & # 34 ; have . I think Damon is a hypocrit given all the movies where he picks up a gun and shoots people vs his real life views and while watching I kept thinking of that , with the not so subtle polictical messages that the Hollywood & # 34 ; Intellegensia & # 34 ; injected into the film .	-1
I read somewhere this was one of Matt Damon 's best roles . I guess so if you 've never seen most of his other movies ... ? The story was not terribly original- the haves vs the have nots in the future ( and the one guy set to change it all ) - and some of the acting was awful . What was up with Jodi Foster 's accent ? It would come and go and sometimes sounded like she was pretending to be British . It was very distracting .	-1
TThe worst is Jodie Foster 's accent- what on earth is she trying to sound like ? And the story wants to be science fiction but it 's really just political . Do n't waste your time	-1
First , Jodie Foster 's accent just made her sound snooty . Not foreign , or exotic , or genuinely upper class . She sounded like a snobby poser . It was very annoying.Second , I felt like liberal Hollywood was beating me over the head with their agenda items . Evil corporate owner ? Check . Hard-fighting & # 34 ; illegals & # 34 ; who have as much right to the promised land as anyone ? Check . Life-saving medical aid withheld from all but the most wealthy ? Check , of course . And it just goes on from there.The acting was fine ( except for that grating accent ) , and the script was well enough written , if you 're looking for obvious politics in your movie . But that 's the thing . I want politics in my news websites , and entertainment in my movies . Things have been reversed . There is really no chance of me ever buying any more movies with Damon or Foster , thanks to this hot mess of a political brow-beating .	-1
While I enjoy Matt Damon as an actor I reeeeaally did not enjoy this movie at all . I did not think I would like it because I 'm not a fan of science fiction fan anyway but I was hoping it would have loads of action in it maybe like a Bourne kinda of thing ... ? Nope . It was just somehow like a District 9 miserable dystopian futuristic no action happening , no suspense , no drama ... No ... .nothing . Do n't waste your time . Save the two hours of your life and read a book .	-1
Saying that this movie is bad would be an understatement . This movie is truly terrible . Bad acting . Bad script . Boring . Bad directing . Bad editing . It sucks .	-1
I love all the people saying to forget the politics , when this is nothing more then a political liberal propaganda movie on immigration . Of course with the limousine Hollywood liberals , the US is the evil entity and the illegals are the good guys . The evil Homeland Security is trying to stop the illegals from becoming citizens . Notice all the good guys but one , is Mexican . I give it two stars for the graphics and cool vision of future medical innovations . Damon was terrible and was out shined by Cougar , his best friend , the nurse , the little girl and the spaceships . One thing they got right , the look of the future Los Angeles area . But Elysium will be all the gated communities the millionaire limousine liberals live in .	-1
Conceptually it looks great on paper ... how could it not be with Matt Damon and Jodie Foster in leading roles , right ? Well even they ca n't save this movie . The special effects make you feel like you 're gaming on a computer ... that is , you 'd probably like it on your computer and think it 's great , but in a movie it seems a bit childish and overdone . The direction along with the sound editing/mixing is also mediocre . The outcome is transparent , the characters are n't developed well and you ca n't understand half of what they 're saying .	-1
not a great story . the have-nots against the privileged wealthy.to be honest it seemed like a very long pro-Obamacare commercial .	-1
It was OK , really did n't my interest the entire time . Setting reminded me of star trek and the other movie with Justin Timberlake where they time to survive .	-1
What an under acheiving , thinly vieled attempt to illicit an emotional knee-jerk reaction from potential voters concerning ObamaScare and illegal immigrartion . Who do you think pays for all this & # 34 ; Free Health care & # 34 ; ? ? ? The average White guy , who is portrayed as sinister in the very root of the word . The only plus I can give this & # 34 ; movie & # 34 ; ( an insult to actual movies ) is that Jodie Foster was the personification of Billary Clinton , and she got what the actual person deserves ; justice for all of her Illegal actions while under oath to serve the nation . Matt and Jodie , welcome to the ranks of Tom Cruise . Reagan accurately labled these crackpots as & # 34 ; Looney Tunes & # 34 ; , and they are . What a sorry film , the so called exoskeletons were very obviously hydralic cylinders used to aid in opening automotive tool box lids and vehicle rear hatches . The special effects team should not take payment for this scam . Some scenes Damon 's shirt was torn , then the next shot it was miraculously brand new . What terrible editing . One star is was too generous . Vaccum in practice ; in other words , it sucked . I should be paid for watching this .	-1
It kept me on my toes , was exciting , I was nervous the whole time . But if I were to do it again I would not rent this movie . It had great actors but the script did not live up to what it could have been . What a waste of money .	-1
Let me preface this with personal info : I AM a sci-fi fan , love action movies and was looking forward to seeing this movie.But when you are watching the movie and checking your watch to see how much longer this thing is going to last ... you know it is a dud.Matt Damon was dull and had no spark . It felt link he was just going thru the paces to get the paycheck.The initial `` setup the story '' part was about 15 minutes too long . He goes to work and goes home and goes to work and goes home -- we got it already ! My friend who went to the movies with me , got up to get us hot dogs just to have something interesting to do.Then she went to the bathroom . Then she figgetted.And as for it having some deep social message - phfft . Some people have money and can get top of the line treatment and some people are poor and can not . period . it always has been this was and always will . I suspect even cavemen had a pecking order.So save your money and your popcorn for something more entertaining , cause this movie wo n't do it .	-1
Thinking this was going to deliver on same level of the well made District 9 , I went ahead and spent my $ 10 to go see it . Not really impressed.Not to spoil it with details but basically , the Haves ( white rich people ) live on Elysium and the Have nots ( poor Mexicans ) live on earth . People on Elysium have it all , top of the line everything , including machines that can heal any ailment a human could have . People on earth basically have nothing . You get the picture . The plot is extremely predictable and shallow . Too many flashbacks . As another reviewer stated , you can figure out how it will end midway through . The only thing this movie has going for it is Copley 's performance as the antagonist , top notch for sure.Blomkamp should have just made the District 9 sequel instead , which is what most people ( myself included ) going to see this movie really want anyway .	-1
More propoganda AGAINST pursuing space colonization and perpetuating the us against them paradigm . I was glad to see Jodi Foster in Sci-Fi , yet the premise of the film dissapoints to the extent that I will not be watching it .	-1
they say that movies are a form of art . And in this case that art form would be impressionist , because this movie gave me the impression that they only read about twelve pages of the book before slapping this abortion of a film on screen . They skipped through the story so fast that all character development was lost . This was an amazing story , with a great cast , and they wrote the script to give the impression that a 12 year old was given command after two battles , a practice with Petra , and a fight or two with a bully . If they had broken this movie up into two films , they would have had a great set of films . As is , the rest of the the book series is pretty much killed .	-1
I was very excited to hear that this was being made into a movie and when I saw the cast I was very hopeful . Sadly , so much is left out from the book there is very little left but a basic premise . I do not know if it was to much story for a single movie , and if that was the case they should have made it in two parts . Do battle school as volume one and command school as volume two . So much of the character development and the strategies were left out that it makes it almost impossible to understanding Ender and the other characters . You get little snippets but nothing in depth , so when it all comes to an end it is very unsatisfying.The special effects were great , visually the movie looks good , and there are some nice moments , but as a whole it does very little justice to the source material .	-1
Where do I start ? The theme of the movie is poorly set-up . You learn quickly about a privious alien invasion of Earth where millions of people died , but one brave pilot flying a standard military fighter jet defeated an entire alien force . Now , the aliens are expected to return and , this time , be successful , unless a young child ( they have better intuition and responses -- apparently from playing video games ) is trained to lead unspecified forces against the aliens . Most of the movie involves us watching the training that occurs with a group of children and the type of exercises they go through to supposedly be prepared for a major alien attack is absolutely ridiculous and consists mainly of the children floating around a zero-gravity room and firing stun guns at other recruits . The whole story is asnine and Harrison Ford 's performance is pure overacting -- but it 's not his fault because the script is shallow . Probably the most uncompelling sci-fi movie I 've ever seen .	-1
The movie went down hill as soon as it become apparent it was a children 's movie . Where in the world the writers thought that children would become an elite fighting force is beyond belief . I kept thinking these were 'child warriors ' and how could they be raised to hero status . Has no one heard of the tragedy in Africa ! The only reason I rented this movie was that I thought Harrison Ford would not be associated with a pitiful , moronic , unrealistic piece of garbage.The only audience that would like this are pubescent children . I still ca n't believe the rating it got .	-1
First let me say I have not read the books . I wanted to care I really did . Most of this movie is the kids training and making their way through the program while making bonds and fighting bullies etc . Over half way through I realized I did n't care what was happening or who the characters were.For a sci-fi action film it was terribly slow , drawn out and boring . Definitely not what the previews showed	-1
I went to the movie theater to watch ender 's game with my 6 years old son , 7 and years old nephews.I did not see any of them enjoy the movie ; I had to explain what was going on during the movie.I also read the book , and probably if I had not I would had found the movie boring and would not understand or agree with Ender 's actions.My son thought Ender was a bad person ... so I had to explain what was going on.None of them found him a leader or cheered for him to win the fights he was in during the movie.There were lots of good actors , but the screenplay was not intense or lacked the power that the book had . I remember that I felt lots of emotions when I read the book , I did not feel the same or near it during the movie.I hope they find inspiration to remake this movie some day with a different screenplay . Or maybe a good animation .	-1
As a huge fan of the book , the movie was a big disappointment . The character development was lacking and the acting was just ok . Overall it got 2 stars because the graphics were good . Sad . What an amazing book .	-1
The ending was horrible ! It was like ... oh well , we have no idea how to end this so let 's have him save the race he just destroyed ... ugh . The rest was pretty good , but be prepared for a big wamp wamp waaaahhhh at the end !	-1
Wow , Why are there warnings for mature content movies but none for immature content ? As thrilling as watching sap drip .	-1
I went to this movie in the theater never reading the book , or even knowing there was a book . I have to admit , I do n't get what people like about this movie . The story line , the plot , the characters , etc . were all boring , slow developing , and I could n't connect with any of them.Overall , the movie was slow , uninteresting , boring , the story line was disconnected and made no sense , and just when it felt like the movie was ( sort of ) beginning , it ended . I simply ca n't recommend this movie and feel giving it 1 star is being generous .	-1
This is around as compelling as a bad after school tv movie . Boring , predictable and a waste of Harrison Ford . The teen cast is ludicrous . What a joke .	-1
If they would have just annihilated aliens and danced on their dead corpses , this would have been an entertaining movie . Trying to make the audience feel bad for rooting for the death of the aliens is absurd and obvious in intention .	-1
Sorry , having grown up on sci-fi movies I expect them to be a lot better these days . This one is not , unless that is if you are 10 years old . Even then pretty corny .	-1
I did n't read the book , so I ca n't compare , but terribly weak concept . Children are the innate natural battle strategists that will save us ? ! ? Lots of acting talent wasted on a weak premise .	-1
This seems to be one of those movies that you think is pure sci-fi then turns out to be a & # 34 ; political message & # 34 ; movie . The basic premise was difficult to overlook ( that kids would be the smartest at warfare ) . The action and dialog left a lot to be desired in terms of a realistic plot but ignored some of the cliches in the hope that the end would be worth it . The ending though is what changed the movie from a 3 to a 1 , it was ludicrous to me . If you are a purist sci-fi fan then I suggest researching this movie before watching it . If you like & # 34 ; message & # 34 ; movies then you might like this one . I watch movies for entertainment not for political philosophies or political messages .	-1
i ca n't say enough bad things about the lack of creativity and the overall & # 34 ; suk & # 34 ; factor of this movie - took some great science fiction books and converted them into this high budget crap ...	-1
Ridiculous plot , poorly acted . Why would any actor risk his or her reputation on this childish movie ? What were the performers thinking ? Money ? Whose ?	-1
At the end of this , I felt like sending a small check to Harrision Ford with a note saying & # 34 ; You obviously need this money more than I do. & # 34 ; I do n't understand how he could have read the script and thought that this would be a good career move . The story 's premise is laughable ( only children are able to process information fast enough to defeat the aliens ? ? ) . The poor young actor playing the lead seems unable to grasp the directors vision ( if there was one ) , and plays the whole movie like a grimly determined 40-year-old in a 14-year-old 's body . Harrison Ford seems like he 's in some other movie , and Ben Kingsley ... well , all I can say is he would have wept the night he won the Oscar if he could 've looked into the future to see himself flailing around in this dreck . I gave it two stars rather than one because 1 ) it 's benign in that it contains no offensive material , and 2 ) the special effects were OK. Do n't waste your money ; spend it on something useful like an enema or a root canal .	-1
Had to watch in two settings . Had to take a break because it made me sick it was so bad . A video game without thumbs . The movie makers sure have lost their touch . Waste of time , waste of film , waste of money .	-1
Other reviewers are right : the camera work gets mighty jerky at time . I think this tends more towards Hollywood 's version of political correctness ( depict the Somailians as human beings with their own set of troubles ) rather than any genuinely authentic attempt to make the plight of Somailians clear and understandable to viewers . It smacked a little bit of a & # 34 ; white man 's burden & # 34 ; kind of perspective that made me feel particularly uncomfortable.I did n't even watch it to the end .	-1
That 3 waifer-thin men withOUT armaments could hi-jack and take over an entire container vessel filled with a hundred sailors is preposterous . [ And , not for nothin ' , , but if it IS a true story , ,then it 's certainly no good plot to base a movie on . ]	-1
Full of jerky camera by Paul Greengrass who did the same thing on & # 34 ; Bourne & # 34 ; movies.Trying to be Hip again ... Unfortunately all the frenetic camera work does n't hide the weakness of the movie but gives you onlya terrible headache.This movie doesn & # 8217 ; t go beyond action movie conventions and the story is totally inaccurate.Captain Philips was no hero , but a vainglorious idiot whose arrogance led to the hijacking.Why this movie was made is beyond me or yes of course ! ! ... ..money ... money ... .money ...	-1
If my wife was as ugly as Captain Flip-Flop 's , I 'd go to sea for 6 months too . Was Meg Ryan busy that day ? I 'm sorry , aside from the cool Navy Seal stuff at the end , this was the most boring movie in history . The pirates were more sympathetic and interesting than anyone on the ship . I was cheering for them , if you want to know the truth.Why does the Academy love to give awards to multi-millionaire actors pretending to be retarded ? Why ? I want an answer , dammit ! Imagine Bogart or Robert Mitchum or William Holden in this role . Would they be as limp as Tom Hanks ? I wanted to rush up on the screen and lend him a walker.Or even go cross-grain a bit and cast Mickey Rourke channeling Bogart . make the guy INTERESTING.Why do n't they make movies with actual male leads anymore ? Do we have ANYONE , aside from Russell Crowe , who is close to being an actual MALE ? Sorry , I just watched Magnificent Seven the other night , which has LOTS of actual men . Looking at the current crop of actors is just sad . Matt Damon ? George Clooney ? Christian Bale ? Are you freaking serious ? ( though to be fair , Mathew McConaghey ( sp ) is turning into an interesting actor ) There was ONE hilarious scene , though I do n't think it was intentional . When Captain Philips logged on to his computer to e-mail his wife , I was waiting for the screen to come up `` You 've Got Mail '' . Now THAT would have been funny.One reviewer mentioned the director had worked with Matt Damon on two Jason Bourne movies . Let me make this clear . Matt Damon as an action hero is to Jason Statham like Budweiser is to a McCallan 18 year old . Damon can be interesting in intellectual roles , but action ? It is to laugh.Save your money and your time and screen The Wild Bunch or Once Upon A Time in The West and see how it 's done .	-1
Because this ship and others could n't institute the simple policy to arm their crew to properly protect themselves from small , rag tag bands of pirates like these , we the taxpayers footed the bill ( probably in the millions ) to rescue Captain Phillips . Something is *very* wrong with this picture . As for the movie itself , I 'm puzzled why Tom Hanks would get a best actor nomination . He was good but really , best actor of all the movies released in 2013 ? Maybe not . The movie was borderline boring and character development seemed a little shallow too . Glad I got it for free from Redbox .	-1
While the movie is well-made , it 's boring in quite a few parts . Most importantly , it is not factual by any stretch . It glorifies a captain that multitudes are claiming was by no means a hero . If you value the truth in the matter , just go online and read the articles about this captain , his recklessness , and the lawsuits popping up over the kidnapping . If you just want to see Tom Hanks ' incredible performance , go for it. Can not endorse a series of lies and a possible dope being glorified . Captain Phillips ' ACTUAL acts which CAUSED the kidnapping are more interesting than this movie .	-1
After having watched the first movie I thought to give this one a go , wanting to see where the story would take me . I have not read the books.I was very disappointed with this movie . The first movie was about his discovery that he was the son of Poseidon , and was all about his character development where predictably at the end of the movie he came into his full power to defeat the anti-hero and save the day . Predictable , yet somewhat original with great special effects and likable characters.This movie however , contained many elements torn directly from the Illiad ( The Odessy ) . The four winds contained in a thermos instead of a wine-bladder , yet used for the exact same purpose , to propel a ship ( which would not have been necessary since there were not 1 but 2 sons of Poseidon on said boat , both with power over water ) . This movie was riddled with face-palm moments where I think & # 34 ; What 's his problem , he 's surrounded by water ! ! ! & # 34 ; . And when he does use the water to his advantage , it seems he uses it in the most ineffective , pointless manner possible.I felt like this movie had taken all of the character development back to even before the first movie . It was all about his insecurity , where by the end of the first movie he had developed a total self-confidence and self-control . Annabel also seemed to take a backseat from the over-confident , dominant , stubborn warrior princess to Hermione from Hogwarts . The new character additions were so annoying with the bullying of the now down-and-out Percy that I thought he was going to contemplate suicide.As such , I give it thumbs up for special effects and fight sequences ( although in spots the fighting was awkward and stiff ) . Zombies added another star . Just for showing up . The rest was so/so .	-1
The classic , overused nail gun nonsense . This is a great test of how dumb a movie is : if they fire a nail gun at a distance , which is not possible , since something has to press against the tip before it will fire , you know the writers/director make no effort to create believable or plausible situations . Yes , it 's a horror movie and thus not possible by its very nature , but that does not mean there should n't be basic realism in the character 's behavior and in the things they do within the fiction . There is no attention to detail here , and no effort is made to at least avoid some of the most overused and tired Hollywood formulas .	-1
Evil Dead original is a classic , Evil Dead 2 is a must see , Army of Darkness is worth seeing , Evil Dead remake sucks ! Evil Dead remake is all gore and a confusing story . The group who went to the cabin had no idea what 's going on , even after the one girl gets possessed they still were not convince . Evil Dead 1,2,3 had a story that a person can understand , this movie story was going one way then another way and nowhere . Then they had this one girl who was just in the movie for no reason , she did n't say anything for a long while and she cuts her arm off . The one girl gets possessed then dies and she 's ok to fight off the other demons . I 'll say this the movie did had some good gore , but I still could n't get into it , it 's time for Bruce and San too retire from horror .	-1
All I 'm wondering is why raimi and the guys chose to produce this screenplay . It 's a movie that is similar to the original , but so are another 100 movies that have been made since the original appeared 30 years ago . A nail gun ? The old machete thru the wall trick ? Witchcraft ? I guess the man who kills his daughter in the best part of the film is supposed to be the professor whose recording is played in the original that awakens the demons even though you never find out exactly who he or the rednecks are . Whats with the dead cats ? I hate to say it but the make up effects in this version did n't even come close to the originals low budget creations which were actually disturbing to see.Hopefully they 'll get somebody else to write Evil Dead 2 .	-1
It used to be in Hollywood , aspiring film makers could break into the scene by making a low-budget noir thriller ( see Blood Simple ) or horror film ( see Night of the Living Dead ) . Sam Raimi and his friends got into the business by making The Evil Dead , a low-budget horror movie famous ( or infamous ) for pushing the boundaries . The movie is pretty raw . The story is fairly basic -- five 18-to-25 year-olds go to a cabin in the woods where they plan to have a lot of fun but unleash a demon who starts possessing and killing them one by one . The special effects were the best they could do on a low budget and work for the most part . The violence and gore and scares are so extreme that they sometimes become comic . Bruce Campbell 's over the top performance as Ash begins his amazing career . The movie became a cult hit and was also banned in Britain during the video nasties scare of the 1980s.Fast forward 30 years . A high-budget ( comparatively speaking ) remake is made with the backing of the original film 's producers . The story is mostly the same , except that the five young people come to the cabin to help one of them kick her drug addiction ( which helps explain why they do n't run away immediately when she tells them about the crazy evil things happening to her ) . The special effects are top-notch , to the fault of being too realistic . The violence and gore and scares are extreme but do n't cross the line into comedy . Jane Levy 's solid performance as going-cold-turkey Mia carries the viewer through the excruciating horror . The movie , while not a big hit , performed well enough at the box office to get a sequel greenlit.This movie has a lot of visual and audio references to the first film ( and its sequels ) , which is to be expected , but has nothing iconic of its own to offer . I liked the set-up which makes their reluctance to leave more plausible , though both this film and the earlier one show that escape is impossible regardless of the characters ' decisions . So the set up is a welcome but not necessary addition . The change in tone , losing the humor and the over-the-top rawness , is a big problem . Without the humor to buoy up the viewer , the gore gets too grim and unbearable . The realistic depiction of the gore does n't help . When Bruce Campbell cuts his evil hand off in Evil Dead II , the filmmakers play up the ridiculousness of what 's happening ( at the end the hand goes scurrying away like Thing from The Addams Family ) . A similar scene in this film has a woman ( not Mia ) chopping most of her arm off with an electric kitchen knife , but it 's just an unpleasantly realistic-looking experience -- gore for its own sake , which is repulsive in every possible sense . Mia 's plight is pitiable but truly unpleasant . Perhaps there 's heroism in her survival to the end but watching the movie is more like a forced march than a triumphant arrival . The film has almost nothing to offer but a lot of unpleasantness .	-1
Seemingly an excuse to deep into fanboys pockets and attempt to connect with new fans of gore , this film was senseless and added nothing new to the franchise . Fan boys eat crow .	-1
Evil Dead returns to its horror roots . The remake suffers from the lack of Raimi or Campbell 's involvement . They are associated with this film but their personal stamp of approval does n't seem to be on it . Raimi 's influence does n't show up and Campbell appears in the end credits . It 's almost as if they were hired solely to promote the film . The good news is that it is very gory . The bad news is that they do n't take it to the next level . This is not the cabin in the woods I was expecting . The Evil Dead was legendary as a horror film . I can still connect with the original or sequel ( you do n't see that camera work everyday ) . It 's so much fun and scared the wits out of people in the 1980s ( it was the # 1 movie rented in more than one country for at least a year ) . It revolutionized the demonic POV shots that grab you . The remake is fairly loyal to the original storyline . It unfolds almost exactly the same way with different camera work and actors . Some of the best elements of the original are here ( e.g . the perverted pencil and basement zombie ) but they just seem inserted and not crucial to the plot.Ultimately the remake does n't offer more story or character development and is much less memorable . It could have been amazing with Raimi 's involvement . After all , he made some awesome movies on a low-budget and then became a big success in Hollywood so he has learned so much since the 1980s . Yet he handed the directorial reins over to Fede Alvarez . The teens show up in an isolated cabin before the dead come to life . My main complaints are the acting , props , story and CGI . The cast is mostly forgettable . The acting featured one atrocious scene that reminded me of The Ring . This actress in a blue screen was whispering while surrounded by zombies with the music blaring full-blast . The scene either did n't support her , she was in the wrong movie or she simply lacked direction . The prop for the Necronomicon ( Book of the Dead ) was rather lame . I 'm not sure many demonologists use red magic markers to write in an ancient , priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead . The CGI hollows out this movie to the point where so much is happening that you ca n't connect with the characters or action . This Blu-ray has about 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary ( Director Fede Alvarez , co-writer Rodo Sayagues , Jane Levy , Lou Taylor Pucci , Jessica Lucas ) . That is fairly light treatment for such an iconic horror franchise . I must admit the Blu-ray picture quality is good and the audio is very good . I would be interested in purchasing an Evil Dead 1-4 box set on Blu-ray . Evil Dead fans deserve the deluxe treatment !	-1
I should say that the original movie is one of my all time favorite movies ; it 's original , groundbreaking , funny , and entetaining on just about every level , it 's the kind of movie that each time I see it , and I 've seen it many times , it leaves me grinning because of it 's uniqeness and cleverness . And knowing it was made on a shoe string budget by a bunch of amateurs is just icing on the cake . So while I did n't expect the remake to be as good as the orginal , I still had high hopes . Needless to say those hopes were dashed against the rocks into a bloody pulp . The remake is lifeless , humorless , predictable , and not in the least bit fun . I was n't grinnimg while watching the movie , I was shaking my head in dismay . Oh it 's gory alright , and the blueray picture quality is very nice , but that my friends is all it has going for it . At no time does it draw you in , or connect you to any of the characters , and you certainly do n't find yourself cheering for any of them like Bruce Campbell in the original . The story simply plods alomg from one gory scene to the next , leaving one hoping that it will end mercifully sooner , rather than later . So I say stick with original or it 's great gory cousin Dead Alive , if you want to come away grinning , entertained , and a proud fan of the genre .	-1
The promotional material for this reboot stated , `` The most terrifying film you will ever experience . '' The hyperbole alone should have warned me trouble was ahead . If you 're a fan of the original , I ca n't see how this wo n't disappoint expectations . I realize that both films should be considered separate entities , but I 'm not sure how realistic that is when you 're a fan of the first version . The basic premise remains , but the gonzo film-making of the first is replaced with smooth , moneyed production that -- similar to many modern horror flicks -- asks audiences to suspend much too much disbelief . I 'm tired of the `` super hero '' everyman who can be beaten with a crowbar or shot senseless by a nail gun or have his/her hand amputated ... and still come back bouncy and defiant . In an effort to not give anything away , all I can say that if I were n't decided before the last two characters were left , I certainly was from that point onward . A ridiculous ending that neither satisfies nor chills . If you have n't seen Sam Raimi 's 1981 flick , you might enjoy this . For me , it was a definite case of lunch bag letdown .	-1
Add another to the long list of terrible remakes . The plot holes and inconsistencies make this impossible for me to watch . Early on , the girl Mia is chased through the woods by her possessed self ... If she has n't been possessed yet , how is her possessed self chasing her ? ? ? ? And that is just the beginning of the blatant and unbelievable inconsistencies that went into making this film . When the heroine needs some gas for the chainsaw she bangs on a shelf and , da , da ! a small water bottle full of gas falls into her hands . Like magic , very hokey magic . Who keeps gas in a water bottle , anyway ? ? ? These are just the tip of the iceberg , it 's like watching a bad cartoon . I pointed out all the mind-numbing inconsistencies in a post on my blog , and there are A LOT of them . I would have rated this 0 stars but Amazon wont let me .	-1
This movie was really a huge disappoint for me . After seeing the trailers with the obvious notion of `` Evil Dead '' being done with actual money ( let 's face it-the original is fun , the special effects were n't even good for it 's time ) , it looked good . I have no idea what anyone was thinking when they churned out this piece of garbage.For one thing , any evil dead knows about the mysterious evil monster that is in the woods at all times . It was creepy and errie . Here is reduced to lasting all about a few minutes and once it `` possesses '' the main girl , it never shows up again . Um , what ? Then they remove any potential humor from the film . Let 's face it-the entire Evil Dead franchise had a sense of humor , with total overuse of squirting blood , to crawling hands , etc . The morons playing the tape while one girl is like `` shut it off . '' They did n't even play a tape , this random guy thinks it 's a good idea to read English translations ? Um ... it would 've been better if this guy was a student in a Latin class and read it , but in English ? It 's like a film that cuts every corner to try to be different , only to turn out to be stale . The basement in this movie is so foul , way more than the original , and yet , it is horribly underused.The `` forest is alive and ready to do bad things '' scene is done we 'll , yet is also underwhelming . It 's kind of sad thinking they basically had to play with trees to get this to work in the original , and here there is obvious CGI.The original `` Evil Dead '' really had something going for it , even with the bad special effects . The particular ending scene where Bruce Campbell aka `` Ash '' undoes the curse and the demons break out of the people with the hands could 've really added some much needed pizazz to this film , but it 's absent.The movie also seems half-written for one direction and another direction , considering it can not even figure out whom the main character is . First it 's the girl , then it 's her boyfriend , but somehow the girl is saved ? I mean , why ? Just let everyone die who is cursed , the beginning of the film pretty much said that , yet the film does n't even follow through on it 's own story . It is poorly written on top of being bland.When there is gore , it works . Some of it is over-the-top . Might be the movies only real succession.This is a remake to avoid at all costs . Just go watch Evil Dead 2 if your itching to see another version of `` Evil Dead '' ( since it seems more like a more expensive remake than a sequel ) . I have watched a lot of remakes and not understood why there is so much hatred , yet people actually seem to like this one ? Really ? This is crap . It really is . If you want to see a film like this that actually works go watch `` Cabin In The Woods '' instead , it may not have the intense gore but it has the humor ...	-1
Much of what made the original 'Evil Dead ' seem so good was that it was one of the first horror films set in a cabin in the woods . But it had a lot more going for it . It was daring in it 's depiction of gore and violence for the time of it 's release . It was also atmospheric , and actually often pretty scary . There were weaknesses involved due to it 's incredibly low budget , but the film worked . It 's a classic . For me personally it did have one weakness , and that was the cheesy robotic demon voices . I saw the Evil Dead when it first hit theaters back in the early 80 's and loved it but thought the silly robot-like demon voices were stupid . Other than that the film was a truly great horror film . I also did a smirk and said 'Pfft '' when it happened in this version as well , as I shook my head left to right and laughed at the silly and hokey feel of it . It 's what I did n't like about 'Drag me to Hell ' as well- When that robot demon opens it 's mouth so many years later , once again.Evil Dead II on the other hand while sometimes being the equal of the first film , ended up delving into slapstick humor , and that ruined it for me . So I did not like the idea of turning what started off as moody solid and often terrifying horror into a some kind of silly comedy . That made no sense to me . It 's the same reason I disliked Army of Darkness even more . To me it was like taking the demonic Exorcist theme and mixing it with Jason and the Argonauts and adding in slapstick humor . I did not get it . So just saying ahead of time , I am not one of the followers of the series . I did not like any of the series but the first film . But yes , I did love the first Evil Dead movie ... .But what about this remake ? Well I had a lot of issues with it in all honesty . Firstly , at least the version I rented online does not contain a couple of scenes I noticed in the trailers . One being the girl chained in the cellar sticking her face out of the opening of the door and singing a creepy little number . I was waiting for that but it never came . Second issue is that of the trailer . It 's better than the movie is . If you see the trailer it leaves you expecting far more than the movie delivers . Another issue I had was the typical very familiar formula of young college aged kids stuck out in the woods . Nothing wrong with that , except here the treatment offers too many familiar elements and nothing what so ever that is refreshing or original . It feels like too many other horror films with a similar tagline and locations.Yet another issue is that when this remake follows the original Evil Dead it fails to outdo or even match the effectiveness of the same material done much better and with more style and substance in the original . It just does the job , but without really grabbing you at all . Yet another thing that bothered me is that there is every reason in the world to expect great things to happen . Location is typical but good , the sets look creepy enough , but none the less the atmosphere and tension seems rather lite to the touch . It 's just not very thick convincing or all that great.The gore comes in about half way through and there is a certain satisfying feeling about it , and it 's done very well . In fact it does n't particularly feel non-unique . It actually works pretty well . And then later on when the gore get 's deep and truly over the top it seems done intentionally , seemingly to squeeze a rather otherwise uneventful film for everything they could at the last minute . When the movie get 's extremely gory it really get 's very gory . And even die-hard gore fans should be satisfied with that aspect of the movie . But in the end I found my self flicking my wrist at the TV and blowing out a rather snoring annoyed exhale as I said under my breath `` Oh please ... . another crappy movie that promised much more that it delivered '' , while shaking my head left to right with a little lip music that soon followed.For what it is the movie turns out to be generally entertaining in a very non- rewarding typical way . The film also feels pretty typical of the usual horror movies of late . Could have been much better , and the over the top reviews and over zealous add campaigns did n't help . The film is not the match of the original , and it 's not even half as good . But if you love gore for the sake of gore the last half of the film should do the job . Otherwise I 'd skip on this one . It 's not all that scary , and pretty much the kind of thing we 've all seen too many times to even care to count any longer .	-1
I gave evil dead two stars because i love the beginning but the movie really dies after and looses me.The family issued in this movie is not interesting one bit and why would the brother bring his sister to the woods for her as some sort of rehab , thats why there are rehab places out there.This remake is more like a soap opera then a horror movie and i was bored out of my mind watching it.I love blood guts gore and i love the original and i do like some remakes hill have eyes was a great remake and hill have eyes two is also a good movie and way better then this boredom remake.Skip this crappy movie	-1
I admire any horror film that has the balls to put `` The Most terrifying film you will ever experience '' in large print on its poster . Talk about guts . That includes being scarier than The texas chainsaw massacre , the exorcist , psycho , alien , and even the original Evil Dead : which offered satisfying scares and launched the careers of the talented Sam Raimi and cult-favorite Bruce Campbell . Raimi ( who produced this reboot ) often said that if he had a bigger budget , the film would have been the scariest ever made . After seeing this new Dead , I 'm starting to question that viewpoint.Evil Dead comes armed with the special effects Raimi always dreamed of , and enough blood , limbs , and guts that no gore hound will leave thirsty . But there 's also something dry about this movie . There 's no personality . The original had all the gore , scares and laughs any h-fan could wish for , but what set it apart from other horror films was its charisma . This new `` Evil Dead '' has none of that . Bruce Campbell 's chin alone has more charm.After last year 's `` Cabin in the woods , '' I thought big-budget scary movies would have been more hesitant to using stock characters . Yet here they all are in one convenient movie : You have your ditzy blonde chick , your heroic jock type , the know-it-all dweeb , etc . The best character here is Mia ( Jane Levy ) , a drug addict who 's decided to go `` cold turkey . '' But even she is written as just another excuse to drive the plot along . The writers could 've made an inspired parallel between drug addiction and demonic possession here , but they seem more interested in giving pointless exposition . The original dead never bothered with such . It knew that telling the occupations for every character or why the demons were attacking wasnt necessary . Too bad this dead is the exact opposite , at every turn we have Eric ( the dweeb ) explaining in detail why the demons are possessing their friends . Is the fact that they 're demons not reason enough ? And did I mention these characters were stupid ? I mean really stupid . I 'm not saying that the characters from the original were geniuses or anything , but they are compared to these idiots : When Eric discovers the Book of the dead , he is told specifically by the book not to read a passage out loud . What does he do ? He not only reads the book out loud , he also scribbles in it with pencil . Who invited this guy ? Some horror fans will enjoy `` Evil Dead . '' The effects get the job done and , as another reviewer said , since there is n't a clear `` Ash '' we never know who 's going to live or die . The problem is I was never given a reason to care . The director focused so much on special effects that he forgot everything else that makes great horror films work : Slow build up , never show the monster in the first five minutes , likable characters , and most importantly , it should never be boring . 20 minutes into this film I felt disappointed , after 40 disinterested , and near the end the impossible happened . I was watching a girl screaming and running from a demon in a storm of raining blood , and I was bored.I never took the tag-line seriously , but now I wish the movie would 've borrowed some of its audacity.Pros : Special effects are well-done , a few jump scares.Cons : Script is weak , acting wooden , repetitive , stupid characters	-1
characters got ta be smarter . I know it 's part of the genre to make them idiots but just can not care about characters who appear in modern attire and act like 21st century people , but behave as if they 've never seen a horror film . movie does n't have to be tongue in cheek , but would be great if characters had an iota of self-preservation . as presented one wonders how any of them survived to adulthood . stupid characters are one feature horror film writers should work harder to avoid . one and a half stars mostly due to competent acting , and movie is well shot.P.S . Totally , and I mean 100 % unbelievable , that a group of 20 somethings , with obviously more than minimum resources , would go out into the woods to sleep in a decrepit shack , no matter what the reason . I could see this group going to a remote , nice cabin , but not to something that looks condemned , and without anyone complaining . And there 's electricity and running water ( how does that happen in a remote/abandoned cabin ) , clean rug on the floor ( who cleans the place ) . Set designer did not do the best job ; there should have been dust and grime everywhere ( there looked to be a handwritten diary with pristine pages , not even yellowed with age - maybe one of the characters brought it with them , maybe I just missed that ) . the writer missed a great opportunity to connect with the audience by not having characters discuss it ; I mean , having them being put to work and complaining would have worked , but no cobwebs , no mice ( in the middle of the forest ) , not believable . I know the lead was kicking the habit , not strong enough plot point or well enough presented in the story to have characters remain there . this group would have retired post-haste to the nearest Holiday Inn , drug habit or no drug habit ( and I know writer was pushing that they were there for the heroine , but he did n't craft his story well enough , should have had at least one character mutter something alluding to the sacrifice her friends were making by staying in such a dump ) . I could not get past the location , so that means I could n't connect at all with characters who made progressively dumber mistakes ( like looking at a demon book that clearly said do not read this ) . The whole film I rolled my eyes . I do n't think impatience and exasperation were the primary reactions the film makers were hoping for , but even with an open mind , that was the best I could do .	-1
Another brainless unnecessary remake filled with lame characters you do n't care about , convoluted plot , and god awful script.Throwing excessive blood and blah moments do not a horror movie make.Why would you bring a woman who nearly died in an drug overdose to a place far away from a hospital or trained doctors to prevent a relapse ? Why would you let her walk around in the woods in the rain by herself then act shocked when she steals the car and tries to flee acting erratically ? They simply took rehashed scenes from the original movie slapped it together in this mess of a movie . This was simply a remake made in the same moldas the Nightmare on Elm Street remake.Over the top gore , bad acting and stupid lines ruined this movie.Less is more . In original movie , it was just a bunch of kids heading to the cabins in the woods for a little r & r ; from civilization . They stumbleupon a terrible nightmare hidden in the woods . It had a good pace of creepiness . The movie runs its course of terror and bizarre horror.Not over the top bombastic crap that is more laughable than scary.There must be a list of cool movies that the idiots in Hollywood want to keep remaking and ruining.If you like a mindless gorefest with lame characters , this is for you.Sadly , they just do n't make horror movies like they used to .	-1
This movie was boring -- plodding at times.Morgan Freeman did his best to overcome a & # 34 ; cold caramel & # 34 ; plod through an ( at times ) confusing attempt to cameo Tom Cruise.The ending was the best part -- -for many reasons .	-1
I am not a Tom Cruise fan but I thought the trailer for Oblivion looked interesting . However , I was disappointed when it just seemed to be sandy land scenes and chasing/repairing drones . My seventeen year old son was even bored with it and we didnt watch all the movie . Amazon did not give you a chance to rent so I purchased it and am sorry I did . What a waste of money .	-1
Although this movie did take a turn I was not expecting , it was lacking a lot of detail . Not sure I would want to watch it again .	-1
All the elements of the plot you 've essentially seen before , including the smaltzy `` memories of human recreation '' that are injected in the movies in an attempt to give it humanity . All of this might be easier to bear , however , if it was n't for the ponderous filming that takes itself way to seriously for such run of the mill ideas . I heard they were going for that sort of `` old scifi movie '' feel . They forgot to make it interesting along the way .	-1
Folks , I enjoy Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman . I was pumped up to see this flick . Words can not describe how disappointed I became . Bad is hard to describe . Ugly is in the eyes of the beholder . This is bad and ugly .	-1
I really like Tom Cruise but , this movie sucks . I am sorry for purchasing it . I think Tom should think more carefully about his roles .	-1
I usually like a Tom Cruise movie but this movie is a boring scifi that drags on.I guess I 've just seen `` Man of Steel '' which is 10 times better so I expected Oblivion to be at the same level .	-1
Plot is rather primitive and movie is just boring more often than not . Tom Cruise is doing his thing which gets old . Both female leads are pretty bad as far as acting goes . If I paid two dollars for HD rental I would give 3 out of 5 .	-1
I got it ... but my wife fell asleep . Not well structured . Mediocre movie with great stars . Must have run out of money with the special effects .	-1
The trailers wee the best part of the movie.The plot was confusing ; the special effects were over the top.Not one of Tom 's shining moments .	-1
I ca n't view it even with the instructions I received by email . I want a refund . I do n't have the wherewithal to apply all instructions to correct my laptop .	-1
Did n't think much of this movie . Liked the acting , but it was a stereotypical , boring Hollywood rental . Do n't pay money for this one .	-1
My family was split regarding this movie . Some thought the movie was too slow and there were too many questions at the end . You might have to read the book before seeing the movie . The other side of family thought that the acting was excellent . They felt that it was thought provoking and promoted a great deal of discussion . I recommend that you proceed with an open-mind .	-1
Special affects are wonderful , but the storyline was very much like so many other movies ! Do n't buy it , just rent it .	-1
What a waste of talent . Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise , were so wasted in this movie . The script is just awful , so slow , I mean really slow , and when there was action it was predictable . Wish I could have gotten my money back .	-1
I was not impressed by this movie , I fought to stay awake through most of itI was at A loss as to what the plot was supposed to be , so I had to go online to find out , reading the DVD jacket did n't even help , I received this the same day as Olympus has fallen , which , is shaping up to be A good movie , but , that 's another review , all and all , Oblivion was A stinker , I was more impressed with the packaging	-1
The worst of the 3 Iron Mans . I have been a comic collector and enjoyed the other movies developed from comics . They completely killed the character of Mandarin from what he was in the comics . The placed more of the hero factor on Pepper . It seems that the Directors and screenwriters need to research the comics before trying to do another on of these . I was really disappointed !	-1
Slow , lack of action in the beginning it was just okay - not as good as the first two movies .	-1
Absolute trash . & # 34 ; Iron Man 3 & # 34 ; mocked The Mandarin character , did not have a solid story , and was extremely boring ( the few & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; scenes were towards the end of this pathetic movie ) . Since Drew Pearce wrote the story and this movie featured Guy Pearce as the main villain , I was expecting a worthy successor to the original , gold-standard & # 34 ; Iron Man & # 34 ; , but this movie was and is , as they say , an epic failure . Do n't waste your time and money watching this piece of trash .	-1
I was really disappointed in this film . I felt betrayed . Seeing them treat the Mandarin character as they did , and the extremis storyline was ruined . It felt as if this movie was just thrown together to have a vehicle for the next avenger film .	-1
Iron Man 1 and 2 , I think were much better . Lots of action , It would seem the writers were running out of ideas and started looking for a way to put away end Iron Man , witch they did - for now.Without spilling the plot , you just have to see it .	-1
This movie is decent at best , RDJ was obviously not wanting to do it.But the money was good and people would go to see it anyway.CG - 6/10Acting - 4/10Story - 7/10Action - 5/102 stars from me because this movie should have been a lotbetter .	-1
This film is utterly ridiculous . From the improbability of the science to the plot . Without an apparent source of fuel , the villains -- biological organisms -- in this farce can generate two thousand degrees of heat and direct it like a laser at targets . They can then reload faster than the flash on my camera and do it again ! AND , they can overheat , creating a nuclear-bomb-like blast . Where does this energy come from ? Robert Downey 's Tony Stark was brash but charming in the first installment but devolves into annoying by this version . Paltrow and Favreau are annoying as well . Oh , and the villains can outsmart the US government at every turn and hack worldwide communications . It 's a wonder our real-life enemies have n't done this so far . Spend your time and money on something more fulfilling , like watching snow fall .	-1
By far the worst Iron Man movie , I 've seen . The story line was predictableand the acting was notorious . The one line jokes were not funnyand the movie made Iron Man look like a weak hero . I only wastedfive bucks on this movie . However the biggest waste was the 2+hrsI spent watching this poor excuse of a movie . REAL BAD ! !	-1
I enjoyed both of the previous Iron man movies , but this one just lacked . It had a couple solid moments and Guy Pearce as well as Ben Kingsly were both nice addititons to the cast .	-1
movie really fell apart after Tony 's home did ( as seen in trailer ) it started out with good energy , cool tech , everything was tight ... . but then your jaw is going to drop at the quality of the movie.horrible one liners . scenarios that do n't make ANY sense.what a waste of great actors & Iron Man suits . ( which he was barely in ) they tried to break him down to just Tony but it failed hard.the trailer really sold you another movie.BUT HEY AT LEAST THE THOR2 TRAILER LOOKED GOOD !	-1
Iron Man is a genius who created a new type of technology and is responsible for supplying the military with firepower ( according to comics ) . This being said , the technology prowess of this film is below disappointing . In the first film you had the jericho , which blew up an entire mountain range . The technology that followed was far superior compared to some of the stuff we actually have . The preceding movie was about stolen technology , which is why it was understandable not to evolve the technology . However , this latest film is a laughable joke compared to the first two . After going through so many models , the suit attaches at command ? That 's it ? No special bombs , no special weapons , and a code that commands all of the suits to assemble as a team to fight an army but ca n't seriously fight ? There are so many disappointing aspects of this film that I wish I could get my time and money back from it .	-1
Like the title says , I 'm keeping this simple.If your only experience with Iron Man has been the movies , you will likely enjoy this movie . Not as much as the first and probably more than the second , but you 'll like it.However , if you are a fan of the character and are aware of the history of Iron Man , you will HATE the movie.In the first movie , I was willing to overlook the changes made for artistic license and to help make a decent movie and franchise . When the second movie came out , I was disturbed by the continued changes and poor choice of directions the movie took.But , this movie and especially the big `` twist '' had me wanting to throw my popcorn at the screen and leave the theater.Overall , this movie felt rushed , predictable and poorly written .	-1
I 'm tired of these trilogies ! The 1st Hangover was great . The 2nd was just a repeat and the 3rd had to end it ? There was nothing to complete because the 1st one told it all and the best !	-1
I do n't recommend this movie to any one who expects it to be like the original . It 's nothing about a hangover . sure their are funny parts but overall bad movie .	-1
Do n't buy this . I 'm REALLY bummed they made 2 and 3 after the original was SO hilarious . Do n't buy this or the second one if you 're thinking about it . I wo n't keep either sequel and neither should you unless you really like this more dark , gross out humor . What a waste of time and money .	-1
There are funny parts but the movie is just okay . Should have stopped at the first Hangover movie ( first one is the best ) .	-1
This is the worse movie of the 3 . Would just rent it instead of buying it if you really want to see it .	-1
i was fooled in believing the 3rd installment would be as good as the first an second ones , but i was really wrong . i only watched the movie all the way through , because i had rented it . the plot sucked , and the whole movie reeked !	-1
`` The Hangover Part III '' is such a joyless , unhappy excuse for a film , it almost defies description . Almost.The key difference between `` III '' and the first two installments is that there is never a single moment in the film when the three characters played by Bradley Cooper , Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis seem happy to be together . In the first two films , there was at least the possibility of a good time at the bachelor party each film begins with . This moment helps illustrate their friendship and gives us a reason to go on these harrowing journeys with them . Yes , things go horribly wrong , but in the beginning , they are happy and excited . In `` III '' , the reason for their trip is very different and they all seem to dread the very idea of the journey which does n't help the film get off to a good start.In `` III '' , Alan ( Galifianakis ) has not been taking his meds leading to even more erratic behavior than in the previous films . When his actions lead to a pretty irresponsible , unsettling event , his family decides to have an intervention and Phil ( Cooper ) , Stu ( Helms ) and Doug ( Justin Bartha ) agree to drive Alan to a rehab facility in Arizona . On the way , Marshall ( John Goodman ) , a gangster , has his men run the friends off the road . He takes Doug as a hostage and will return him if the other three find Chow ( Ken Jeung ) , who has just escaped from a Thai prison . Chow stole $ 20 million in gold bars from the gangster and he wants it back . They hit the road and travel from Arizona to Tijuana before finally ending up back in Vegas . Along the way , they get into dangerous situations , people get hurt and killed , animals die , all in the pursuit of finding the gold and returning it . These situations are n't inherently funny and even the cast and crew seem to realize this because everything is played straight , leading to a bad impression of an action film.Seriously , the only person who even seems to be attempting something funny is Galifianakis . He takes the man-child character he always plays to familiar places , places already explored with much more energy and vitality by John Candy , Jim Belushi , Chris Farley and others . This type of humor is , for me , best served in small doses . When the character and behavior are prevalent throughout the entire film , everything in the narrative seems dumb , just dumb , not smart-funny dumb . It is much harder to do smart-funny dumb , which is why we so seldom see it , and why so many comedies are completely forgettable.Cooper and Helms grimace and frown their way through the entire film . And they have a right to , because they are in one dangerous situation after another . Hopefully , the large sequel-sized paycheck each received made up for this unpleasant experience . But what about our unpleasant experience ? Who will pay us ? We have to pay to sit and watch this dreck . That seems backward somehow.I find it hard to believe that director Todd Phillips envisioned these films as a trilogy ; when the first one made so much money , the plans for II and III were born . The phenomenal success of the first led to a virtual copycat set in a different country . Now , with the `` Epic Conclusion '' , he changes the format of the film . Initially , this is a welcome idea - `` II '' was a hollow retread of the first film - but why make this film at all if you ca n't figure out a way to incorporate , in some way , the original idea ? Basically , the only connection between the three films is the characters . Everything in this film happens moving forward , so the initial shock of seeing an outrageous moment and then learning about the circumstances leading up to it is gone . I suppose Alan killing a giraffe and the aftermath of this situation is meant to stand in for the bachelor party scene , but it is simply shocking and grimace-inducing . It just is n't funny.Phillips is a mixed bag as a director . He 's done some good films ( `` Old School '' , `` The Hangover '' ) but most of his films are jaw-droppingly bad.The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film ; the boys visit Heather Graham 's character at her new home . Her former hooker is now leading a respectable life with a new husband . The inclusion of this scene is just bizarre . It really is n't needed which leads to the question `` why is it included ? '' To give all of Heather Graham 's fans another look ? Does she even have fans anymore ? So the scene is not only unnecessary but boring.How bad does a movie have to be when even Melissa McCarthy is n't funny ? McCarthy pops up in a cameo . This is the first time I have not laughed at one of her cameos or performances . Her character is simply mean which is supposed to be a mirror image of Alan 's treatment of others , but that does n't work either . A mirror image of something that does n't work is also something that does n't work.There are a number of incidents involving animals . In each , the animal is drugged , harmed or killed . Is this supposed to be funny ? I think it is sort of sad . Everytime an animal pops up , something happens to them . In the other two films , animals make appearances and the level of harm played out on these creatures throughout the series seems gratuitous and out of proportion . Were the animals actually harmed during the filmmaking ? No . But depicting these moments as ` comedy ' just seems wrong . Very wrong.When the story finally gets to Vegas , the three men regard the opportunity to revisit the iconic city with palpable dread . They eventually learn that Chow is holed up in a penthouse at Caesar 's Palace . Alan refers to the resort as a ` hell-hole ' . When they finally make it to the hotel , there is an extended sequence featuring acrobatics from the penthouse . My question is : Did Las Vegas and Caesar 's Palace partner with the producers to make this film ? Neither is painted in a very positive light . If you had your product featured in a film and someone referred to it as a ` hell-hole ' would you be happy ? It might very well seem like an awful place to the characters , but none of this is remotely funny and seems like a stupid waste of time.And on that note , I do n't want to waste any more of our time on a movie that is essentially a complete waste of time .	-1
I can & # 8217 ; t believe someone finically backed this movie . Even more outrageous is when the movie was all edited and all the finishing touches were complete , someone had to have said , & # 8217 ; ok , we & # 8217 ; re done . Off to the theaters ! & # 8221 ; this guy needs to be removed from society . Etrememly predictable and after watching it , i can & # 8217 ; t really figure out if anything actually happened or if these guys just drove around and Glaifikonikis made stupid comments , Vegas & # 8230 ; .happy ending & # 8230 ; the end . Seriously ? Refund Please !	-1
I do n't think the movie was great . It was not as exciting as the last five . I guess it 's because it 's to many sequel . And casts are keep dying off . It was okay .	-1
Wow ... . I just received my Fast & Furious 6 and the Blu-ray would not play ... . Universal Studios Logo and then the screen goes black ... . why ? This has never ever happened to me I did a system update and still No Picture Why ? I have all five ( 5 ) Fast And Furious in Blu-ray and all played now this ... . WHY ?	-1
& # 34 ; You wan na catch wolves , you need wolves. & # 34 ; After their heist made the gang all rich they have all settled in nicely to normal life but not in the US . When Hobbs ( Johnson ) needs a way to catch a criminal mastermind there is only one call he makes . Dom ( Diesel ) and Brian ( Walker ) get the crew together again but this time they are working with the law . This is a movie that does n't really need much said about it to convince you to watch or not watch . Since it is the 6th in the series you have either kept up or not . That said ... I have seen all of them and only really liked the 5th one because it was more of a heist movie then & # 34 ; I have car , I go fast. & # 34 ; I know what your thinking ... if you do n't like it do n't watch , on the other hand I ca n't really talk about it if I do n't watch them . This one was , how do I put this ... not good . The plot seemed OK , help catch the bad guy and you can go home . The problem is that this seemed to be that last thing on the movies mind . Five minutes after they agree to catch him they find him , and let him go . Then Dom and Hobbs meet him face to face , and let him go . The only way to catch this guy is only during long car chase after long car chase . The stunts and chases got more and more absurd to the point of being laughable . ***SPOILER*** Taking down a TANK with a smashed up Mustang to taking down a PLANE with a car that looked like a GEO Tracker on a runway that must have been 60 miles long . I mean seriously ! ***SPOILER OVER*** There are also so many people jumping onto moving cars I lost count . I will again say I am not a fan of this series ... and this movie is an example of why . Overall , fans of the series will like it , I struggle to find anything good to say ... even the dialog is bad . I give it a C .	-1
I been a big sci-fI person all my life , but not sure that high tech makes a movie any more , for one thing Will Smith should stay from writing stories or at least get a book on it . It got more than one star because I sit though the entire movie . But I did look it up on my iPad - but I had to be fair and see it all before I wrote this.Well actually thought of not even watching , when I saw preview for `` White House Down '' Well Sony may make good TV 's but they need to go back to school in making movies .	-1
This film would probably work well as a book , or perhaps a graphic novel ... .or a lunchbox ... or a meatloaf . Essentially , it would work better as anything apart from the film it ended up being . The characters had an interesting sort of hybrid accent conglomerating elements from around the world , giving the distant future a cool polyglot effect , and Will Smith did well as a militaristic , absentee father , with Jaden playing the part of a forsaken son trying to prove himself to his father nearly without flaw . However , the story could have been told in its entirety within about 5 minutes , with very little dialogue , and much of that dialogue awkward and phoned in , in terms of writing . The second star I gave it was for the visuals . Much of the aesthetic is downright breathtaking , or at least would be were it not unabashed , ten-yards-behind-cutting-edge CGI . All told , this film is summed up ideally by the trailer : computer-generated monsters ( totaling 5 species , 4 of which are shown therein ) and Will and Jaden Smith playing themselves on a lean weekend .	-1
A very poor film for me . Beautifully shot but with a terrible dialogue and paper-thin plot.Will Smith plays it straight , supported by his son too , and I really thought with Will 's experience it could turn out to be something great but , really , it was n't even a great waste of time .	-1
Apparently in the future we no longer have to eat , drink , defecate or urinate . All you will need is a `` smart suit '' to keep you going , unless of course the temperature drops below zero . But , why quibble with such details , M. Night Shyamalan and Will Smith seemed to turn this entire project over to young Jaden . It 's a coming out party essentially , a whimsical blend of the sci-fi films Jaden apparently likes , plus a nod to Moby-Dick , which it seems he had to read in school.The story could have just as easily been set in Alaska or the High Sierra with father and son on a camping trip , menaced by an over-sized grizzly bear . Father and son could have communicated with walkie-talkies or mobile phones as the son had to seek help on his own due to his father being too weak to move . Instead , we get a kind of post-apocalyptic earth that appears to be a throwback to an earlier Cenozoic era with over-sized condors , saber-toothed lions and simian troops.There is kind of a nice moral to the movie about conquering fear . I suppose a big white whale seemed like a good analogy to the over-sized insect known as Ursa in this film , although that was n't what Moby-Dick was about . You knew what was coming long before it happened . There was surprising no tension in this film . The only thing mildly disconcerting were the flashbacks . There certainly is n't any far-reaching philosophical narrative as there was in Moby-Dick , just your standard survival tale set on Earth some 1000 years into the future long after human kind ceased to be part of the picture .	-1
Boring , no depth . Watched young man run through pretty scenery with occasional predictable CG creatures attacking him . Will Smith got to do a film with his kiddo . That 's great , but in the end it is just a family film for the Smiths	-1
Boring -REALLY boring . I could n't find one thing I liked about this movie-not one thing ! WARNING ! DO NOT RENT , BUY , OR BOTHER TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! !	-1
I am not reviewing the DVD at all , I just wasted $ 10.50 watching this mess . Not the directors fault , the acting is SHAMEFUL . I guess if you have a rich father this is a vanity project : (	-1
I 'm a pretty easy going person and I approached this movie not expecting too much . I 'll just go straight to the critiques . For those that have n't watched the movie , I 'll try to censor the spoilers : Pros : - A lot of people felt Jaden Smith 's acting to be not so good , but I thought most of the scenes that he was in was okay ( in other words ... I was expecting it , especially after seeing the Karate Kid which I did n't like either ) . I see some improvement in his acting and I too wish he would one day become as talented as his father . I 'm a Will Smith fan and I mainly watched this movie for Will Smith but I was willing to give his son a chance . I understand that Will Smith is trying hard to give his son a strong chance in the acting career , he 's doing everything a father can do to give his kids the leverage that they need . He loves his family and he 's doing what he can and I admire that . Being a bystander , sometimes we are quick to criticize him of stuff like nepotism but he 's a father that 's a famous actor , what did you expect ? Any father would probably do the same.- I 'm not yet much of a Jaden Smith fan , but seeing him in this movie definitely made me think of Will Smith and there were scenes where I did feel that charismatic presence coming from his son . I do n't think his son will be as fun to watch as his father but I hope he proves me wrong.Cons : - I 'm going to flat out and say I blame this film 's mediocrity not on Jaden Smith but on M. Night Shyamalan . I think most of M. Night 's movies are overrated.- The narration with Jaden Smith in the beginning did n't feel right . His voice moves me AWAY from the movie.- The trailer shows pretty much all the action scenes . Many times I feel like the person that made the trailer should be the person that makes the movies , it 's just so much more exciting . The better the trailer and/or the more action scenes they show in the trailer , the more you expect the film to be not so great . They 're desperate for advertisement that they 're basically throwing everything good about the movie into the trailer to hype up the potential moviegoers.- The planet that they land on , do n't expect a world you have n't seen before , or creative interesting sci fi creatures . Eagles , lions , apes , even the plant life . Only the Ursa is different from the rest and even they 're not that creative ( they look like what you see in Lord of the Ring ) . This was one big reason why I was disappointed . I was expecting a fantasy world , but pretty much everything that 's seen in the trailer is everything you 'll see in the movie pretty much.- SPOILER ALERT thereisascenewhereheisalmostfrozenaftertheraftscene . And he gets saved by an eagle that is smart enough to drag him into a hole and then cover up the hole with foliage AND THEN spread itself out over the spot in order to keep Kitai ( Jadan ) alive ? Yeah F right haha ... why would the eagle also remain on the ground and not fly off with Kitai instead ? - Alright we just have to bring up the Ursas . The blind creatures that can smell human pheromones when humans are scared . The movie does n't really explain what made them such a threat to human kind . They 're just introduced as large creatures that smell human fear and go after them , but they do n't look special or anything . Cypher Raige ( Will Smith ) took out one with one swipe to the throat , they did n't seem special . The movie just does n't elaborate on it . Also , if they can smell human fear that comes off our bodies , what about people in another room or people in suits that are airtight ? I 'm just watching the movie and it makes no sense as to why they 're so fearful . Giant monsters ... got it.- Will Smith 's part is lacking in this movie , you can tell he tries to leave the significant parts to his son . Will Smith 's acting is also toned down , not sure exactly why but it did n't capture me like it usually does ( or maybe I just was n't in the mood or something ) .There are other complaints but I 'll leave it here , the main ones are covered I believe . The story is slow , the acting kept me away from being absorbed into the movie , and the planet that they crash landed and how boring it was down there left me very unsatisfied . I was surprised that it was a 130 million dollar movie .	-1
It was an okay story , with okay acting from what should have been super star actors with high-power presence . But it was n't that way to me . Being a real father-and-son team should have come across on the screen , but I kept getting the feeling that neither was really into their roles . Or , maybe that 's what they wanted ? Anyway I just did not think this movie was very good overall .	-1
An absolutely dreadful attempt at movie making . I can not recall a worse sci-fi movie . Perhaps useful as an inspirational toolfor very young and not very bright peoole .	-1
I hound the plot non-existent . The photography and/or special effects were not believable . No character development really hurt this movie . When there are only two characters , the audience should care about those characters . What I did get from the little we know is that I did not like the characters , the relationship between the father and his son . Was this movie meant to be a farce ?	-1
Was not the movie I expected from Will Smith . He barely was in it . And his kid acted like a spoiled brat , probably is that way in real life .	-1
Ok , so let 's showcase your No-Talent Kid in a movie and sleep through it soyou HAVE TO WATCH THE KID ! This thing was a joke !	-1
It 's very boring , good concept but did not deliver . Do n't waste your hard earned money on this one it 's a dud & # 128564 ;	-1
I am a big sci-fi fan , and often , I will end up liking a science fiction movie that the critics and other audience members rated very low . This movie is not one of them . The plot is too predictable , and Jaden Smith 's acting just is n't mature enough to carry a movie either on his own or half-way with his awesome dad . The special effects were OK , but nothing special by today 's standards . I would not recommend paying blue-ray or even dvd prices for this movie -- not even if it 's in the bargain bin . If you 're curious about it , just wait 'til it comes out on free TV or on your streaming video subscription ( e.g. , Amazon Prime ) if you have one .	-1
Not really what I expected..Not boring but kind of lack luster . Not what you would expect from Will . Just my opinion	-1
Sorriest will smith movie I 've ever seen . He was barely in it and his son was stiff and unimpressive . He was good in karate kid but he stunk in this . I think this is one if those movies where they figure they 'll make enough money just on the stars drawing power so they do n't put too much effort in making it good .	-1
I streamed this in last night via VuDu . After 15 minutes I shut it off and went and read until about midnight . At this time I powered the movie back up , but as I was watching it I found myself glancing over to the left to watch Rambo on one of my other TVs even though I had the volume on mute on that one . I have 3 TVs mounted in my bedroom : ) Anyhow , I watched the whole movie so it would n't be a waste of money . Will Smith 's character was such an SOB I hated him right off the bat . And as far as Will 's son goes , I have n't found a single thing I like about him . There is nothing about him that stands out more than any other actor . As far as After Earth goes , nothing special about the movie at all . The visuals were kinda lack-luster , the story was unoriginal , and the characters were pretty much unimpressive , if not outright annoying .	-1
While the effects in this movie are ok and the two seconds of supporting cast is pretty good , the movie as a whole is a melodramatic flop . Jaden is always on the verge of crying . Will Smith is trying ( badly ) to act stoic and emotionless all the time . There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters . A lot of Jaden 's dialogue is undecipherable.A movie should not require effort to watch.The pace of the film is like glue slipping down a wall : slow and awkward . Characters are not developed . The aliens are not developed . The state of society in the future is not explained . Basically , this is one of those films that asks you to care for no reason . Like a B movie , it gives you some action and bad acting and expects you to walk away satisfied.How did this get made ? It is the cream of the crap.AVOID AT ALL COSTS . You have been warned .	-1
I like all of the actors involved in the project but the film was very disjointed . I was warned away from seeing in the theatre , Superman is not a dark character like Batman and I felt like they were making him a bit too existential .	-1
This movie was boring at best . So completely disappointed . I am just happy we did not go to the theater and pay thirty bucks to see it . I got half way though the movie and gave up . My husband finished watching it but said it was painful to do .	-1
Man of Steel is , technically , the first movie reboot of the Superman mythos since 1978 's Superman : The Movie . Produced by the Christopher Nolan , written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder ( 300 , Watchmen ) , it 's an attempt to bring the moral ambiguity and 'grittiness ' of Nolan and Goyer 's Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films to the Superman franchise , and set up a new shared universe of films based on DC comics characters.Things start promisingly with a visit to Krypton , depicted as something between Avatar ( the Cameron movie ) and Dune , with a mixture of ultra-advanced technology and feuding nobles . Russell Crowe plays Jor-El , here depicted as a scientist trying to save his world from imminent destruction but , in typical Russell Crowe style , is also capable of laying waste to entire platoons of soldiers single-handedly . Crow runs afoul of Michael Shannon 's General Zod during a coup but still manages to blast his infant son ( eventually a capable and reasonably good Henry Cavill ) into space before the planet explodes . Zod and his cohorts are sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone , which works out about as well as it ever does.The infant Kal-El arrives on Earth and is found and raised by Kent family near Smallville , Kansas . Kal-El aka Clark 's crazy powers and abilities soon manifest and his human parents ( ably played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane ) are soon spending their time running around quashing rumours that their son is a space alien and instilling him with noble human values . Clark attempts to lie low in a number of fairly innocuous jobs but his tendency to rush into dangerous situations to rescue people soon attracts the attention of a reporter , Lois Lane ( Amy Adams ) . Clark discovers a Kryptonian ship which he can use with technology from his own crashed vessel to create an interactive AI based on his father 's personality . This allows him to learn about his heritage , but also sends out an automated SOS which lures Zod and his crazy crew to the planet . Cue a lot of carnage as showdown follows showdown until the film climaxes.The storyline is , in principle , a good idea . The film avoids any mention of Lex Luthor or Kryptonite , and the use of Krypton , Zod and Jor-El as an AI are all good notions that give the story a personal investment for Superman whilst allowing the origin story part of the narrative to flow into the actual present-day storyline . Unfortunately , this does n't work out in practise . The film 's first hour , just under half the total running time , is overwhelmed by backstory and exposition . The Krypton sequences with Russell Crowe are pretty good , with a strong visual identity and Crowe - easily the best performer in the movie - doing some excellent work , grounding the fantastical landscapes and events in more relatable issues of family . Michael Shannon is a bit thuggish and lacking in nuance as Zod ( especially as the film goes on and he gets more shouty ) , but he has credible motivations and presence . The Krypton sequence is imaginative and involving , but also overlong.Once on Earth , the film becomes a confused morass of flashbacks ( many of them pretty pointless ) and present-day story . Kevin Costner is very good as Superman 's human father , right up until he gets what is , by a considerable distance , the stupidest , most pointless and most unconvincing death scene in the history of cinema . The overwhelming stupidity of this sequence , not to mention that it was completely unnecessary , may be the film 's lowest point . Some individual sequences such as Superman saving the crew of an oil rig or learning to fly by first jumping really high ( a nod to early versions of the character who could n't fly at all , only jump miles at a time ) are much more successful . Amy Adams 's Lois Lane , who soon enters the story , is also really good . She plays Lois as a smart , intelligent reporter in her thirties who is more plausible than other takes on the character . Crucially , she is also aware of who Superman is from the off . This is an obviously different take on the character relationship , avoiding the whole 'wears glasses as a disguse ' cliche , even if it makes no sense whatsoever ( Perry meets Superman but later falls for the old 'glasses ' trick hook , line and sinker ) . But still , points for trying on that score . More disappointing is that Adams and Cavill do n't really have much chemistry , and their eventual romance is utterly unconvincing.The film continues to try hard to succeed : Zod 's plans for Earth are actually somewhat logical and make sense . They also give hope to Clark that one day Krypton can live again , which should lead to greater moral confusion over what is the right thing to do . But this never happens : Clark decides early on to defend Earth no matter the cost and never budges from that , making these attempts to complicate things fail outright.This leads into the film 's climactic action sequences which are , on the whole , highly disappointing . The action sequences are over-indulgent and seem to go on forever . They also frequently lack context or conviction : seeing two invulnerable beings fight one another knowing they ca n't hurt one another makes for zero tension . The CGI is also flat-out terrible in these battles , rather bafflingly since Krypton is so impressive at the start of the film . The character-replacement CGI is unconvincing , the placing of the actors ' faces on CGI bodies is amateurish and some of the flight and movement CGI is worse than the twelve-year-old original Spider-Man movie . Usually in 2013 the very least you can say about an otherwise terrible movie is that the effects are good , but Man of Steel ca n't even manage that right . The final battle also indulges in some dubiously lingering shots of collapsing skyscrapers with hundreds of people in them ( or about to be squashed by them ) which makes for uneasy viewing in a Superman feature.Man of Steel ( ** ) shows hints of a fertile imagination and originality ( mostly in the opening act set on Krypton ) whilst showcasing a few good performances , but these are soon buried by inane dialogue , terrible action sequences , poor CGI and a total collapse in logic at several key points in the film . Man of Steel is not only not very good , but even manages to make Superman Returns look like a capable and competent film in comparison . Overall , not recommended .	-1
Probably the worst Superman movie ever , and it 's a shame . The plot of the movie is n't really that bad . It 's a reboot , so you know most of the basic story ( refer to Superman I and II of 1978/1980 ) . I think I like this version of the story better than the earlier movies , but this movie was slow and predictable .	-1
Classic example of special effects shoring up a very weak story . The writers of this trash should be ashamed of themselves . I 'm a huge fan of Superman , but I desperately wanted to fast forward through much of this movie .	-1
Effects were great . Acting was great . But story was weak . Cavel looks good as supes , Shannon was a great zod but left just feeling underwhelmed . Actually am more of a fan of returns . Even tho most hate it . Just did n't feel like a superman movie .	-1
First , I love Christopher Nolan ( the director ) Memento is one of my all-time favorite movies . This movie runs 2 hours and something like 20 minutes . The story is good but the emphasis on special effects and the OVERLY LONG fight sequences were just too much.. Although this movie had the look and feel of Nolan 's effort in the Batman movies , it just was too darn long , I mean how many times do I have to see guys getting punched and then getting up like it was nothing.. ? ? The fight sequences in this movie just go on and on and on FOREVER and the CGI/special effects are just way too much.. I liked that it was a unique story but even my kids ages 14 and 16 got bored with it.. I really felt that I could have done a much better job editing and tightening up the story line on this one..It 's like a visual feast where the host just overindulged on special effects.. Not recommended unless you 've got time to waste..	-1
This movie was bad.I could end this review right here but why would I ? This movie is a mess , it attempts to deliver an origin story for Superman but the problem is that we never connect to Clark as a character . The first chunk of the movie takes place on Krypton , a location that in all honesty does n't matter because it explodes , the only reason Krypton is shown is because A ) Avatar was popular , let 's show an Avatar-esque world and B ) Thor was popular and that took place in part in an alien world so let 's show another world 's culture . The problem was this is a Superman movie and at the 30 minute mark we still know nothing about Clark.In fact even by the big moment in the movie when Clark flies for the first time we have a problem in that we still do n't know who Clark is as a person . We saw him as a child , and we see him get punched and then destroy a trucker 's livlihood in retaliation , so we know two things : Clark wants to save some people and Clark is petty . The next problem is that his father sent him from Krypton so he 'll have a choice , but as soon as he meets his father 's ghost he says something to the effect of `` this is what you should do . '' So Clark then has no choice.Ok got it.So at no point in the movie do we get to see Clark as a person , he 's an emotionless beast who does nothing and even when he does show himself he 's simply too cocky to have any personality other than that of a jerk . Who then is the main character ? Is it Amy Adams ? Well I mean she is the one we learn the most about but even she is barely deveolped as a character , instead she somehow is brought into any and every situation for no reason.So here 's the next problem . Superman gets his power from earth 's atmosphere right ? The Kryptonians get their power from Earth 's atmosphere . Why then can these characters jump far and run fast even when they have their suits on ? It 's the atmosphere but that only gives them xray vision and laser eyes ... Why then do they want to terraform earth ? Would n't they want to be superhuman ? Leave earth alone and kill the people then live as GODS.Ok , logic problems aside let 's look at the `` story '' any origin story should follow the basis of the heroes journey , this is just how it works . Superman has an awful heroes journey because we do n't know who he is . I have never been so bored by a superhero movie , I even liked Batman and Robin more than this because at least I could laugh at that . This movie takes itself too seriously and falls in a place between boredom and not being able to be laughed at .	-1
Superhero movies are best when they deliver on their humanity , but this one fills the vast majority of it 's 2+ hours with CGI explosions and superbodies crashing through every kind of thing imaginable . ( Though , of course , never getting really hurt ) . There were a couple moments of cool re-imagining Superman 's formative years , but , again , not nearly enough to overcome the trite and supremely cliche superhero fighting that dominates .	-1
If you like super hero movies , you should probably skip this one . The beginning was interesting , but , once the 24 hour thing , it felt like they were just trying to fill in the time . I could break down the major story line gaps , but , in case you do decide to watch it , I wo n't be a spoiler . They also made it more of the faithful vs evolution which was just weird . I was n't expecting that and found the subliminal messages rather repulsive .	-1
Ok , I was enjoying this movie until the action scenes started ... HALF of this movie is Superman being thrown through buildings . Can we get a count ? Seriously , I understand you guys were proud of the special effects and stuff , but 45 minutes of watching superman get hip tossed through buildings gets a little old . So yeah this movie starts out good , than tries to get too over the top with the action and it ruins the whole thing . I think at some point I went out for some popcorn to return to Superman being hucked through the 115th building of the day ... at that point you get 1 star . I could have made a better movie .	-1
This is the cheesiest most hunky dory dorky makes no sense superman ever seriously the amount of telling yourself it is a kids movie it does n't have to make sense takes up 4 hours how they managed to put so little meaningful content into such a massive space of time is beyond my understanding I felt myself getting dumber as I watched this movie no american super hero is to good for a beer i 'm just like you the american average joe this movie is great if you have a very low iq or just enjoy shiny things in general other then in form of punishment this film should not be seen by anyone over the age of 10	-1
WHY START FROM SCRATCH ? ALSO , TOO MUCH TRAMSFORMER VISUAL AND SOUND EFFECTS . HATE TRANSFORMERS . I WOULD WAIT FOR THIS TO COME TO CABLE . PROBABLY WO N'T WATCH TWICE . SORRY , BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE , IF ONLY A LITTLE STORY IMAGINATION WAS USED . PERHAPS MAN OF STEEL TWO WILL BE BETTER ? ? ? ? WE WILL SEE .	-1
Might be a good sci-fi action adventure , beat-em up movie , and I like those now and again but that is all this is , it is not a superman movie , they sorta took the legend and weaved some of the superman stuff into the movie but it was not about the Clark Kent , Superman/Mild manner reporter and Louis Lane , hard hitting journalist I grew up loving and adoring . Sucked ! ! !	-1
If you liked Christopher Reeves , if you think Superman is a good and simple man , a man who always stands for simple old fashioned American ethics , if you think Superman is strong and unwavering in his righteousness , and these are the reasons you like the character , then please do not watch this movie . I 'll warn you , you 're going to get angry when you try to sit through this thing.This movie is just one more example of Hollywood 's sickness : taking everything that was previously good ( and I mean good in the altruistic way ) and turning it into a contorted modern flawed ugly thing . They have destroyed so many of the nice and righteous parts of our culture by rewriting them or `` rebooting '' them . This is another sad example of how the soulless Hollywood machine can no longer express any goodness . Everything , even Superman is flawed , gray and unattractive . Nothing can be simply brave and true and simple anymore . They think that 's progress . They do n't see that it 's actually digression . Sad.Superman over the last 76 years has stood as a fictional symbol of simplicity , goodness ... . well , as he used to say : `` truth , justice and the American way . '' Now we see the media machine pumping out a driveling , pathetic self pitying little floppy haired pouty boy as the `` Man of Steel '' . It is interesting that as American itself does n't any longer stand for truth and justice , neither does it 's central comic book symbolic hero . The whole altruistic good vision is gone from the minds of our movie makers . They 've lived too long in a gray shadowed existence in their all too real world of corporate compromise . Gone are the days of simple good male character finding their way onto the silver screen . And when they do come back they are changed beyond recognition . The saddest thing about this is that the younger generation will just eat this up and think that this Emo-Superdud is what this character is ! Here 's some annoyances you 'll have to swallow if you decide to torture yourself with this movie : ( 1 ) Krypton is failing because of their environmentally unsound industrial practices . Oh my . How obvious can the brainwashing agenda be ? ! ? ! Ca n't they just make a movie anymore ! ? ! Or does it all have to be some sort of message device , a soap box ? When I pay to be entertained I am not paying to be preached at yet again about how terrible we are to the planet . Guilt guilt guilt . O.k. , I feel crappy about using fossil fuels , now what ? I ca n't just watch a Superman movie for an hour or two and then get back to the guilt after that ? No . Ca n't we just watch a freakin ' comic book movie and have a little fun ? No . No you ca n't . Everything must be on message . Uh ... such a waste . Inevitably all these dvd 's need to be thrown in the dumpster . ( 2 ) Do n't worry though ... if you like being preached at they 've got more for you . Old self-pitying Superbrat needs to save the off shore oil rig from itself in a big explosion scene . At least this stops his super-poutying teenage angst for a minute or two . But again , can these soulless Hollywood types think their own thoughts at all . No . They saw oil spills on the news and it was getting ratings and so they thought that was a good idea . Preachy and transparent . I really dislike movies that are n't really what they 're supposed to be and are actually about getting bullet points or messages into the audience . Again , I thought I was buying a comic book movie . ( 3 ) This may seem small , but to the Superman fan it is not . It 's a detail but I 've always thought them smart to avoid . The scruff , the beard , shaving . In almost all Superman movies and tv , they avoid this issue , very wisely I think . What on the planet can he shave with . Bullets literally bounce off his pupils , so what does he shave with ? Almost all other directors and producers cared just enough about the suspension of disbelief enough to avoid this issue . These filmmakers thought it more important to make him look cool or dramatic than to make the character make sense . Again , if you 're not really a comic book person , sci-fi fan , or Superman buff , you might think this point silly , but it is not . ( 4 ) Krypton . Originally it simply died of old age . It was vague way back when . But it is clear that there was no rebellion or internal war . It is so pathetic that Hollywood has to take a place of enlightened higher level beings and lower them down , not only to our brutal human level , but to this very moment of war and brutality . No longer is Superman and his race a dream or ideal of an advanced species we might try to be like , no longer are we in awe of their peace and beauty . No , they are dumb and warlike like us . Great right ! Do n't you just identify with them so much more now that they can not focus on the environmental issues tearing their planet apart because they 're too busy killing each other . Is n't it great that they 're just like us ? These stupid filmmakers think people tune into Superman to see ourselves ! ! ! ! ! No , Superman is supposed to be an ideal , not a reflection of our own inadequacies . ( 5 ) We can get into Zod and all the rewriting if you like , but let 's just cut to the chase : they have no ideas in their manikin heads out there in Southern California . Everything is a pale rewrite of some previous material . They can not simply pick Superman up where the last movie left off and writing from there . No , they have to retell the beginning because they have no original thoughts.All the media machine can do is regurgitate the same plots ... each time releasing it with more bile left all over the product than the last time . So we have to use Superman II ideas . We have to retell the beginning of Superman I . And we have to puke it up through the ugly and contorted lens of our modern gray minds . They 've forgotten what good looks like . They 've forgotten how think , and apparently they do n't seem to hire those people ... what are they called ... . oh , it 's been so long since we 've seen one ... oh , yeah they 're called writers . `` Re-writers '' seem to fit the bill just fine.Note to any Hollywood `` writers '' out there : If someone asks you to take an old idea that was good and touch it , rewrite it , or otherwise make it palatable for the modern audience , you should remember that you 're a artist not an office secretary . Artists create , they do not destroy other people 's creations and call themselves artists . No one calls themselves a painter when they 've painted a new Mona Lisa . We call them forgers.I mean , this movie is an amalgam of pop culture hot words : terraforming , oil spill , coup d ' & eacute ; tat , military investigation , genetic engineering ... blah , blah , etc . Tiring , obvious soap box big media messaging , wrapped in a flesh of a childish unmanly super-emo-man , who 's self doubt and pity are pathetic.This is certainly not Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster 's Superman . You actually like that guy.Max Fleischer 's Superman would not understand this movie at all . He lived in a different time , a simpller time , when good was obvious and Superman was a symbol of strength . Period.George Reeves ' Superman was like your ideal , strong , caring , dad figure compared to this super-brat , who is like your wimpy , video game playing , pouty teenage emo son.And Finally , Christopher Reeves ' likable , kind , simply , strong , bold , loving and brave Superman would simply shake his head and feel sorry for this pathetic little thing . Christopher as a human was immensely more charismatic , and as an actor was , well , a good actor ! You believed he was Superman . And finally , you liked him . And you like Superman . You wanted to be like him , and as a parent , you did n't mind your child wanting to be like him.I do not think Man of Steel is appropriate for small children the way almost all other Superman series were . I certainly do n't want my son to be like this guy.I 'd suggest passing on this movie . I wish I could give it zero stars.It 's the worst Superman anything ... ever.Finally , Superman does not kill . He is supposed to be a good person . Period . Therefore , this is not Superman . So sad , so very , very sad ...	-1
Superman does not -- through inaction -- allow someone to die . ( Especially not his father ? ) Superman does not kill.I saw tis in the theater , and will not be buying the DVD . I already own a really good Superman movie on DVD .	-1
1 Take a classic story , throw it out.2 Keep the character names so you do n't have to worry about developing them yourself . But make sure they 're edgy and new . ( Seriously a dark and moody troubled Superman ? ) 3 Put in plenty of obvious paid advertising . ( Ihop , Sears etc ... ) 4 Throw in as many overly dramatic plot twists as possible.5 Blow all that money you should have put into writing and spend it on special effects.273 Stream it from Amazon so that the quality sucks even when you have a great internet connection . ( Okay , that one is not Hollywood 's fault )	-1
Sometimes the action and special effects are just simply too much . I felt like I was watching a 2 hour trailer . Though there was a story , and it was good , I guess I have just outgrown all the & # 34 ; eye-candy , & # 34 ; I like something with a little more depth .	-1
One of the worst movies of the year , complete garbage ! Steer clear away from this monstrosity , it 's not worth the money .	-1
How could they do this to our Superman character ? Maybe the producers of this brand new Superman movie should buy old comic books & educate themselves about what Superman is all about , what he represents and how he makes us feel as we watch him take care of baddies using his superpowers . I did not want a movie that is an hybrid of a recent Thor or alien movie . I guess this movie could be awesome and worth watching if you had never watched a real Superman movie or were just born yesterday .	-1
Good actors . Bad editing . Would only watch for free . Older Superman movies better . A disappointment . And that is all folks .	-1
If you 've seen the endless Peter vs Chicken fight on Family Guy , you 've seen this movie . Pretty much the same thing . And Family Guy does it better .	-1
