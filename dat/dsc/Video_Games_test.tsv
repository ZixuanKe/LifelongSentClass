Finally at $ 20 , this is priced perfect ! It 's a simple arcade-style game that is perfect for multiple players . My 7 , 5 and 3 year old play this together and have a blast -- it utilizes the WiiPad perfectly and the ability to easily create avatars with the WiiPad 's camera is one of my kids ' favorite things ! Download the demo on the Wii U and if you like it , buy the full thing -- especially for the mode where the WiiPad holder gets to control the monster ! $ 20 is insanely good value on this underrated game . Perhaps the $ 40 price tag was what caused slow sales and the eventual liquidation price . We 've ordered a second copy as my 1 year old loved the disc way too hard and cracked it !	1
The giant monsters remind me off Godzilla films and are equally as intense . The fact you can make your own avatar from your own face is really cool and the gameplay is solid . The enviroments are destructable which is awesome and rather than attacking with the army you can even play as a monster which is super cool . Great title .	1
Tank tank tank is a weird yet straightforward game your in a tank fighting giant mechanized robot monsters that resemble a Godzilla movie . he graphics are good just nothing spectacular . simple graphics that are somewhat colorful . The game controls are simple you point your tank at the enemy and shoot while power up shots are thrown out giving you super ability for a short while like missiles or lasers . The monster will attack you and pick up your tank you while then mash n buttons to be freed or if in multi player the other player will help . You earn coins to unlock new levels and tanks which adds variety as well as you are scored at the end of the match . If you go co open missions the 1st player uses the game pad screen while the 2nd uses the TV . Multi player mode also consist of one player versus the other 3 . The one player will play as a king Kong style robot trying to smash the other players that are in tanks . The funny thing about this game is you get to take a picture with the game pad of your face to add it in the game . The sound is average . The story is presented in Japanese anime style Godzilla type movie . This game is fun I owned it for over a month and still enjoy it . It is an arcade game so keep that in mind . Its a pick up a play type game .	1
You really ca n't & # 34 ; buy & # 34 ; youth ! This was the cheapest game of three that were stocking stuffer this Christmas , it was less than half the price of the other two , but my Son plays this game more than the other games . My wife and I have played along in multi-player mode , it is not a very complicated plot , but it is entertaining enough , the graphics are not & # 34 ; realistic & # 34 ; , but I think that is one of the reasons I do n't mind him playing it . Even though it depicts & # 34 ; violence & # 34 ; , because of its cartoonish feel , it is not reason for concern . We love the pic 's that you can take of your own players , we have a lot of fun making up funny faces !	1
For serious buyers this game is by no means a serious game or story driven . It has a very strong sense of it is trying to appeal to younger children with its simplistic controls ( you move and shoot , that 's it ) and tons of explosions . It is certainly much more enjoyable with a group of friends ( adult beverages also increase its appeal ) . Not a sit down and play for hours type of game but every once in awhile if you just want to see a lot of explosions with very silly scenarios this game can certainly satisfy that yearning ... for awhile .	1
If it had manual aiming with the right thumb stick , I 'd give this 4 1/2 stars . If you could customize or upgrade your tanks , I 'd give it 5 . But you ca n't do either , and the campaign levels are repetitive . With that said though , kids really eat this game up and enjoy the multiplayer modes . I can play it for about 30 minutes to an hour before I get bored with it ( I 'm 24 ) , it 's an arcade game though so have realistic expectations before buying .	1
the 1st few times i played this with my friends , we had a blast.. our laughs could be heard a mile away . such little fun things like having you picture on the tank and on the big gorilla and the creative/funny way people can do it is fun . over time though , this game can get old quickly , so we are trying to play it a little bit only every gathering . still worth the purchase .	1
Got this as an add-on Christmas present since we got them the Wii-U and I wanted them to have a few games to play Christmas morning . We had Zelda as a download and I got Mario and Luigi and a few other titles.My son is 6 and my daughter is 5 . My son is FAR more advanced at videogaming than my daughter but she WANTS to play . I was surprised when this budget title ended up getting so much of their play time.First , they LOVE taking their pictures and choosing their avatar . Especially with the MyKong game where their face is plastered all over the big screen . Second , it is easy enough my daughter can play it and as Kong she can even win sometimes without her brother throwing the game.It does look as if this is a pretty standard arcade game with limited options and may not be a title they are playing years from now , but for a quick , jump in and play for fun game , this is pretty fun - especially at the budget prices it is going for now !	1
The war between the Autobots and Decepticons for control of their homeworld , Cybertron , has resulted in the near-ruination of the planet . Its energon stores are almost gone , with the last few scraps being fought over at tremendous cost . The Autobots realise they have no choice but to abandon their home and search for a new refuge amongst the stars . To this end they have built the Ark , an immense starship , but it is under the threat of Decepticon attack . The Autobots have to power up the ship , protect it from attack and escape , whilst the Decepticons try to stop them and engage in their own internal conflict.Fall of Cybertron is the sequel to the enjoyable-but-lightweight War for Cybertron and is an improvement over that game in almost every way . Like its forebear , it 's a linear third-person shooter which tells a large-scale story involving many characters , with you playing different Autobots or Decepticons on different levels . Unlike its forebear , it 's a bit more generous and smarter in differentiating the characters and allowing you to use their full range of abilities.Part of Fall of Cybertron 's appeal is that it takes what is usually the starting point for the Transformers mythos - the launch of the Ark from Cybertron , the subsequent Decepticon ambush and the crash of the starship on prehistoric Earth - and turns it into the grand finale . The build-up to this event is depicted through a series of missions where the Autobots try to get the ship ready for take-off , secure new fuel supplies and fend off Deception attacks , with a series of side-missions depicting the search for the missing Grimlock and his team ( the future Dinobots , who get probably their most logical-ever origin story in this game ) . From the Deception POV , there are a series of missions about trying to defeat the Autobots whilst - as usual - there are internal conflicts and attempts by the treacherous Starscream to supplant Megatron as leader.The game is heavily focused around combat , although some of the characters ( Cliffjumper and Starscream ) have more stealthy options available to them . A lot of the time you are fighting in robot mode , diving in and out of cover to exchange fire with enemies , but the game also provides many larger areas where you can switch to vehicle mode for a more mobile experience . The first game was guilty of neglecting the Transforming mechanic ( which is a bit stupid ) , but the sequel makes full and vigorous use of it . Indeed , the one level where you command Grimlock has you limited in being able to transform only when Grimlock gets mad enough ( represented by filling a bar by defeating enemies ) and then giving you a ridiculous number of overpowered abilities in dinosaur mode . Another sequence has you controlling the gigantic Decepticon Bruticus and smashing your way to victory.The game also maintains interest by providing a series of massive set-pieces . The game is limited in the freedom it gives you to change or alter the storyline ( you get two slightly different endings depending on whether the Autobots or Decepticons get the upper hand in the battle for the Ark but that 's about it ) , so it makes up for that by making the combat fun and by making the levels as memorable as possible . One sequence has you alternating between the Combaticons as they work together to take down a bridge to block an Autobot transport . Another features you as Cliffjumper infiltrating a ruined party of Cybertron and taking down enemies through stealth attacks . Jazz takes part in a combat mission using a physics-based energy grapple , whilst Optimus Prime has to fight his way through enemy lines by lighting up targets for the massive Autobot Metroplex to destroy . The designers work hard to provide big , epic moments at every point of the story ( some shamelessly cribbed from the comics , TV series or , especially , the 1986 animated movie ) and generally pull it off . Long-term Transformers fans will likely play through most of the game with a big grin on their faces.The game 's biggest success is the depiction of the battle for the Ark . Ususally depicted as a one-sided massacre , the game turns it into a furious battle in space , on the hull of the ship and inside its decks . The POV switches rapidly from Soundwave boarding the ship with his cassette warriors to take down its main guns to Jetfire shooting down grappling hooks outside to Bruticus smashing his way along the hull to Jazz trying to take him down , and finally to a brutal slug-fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron . As final missions go , it 's exceptionally good , despite the massive cliffhanger ending.The game still has some drawbacks . Whilst the stealth sequences and the sequences where you play as overpowered killing machines break up the third-person shooter scenes , you still spend a lot of the game exchanging fire with distantly-glimpsed enemies down corridors . It 's also highly unclear what half the weapons in the game actually do ( due to some uselessly non-descriptive names ) . There 's also an upgrade system which never really feels that necessary to use.The drawbacks are fairly minor , however . The game is fun , makes much more interesting use of the licence than its predecessor and has a great , pulpy storyline . More recent fans of the franchise may miss a whole host of Easter Eggs , but old-school Transformers fans will enjoy the tons of references to the many different incarnations of the franchise . If there is a major problem , it 's that the game ends on a cliffhanger which is not likely to be resolved any time soon : the planned third game in the series has been turned into a tie-in with the upcoming new Michael Bay movie and wo n't resolve the story at all.Transformers : Fall of Cybertron ( **** ) is available now in the UK ( PC , PlayStation 3 , X-Box 360 ) and USA ( PC , PlayStation 3 , X-Box 360 ) .	1
I loved the first and the second is just as good . If you like the lore of the Transformers as I do you have to get this .	1
Great game ~ best yet : ) They 've `` nailed '' the transformers experience w/ this 1 : ) & The Grimlock stages rulz : ) Enjoyd it more than WFC & Metal Gear Solid HD & 4Sry folks ~ I guess I enjoy faster paced games ~ snake is on the lazy side for Me & multi-player w/ dinobots & sect-i-cons packs is fine fun : ) Even though I normally get my digitized a22 kickd by level 17 players : ( Highly recommend this title ~ even if it 's a download & remember ~ It 's only a Rip-off if U do n't enjoy the game : )	1
I did n't play High Moon Studios first Transformers-based game , War For Cybertron , but I saw and heard good things about it so I decided to give Fall of Cybertron a shot on Steam.I 'm very impressed with the game as a whole . The campaign mode is action-packed and extremely fun to play as all the different characters in the Transformers universe , and the multiplayer , with progression , transformer customization and numerous weapon unlocks , is a blast to play online and will serve as an important factor in the ongoing replayability of this game.But most importantly , the gameplay itself is basically perfect in how it feels and the things you can do as a giant , superpowerful transforming robot . As it should be.Transforming back and forth between your vehicle and humanoid forms is fluid and very satisfying visually to witness , but also essential to success in combat . There are an endless number of tactics and exciting ways to maneuver using the transform function and you 'll quickly realize , not only how much fun it is , but how much more effective you can be once you have mastered it.Great game and worth playing for sure , for either the story mode or online 6v6 multiplayer ( includes deathmatch , conquest , capture the flag , and headhunter modes ) alone , and certainly for both.I purchased the game on steam , and my only issue with the game so far is that it can be hard to get into games and have enough players in lobbies to start matches . Perhaps because there are n't that many people that bought the game yet , so go buy it !	1
If you are a Transformers fan , I do n't see how you would not love this game . Great XBOX 360 Controller support for PC , which so many other games tend to neglect these days . I have not gotten into the multi-player yet , but the single player campaign is great . Superb voice acting , voices sound just like in the movies . Nice expansive wide open battlefield scenes as well as closer combat settings . Great action and variety as the game switches you to very different transformers with different abilities to accomplish different tasks . I liked the Transformers War for Cybertron as well , but this one is even better since there is more variety . I was not in favor of their new look of Optimus , but once I bought the separate Massive Fury DLC I could switch over to the traditional Mac truck Optimus aka G1 Optimus . Oh and one more thing ... Dinobots made it into this game !	1
The Good : Top-notch production values , more varied gameplay , more unique Transformers , improved visuals , lots of easter eggs and tidbits for fans , building your own robot in multiplayer , solid campaignThe Bad : Not enough has changed from the last game , story is n't all that memorable , multiplayer is boring after a while , graphics could use improvementWar for Cybertron was the first Transformers game that was actually good and not based off of any of the three movies ( hey , I liked them ! ) Its based the characters off the Generation One cartoon series and even brought back some of the original voice actors . Fall of Cybertron continues in this fashion , but brings out some of the lesser known Transformers and puts them in the campaign . The game is overall the same as the last one , but with more polish and fine tuning.The story is decent and entertaining , but nothing memorable . It picks up from the last game where Megatron is still trying to wipe out the Autobots , but this time prevent them from escaping on the Ark . Optimus Prime and his gang are desperately trying to gather enough Energon to power the Ark , but Megatron and the Decepticons , as well as the Insecticons are causing problems for everyone . The planet is pretty much lost at this point and all Optimus cares about is getting his Autobots off the damn planet and to safety . You play through thirteen chapters of various different Transformers from both sides to experience this pretty cinematic and entertaining story.You play as regular Transformers and the larger ones . Bumblebee is your first one during the first chapter . Optimus Prime and Megatron are used quite a bit , but also Cliff Jumper , Bruticus , Jazz , Vortex , Grimlock , Starscream , and even for a brief moment in the final chapter , Jetfire . I preferred this over choosing between just a few different ones like in the last game . It made the campaign more unique , and less repetitive and boring . Each chapter is completely different with different gameplay elements thanks to each Transformer being unique . Sneaking around cloaked as Cliff Jumper , grappling as Jazz , flying around as Vortex , and stomping things into the ground as Bruticus was awesome . The vehicle forms are better controlled and I used them a lot more than I did in the last game . Even the gun play is tighter.The enemies are smarter this time around , and there 's a bit more of a variety . The Insecticons add to this variety and are spread throughout the campaign . Even the objectives are more varied instead of just pulling levers all the time . There 's a new upgrade system via the Teletraan 1 which allows you to use Energon Shards to upgrade weapons . These upgrades are actually useful and make a huge difference . I still wish I can upgrade my vehicle form , but they are already powerful enough . The campaign just stands as a solid cinematic Transformers story and is just so much better than the last game . There are still a few issues like difficulty spikes , minor collision detection issues , but it is n't nearly as abundant as the last game . This game is hard , and if you do n't take cover and watch out you will die in a few hits . Using shields and Energon packs helps , but at least you wo n't die every 5 seconds like the last game.The graphics are really good , but it still uses the Unreal Engine 3 based on the consoles and it could look better . I was hoping the PC version would have some enhanced visuals , but we it does n't . There are some ugly muddy textures here and there , but overall it looks way better than the last game . War for Cybertron already looked dated when it came out . The art style is gorgeous and the voice acting is just top-notch . The multiplayer comes back again , but not much else has changed besides being able to build your own robot . After a while you will get bored like the last game , but hardcore fans may stay . If it makes you feel better you get to be a T-Rex as Grimlock later in the game . I just ca n't tell you how many surprises this game can throw at you . There ia just a ton of love put into this game and tidbits for fans.As it stands , Fall of Cybertron improves immensely over the last game , but still does n't offer enough variation and diversity to make this game of the year worthy . There is more variety here than the last game with different Transformers used in each chapter , but I really wanted something even more epic . What 's here is great , and this really is the best Transformers game ever made , but I know it can be even better .	1
Best Transformers Game out there love playing have put about 38 hours into game and never get tired of it . Multiplayer is sweet also .	1
Sweet Game its a Origin Code but still been good ... i like it ... and its good amazon continue down those bundles that help people to continue playing those good games for a low prices	1
2 good games for 5 dlls , great deal ! can ` t complaing about it , burnout is a great game , NFS is ok	1
Anyone who loves racing games will love these pieces . Burnout Paradise is considered by some as the greatest racing game of all time . I personally only bought this for Burnout but the Need for Speed game surprised me too . I do n't normally play racing games so this was a nice surprise . But , for the price I got this , it was a steal .	1
Aunque los de criterion games se tiraron en la saga de need for speed , le dan un toque diferente , y para obtener estos dos juegos de criterion games por tan bajo precio , realmente si vale la pena , solo cuando est & aacute ; n en promoci & oacute ; n de resto no .	1
Many race games try and fail , Burnout Paradise deliver . Great game , recommended . I love to drive around aimlessly just for the fun of it !	1
i enjoy burnout paradise it open world too explore easy find new races too try an it really fun wolrd too explore hot pursuit is more focused but also well made did not play it as much as i been mostly playing burnout paradise	1
I own every Burnout game from the PS2 originals to the PSP spinoffs . I even have this game on PS3 as well but not the ultimate box edition . This is by far the best version considering the visual quality on PC . Definitely a must buy for any Burnout fan , hands down . A lot of replay value compared to previous titles .	1
We have several of these accessory packs in our family to protect our 3DS consoles . The cases make traveling with the 3DS more enjoyable because we do n't have to worry about the consoles becoming damaged .	1
This travel pack has everything you need for great gaming ! I 've had it for a good little while and every thing still works as it did when I bought it . There is a good use for everything .	1
This has everything I need and more . Really all I wanted was a nice hard case , but this comes with very decent extras . I 've not used them yet , but I have them should I ever need them .	1
The product was very complete , everything fits inside the case . It is a very nice product . I will recommend this product , is good quality .	1
This download runs beautifully on my system and it 's activated through Steam which is a plus . If you have the Xbox 360 controller connected , it 's fully compatable which is also nice for those of us who prefer using controllers . For $ 6 for the Game of The Year edition , you simply can not go wrong . For the people that are saying they ca n't access the downloadable Game of The Year content over Steam , I 'm not sure what to say , because the content downloaded for me . In the options menu , it says `` Unlocked '' for all of the DLC . Great game though . Buy it while you can for the price .	1
I like this game very much , though there are some flaws I hope they avoided in the sequel.I 'll tell you about the negatives first , and then the positives.Cons : *The grammar used in the titles of some of the challenges is terrible . It 's so bad that I wonder if they were written by someone who speaks a language other than English and did n't have it proofed by a fluent speaker . & # 34 ; My collectibles , let me show you them ! & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Someone set up us the bomb. & # 34 ; Uh , did I miss a joke from a movie or something ? I do n't even know what the second title means . *The analog controls for swinging the melee weapons is too slow , and you wind up getting your bum kicked if you are n't standing on a car or something . *There are four types of special upgrades for your weapons : *SPOILER* You can make barbed ( cutting ) upgrades , fire upgrades , electricity upgrades , and toxic upgrades . You go through all sorts of trials and quests to get these upgrades that barely enhance the weapon 's damage and critical chance at all . Then you get another one that does the same thing the last electric upgrade did , only it 's a tiny improvement . It gets monotonous after a bit . *You ca n't boost the upgrade to your weapons once they 've been modified . You have to find a new one of the same type and use the next mod . Looting good weapons is a royal cramp . *It takes way , WAY too long to reach the top tier of the challenges , but that 's just my opinion . I 'm not adverse to a good workout and lots of labor , but come on ... $ 10,000,000 when you usually loot one or two hundred from each body ? And that 's after you have gotten the first three levels of cash loot . *You have to play online if you are using a PC . I do n't know about the consoles . I personally do n't like the fact that I have to be online to start the game . If I 'm not at home and away from the internet I have to do something else . *The mandatory Steam download is a pain I consider intrusive.Pros : *The primary characters are developed and designed beautifully . The skin textures and hair were done masterfully . The bodies are different shapes . Not everyone is fit and skinny . There are curvy women , heavy men , athletic bodies , and different clothing styles . Very good for realism . *I LOVE the setting ! The gorgeous , colorful island environment with vibrant , clear ocean water is amazing , and it offers a great level of spookiness with the contrast of the zombie gore and violence . It totally enhanced the horror aspect for me , as many macabre games are set in nasty , dark environments . *The controls for the most part when using the keyboard and mouse make sense and are easy to learn . *The story line is really well thought out , and keeps you guessing what 's really going on behind the scenes . *There 's plenty of action , you can decide whether or not to take it easy . You can decide how crazy you want to get . *There 's more than one way to 'skin a cat ' in this game . You do n't only have to use melee weapons . They decided not to make it a shooter . I love shooters , but it 's nice to take a break . There are guns , but they do n't dominate . *I finished the game wanting to know what was coming up . Very good . *The variety of accents and cultures of the characters makes the social combo interesting . *Not all the characters are the same height , and there 's lots of variety in zombie design . *The biggest one for me is that I do n't have to play with other people . I ca n't stand playing with others , as they 're usually annoying and rude . So , it 's nice to have a choice.Overall I 'd have to say it 's a game worthy of high praise for the creativity and the developers ' willingness to break the mold and step away from the norm . It 's a bit more surprising and suspenseful when you ca n't guess what 's going to happen next .	1
I first got this game for the XBOX 360 . I loved it so much and when this was on sale for the PC , I jumped on that deal ! This is a great zombie fighting game ! The storylines and the modifiable weapons are amazing ! I highly recommend it to any zombie game lovers out there !	1
Nice Game its a Steam Code and great game ... i like it ... and its good amazon continue down those bundles that help people to continue playing those good games for a low prices	1
& # 8220 ; Dead Island & # 8221 ; , when it comes down to it , is a cross between & # 8220 ; Far Cry & # 8221 ; , & # 8220 ; Left 4 Dead 2 & # 8243 ; , and & # 8220 ; Dead Rising 2 & # 8243 ; . I enjoy playing it , though it does tax my video card even on low settings . Those looking to purchase this would do well to pay attention to the recommended PC specs . Despite that however , the scenery is beautiful and the gameplay mechanics keep me coming back for more . It is currently going for $ 19.99 ( as of 12/2/12 ) and I believe this to be a fair price for the amount of content it offers . I picked this up for more than half that during a Steam sale and I & # 8217 ; m glad I did . The bugs during its rocky launch kept me from dropping money on it , but the patches and price drop put the game back onto my radar . If you enjoy wading through zombies using melee weapons , managing inventory / weapons , and doing quests , then you & # 8217 ; ll get a lot out of & # 8220 ; Dead Island. & # 8221 ; Oh , and the original trailer ? Fantastic !	1
Dead Island is tailor-made for those of us who like to do their killing up-close and personal & # 8211 ; and with copious amounts of blood and gore . The only thing better than slicing some Thug & # 8217 ; s arms off is to break them instead so you can watch him sling the useless things around before you kill him . I & # 8217 ; ve played a lot of shooters in my time , but no FPS shooter compares to the gloriously gory mayhem that is Dead Island . They call it & # 8220 ; visualized gore & # 8221 ; but I just call it awesome . You leave a gory trail of limbs and torsos behind you as you progress through this game.The game & # 8217 ; s visuals are well-nigh stunning . The island of Banoi is a tropical paradise and looks every bit of it . Unfortunately , some wanker had to go and start a zombie epidemic to ruin everyone & # 8217 ; s fun . You have the option of playing as one of four different characters & # 8211 ; although my man Sam B. is just too cool for me to play as anyone else . Sam came to Banoi to perform at one of the resorts ( basically living off of his one hit song , Who Do You Voodoo ? ( which is awesome , by the way & # 8211 ; I & # 8217 ; d totally buy it ) . He & # 8217 ; s also your muscle melee kind of guy who fights the baddies eye to eye . If you want to engage in more gunplay or throwing knives and other sissy stuff like that , choose another character . All of the available characters have one thing in common & # 8211 ; for whatever reason , they are immune to the virus . Each of them can still die easily enough , but none of them are going to turn into flesh-eating monsters . The downside to this whole immunity thing is that you ( and your partners if you play co-op ) pretty much have to do all of the dirty work to help others besides yourselves survive ( although Sam B. pretty much cares only about himself ) . All four characters basically play as a team , which can be a little disconcerting when you play a solo campaign . You & # 8217 ; re on your own out there with the zombies , but some cut scenes feature all four of the characters.You start out with little more than a wooden oar and your fists , but your tools of the zombie-killing trade increase as you go along ( as does the strength of the zombies ) . By killing zombies and completing missions for survivors , you gain experience ( and a selection of skills that come with it ) , better weapons , and cash & # 8211 ; and you & # 8217 ; ll need plenty of cash to keep your weapons in good shape and to upgrade their effectiveness . Best of all , there are a number of weapon modification plans available that help you to take your zombie slaying to whole new levels . It & # 8217 ; s great fun to set a zombie on fire and watch him burn , or to electrocute him , or to bash his head in with one swing & # 8211 ; although a plain and simple decapitation gives me more satisfaction than anything else . Oftentimes , the freshly severed head will sort of hover in the air for a second while the rest of the body tumbles to the ground . And then there & # 8217 ; s rage mode , which makes you and your fists alone the most powerful killing instrument on Banoi.The AI could be improved a little bit , but Dead Island still represents quite a challenge . Alongside your run-of-the-mill zombies you & # 8217 ; ll face powerful Thugs , Suiciders who can kill you in a second if you get too close to them for too long , Bloaters who spew deadly acid all over the place , and Rams who can run you over and kill you in a heartbeat . You need different strategies to kill different enemies & # 8211 ; but they all can become pretty predictable after you & # 8217 ; ve faced them a few times.There & # 8217 ; s really only one thing I don & # 8217 ; t like about Dead Island . All of the NPC females are butt ugly & # 8211 ; heck , some of them look better as zombies than they do in real life . Seriously , what is up with that ? You & # 8217 ; ve got bikini-clad women all over the island , and you don & # 8217 ; t bother to make any of them the least bit attractive . What , did the designers think seeing a cute chick or two would distract me from the whole zombie apocalypse thing ?	1
Great game for $ 30 . Very good graphics , physics , and gameplay . Good open environment . Could have used more subplots/quests , but was non-linear enough . Starts out a little slow , but once you start to find good weapons and develop character , the game is a lot of fun . The enemies level with player ( need to develop and use skills to defeat enemies ) . I finished at L36 and restarted game with leveled enemies at L36 ( not as much fun , but almost have all skills now ) . There is some replay value.There are no difficult puzzles , quests get difficult but are straightforward . I enjoyed finding most efficient ways to use weapons , skills , environments ( fire , electricity ) to kill NPCs . The & # 34 ; Rams and Thugs & # 34 ; are fun.The game is worth the $ 30 download . I am waiting till dead island 2 drops in price a little bit and will download it based on this game ( yeah I 'm frugal ) .	1
This a Zombie game with an special appeal.No , it is not your typical & # 34 ; left for dead & # 34 ; game nor is your & # 34 ; dead rising & # 34 ; and it is not even an rpg ... So what makes this game , with all its bugs , incosistent story and stupid gameplay so great ? I do n't know ... All I can tell that if you find the perfect strangers to play this game with is AMAZING ! You 'll laugh to death and the grinding will become part of the fun instead of the boring part.I wo n't criticize the gameplay , or the story or the graphics , it is part of this game charms . If you wanto to shot zombies go elsewhere .	1
Amazon offering this game at such an awesome price deserves 5 stars for surebut the game itself gets 4 . This was an excellent game , but just not one of my tops..thus 4 stars.Enjoy !	1

awesome little game .. ca n't wait to purchase Riptide which is part 2 .. but i will buy riptide when they fix the co-op apparently it 's broken right now and when you beat this game you are able to transfer over your skills to Riptide so that 's awesome ..	1
I have played Dead Island since its original release day and I love it . I think the game was marketed extremely incorrectly and many people like myself had the wrong idea of what to expect when picking up their day one copies . Luckily for myself I was quite pleased with the game itself and the wonderful combat system . This game really makes killing zombies feel satisfying and keeps things interesting by making you change up your weapons regularly . The game is far from perfect and has its technical issues but it is well worth a play for fans of action rpgs . I find it to be a mix of borderlands style loot roulette and an almost Fallout style exploration and leveling system .	1
Whats nice about this game is you cant Run and gun , you need to think about your next move , weapons have a life so you can only use it so many times before its gone , great graphics and gameplay	1
Pros : - Good graphics- Lots of gore- Interesting landscapes- Semi-nonlinear play- Zombies ! - Multiplayer co-op capabilityCons : - Buggy in spots- Poor variety of zombies- Items to build all the plans you find are scarce- Abyssmal voice acting- Controls can be wonky , especially driving- Too fast of a respawn timer	1
Definitely worth 5 bucks . This game is really fun to play co-op . You like zombie game ? Then do n't wait , grab it !	1
Sure its not a perfect game but I ca n't believe how long I passed up having a lot of fun , because of some bad reviews.You awake from drinking way too much to find , all heck has broken loose and now there 's an endless horde of zombies that you 've got to deal with in this surprisingly good First Person Action RPG.The graphics are well done for the times , and the gameplay gets a little wonky if you use the analog controls , and way too repetitive if you dont , but its the RPG elements that really bring this game up for me.Oh the sweet sweet loot.As you kills stuff or open chests , you have chances to find rare weapons that are true instruments of death , or you could take a crappy weapon and upgrade it , add some nails , or just make it a little more sturdy ... OR you could find a great weapon and then upgrade it even more ! It takes a while to get into this game , and sure it has its problems with some physics bugs and other weird open world wonky-ness . But its actually got a decent story and some fun action . It 's also a pretty long game , which is a big plus to its value.The end bit does drag a little bit , but I liked slaughtering zombies through the different areas.If you like loot and enjoy repeatedly smashing zombies in the face while doing some questing for dozens of hours . Click Buy Now .	1
Dead Island is great if you do n't expect too much . It 's a open world zombie apocalypse on a resort island . What else can you say . It 's not super pretty , but on PC it looks as good as it 'll get . Get a couple of friends to co-op this beast with you and plenty of fun will be had . ZOMBIES !	1
Fun games , only a few minor bugs found in many , many hours of gameplay . ( The only serious one is the pathing issue with bathroom staircases especially when moving slow )	1
Developer ( s ) TechlandPublisher ( s ) Deep SilverPlatform ( s ) PS3 , Xbox 360 & PCRelease date September , 2011Genre ( s ) Role Playing , First Person , Sandbox ( Open World ) Mode ( s ) Single Player , MultiplayerRating ( s ) ESRB : M , PEGI : 18I do n't play much Zombie Apocalypse games , I do n't like the idea that it 's the trend of this generation so simply I do n't like it when a certain subject can become the `` it '' factor in the world society and be part of that . Simply it diminishes my real identity and individuality . But none the less , I play them enough to understand its purpose and how effects towards the fan of the genre.The game is developed by a gaming company which I was not familiar with even though Nail 'd & Call of Juarez games were scattered in several shops back here I did not gave my time to check them out . `` So , why the f*** are you reviewing this game then ? '' you may ask . Some may still question themselves whether to buy this game or wait for another epic game to come but my reason behind it is simply that I had set myself to play with a mutual friend as soon as it came out . The first time I heard about the game was in their trailer , the first it caught my attention and I included it among the most dramatic game trailer I 've seen . Read about the game and it was expected to be an open world with a Left 4 Dead survival FPS game . Few weeks after the video footage of the gameplay , I found that quests were shown Experience Points . By that time I started to expect an RPG element will include , which convinced me that it will not look like just another `` hack-your-way-through-zombies '' game.On release day , as I made my first run , my previous views of the game changed almost significantly . Although my very first try was unpleasant due to several technical disturbing events . Patches were quickly given and things got a lot better by diminishing some game breaking bugs.So here I am and ready to give my thoughts about the game.Presentation : The set up if located in a fictional paradise island ( or so it was ... ) called Banoi . You can play as one of the four basic characters in the game and each of them has backgrounds and combat styles . As soon as you made your choice , you will wake up in a bed to find that things are in total chaos . And as one of the ( immune ) survivals , it 's your job to save some survivals by discovering the open world of Banoi and try to figure out what 's going on and what find its source as you hack your way through places with various infected ( zombies ) .Graphics : There is no doubt that is has one impressive graphics I 've seen in gaming . From open environments , narrow places , water effects and dark rooms , there 's so much to appreciate in terms of landscapes and lightings . The blood and chopped fleshes will leave you in horror especially when cutting zombie 's limbs as you go in slow motion.Gameplay : This is where it shines the most . But I will try to mention all of them one at a time without losing my focus . The view is set on First Person mode , when you check the skills ; you will find that it 's designed with kill trees and you need to earn points by leveling up ; and to level up you need to kill zombies . Skill trees are distributed in three and they are set depending on the character class you chose and their classes are specialized in Firearms or Sharp Weapons or Throwing Sharp Weapons or Blunt Weapons . So the more killing and side questing the more experience you will gain to create a very effective class character . Since there 's a class who 's specialized in firearms , this game is more focused on using melee weapons and they work very well ; weapons usually warn off so they needed maintenance by working on them on a workbench and they can also be upgraded to increase its effective use and durability , aside from maintaining a weapon , you can also create custom made weapons by acquiring manuals scattered in the island and it will instruct you for the items you will need to gather in order to make that particular weapon . The game can be played either solo which will take you long to finish a given quest and will have some difficulties to finish a mission or co-op whereas you will find quick questing and extra fun . Questing is designed traditionally like a fetching method taken from an RPG perspective , so you will be busy going to locations either on foot or via vehicle . When playing solo , the zombies will have a fair level close to yours unless if the host is higher from your level then you will have a rough time to kill one zombie at a time . My first play through was n't pleasant due to several encounters of bugs and ultra-sensitive mouse handling which left me a bit dizzy . But in just a few days it got patched and most of the bugs were fixed . So the game got me hooked for more questing and level grinding which let me to forget about its glitches overtime.Audio : Given that this is an adult game , you will expect gores , screams and voice acting where you find them struggle to survive from attacks . Not excellent but believable to say the least.This is literally one horrifying zombie apocalypse games I 've ever played in terms of sounds . The voices of the infected will alert you as you hear them in the area . Given the fact that will determine what type of infected you will encounter nearby but the trouble here is that it 's not clear to pin point their locations so expect to get many surprise attacks even though you 're in a sunny open world . An early tip is to proceed with caution.Overall : What can I say ? like i said i 'm no fan on the zombie apocalypse game . However , it 's another great pre-purchase for me via Steam . Dead Island gave a new flavored treat for those who love Left 4 Dead/Killing Floor games with a blend of RPG element which will charm gamers who played Fallout ( 3 & New Vegas ) and Borderlands . It 's a First Person Melee that strongly relies on the RPG element in a survival horror setup . But for those who expect gun blazing , solo campaign then you might need to rethink that . Despite the bugs I have encountered in the game , it never fails to let me go back to grind and loot for more goods and explore the wonderful yet horrifying Island of Banoi.Score 9Pro ( s ) Open worldGreat weapon customizationAddicting level grinding & lootingPlays well with friends and will guarantee sheer funWill hook you on taking even the side questsSurprise elementsNice car controlCon ( s ) BuggyVery sensitive mouse controlLong questing when playing soloHard at times when playing solo [ Update ] With the rest of the DLCs in this game , it ca n't go wrong .	1
This is a game that can keep your attention . I think at times you get bored because the gameplay does n't change to much . However , if you get a new weapon you feel like its a new day and a new game . Great game !	1
All complaints aside , this game is excellent . I have beaten it three times with several different characters . The Bloodbath Arena DLC is really fun , especially with friends . The Ryder White DLC was somewhat interesting but I did n't like it as much . This is a great deal for an amazing game !	1
I really enjoyed this game . So much fun , though it is a bit repetitive . Great melee action , I like upgrading the weapons . Cool scenery .	1
Purchased this after playing a cracked version . Got it half off , and received a code to purchase Riptide on a discount . Love these games ! I will always purchase from this publisher .	1
I absolutely love the feel of these headphones compared to others , I can not describe how awesomely comfortable they feel on your ears.Downside to these headphones and how prices they are , is that they are stereo and not 5.1 or 7.1 headphones that other headphones can provide like the razor product headphones or the Sennheiser 363D . I would recommend looking at those headphones if you want to be able to use the full 7.1 surround sound feeling in games . Otherwise if you are comfortable with just stereo then these headphones are perfect for you.I ca n't say I am unhappy with my purchase because there is no real con 's to what it is , I somehow expected it to have 7.1 but that was n't promised to what the product was.Hopefully this can help you decide what you want to purchase .	1
I decided to try these headphones after previously owning the Sennheiser 333D gaming headphones . The 333D had phenomenal sound quality courtesy of the USB 7.1 Dolby sound processor ; however , they were easily the most uncomfortable headphones I 've ever owned . They did n't feel bad at first , however , after about thirty minutes , my ears would start aching . The pain would grow in intensity until they became too uncomfortable to continue wearing . I was not alone in that complaint . Well , Sennheiser must pay close attention to customer feedback because the 350SE is the polar opposite of the 333D in terms of comfort . They fit quite spaciously over the ears with no pinching or bunching of the earlobes . There is plenty of room for even large ears inside the cups and the padding feels very soft and comfortable . They never feel uncomfortable , even after hours of use . I just completed an eight-hour training session and experienced no discomfort whatsoever . Sound quality is excellent . It 's not quite as nice as the 333D , but in fairness , as I stated , the 333D utilized a separate USB 7.1 Dolby sound processor instead of relying on your sound card , which in my case is standard onboard . Despite not being quite on par with the 333 , the 350SE is definitely no slouch in the sound department . They still sound better than most headphones out there . When gaming , the sounds were crystal clear . I could clearly hear distinct footsteps , shell casings hitting the ground , wind , radio crackle and many other subtle ambient sounds that usually are n't quite as noticeable when listening through the PC speakers . Music is also very clear and these headphones have decent bass/low frequency sounds in both gaming and music . Although this is a gaming headset , it really excels when used for videoconferencing . The mic is top quality and party on the other end can hear you crystal clear . It worked great with both Skype and Elluminate.Build quality is very nice . The headphones have sturdy construction and the folding action is nice and clean . The cheesy plastic faux metallic accents are still present , but thankfully , not as plentiful or garish as the 333D . The 3 meter cord is a woven fabric and seems much more durable than typical rubber cords . The only downside to it is that it kinks and knots very easily . The headphones fold for easy storage and although they become pretty intuitive to fold after a few times , it would be nice if Sennheiser included some kind of manual or quick tips guide . Your left to figure out how to fold the headset and use the integrated buttons on your own . There is no documentation in the box nor on their website . The rigid carrying case is a nice touch and offers protection for your headset when not in use . The connector is two 3.5mm plugs ( mic & headphones ) . There is no USB adapter included , so this is pretty much PC ( or anything with a 3.5mm jack ) only . It wo n't work with console games like a PS3.If you 're trying to decide among Sennheiser headphones and especially if you 're considering the 333D , I advise you strongly consider these instead , unless you must have the USB adapter . The 333 is fine if you have small ears and a small head ( I 'm talking really small ) . After being too uncomfortable for both me and my teenage son , my 333 's ended up being used by my 10-year-old daughter on her PS3 . She was the only one in the household with a small enough head and ears to wear them comfortably for extended periods . I can happily say , the PC350 will remain all mine ! With excellent sound and build quality and a nice carrying case to boot , these are definitely a good quality headset .	1
These are very comfortable . They have a nice long cord that is wrapped- which is awesome because I have had trouble with my cords getting frayed and this really helps extend their life ! The microphone works great - I use mine MOSTLY for dictation with Dragon software , but also use them for gaming.They have conventional plugs - not usb- that go into your audio out and your mike in . I have used them with a usb adapter with my PS3 too.Love how easy it is to adjust the volume with the little rotating button on the right ear.These are comfortable even at long sessions writing or gaming . They come with a really nice case in case you need to be mobile with them . The case itself is well made and not bulky.I own several pair of high end headphones and Sennheiser continues to be my favorite . When I got my first pair , I thought that they might not last because the materials are fairly lightweight , but I 've not destroyed a pair yet , even though I 've dropped them between my headboard and mattress , off the side of the bed , my cat has tried to eat them ... they seem pretty indestructible.Sound quality is excellent and the volume range is good - they go up loud enough to satisfy but I not so loud I worry about them being too loud if I turn the button all the way . Bass response is great in the games- handles the explosions very clearly and well.Great noise reduction and the mic is good at isolating sound . I am able to dictate and the mike picks up words EVEN when there is a gaming session going on in the house that I 'm not involved in.When you want to quit using the mike , you just push it up and it cuts off.I love these . : )	1
I currently use theSennheiser PC 363D High Performance Surround Sound Gaming Headsetand I have to say that I like the 363 's better . Let me compare the two:363 -- sound quality is refined , better clarity and better high-end sound . ( 363 Wins ) 350 -- sound quality is excellent throughout the range , but lacks the extreme clarity of the 363 ( that said , unless you 're comparing them side by side , as I did , you 're probably not going to notice ) .363 -- USB cable connection . I prefer this , as it 's more usable and can cross over to different inputs ( keyboards , pc 's etc ) . ( 363 Wins ) 350 -- pc cables only ( one for mic , one for sound ) . This is as equally convenient if you 're just using it on your pc . In fact , if you lack USB input availability , this might be a plus.363 -- comfortable . VERY comfortable.350 -- comfortable . Also VERY comfortable . ( Tie ) 363 -- raise the boom for muting the mic ... this is convenient.350 -- the same ... ( Tie ) 363 -- does n't fold up flat , comes with a bag-case.350 -- folds flat and comes with a very nice hard ( er ) case . ( 350 Wins ) 363 -- cable is nice and long , regular cables.350 -- cable is not quite as long , but is coated with fabric and does not tangle . ( 350 Wins ) So , depending on your use -- the 350 's might be better . The prices are nearly the same ( 363s are 299 today , 350s are 250 ) , so if you 're a heavy user , or just very picky , that 's not really an issue.I hope this helps ...	1
My son is a gamer and needed a new headset to replace the original PC 350 Sennheiser headset we purchased back in 2009 . ( We had to replace that one once due to a broken cord , then the replacement eventually developed the same issue . ) This `` special edition '' headset is a much better product in several respects . The cord is braided and seems much more durable , and the volume control is in the earcup instead of the cord , preventing him from constantly pulling on the cord to adjust the volume ( which probably contributed to the cord wearing out so fast - twice . ) As with the previous model , the earcups go completely around his ears , and are very comfortable for him . ( He has had issues with other brands . ) He also loves the setup of the mic in this model much better than the PC 350 . When he slides the mic up and hears the click , it mutes it to allow privacy . With the original 350 , he had to mute it at the volume control on the cord . This special edition also includes a nice , hard-sided case . This product appears to be better designed and a ( hopefully ) much more durable product , absolutely worth the upgrade from the original PC 350 .	1
I think the game name describes itself pretty well ... you control the plants , and you got ta stop the zombies from taking over your yard . Everything about this game is genius ; the level design is simple , yet allows for various twists in the gameplay and strategy . Character names and profiles are extremely clever and humorous . AND , there are just tons of different game modes to enjoy this game.The basic game is the traditional tower-defense . You use sunshine to buy various plants ( that do anything from shoot peas to form walls to ... well , generate more sunshine ! ) . Defend from an army of bobsledding , swimming , dancing , or just braindead zombies , and move on to the next level with its own set of challenges . You earn coins in the course of the game which can be spent to upgrade your plants themselves , provide extra layers of protection , etc.If you want to take a break from progressing around the various parts of your house , you can try one of the minigames that they have available , which offer all sorts of fun twists ... in one game , the zombies are shooting back at you ! In another , you have to smash pots to reveal both the plants and the zombies , and then figure out how to manage the plants that you have against the multitude of zombies you 're bound to unleash.There 's even a zen garden mode where you can plant different `` baby plants '' , and nurture them for extra coins and new varieties . It 's silly but it makes for a great screensaver and a relaxing side activity.The music in the game is basic , but does n't seem to drone on like in other similar games . And the sound effects themselves are lighthearted and great . Zombies ' heads pop off , your plants shoot their peas or spores , and it 's just a fun departure from the realistic gritty stuff that you hear in other zombie games.Graphics are also fairly simple , but as I mentioned before , the character design is amazing , and you can tell that a lot of time and effort went into creating these dozens and dozens of various characters while fitting the theme perfectly.A word of advice to people purchasing this game on Amazon : You can NOT register the key on Steam ( so if you want it in your Steam library , best to buy it over there ) . The purchase on Amazon does require Origin ( EA 's equivalent of Steam ) . People seem to like condemning Origin , though I 've personally been using it since its release ( just like Steam ) , and the only `` downsides '' to it are that the store selection there is extremely limited , and several other features you probably got accustomed to are missing . That 's literally it . So if you are 100 % intent to buy this game via Amazon , you should NOT let that discourage you .	1
my son absolutely loves this game . had to buy zombie toys . he has made tons of zombatars . worth every penny for this one	1
Plants vs. Zombies is pretty much what the title says . You are attacked by waves of zombies in several different 'lanes ' , which you must defend against using militarized plants such as Peashooters . There are many different zombies with different behaviors which you must defend against from the simple zombies that shamble along , football-zombies that are armored and are much harder to kill , to giant ogre-like zombies that wield telephone poles and can smash your defenses flat with a single blow.PvZ is a very good casual game with lots of minigames to pass the time , but there is just enough depth to keep more serious gamers occupied and satisfied.I bought PvZ in a brick & mortar store and have reviewed the product as such . Other reviwers have expressed distress that they must use Origin , a digital software distribution software , to play the game . Origin is Electronic Arts ' software used to distribute most of their games from Battlefield to Plants vs. Zombies . If you do n't want to deal with Origin I 'd recommend going to a brick & mortar store to purchase this game as it is a welcome addition to any collection .	1
Unexplainably fun and strangely addictive . This is from someone who is fed up with zombies.If you take care of your plants , your plants will take care of you .	1
A nice case . Nothing else . Does the job just right . Will be using it for a long time . The only problem is that it only has 3 places to hold the games . Wish it had more .	1
I would like to begin by saying that I think there has been two versions of this case ; one that was released over a year ago , and this currently sold one that is better fitted to the 3DS XL . Also I believe that the case is made for a 3DS XL that is covered in a thin poly-carbonate or polyurethane case . As it fits the system near-perfectly with a skin of some sort on the system than a bare unit.With that in mind , this case protects the 3DS XL quite well and is constructed very nicely . You get exactly what you see in the images portion of this product page . It 's also nice that the case has only the slightest of odor upon opening of the product , and it quickly dissipates within a day or so of airing-out.However if you do not have a skin-style case on your system , I would probably recommend purchasing the Amazon-Basics alternative to this case . As I believe that hard-case is dimensioned for a bare 3DS XL .	1
You are not only buying a case , you are also buying a place to put your frequently used games , AR cards and Stylus.Great Quality . I recommend this to everyone .	1
When I read the item description and customer reviews , I expected an adequate case . Nothing more , nothing less . Well I just received my case today and I love it ! The case is harder than I thought it would be , so my 3ds xl will be well-protected . There are three small pouches inside to hold my games . I 've been able to fit three games into each pouch no problem . Behind the really is a large pocket that can be used to store more games , booklets , AR cards , etc . The 3ds itself fits perfectly into its space ( some reviews say that the case is to big and their 3ds ' move around inside as they carry it , but mine fits just fine.All in all , I think this case is a very good buy to protect your system and games while on-the-go . The only thing I wish this case had is space to fit my charger , but that 's not really a big deal to me .	1
I really like this case . It is awesome for the price . Very sturdy . I feel like my 3DS XL is very secure when I toss it in my back pack . The game slots are nice . The pockets are very useful . I just recently purchased another 3DS XL and I am about to purchase another one of these cases for it .	1
No need for a description . Great case . Holds 3DS XL and games . Get it if you have a 3Ds XL .	1
There is a little too much room for the 3DSXL . It dances around in the case a little bit . But it provides protection , and storage space for about 4 game cartridges.I could n't find anything else out there and I do not regret purchasing this .	1
This is the best case I have found that is more reasonable than a 60 game , 3 system , might as well put some text books in there too , backpack . It is the perfect size for convenience and protection.However , it is just an altered DSi XL case ( I included a picture with the extra space measured ) ; if you plan on using this often , I do suggest putting a bit of padding in because it WILL slide around . 1/2 '' may not seem like a big difference , but it is the difference between the case being useful or not if you drop it.For casual use , what I do , it is wonderful . I can put the few games I plan on playing in there with the system and be on my way . It has a nice tough shell that is n't made of a surface-scratching plastic , like most of the snap on cases do to your system .	1
the case is good quality and reliable , however it is more bulky than i originally expected it to be . its worth it though	1
I bought this to protect my wife 's 3DS and it has done just that because she goes to college and needs some entertainment between classes while keeping her 3DS safe	1
A nice case with a little lanyard loop . My 3DS XL fits snugly while it is wearing its Duraflexi Clear Protector ( separate product ) and fits under the securing strap inside . Nice metal zippers . The 3DS sits in somewhat of a ditch , so the zippers are less likely to scratch it and travel along a bump of fabric . Has 6 game pockets . Not big enough to squeeze in the charger , but I care more about the device . I feel confident in its ability to help protect my Yoshi 3DS .	1
A very nice sturdy little hard pouch for your 3DS , nothing to fancy it has a basic clam shell design with acouple spots for games and what not . But the important part is its nice and strudy .	1
No complaints here - the case is exactly what you pay for . The 3DS fits snugly inside , and you 've got a & # 34 ; flap & # 34 ; that goes over it . I can easily ( without cramming or warping the case ) fit my 3DSXL , 6 games ( a couple stacked in pairs in the set of 4 sleeves ) and a pair of headphones . The case closes with a zipper that pulls nicely all around , and the front and back is protected by a reinforced hard plastic that has just enough & # 34 ; squish & # 34 ; to it that I 'm comfortable tossing this into a backpack knowing that the shock is being absorbed .	1
Good case for the 3DS XL . Its size could be more fit to the portable , though . I hope they make another one .	1
I highly recommend this case for someone looking for a simple case for their 3DS XL.I do n't take my 3DS XL with me much anywhere so I do n't worry about dropping it , but having it in this case while it 's in my desk is a lot better than just having the system by itself there .	1
This pounch is great , there have a lot of space and also is pretty solid , it has easy access to the cartridge , although would be great to have additional slots , but it is ok	1
really overcome my expectations , not just can it save 3-6 game cards ( you can easy put 2 in the same pouch ) but the space is really neat	1
Works great . It gets marked somewhat easily , like little indents in the case and tiny marks , but nothing really noticeable and nothing that compromises the protective factor .	1
I wanted to get the leather case that Amazon sells for the 3DS XL , that 's the one my brother has , but it was not available . This one however is perfect . It has slots for games and secures your 3DS XL perfectly . It closes with a zipper . Check it out , it works great .	1
I have tested several puches , and this one is the best one ! It really protects the 3DS very well , spaces inside are perfect for games and cables.Plus is Nintendo Certified . Love it .	1
I bought this case and one of those plastic see through 3DS XL covers ( the cover protects from scratches ) . This case is made from superior materials . The zipper works smooth every time . The case has all materials intact after almost 3 months of use , with no signs of possible weak spots . Hori , keep up the great work .	1
I was nervous ordering this as some of the reviews stated this case may have been primarily designed for the DSi XL and was a tiny bit too large to snugly fit a 3DS XL . I think they must have redesigned the case at some point , because mine fits like a glove . I also had mine shipped from and sold by Amazon , so if you 're worried about getting older stock with the poorer fit , just make sure you get it directly from Amazon.I also tried out Hori 's Mario and Luigi-themed 3DS XL cases . They are cool looking and just as high quality , but those ones *did* seem slightly too large , and allowed my 3DS XL to move around slightly while inside the case . This one allows no movement , so I ended up preferring this plain black one for the better fit .	1
This will fit the 3ds XL with a little room to spare . I wanted to get a hard case for my son 's game system he is only five and this works great .	1
It has been one of the biggest surprises of gaming for Nintendo with the 3DS . When the 3DS XL was released earlier this year , it definitely expanded already what made the Nintendo 3DS so fun . But , when they announced the Nintendo 3DS was announced , there have been not as many accessories for the Nintendo 3DS XL . Hori 's Nintendo 3DS XL hard pouch fairs well as one of those few accessories where you can not just store the 3DS XL with ease , but it also holds up as well if you have previously bought the Nintendo DSi XL back in 2010 . The system holds comfortably , while sadly it only can hold as many as 3 games from the Nintendo DS and 3DS libraries . My one big gripe about the pouch is that I wish there could 've been more storage for games from the Nintendo 3DS , but there are very few and far between accessories that are actually made for the Nintendo 3DS XL , but this one holds up for the money.Price : B-Storage & Convience : C+Overall : B-	1
My son loved this for his xmas gift . It is something to must have to hold all of his 3DS supplies . I would recommend this for anyone buying a 3DS xl .	1
This was exactly the case I was looking for my 3ds xl , it holds 3 cartridges and has a little pocket for ar cards or other documents , it goes perfectly well with a crystal cover hardshell for the console as the space is big enough to fit the console with the case on , very apply would recommend to anyone that takes care of their stuff like me , very stylish and it is licensed by nintendo , ca n't go wrong there .	1
case hold the 3ds xl perfectly and protects it from the elements . feels sturdy enough to withstand a lifetime of use	1
Ive had the same one for my small 3ds , so of course I got the same one for my xl , works great	1
I wanted a case to protect my 3DS XL , and this case does just that . It has a place for your 3DS XL , 3 game-card slots , and one pocket to store another other cards , styluses , etc . However , if you want a case to be able to hold more , you may have to invest in a more expensive case .	1
Great soft case , fits my 3dsxl perfectly , still ordering a clear hori case for the console itself but for tossing in a ruck on the run this works great and hold extra stuff like stylus , sham cloth , cartridges andmemcards	1
Excellent case for the 3ds xl ! System does move around while inside the case but it 's ok for me cuz I don ` t intend on taking it outside of my home or flipping it around . I agree that the case should come with some internal holders but it suit ` s me well for what I intend on using it for . : )	1
i love it even with the like 1-2 inch but i can see the reason for it they give you that little extra space incase you get like a N3ds Xl cover case in clear etc so it fits nice and snugg its realy neat wish it had more room for games tho but you get what you pay for am i right or am i right	1
As an adult who owns and enjoys playing the 3DS XL looking for a proper case can be difficult because a lot of them are aimed at children with colorful characters and graphics . This case is sleek , black , and high quality . It fits the 3DS XL perfectly and I can store a few extra games in there , so I have everything I need in one spot . It 's thick and sturdy enough so that if I happen to drop it I 'm confident the 3DS will be protected . Great value !	1
Got it for my son and he loves it . Good case as described . All you need to protect your investment .	1
I bring this with me on the train every day to work and it 's perfect . I can fit just the right amount of games and it keeps my 3DS nice and safe .	1
Not many accessories are available for the 3DSXL in America , this is one of the best available . A little spacious in that in does n't keep your system totally tight , but it still protect it , just moves around a little in the pouch . If you want more color and variety and a pouch that fits perfectly I would recommend PlayAsia , although it cost a lot to ship .	1
Good fitting . I like the slot for cards . The color and inner protection is just the way I like it .	1
I 've bought and used Hori products in the past and they have ALWAYS delivered exactly whats promised , the guys at Hori clearly care about delivering a quality product.its a hard pouch , nothing more or less , its got a nice smooth soft interior for your system , space for a spare stylus and 3 games , plus behind the game slots is a small pouch for your system 's AR cards.I did note that there seems to be a bit too much space in the case with just the xl itself inside , however , affixing one of hori 's protectors takes this down to a comfortable and acceptable space , just enough to get a finger or two in to lift the system without having to open the case upside down like I often had to do with the standard 3ds hori pouch.I recommend all potential buyers of this hard pouch consider hori 's duraflex protector as well , here 's the retro mario themed oneB00ECWJEA4for $ 15 bucks I do believe I 've gotten my money 's worth .	1
this case worked excelent for me , i needed something to carry my 3dsxl and i couldnt find a good case in stores , it can also carry 6 3ds games too	1
I replaced my old Microsoft Sidewinder - a mouse I still own and like quite a bit - with this one and am very pleased so far . It 's far more responsive than my Sidewinder ( not the fault of the Sidewinder , it 's like 7 years old ) . For just surfing the web , paying bills , ect . it 's just a mouse ... a very good looking mouse , but just a mouse . For games , though , the high CPI and super-slick pads really do make a difference . It rocks for SC2.As I said above , I really like the look of this mouse . For me , the more flashy gaming mice - the Razers , the R.A.T. , the Corsair , and the Logitechs - are just plain ugly . I have friends who use them and I know they 're quality mice , but what put the Sensei [ RAW ] over the top in my eyes was its classy , minimalist design . The glossy black matches my setup , and the glowing logo is really sharp with it 's pixel-style graphic and crisp white lighting.The software - the SteelSeries Engine - is easy to work with and does what it 's supposed to.A nice looking and excellent performing mouse .	1
This is one well built mouse . The outer case is smooth yet easy to grip . The Multiple buttons work nicely and the movement at my workstation is smooth and extremely accurate . I highly recommend this item	1
Best gaming mouse around . I use a claw grip when gaming and palm for web browsing and nothing comes close to this mouse for comfort . Used both razer and logitech gaming mice and this smokes both by a mile . Super comfortable , slick looking , and accurate . Outside of the terrible Steelseries software that blue screened my Win 8 PC this is a 10/10 mouse . Buy the mouse but do n't waste you 're time with the software .	1
The rubber is a nice touch , and keeps the sweaty hands down to a minimum . This thing looks fantastic , and the white led on top and under the scroll wheel is awesome . You can control the pulse speed as well as turn it completely off . I use this is many top FPS games and it performs extremely well . I took one star off due to the buttons on the left and right side of the mouse driving me crazy ! I kept accidentally hitting them with my thumb and the page would scroll up or down . You can go into the software settings and change this though = )	1
The mouse is very light and glides easily . Install the software from the SteelSeries website and customize it . I 've had a little trouble with the software , but ended up getting it to work . Very high quality .	1
Good quality , functions very well . My only complaint is the weight of the mouse . It 's too light and there are no options for weight adjustment .	1
I own two SteelSeries Kana mice and LOVE them both so much . I wanted to try out the Sensei Raw because it offered adjustable DPI ( in increments of 90 ) , and two side buttons . The mouse is amazing and feel great . The rubberized grip is a little smoother than you would think , but still great for long sessions where you might sweat a little . The two thumb buttons are very well placed but I wish they were a little bigger . The tactile feedback of all buttons ( fingers , thumb , scroll ) are all fantastic and feel great ; not taking too much pressure to activate.My only issue that is personal preference is that the mouse is a little too big for me to use a fingertip/claw grip . I do n't palm my mouse so it was just a little too long and wide for my preferences . I did n't remove a star for this because it 's personal and not a defect of the design .	1
Claw grip , right-handed gamer here . I 'll start off by saying that I have owned MANY gaming mice over the years , starting with the old Razer copperhead and eventually this Steelseries Sensei [ raw ] . I am no stranger to gaming mice . I have either owned or tried nearly every mouse that 's currently out on the market right now.That being said , this mouse is probably the best that I have ever used . The aesthetics of the mouse are extremely similar to the microsoft intellimouse of olde . So if you grew up using one of those mice , this one will feel pretty much the exact same in your hand.The tracking on this mouse is excellent , I have never had any issues whatsoever on any of my mouse pads ( Razer Manticor , Steelseries 9HD , Mionix Propus 380 , Razer Goliathus , and a couple others ) . This mouse performs excellently on any surface that I have put it on.One big plus about this mouse is that , technically , you do n't even really need to install any drivers or the steelseries engine software . The mouse will work perfectly if you simply plug- & -play.The only thing that I would 've improved , is that I would 've liked to have been able to shut off the lighting in the steelseries logo found on the palm of the mouse . I would rather just have the mousewheel lit up.Easily a 5-star product . If I ever break my mouse in a rage , I 'll certainly buy another of these immediately .	1
Mouse is very light so it feels cheap but the matte finish is much better than the glossy . Slipping and fingerprints are n't much of an issue . SteelSeries software for setting macros and managing their devices is horrible , just keep that in mind .	1
I did not buy this from amazon ... But I hope this review will help.This is a must have mouse to any gamer . Specially FPS . I play BF3 and ET multi-player and I consider myself a good player.. And mostly a little above average : ) I was using Razor Diamondback 3G for like 4 years and thought I needed an upgrade . After lot of research I went with this one and I am glad I did . It was solid ... Build quality is good . Fits my hand perfectly . I could feel the difference of tracking between my beloved razor and this . The glides were smooth . It feels like floating on ice . I just bought a 4HD mouse pad , and hope it will improve it further.Sensei vs RAWHonestly I do not really think all the sensei features are used by anyone . RAW is the cut the crap version of Sensei ... Pair it us with a good mouse pad , you will feel the true power of gaming mice.Rubberized surface feels good . And did not attract any dirt or dust . No finger prints on it . The only problem i faced was , I accidentally press the right side mouse buttons often ( I am a right handed mouse player ) . May be because of my grip , but it ended up doing unwanted actions during game play . So i simply unassigned the action mapping to those buttons.SS software is great ! this product is superb ! ! I will be a SS fan now on : )	1
ModNation Racers : Road Trip was my first racing game I picked up for the Vita handheld ; I 'm also pretty confident it 's the only kart racer besides All-Stars . If you can deal with being limited to Ad-Hoc play and want to make racetracks go the ModNation route . This game was everything I wanted and more for my personal taste though . The 'Transformed ' approach is cool as hell and I throughly enjoy all the nostalgic maps created , not to mention the incredible online play . I think this title is a MUST for any Vita owner .	1
This game is one of the best racing games I have ever played . It has great controls and is genuinely challenging with AI opponents that do n't cheat or & # 34 ; rubberband & # 34 ; to the player , and it has online and ad hoc modes , too . If you are going to bother owning a Vita then I would definitely recommend this game . The problem with this game is that there is a character and a track that you can only access with a code in spite of the fact that they are on the game card . The only way to get this code is to buy a brand new copy of the Bonus Edition . There is no way to get this hidden content unless you specifically buy the Bonus Edition with an unused code inside , meaning eventually the world will just run out of codes and this content will be forever inaccessible in spite of the fact that it is literally already on the game card . You ca n't even buy a code on the PSN . It has to be inside of an unopened box of the Bonus Edition . The game cards themselves are all identical whether you buy the Bonus Edition or not .	1
It 's really fun to play and it can become a challenge sometimes . : ) If you like adventurous games , then this it ! It would be great tough if you could customize your car like in need for speed .	1
When Sonic and Sega All Stars racing came out I actually casually enjoyed that game it was n't perfect but it was good . Fast Forward 2-3 years later and the sequel sonic and all stars racing transformed comes out and made the original obsolete and even in my opinion better then Mario Kart 7 on the 3ds ( still a great game though ) . The Characters in the game are a good mix everything from the standard sonic , tails , eggman to other people from sega such as B.D joe ( crazy taxi ) to Joe Mussashi ( shinobi ) . The Tracks is what really makes this game stand out from other kart racers most of the tracks change from lap to lap and are designed very well plus there are 4 tracks from the previous game return also which is a nice bonus and a download voucher for a outrun bay track if I assume you buy the game new . I ca n't really compare this game to any other versions such as ps3 , wii u , etc cause this is the only version I played but I assume the graphics have been downscaled some but probably not much because the game looks really nice the graphics are great . It did at first before I updated it seem to have frame rate issues but I ca n't notice anymore . The transform aspect of this game is very well done and makes the game feel like a cross between the original , diddy kong racing , and a little bit of wave race mixed in at the water parts . Really my only problem with this game is the powerups minus a few are kinda meh . Anyway this is a great game to play on the road or at home and if your a sonic or kart racer fan pick this game up.pros : really fun game to play on a portable devicegreat characters , controlsgraphics are goodlots of gameplay time for a kart racercons : slight frame rate issue but I believe it was fixed or seems like itpowerups are n't very good	1
I got this game a day early ( thanks target ; - ) ) and I could n't stop playing it . It 's tons of fun . It looks great ! Finally a proper cart racer for the vita ! There is online but because of the lack of servers I could n't get a game . The game is not as nice in the graphics department as the console version but it looks damn good to me . Pretty close actually . I will be updating my review after more gameplay . I ca n't imagine the online will grow like mario kart 7 or be nearly as fun but when more people get the game I will review the online experience.Edit : Just because it has cartoony animals in it does not mean only children can play it . Adults can play these games as well . I 'm an adult and I love it . Most gamers are actually adults .	1
This is one of my son 's favorite games after the Halo franchise . He loved Mario Kart , so when the first Sonic racing game came out , we got it on our Xbox and he fell in love . Once I unlocked all the levels and characters for him , he just could n't get enough.So I thought I 'd surprise him with this for the Vita . There 's not many games a 9 year old like him has for the platform , so it 's nice to get something I know he 'll play.Graphics are surprisingly well done , and while it 's a bit tougher to control due to the smaller control sticks and layout ( the top right shoulder button needs some texture on it so the finger does n't have a tendency to slide around on it while using it for the `` gas '' ) .The sound is great , the immersive feel of the pseudo surround really makes you hear the crowd as if they 're on the side of you , not coming just from the little speakers on the unit.Loads up quickly , not quite the same lag as there is on the Wii-U so that 's appreciated as well . Between this and the Mario Kart 7 on his new 3DS , he 's in racing heaven for the handheld consoles.And it 's nice to be able to jump right in knowing the tracks already.All in all , for the price , an awesome buy for the Vita .	1
Awesome game that 's definitely fun in short bursts . The best way I 'd describe it is that the game is Mario Kart for adults . Definitely more challenging than Mario Kart and far more innovative . The game will be free on PlayStation Plus soon , so I 'd hold off on buying it .	1
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed Bonus Edition - PlayStation Vita & # 34 ; Sega of America , Inc. & # 34 ; I give it five stars and a thumbs up .	1
While I did not get this item from Amazon , I did pick it up on the day it was released at my local game store . I was initially worried that this would be a watered down version of the console title , but thankfully , I was n't completely correct.Graphically , the game pulls off the nice , vibrantly colored worlds well . Each race is themed around a particular game and has some really awesome things going on in the backgrounds . It is a step down from the console versions , but it 's not too noticeable on the Vita 's smaller screen . The characters , at least the human ones , could have been rendered a bit better , but since you pretty much only see the back of their heads while racing , it 's not a big deal.Performance wise , the game has a few minor hiccups . Mostly in the way of frame rate drops when things get cluttered and busy . It 's not game breaking , but it is annoying when it happens . These performance issues are what knocked it down a half star.Gameplay is amazing . Of course , it 's a racer . But it 's got a nice sense of speed , and power sliding quickly becomes second nature . the game is a breeze when going through C-Class races . Bump it up to B-Class for a good and fair challenge , and A-Class if you want to be frustrated . Seriously , on A-Class , the computer will own you . I 've been playing Kart racers since the original Super Mario Kart on the SNES , but I have had to replay A-Class races multiple times , and on some challenges , stuck on them for almost a day . A-Class reminds me of Demons Souls , but for cartoon kart racers . So , maybe not for your littlest ones , depending on their tolerance for defeat.When I said I was worried about a watered down port , I did n't mean graphics . I expected a downgrade there , after all , this is a portable machine and not a home console . Still , games like Uncharted : Golden Abyss and WipeOut 2048 proved that you can have killer graphics on the little system . I was worried that the console tracks would be re-done to accommodate the handhelds , in other words , a 3DS port like the Lego games . That 's not a knock against the 3DS , it 's just that with the power of the Vita , there is no need to cut corners like the Lego games have done in the past : Re-done levels , omitted features , cut scenes that do n't make sense within the new levels ... Lego Batman and Lego Harry Potter 5-7 , I 'm looking at you . Thankfully , that is not the case . The tracks all have exactly what the consoles have , just not as pretty.And the race tracks are the real stars of the game . The whole hook of the game is that you can go from Kart , to Boat , to Jet at any point . Thus , the stages change in order to allow you to do so . Race along a track and suddenly the road collapses before you , you fall , but your car morphs into a boat and you zip along the water . the bridge across a chasm you 're about to cross gets destroyed by a dragon , and instead of falling to your doom , you morph into a jet and take off after said dragon . All this happens from lap to lap , so certain stages are never the same layout for more than one lap . And that 's amazing.The only other thing I can bring up against this game is that controlling the boat seems mushy . As it should , being that you 're on top of water , but I feel that in an arcade racer , the realism should be kept to a minimum . Especially when the hedgehog that 's all about speed drives a car that goes slower than he purportedly runs . And there are a lot of boat sections , so in my opinion , another half star taken off.Online , the game is great . Of course , I mute all the other player 's voices , because I really do n't feel like hearing people swear up a storm while playing . And that 's not a knock against the game , but rather , the people who ca n't control their mouths . I 've never played in a full lobby , the most people I played against were 6 , but I was able to find games very easily and quickly . And best of all , the game runs just fine online . No lag for me ! Overall , this is a great game . If you do n't have the console version already , get this game . And , if you love the console version so much that you want to take it with you wherever you go , then get this .	1
Sonic All-stars racing Transformed is a great game . The tracks are well designed and challenging . This is not an easy game you have to think about the type of car and how it can handle the course . I got this game for the Vita for about twenty dollars and it was a good investment . There are plenty of tracks and characters to unlock to keep you entertained for hours . If you like racing games with fun factors then Sonic All-stars is a most in any collection .	1
Got it for my nephew , he loves it ! It 's good for kids and adults too ... I have n't played it but this is coming from his mom .	1
really enjoy playing it , can spend hours just racing . controls are very responsive and you can customize them to an extent if you have small hands and dont like using the rb as the accelerate button , have yet to try online but it is on my to do list . graphics are extremely well done , especially compared to some vita games i have played	1
is an excellent game that offers hours of fun for the kids with good quality graphic designs in more and better resolution provided high Quality	1
This might be one of the best PSV games.But it does n't have a manual . I believe something is wrong with SEGA.In fact , it 's the only PSV games I have that has no manual .	1
The first Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing game was tons of fun ! It was great to play with friends and each character felt different from the last because their vehicles and & # 34 ; all star & # 34 ; attacks were unique . Good for parties for sure . But the sequel is EVEN BETTER ! The vehicles are all once again unique and delivers fast paced action . This time , in Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed , the vehicles will change form depending on the racing conditions . The race will start on ground and then turn into a race in the water in which your car becomes a fast boat , and then shift again when a ramp or course sends you airborne into the sky for an airplane race ! In most tracks this all happens within one race , and it 's a great and fun addition to the action that was already there . Back again is the wonderful Sega soundtrack . Both games feature great soundtracks from tons of Sega games and the pickup items to use to either defend yourself or attack other players return . The & # 34 ; All Star & # 34 ; moves are just as cool as ever although some seem nerfed ( in the first game Sonic becomes Super Sonic and dashes through everyone for about 10-12 seconds ) . The game is more fun than the first indeed , but it is not without difficulty . They stepped it up this time around and made the AI smarter and harder to handle so practice makes perfect ! I definitely recommend buying this game not only for fans of the original game , but for fans that enjoyed Mario Kart , Crash Bandicoot Racing , and Diddy Kong Racing as well !	1
Very fun Sonic racing game ! I like that you have many characters to play as ! Wreck-It Ralph is my favorite because he has a cool kart and looks exactly how he does in the movie . Overall great game for fans of Sonic .	1
My kids love this game . The transforming into a plane and a ship adds new dynamics to the Sonic Racing . My son likes playing and unlocking more items keeping him interested in the game .	1
It 's been known that sega has made a turn around . It went from a company with many franchises fading into obscurity to one of the best developers around again . Sonic colors , sonic generations , Virtua fighter 5 FS , ETC . are all hits that put them back in the game . Now they are making another Kart racing game . But do n't write this game off as a copy and paste Mario kart.Gameplay ( 4/5 ) : Sega has tried kart racing games plenty of times . From sonic drift to sonic riders zero gravity . But here 's the thing . Allstars racing transformed takes a few pages from each and every sega kart racer and makes its own book in the process . The game is a simple kart racer but with 3 kinds of racing combined into one . It 's due to the transformations your car has and uses mid-race . The 2 other racing modes besides regular on-road is boat and plane racing . Boat is a lot like it was in sonic riders zero gravity and works great . The waves and the ability to do tricks on them is great . Plane mode is also similar to SRZG but also air combat games . Unfortunately the controls are inverted in flight mode and it took some time to get use to.Graphics ( 5/5 ) : the game looks amazing . Easily better than Mario kart 7 and Wii.Music ( 5/5 ) : good tunes . All are from previous Sega games.Content ( 2/5 ) : this is where allstars racing transformed disappoints big time . Compared to allstars racing it 's successor 's roster is pretty lacking . Where is Akira or billy hatcher ? There 's a billy hatcher stage for crying out loud . But it 's ok to have Pudding ? I never played space channel 5 but that 's just ridiculous ! We do n't need Amy rose . Also the career mode requires so much replaying its ridiculous . Sure the difficulty is fair but I do n't wan na replay the exact same level 3 times.Online ( 5/5 ) : Online is great . Works very well.Overall ( 26/30 ) : While I 'm not pleased with the roster this is a great game . Rather than living in Mario kart 's shadow this game stands on its own .	1
land water and air . Sonic and his Sega buddies in their second racing extravaganza . If you like the first one give this one a try .	1
I did n't expect much from this game . The last Sonic Racing title was fairly clunky , with a frame rate that chugged regularly . The items were weird and confusing and it just did n't feel right . I find this to be true , generally , about any non-Mario karting game ... But I buy most of them anyway , such as ModNation Racers ( which I love despite the load times ) .Reviews kept coming in for this game , though , that made me suck it up and pay the $ 40 . I kept reading that it was the best kart racing game in years , that the frame rate was solid , that it felt right . And with some apprehension , I bought it for PS3.It 's worth the money . It is one of the best kart racing games in years , arguably ever . I do n't think it knocks the best of the Mario Karts off of their pinnacle ( for what it 's worth , I loved Double Dash and MK Wii , but did n't care for MK7 ) , but it 's easily in the same league . Unlike Mario Kart , it has a LOT to do as well . There 's plenty to unlock , the career mode is robust , the game is challenging without feeling cheap and the online functionality is solid ( I had no problem finding matches ) . Doing well as a character unlocks `` mods '' that adjust the kart 's stats , so there 's a good amount of replayability.The SEGA fan service is wonderful too . Ristar holds the flag starting off the race , all of the tracks feature little touches . The transforming concept is put to great use and it 's far more successfully realized than Mario Kart 7 ( which does n't come close ) . The first time you run the After Burner track , drive off a battleship and transform into a plane while jets are dogfighting all around you ... Man . It 's just awesome.I 'm sure many people have mixed feelings on DLC , but I generally welcome it for kart games . If you get the Bonus pack , you 'll get the Outrun track and Metal Sonic to race with , both of which are great . I 'm looking forward to maybe seeing more of these , if they 're cheap enough . One of the biggest downers with Mario Kart was always that they 'd generally release one game per system ... DLC tracks can easily make up for that lull . It 'd be awesome to see some more obscure ones , maybe Wonder Boy ? All in all , this is a GREAT game and completely worth the $ 40 .	1
The new courses and characters are great but the plane and boat controls are n't tight enough ( nowhere as good as kart portions and original . )	1
Way back in the day , I was always a Nintendo fan , and would have nothing to do with Sonic , and avoid Sega at just about any cost . That was up until around 1994 when SEGA created the best arcade racing game of all time & # 34 ; Daytona USA & # 34 ; which even I could not stay away from and admitted SEGA had out done everyone with arcade racing games ... or arcade games in general . Daytona is still found in arcades today , as well as take away stores and wherever else someone might prop up a video game unit.So you can pretty much guess by now I am a big fan of Daytona USA ! But what does that have to do with Sonic & All-Stars Racing ? Well , I happened to catch a video on Youtube that showed the Hornet from Daytona USA being played in this game , and low and behold , it was n't a mod/hack , it really was in the game ! So I just had to get this game ... even tho I read somewhere that the original All Stars Racing was better , I did n't care , I wanted to race as the Hornet ! I soon found out playing as the Hornet was not going to be so easy . Here 's why . In this game , you select a character and race , much like Mario Kart . In fact , it pretty much is a Mario Kart clone , only the characters all have something to do with Sega . You are first given a few characters to pick , but more can be unlocked ... one being AGES which is the Daytona Hornet . It 's called AGES because it does take quite some time to earn enough stars to unlock it.There are a few modes of play you can race . One being versus ( 2 to 4 players ) , another beating staff ghost times , a Mario Kart style of 4 race championships , and career mode . In career mode you can earn up to 4 stars , depending on your difficulty . At first you will only have beginner , moderate and advanced , but you can unlock expert mode too by winning championships . Each time you compete in a race , the next one opens , even if you did n't win it ... which seems kind of pointless , as you just need to be in it to unlock it to race as it whenever you want ... but anyway ... The more stars you earn , the more things can be unlocked when you reach the spot they are on the map to unlock them ... apart from Alex Kidd who will probably already be unlocked when you install the game , as he was programmed to be unlocked for Xmas in 2010 . Most unlocks are a new character , but some are console mods , which give a final upgrade to selected characters . In each race you also earn XP . You try to gain as much XP as you can by winning or else you get less XP for failing to win . The XP will help gain each of the 5 or so mod upgrades for each character . Each mod is different , so you might get a mod where speed or acceleration are really good , but handling might be pretty bad . So depending on the track , you need to decide or figure out which mod will be best , or if that character is even worth trying to win with at all ? Something else that is cool is , like Mario Kart , you just do a couple of laps as the same vehicle , but in other coarses in this game you may also transform into something else to continue the racing ! Hence why the game is called & # 34 ; Transformed & # 34 ; . You may be speeding along as say , & # 34 ; The Hornet & # 34 ; when you come to a transform area where you find yourself transformed into a plane or a boat ! It 's really a cool idea that had worked well for this game ! There are also a few other modes that are not just the same battle to the finish line ... some are ring races , where you have to beat the clock by trying to fly through every ring shown on the screen , if you miss one , you lose time ... others are boost races , where you really need to hit every boost on the track you can nail ... another is drifting , another is a battle race where you try to eliminate the other drivers by hitting them with something 3 times or knocking them off the track if there is no ground below ... and another is boss battles where you tail a tank and shoot it till it explodes.I was really enjoying this game , and I had been playing for about a month , trying to unlock the Hornet ... and that 's when the game stopped being as fun as it was . To get the Hornet , you need to earn 165 stars . You can imagine that each race has a max of 4 stars , there is about 16 tracks to choose from , then it repeats them as mirror mode , and just about each of the 16 tracks has a ring race/boost/drift or whatever to earn another set of 4 stars ... so you can see it does take a while to build up those stars . And once I did unlock the Hornet , then earn all XP Mods ... I found , it 's not the best vehicle in the game ... it takes AGES to earn it , then when you get it , you find that Sonic and Amigo seem to be the best for most tracks . Pretty disappointing , especially when you are expecting that perhaps the hardest character to unlock in the game might contain a mod with full maxed out stats ? But no , it 's an average vehicle.Not only that , but I am now stuck trying to earn 200 stars to unlock the second last level . I expect once you get there , it 's a race , the final mod console , then a final race ? But I am now just finding the game to be frustratingly difficult . I 've earn medium difficulty medals for everything , but when you try hard and expert , it seems some areas are just badly programmed , or an extreme amount of luck is needed . I find myself having to constantly restart races because something happens out of nowhere that gives the AI an unfair advantage ... and you would think expert mode means you can become an expert and figure out strategies etc ... no , it does n't ... it all relies on luck . A few races I did n't think I would win , but got an all star at the last moment and manged to beat the AI by a millisecond across the finish line . However , the AI has done that to me too , many more times than I have , which I think is just unfair AI cheating when you are about to cross the line , and out of nowhere comes someone with a power-boost or rocket , shoots you , you fumble around , and end up coming 8th when everyone zooms past you . SEGA really did not test things well on every stage , on expert difficulties , as I even found one traffic attack stage I can not earn an Expert 4th star for , as crossing the second last barrier does not give you a time extension , making it impossible to reach the finish line.I have given up trying to unlock those last 10 stars to earn 200 to try and get to the last 2 races . I have played enough games in the past like that to know , it 's most likely not going to be worth the time or effort , and if it just plays a ending with staff credits rolling , then who cares . I do n't know if I will ever boot the game up again now . But it has left me with the feeling that the game was fun for a while , but it 's few imperfections and glitches , and annoying AI prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 star rating . Which is a shame , as the controls where great , the graphics good , characters decent , sounds alright , but the music was irritating at times.Oh , and not to forget , the games sound glitches on a few levels ... particularly the Dolphin Tank one . Sounds first where out of sync , then eventually no music plays , and the sound effects are dim , the more you replay it , the worse it get 's . One time it even froze up on me . However , I have not connected this game online , so it 's possible SEGA provided a patch to fix it ? So that 's why I wont count that towards rating the game any lower for bugs and glitches.Overall ? Do I recommend the game ? Well , I 'll ask you , do you like racing games , particularity ones like Mario Kart ? Then you decide if you wan na play it or not . If you like Mario Kart , you should get a kick out of this one !	1
I like this game because I like all the characters and the fact that you can upgrade everything . There are many different kinds of racers .	1
My son wanted to buy this after he tried the demo on PS3 . I was a little hesitant since I had n't played it . Turns out it was pretty fun for a little racer game . It has nice graphics , good game play and quite a bit of variety . We 've all had fun playing it and trying beat each other to the finish line . My daughter loves how you change from car to boat or plane through out the race . It has a good amount of boy/girl options so each gender can be properly represented in the game . It has been a good buy for us .	1
Why is it Sonic ? I do n't know . Do you care ? I do n't . It 's a racing game . It 's nuts . Everything 's happening . Danica Patrick ? Booming sounds . Power ups . Now you 're a boat ! Now you 're a plane ! Do you remember going to the arcade and seeing a kind of off-beat racing game , throwing a quarter in and having your mind blown with sounds and colors ? That 's really what this game is . It can be compared to the likes of Mario Kart , and while there are similarities this is a unique game all it 's own . My biggest gripe is that unlocking all the maps , characters , and so on will take a lot of single-player action , so you run the risk of turning into & # 34 ; that person & # 34 ; who plays a lot on their own and just always has an edge on your friends when they come over the play .	1
As a long time fan of racing games in general I like to play both realistic and fun kart racers . Kart racers have been more than a little sour the past few years with the disappointing Little Big planet Karting , and the random blue shells of Mario Kart Wii . Then this gem of a game shows up . Wow great soundtrack , great graphics , but most of all GREAT gameplay.Take the best parts of Sega & Sonic All star racing and blend them with Diddy Kong racing for N64 and you have a good idea of where this game is going . You have master all 3 forms ( Car , Boat , Jet ) because you will transform at certain checkpoints along the race and you need to be on your toes for the change since they all control differently . The power ups seem very well balanced as well no more infamous BLUE SHELL like weapons whew , instead the `` Swarm '' is the will move into first place make by trying to block 1st,2nd , and 3rd place . It can be out maneuvered and rarely seems like you get cheated since you can see it fly over head and prepare.That comes to this finally point . I nearly always felt like skill stopped me from winning instead of luck . That 's a feeling very few kart racers can give you . Kids to Adults will get a kick out of it , and I hope you do too ! Pros-GAMEPLAY ! ! ! ! -Soundtrack-Graphics-Tons of Old School sega characters ! -Online or local co-op ! ! ! -Budget priced ! Cons-No Ps3 exclusive character ( Wii U gets the Mii , and Xbox gets Avatar ) -A few characters from the first game are not playable ( No Billy Hatcher and they add Pudding , really ? ) -The World tour mode can get hard towards the end , which might be to hard for younger kids . You can turn the difficultly down if need be .	1
Our family LOVES sonic racing all stars ( regular one ) so we were pretty excited to see they made another one with more challenge ( planes and boats to steer as well as cars ) Our 6 year old loves both games and we do too ( parents )	1
My kids love this game . My 4 year old is a beast on everything but the flying parts . We like it .	1
It has many different stages with different tasks to complete . And the vehicles change on each track between a car , plane and a boat .	1
This game has 25 drivers , a lot of game modes and a great variety of tracks ! Is simply amazing with your normal controller and just fine with the Speed Wheel ... But the game is excellent I love it ! ! ! ! !	1
while sonic generations was great ... sonic 4 ep . 2 did not really suit me . when i heard about this game , i wondered if it will be good . and it was more than good ! let us start the review ! sound and music.this game is chock full of memories when it comes to music and stages . great remixes ( seaside hill is my fave ) but if you want the original music , watch outgraphics , gameplay , and camerathe graphics are very good when it mixes old and new school . the gameplay is great , just a lot of things are going on . the camera is perfect . nuf saidreplayibilitylike any racing game , the replayibility is high . there are a lot of modes to choose from ! dificulltythis game is pretty hard . if you do not like a challenge , just stick to c classverdictthis is a great game for many people but if like easy modes and original music , start of with the first one10 out of 10. go and by it , it is amazing .	1
got it for my kids they like to play all the games and it helps them learn to take turns	1
This is an awesome game for young children who want to try another version of mario kart . The stages are fun and it is cool to transform into diffferent things	1
If you enjoy Mario Kart you will like this sonic racing game . Or if you enjoy racing games while being able to shoot and explode other drivers and do whatever it takes to be in first place you will enjoy this game . Controls are super easy and very responsive . its really enjoyable to drive and kick @ $ $ . My only complaint is why do these game always have Limited amount of tracks . At least let us have a Course/Track maker so we can make our own tracks share it online and download tracks made by other people . Imaging the possibility of never being bored of driving the same track again . Trust me there are people who have nothing better to do and will create some amazing tracks and even more amazing than what the developer creates.The game feels different because you get to drive as a car , boat and plane . The game has has various difficulties from easy to expert which is extremely challenging so this game is also for adults . Before going online I would recommend you learn the tracks , practice your driving skills and find a 2 cars which you feel comfortable driving because every car handles differently . otherwise you will get destroyed and feel like never playing the game again .	1
I went into this game expecting it to be just like the last one with a few changes.I was totally wrong , it takes what was good about the last and makes it better and added a massive new elements to make it a brand new game.Again it is a true love letter to Sega fans with new characters to play with including ( wreck it Ralph ) from the excellent Disney movie , as well as other classic Sega characters that where not in the last game and cameos from others.The new game play mechanics are a great change at points on the tracks your vehiclewill transform to a water type ( I.e boat type ) and the mechanics will play as if your really racing in the water ( if a wave shows up you can do tricks and get speed boost ) .Also at points your vehicle will transform into plane flying type and again the mechanics will feel like your flying a plane.The game is challenging and is great for all ages . Gameplay is very fast and more like a racing game then a `` Cart game '' The bonus edition comes with a downloadable code for metal sonic and Sega outrunrace track . ( note the bonus edition seems to be the basic edition of the game and no extra cost ) , and the starting price of the game is pretty cheap for a new game.I would highly recommend this to any one and would be a great gift.Extremely fun pick this one up : )	1
IMO , this is one of the best Sonic games out there . Some races you have a car , then it turns into a boat and sometimes an airplane . The grand kids ( and big kids ) all like racing games . This has a lot of levels to it . ( World Tour ) A lot of areas to unlock . A lot of characters to unlock . You collect a star for each race passed and it takes a certain number of stars to unlock new stages and characters . Different difficulty stages . Easy & medium stage place at least 3rd place . For hard stage you have to take 1st place . A star awarded for each stage . The younger grand kids like the easy and medium stages . The older ones like the challenge of the hard stage . There are lots of other stages to pass besides races . There are sprints , traffic attacks , boost challenge , etc.For the money there is a lot of play in this game . We all thought the graphics for this game was outstanding . There is the & # 34 ; Career & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Match Making & # 34 ; & & # 34 ; Custom Game & # 34 ; . & # 34 ; World Tour & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Grand Prix & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Time Attack & # 34 ; , & & # 34 ; Single Race & # 34 ; . Lots of playing time.Xbox Live there is online multiplayer 1-10 . Co-op 1-10 players . Also has voice capability.Xbox 360 players 1-4 Co-op 2-4HDTV 720P/1080i/1080p	1
My point in giving the title I did is because Wreck It Ralph was my daughter s favorite movie last year , and ALL of the games they brought out are horrible , or as my daughter says & # 34 ; they suck & # 34 ; . Then in comes this game , a great driving game , easy to control , and features some great bonus characters including Ralph.My daughter is in heaven - she loves Sonic , she loves driving games like Mario Kart and now she loves THIS game too.It is a pretty easy game to play too , unlike many driving games with cute characters we have tried . It is very similar to Mario Kart on the Wii , with bonus items to pick up that give you extra speed or weapons and then there is the transformation too into a boat or a plane , which is an added feature that we all loved , no matter what age we were.I would highly recommend this for every Sonic fan , every driving game fan , every family fun together fan.We tried it out of Redbox first with NO instructions included and had no problems at all - the instructions help a bit , but honestly it 's an intuitive game and gives you on screen help at the start anyway .	1
Great game , no complaints , similar to mario kart with a new twist when you go from track to water your vehicle turns into a boat , you go off a cliff and your car turns into a plane , great idea , as much fun as mario kart.Only complaint is not very many items/weapons .	1
My grandchildren love this game ! I was grateful for comments by other parents and grandparents which enabled me to purchase a real winner !	1
Delivered timely , item as described , my boys must have Sonic they enjoy this game very much and can not wait til the next Sonic comes out .	1
Most kids are familiar with Sonic . Most kids are also familiar with various racing games . This is a fun , innocent racing game that is perfect for kids . It has great graphics , some familiar characters , very diverse levels , action aplenty , and loads of unlockables . Up to four people can play this on your family game system , and you can also play over the internet via Xbox Live.This game has several game play variants , including a career race mode - in which you compete against other computer AI racers , Battle Arena - in which you try to knock out opponents by hitting them three times with cartoony traps and weapons , VS racing - in which players simply try to outrun their opponents ( think Mario Kart ) , Battle Race - which combines racing with knocking out opponents , and my personal favorite - Capture the Chao - in which players play a sort of capture-and-return-the-flag game.There is a lot of variety in this game - much more than in a typical racing game , and plenty to keep things entertaining for a good long while . Of course , my kids ' favorite races and competitions are the ones in which they can beat their dad ! This game can be fun for adults , too , in my opinion , though it is clearly designed for the kids . another aspect of the game that will keep them interested for a long time are the numerous unlockable awards , characters , racetracks , and other items . All of these & # 34 ; mini-goals & # 34 ; make the game both more challenging and more fun.This game gets an & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; from me . There are few Xbox games that appeal to my kids that are both innocent and fun , and this is one of the better ones .	1
It has a lot of missions , and campaign is pretty long . I have n't even finished it yet , even though I got it like 2 months ago . It 's awesome to play with friends and with family .	1
AWESOME GAME ! ! ! i 'm a huge Mario Kart fan & while i really like the Wii Mario Kart , it 's not the same without voicechat with family laughing & taunting & yelling at each other . i did try the original Sega Racing & i liked it.but THIS ONE ... . this game is fun & fast ! ! ! ! & WOW ! ! transforming is niiiiiiiice ! ! ! it 's so slick how the maps change too . lot of paths & shortcuts.And you can drift in plane boat and car.The graphics are very good too . I got so used to Mario Kart Wii that when you see this game do these nice effects & that real feel of speed , you 're like a kid again.it has lot of characters to unlock.I 've spent all day Saturday unlocking items & learning the tracks.Listening to remixes of classic Sega tunes like Afterburner ( which i only knew cause it was in Bayonetta ) & the classic golden Axe games & even Shinobi = geek heaven.also this Bonus edition comes with code for Metal Sonic & the Outrun track .	1
My kid put this very high on his Christmas list and said it had to be the & # 34 ; Transformed & # 34 ; Sonic because at some point in the he cars turn into boats.He loves this and if they would just come out with a cheat code for dads where I could beat him on this game , then it would be perfect !	1
Great game . My son loves it very easy game play . Highly recommend this for your kids it will keep them entertained .	1
This is by far one of the best videos games I have played . The variety of racing locations is astounding and beautiful . The game is fast paced and keeps you engaged throughout . What a pleasure , and what fun to play . Absolutely recommended .	1
This game is an absolute joy . I have been a fan of the Mario Kart games since I was a little kid playing on the SNES , and I can honestly say that Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed makes the MK games seem like the racing game equivalent of plain yogurt . The flying areas are especially impressive , and they seem like the fulfillment of mid-90s gamer fantasies of how 3D racing games would one day be . That may seem like an odd way to describe it , but I have simply never played a racing game that made me say & # 34 ; Wow ! & # 34 ; the way this one does . The beautiful level designs and sense of speed make me physically twist and turn in my seat as I try to urge my vehicle in the right direction , and I 've never done that with a game before.There is a ton of racing to do here , with numerous tracks and characters to unlock . Easy difficulties are suitable for players of any age and experience , while the highest degree of difficulty will challenge even veteran racers . For edge-of-the-seat excitement and bloodshot-eye intensity , I have never played a game that gave me a more rewarding experience . Forza-like simulations , arcade racers , and other cart racers all WISH they could be this exciting.The only downside to Sonic Racing Transformed is the presence of some nasty sticking points in the levels . There is nothing worse than being inexplicably caught on a wall or obstacle and unable to free yourself while the competition roars past . This can often be avoided once you 've gained familiarity with the tracks , though it can still be very frustrating . However , the superb quality of the rest of the game makes it pretty easy for me to overlook this problem and keep racing.Sonic Racing Transformed is one of the best games I have ever owned , and it really deserves a look from diehard racing fans and casual gamers alike .	1
The unlockable characters and unlockable race tracks and online play keeps you active with this one . Buy it used though .	1
I had played this game for more 20 hours and it is very funny . I love could can use my own Mii . The game has characters very good . Sonic & ASRT is more difficult that MK7 . The sound and the OST of the game are excellents but the graphics are so so . The game bring the download option for that your friends could play it . The multiplayer online game is very good . I recommend much this game if you want a more option that MK7	1
This game is akin Mario Kart but with a twist . Your vehicle transforms according to your environment . The game has many tracks based on classic Sega games that bring back the nostalgia . It 's a great and fun game over all . Get it !	1
Listen people , who cares about the dumb frame rate ? It more than makes up for with good graphics , heaps of unlock able characters , creative level design , and challenging challenges ! It is fast paced and fun , really gets your adrenaline level up ...	1
This is a great fun game keeps you busy and challenges you from level to level . My daughter loves this game.Thank you .	1
When it has came down to Sonic The Hedgehog , there actually has n't been many driven games made for the speed pf the blurred and blue hedgehog that Sega has came out with . While many gamers have been thrilled with Sonic Generations , there still are those who are awaiting to play more with the speed of Sonic . That had been tried before with the speed of Sonic with Sonic racing games , like Sonic Riders and Sonic Racers . While they have worked mostly well for die hard racers , there are those that have wanted more . Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing was made before as a game for the Nintendo DS , and it really could 've been something worked up upon , that needed the kinks worked out of . Well , a new version has finally came for the Nintendo 3DS . But the question is that does it really fly ? Sonic & Sega All-Stars : Transformed racing picks up a bit better than what had came out for the Nintendo DS before . This time though you have 20 different races to match your way to the top of the leader board . You can play against others online , and through the streetpass as well . You can choose from a bit better of a lineup pf racers from Sonic , to Dr. Robotnik and Metal Sonic among others that were overlooked from the earlier Nintendo DS title . Graphically , the game fairs a bit of improvement from the Nintendo DS title , and it is a bit easier to play , as you compete against others in races around the Sonic and Sega universe from levels like Dragon Bay and Outrun Bay . But the game improves nobly by allowing you to download and purchase extra tracks and other racers through the online eShop , like some of the other Nintendo 3DS titles like New Super Mario Brothers 2 . So you can play against others as Wreck-It Ralph and others in the game with the excitement of the game . The control is a bit better than the past DS game , by streamlining itself with the gameplay as you can race by either land , sea and air on the same race course . It makes the game a bit more extreme than was the case with Mario Kart 7 , which worked with the game better . But nevertheless , it is a improvement on the game that faltered before , by adding too much challenge , but not as much fun.Overall , despite a few missing works , Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing : Transformed is still a much needed improvement on a game franchise that did n't work as well with gaming on the go for the Nintendo DS . What I do like is the extreme new tracks , but there still needed to be more . But overall , there have been many poor racing games for the Nintendo 3DS . But this one sustains a bit more to the punch . It is n't as good as Mario Kart 7 showed , but this follows in suite well . If you have played Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing before for the DS , give this a second look and try it for the Nintendo 3DS.Graphics : B-Sound : B-Control : BFun & Enjoyment : B- for solo play ; B 1/2+ for multiplayerOverall : B	1
if you like sonic and racing games this my be the game for you . its a cool way for me to chill - out on my off time .	1
Bought this game for our son who has enjoyed it . The included code to download a bonus character and level is now expired , but available for purchase from the 3DS eShop for $ 2 .	1
All I know is he had to have the Sonic game but it had to be transformed were the cars turn into boats or something like so that made all the difference in the world to him.Personally I want a cheat code where I can beat him on this game !	1
Since the franchise come out with Sonic and Sega All star racing for the Nintendo DS I always evaluate both Mario Kart and Sonic All Star Racing and for me , the best ( but for a short score form Mk ) are Sonic All Star Racing , for the NDS Sonic and Sega All star Racing DS is Better that Mario Kart DS , is more difficult , had better graphics and sound , in The Wii Mario Kart Wii is better , had more character and the graphics sound and gameplay is better , since we do n't had MArio Kart for The WiiU i ca n't compare Sonic and All Star Racing Transformed but in the 3DS both games had plus over the other , in Mk7 the best thing in the cart customization and the online play ( free and community ) and the best in Sonic and All star Racing transformed is the character variety track 's animations , the race itself and the grand tour mode , over some graphics glitches , regular graphics and bad online mode ( if U played the online mode for Sonic and Sega all star Racing you know what expect ) .Actually U ca n't be wrong to choose between Sonic and All star Racing Transformed and Mario Kart 7 both are excellent games for the 3DS , well and about the console , this game is not exclusive for Nintendo 's console like Mario Kart franchise is so if you what tha same fun for ma mario Kart game in the PS3 or Xbox 360 , Sonic and All Star Racing can do the job . I actually had the Wii U and 3DS versionWell about Sonic and All Star Racing for the 3DSGraphics : The character and cards graphics are medium level , may be B+ graphics , but the scenarios graphics are just fineCharacters : it had a variety of characters to unlock including joe Musagi from Shinobi , each racer with unique abilities to boost , speed , handling , etcLoad time : The loading time in the game may be slow sometimes but is is because the tracks are animated , dynamics and very bigSound : the game had a good soundOnline : it is not the best but is works , sometimes can be very difficult find a rival to race and may be slow , this game had a online store when you can purchase new characters and circuits when Sega release them , if you had the bonus edition of the game you can download Metal Sonic and a new circuit for free.Gameplay : had less cup that Mario Kart but each road is a long one , you can take 3 up to 6 minutes in single circuit , each circuit are dynamic and had various paths ( not short ones ) , the race when are in plane mode can be slow and some difficult/frustrating some timesAfter all , I 'll give this game A- , it has weak point and strong ones but it is really fun .	1
i like this game , it is fun to play . i have played all the other sonic games and they were awesome too .	1
I purchased this because it came with all the expansions for less than the expansions themselves for the PC version.However , I did n't know that the maps allowed fewer players than on the PC version and certain maps are just unplayablely large because as soon as you finally manage to cross the map to capture a point the entire enemy team has traveled to the other side of the and started capturing points behind you . Turning the whole game into a game of hide and seek with vehicles.But Most of the maps are still playable and the game is still very enjoyable .	1
great game great price want the online experience of BF3 and best discount here it is look no further .	1
The game is really well done the graphics are really high end ! the game play is top notch and story is something forgetful but overall the game is def a AAA title a must own for any shooter fan !	1
BF3 was great at launch and is still great today . There are still hundreds of thousands of online players every day , the campaign rocks , co op rocks and even more . Get the premium edition for around $ 40 and you get the premium online service for multiplayer , all the map packs , early kit unlocks and wicked black and gold dog tags to start with . Amazing value for an epic game . I love BF3 and COD but maybe COD should take tips on making one quality game and just add to it like BF3 instead of releasing an updated version of last years game every year at full retail price . Totally worth the money and ships quick ! Get it !	1
BF3 is a great FPS and also to get to know what was coming in the new BF4 . I would suggest you get this edition of the game to familiar yourself with the next game . Why I gave it 4stars is because it does n't have the many movements that are possible in other games such as COD BO , or Halo .	1
interesting history line and good playable content is a great choice and the multiplayer is so good and so competitive	1
My son loves this game and plays it all the time . Fun and thrilling game to play . My son would recommend this game .	1
I loved this game ever since it was out . This is a great package with all the DLC that is already released including the ones that will be released . I got this during black friday for around 27 buck which is less than the amount you 'd have to bay for premium by itself . The only down side is that there is one code for all the DLC . I already had the Back to Karkand DLC and can not save the code this time to give it to a friend as a present lets say . At least the Back to Karkand code could have been separate . Other then that this is a great & # 34 ; bundle & # 34 ; .	1
this game is by far one of the best online games that I have ever played , I have out about 15 days on this game and im still having fun !	1
I have been playing this game already on PS3 . I am not giving a review on the product since it has been out for quite some time and there are plenty of reviews on it ( I personally really like it ) . This is about my experience on a new console , the bundle and the price I paid for it ( $ 40 ) . I decided to get it for the XBOX360 because I have many friends on Live . I must say that the community on Live is a bit less mature than PSN but that 's arguable . I was little disappointed that I can not link my Premium status on PS3 . Also , it is quite the pain to link your Battlelog feed if you had previously had done that on PS3 . This console 's version comes in 2 disks ( must swap between multiplayer and single ) . I was bummed that HD graphics require a 1.5g installation on the hard disk . I only own the 4g XBOX360 ( since it is not my main console ) . This left me with VERY subpar graphics since it will not allow me to install on the 4g it originally has . At least the frame rate holds steady , which can be an issue on PS3 . Overall , I recommend getting this Edition since it is the best bang for the buck , especially if you have not enjoyed this title ( I like it better that COD4 or BO2 ) . Hope this helps !	1
This package comes with ALL DLC MAPS , not included on disk . If you were to buy the premium content on xbox live , you would have spent $ 50 or 4000 microsoft points . But on amazon I paid $ 49 for both the premium download code , as well as a free copy of bf3 , which I will MAKE MORE MONEY when selling to my friends . Heck yeah.this game is the most realistic and diverse first person shooter I have yet to see : bullet drop , a time-period before bullet penetration , many attachments , blinding and lighting up via flashlight , as well as blinding via lasers , spotting enemies for other teammates to see enemies/enemy vehicles on their mini-map , suppressors are n't actually too quiet , the blur ( suppression effect ) is taken into account , showing you are being fired at , the ability to be healed by the medic class , the diverse 4 classes that define battlefield : medic ( assault ) , recon ( sniper ) , engineer ( rockets/vehicle repair stuff ) , and support ( LMGs , mortars , tagging devices , etc ) , and the way each class is beneficial during different times and places , like open places , close quarters , or near vehicles . This game really is amazing.The single player is okay , and exciting but is not TOO intriguing for those who obsess over a perfect Halo campaign.the multiplayer is addictive and highly competitive , but on certain maps the enemy snipes where you spawn , especially smaller , open maps.The premium is very worth it , giving you first priority when waiting for a server to open up , giving you a head start with a few good weapons , it gives you camos for guns and your player you would n't normally get , and the dlc is entirely worth it.with premium you get additional content like assignments to unloke newer weapons you would n't normally be able to unlock . The XBOW and FAMAS are good examples of weapons only premium members can really aquire.overall the DLC is great , and exciting.BATTLEFIELD REQUIRES HIGHER INTELLIGENCE THAN CALL OF DUTY . There are many more complications and realistic factors like bullet drop , destroying buildings , vehicles -land , air , and some seacraft , many attachments that get complicated like flashlights and lasers blinding you , taking fire blurs your screen more , and more dedicated players who like to win . Younger kids would only make the battlefield experience worse . even though it ruined COD , it took the focus off of Halo and Battlefield , giving players like me a chance to gain some real competition . Do n't feed this game to your baby brother thinking he will enjoy dying many times over again because he ca n't play as equally as others .	1
This game is flat out amazing . The flexibility it gives you during a firefight is spectacular . Tanks , jets , choppers , transport helos , AC130s ... .the list goes on and on . Anyone still playing CoD is seriously doing their self a disservice by not playing this game .	1
Battlefield 's selling point has always been the multiplayer online experience . Campaign takes a back seat in light this . However , Battlefield fans will feel right at home with Battlefield 3 Premium . This copy is for anyone who wants BF3 Premium , because otherwise you 'd pay $ 60 for Premium alone . Here , for $ 30 you not only get Premium , but the original 2-disc game.It 's chock full of map packs and weapon unlocks , but it was n't as good as could be . Everything you get with Premium aside from the map packs have to unlocked , and while you get some character camoflauge free , you have to unlock everything else . Another issue are the lack of game on the new map packs . The most popular game types from premium are easy to find , but games like CTF and maps from the Armored Kill pack are harder to find . EA wanted to give the reins of the gaming experience to the players , through custom server rentals , but the reality is that there really are n't any dedicated EA servers for the new map packs.Many player servers recycle through the vanilla maps and Premium ones , but EA should have done more to give players who payed for Premium , better ways to experience more maps with more players . But again , that 's to encourage players to rent a server.Aside from that issue , BF fans who want to go Premium should go no further than this edition of the game . 4 of 5 stars .	1
thank you . It may not be the best product but it is okay . You all have a great day and be blessed .	1
Battlefield 3 Premium Edition is a deal you can not beat ! It comes with all of the extra bonus content that has been released so far in the series . With one more future expansion pack in the work . The DLC is in the online pass code , it grants you all of the DLC that has been out . You have to download it through the in-game menu , not the PSN Store/Xbox live marketplace . So that way you do n't pay extra . I have to say though , be prepared to download a lot of stuff I have to say . All in all a great buy at the price I bought it for .	1
To start things off . I would n't purchase this game if you were n't planning on playing online/do n't have Xbox Live . Even the co-op missions are more enticing than the campaign . Not that the campaign is n't fun it 's just that this game was made to be played online . And if you are going to play this game online I would n't get the standard edition because this Premium edition includes Battlefield Premium which is still 50 dollars if you are downloading it after purchasing the game . Anyways , I am not just some anti CoD fanboy . While this game and CoD are both FPS games , CoD is more of an arcade style shooter where you run and gun the whole time while Battlefield is almost more like a simulator ( not quite though ) . There are just moments in Battlefield that can not happen in Call of Duty . This is a game where working as a team and especially in your own in-game squad is how you score big . It will take some getting used to but trust me when I say that this is the best shooter for current generation systems . Comment any questions you might have and I 'll respond as quickly as I can .	1
I like this shooter but I really cant tell if they changed this game up but the third I think is a little better then tha 4th one I see it did not do good can anybody tell me why	1
I bought this game for my boyfriend and initially it was alot of headache because we were unable to access the premium content but with the help of EA sport and Xbox we were finally able to access the content and this is a great game with awesome game play .	1
My husband asked for this for Christmas and he seems perfectly happy with it . I do n't know much about the game itself , but it was shipped quickly and packaged well .	1
Gah ! Ive done this twice ! Bought a used premium edition game ... Well , obviously the bonus content was redeemed already so that sucked . But anyways this game is beautiful ! ! ! I really love it ! Ive always been a cod fanboy but i wanted to try something new , bo2 came put and i didnt like it much , too much quicksoping and all that cod shiz . Ive always like large maps that require good aiming so in bo1 i really liked the map array . Ive made a great transition over and now hate most cod games haha ! Ive been converted by the battlefield comunity and i love it , there is a scarcity if squeakers and thats great too . Amazing game ! ! !	1
Excellent Game.. I love it.. My Best Game Ever.. I have many games on my xbox 360.. but when I play it.. the rest ( games ) do n't like it when I choose him almost every time..haha . When I play this game I really have a nice time by grabbing my M4 with ACOG sight , M17 pistol , and Parachute Suit ... . it is just Wonderful.. Love the Graphics too.. they are not the best of the best but i think they are pretty good and pretty decent when Frostbite make his launch.So Why this game make my day every day when i play it ? Because Depending on this:1 . Game Mode ... mines are Capture The Flag & TCT Group ( 16vs16 ) & Close Quarters2 . Map ... Many Maps I dont remember lol,3 . 4 Different Classes to Pick on ... 4 . WeaponS+Accessories Config5 . Actual Match Status . Ex : If Your Team is Losing.. Cool Now you 're up to forcing u to Win Haha . If they are Winning.. U can take a nice spot with your Sniper rifle to overwatch if anyone hostile enemy is trying to desert . LoL.So ... 5 Things ... 5 & # 34 ; Variables & # 34 ; that make EVERY MATCH DIFFERENT ... . Sometimes I just want to kill and run.. like COD ... lol , so I grab TCT mode + Noshair Canals Map ( close combat map , fast respawn ) + assault or support class + M4A1 or a M249 for example ... this match would be really different If i had taken a TCT mode + recon Class + a nice bolt Sniper + To show on the sniper in your inner self ( overwatch , kill other snipers , alert about Vehicle or soldiers incomming , to take your UAV and help the team leader scanning the area for possible hostiles ) ... So you see ... This is wonderful ... playing in your unique Style.. And if you r tired ... u can always can change someone of the one & # 34 ; variables & # 34 ; and its other game.I have already many unlocks from weapons -not enought yet lol- vehicles and accessories , so im gon na wait till B4 get better stable servers , EA launch some patches then I migrate to the new one . Hey ! , Sorry for my English if any mistakes.See U on the BattlefieldDeltaTeam Leader Out.. !	1
There are really only 2 big players in the FPS world right now . Battlefield and Call of Duty . Sure there are some other guys out there like Halo , but these 2 games are what people are playing if you want modern weapons based in real world type maps.I like COD and have played them all , but this game is so much fun because it is so much different . The COD games are fun because they play and feel like an arcade game . Sometimes you want more realism and rounds where strategy is more important that twitch reflexes . COD games seem to reward those that can play with high sensitivities over strategy . I would like to state that I do really well on COD games , but I still find it a tad silly that someone can 360 spin 5x and then no scope sniper kill you when you have a sub machine gun within a 15 foot range . Still fun , but can sometimes be frustrating . This BF game gives you plenty of realism is big open maps . You are rewarded more for team work and strategy than who can aim the fastest . Sure speed of aiming is apart of it , but not the main factor in determining skill . I 'm going to give one very cool scenario a friend and I did on BF that has n't compared to any other game we 've ever played.A good tank driver kept messing our team up at a certain point . My friend went support with C4 . I went assault . When the tank came back to the point we had just capped to take us out I climbed on top of a building and started shooting the tank trying to get his attention . As he was swinging his big gun up there to blow me up my friend came out of the bushes on the other side of the tank and placed C4 on him and blew him up before he could shoot me ! ! ! You do n't get that type of reward for team work in most games , but you can and do with BF3 ! !	1
This game was awesome when I got it the same day it came out this game is still awesome . It gotten better with every map pack that came out . I had mw3 when released play 2 days got to prestige 3 lost interest and gave it away black ops 2 prestige master all diamomd camo new map pack revolution out but it boring still battlefield 3 is better then any cod game it holds its own battlefield games will always be the multiplayer game to play call of duty should just quit making games seriously any one that disagrees just ai n't good in bf3 cause they need fast reload or special perks bf3 is the most realistic war game out this premium deal is awesome for newcomers you wo n't regret it I spent 60 for game and another 50 for premium and I do n't regret it so for $ 50 u will be happy warning if u use to cod games it will take time to get use to game play maps are huge but so beautiful only cod fanboys wood hate on this game I play cod games but I 'm a battlefield vet I love bf3 bad company 2 I got dem all	1
I bought this game to give it a try ... I was a CoD fan but I was amazed with this title , I bought the premium edition with all the dlc 's included and let me tell you , it is amazing ! The graphics ( with the HD update ) are incredible for a console , the maps in MP are extremely huge and the online gameplay is very addictive ! You 'll need like 10Gb of HDD space for all the downloads , maps and updates . It is much better if you install the game on your console wich can take as much as 20 Gb with all the downloads ! I strongly recommend this ! UPDATE : The game is just awesome ! With the 2 Discs installed , the 5 DLC 's and all the Updates the game takes 32 Gb of HDD space ... !	1
A very good FPS with incredible graphics and great sound . The premium edition adds so much and makes it a complete experience .	1
The campaign is great , the multiplayer is AWESOME , you get all the cool premium stuff , benefits , and expansion packs , and the best part was , I got this new for only 25 dollars from amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! Oh yeah ! !	1
If you 're looking to get into bf3 , then this edition will help you jump right in . BF3 itself is an excellent war game , with only a few shortcomings that made it lose a star.Cons : 1. no offline bots ( very lame since bf2 had bots , if you wan na do some practice or just avoid campaholic cowards guess what , not gon na happen w/o bots so if you 're rusty , get ready to be a bullet magnet for a while online ) 2 . No respawn protection- this means that you will definitely be getting killed as soon as you spawn in a lot of games ( this also happens a lot when you get revived just fyi ) 3 . Jet Ramming/Glitching- Yep there 's a lot of bad players out there who will feel the need to play dirty b/c they suck and ca n't do well unless they cheat.4 . CONTENT TO DOWNLOAD- There 's a lot of GB space to be taken up by this game so make sure you have the room for it and a lot of time to wait to actually play the game ( I did n't start playing the game till the day after I got it b/c of how much there is to download ) 5 . Combined Classes- Yes , for some reason they felt that the assault class should be combined with the medic class ( so stupid I wan na slap the dummy who came up with this idea and the other idiot who agreed to it ) Also , the SpecOps class is gone so there 's only 4 classes now which is really pathetic actually but you learn to deal with it unfortunately.So , all that being said , BF3 is pretty good but do n't expect it to be as good as the old BF2 except for the graphics which are a little bit better.Also premium is very much so worth it over regular .	1
I love this game and can not wait for the 4th one to come out . I am more of a Play with Friend type of player , and well , these types of games for me are really boring without a good team of friends .	1
I so wish that I had known that a player MUST BE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OLD TO Play this game other than under just Campaign level . This is the first time I have purchased a game that requires an age minimum for playing . If your Xbox Live account age is not at least 13 you can not obtain access to play this game . We have tried calling Xbox , EA Sports , talking to supervisors and doing numerous Google searches . If anyone knows how to get around this please reply to my post . Our 13 year old can play , and he chose to buy it for our soon to be 12 year old so they could play together and the system settings will only allow `` Campaign '' play for the 12 year old .	1
This game is fantastic . I enjoyed the single player elements , I enjoyed the cooperative elements , and I love the multiplayer battles.Fair warning : cooperative is best enjoyed with friends that will not abandon you mid-game . Also , you can rent your own multiplayer servers . This has not been a problem for me , but one may be kicked arbitrarily . Also , the game does have a learning curve.Finally , I would not get it without an internet connection , if that were not already obvious . The DLC is awesome , go premium .	1
As always , many users seem to complain about this particular Battlefield 3 Premium Edition because of the small amount of content being provided for such an extremely high price . In most realistic cases I would have to agree . EA has made plenty of output salary from the previous first time market release edition of Battlefield 3 and now they want more ? ! It may be ridiculous for some , but actually beneficial for others , including I . My friends all purchased the original Battlefield 3 when it released and I never had the time to actually go out and buy it . Now that the days are more settled in my schedule , I was able to purchase this set as a first time buyer and I have not lost anything in spending , but yet gained more content than my friends when they bought the Battlefield 3 prior to release date.As the saying usually goes , it pays off to wait off . Better yet for me because I have been eye-balling this item on amazon for about a month and I was able to catch a significant price drop offered by Amazon for $ 39.99 . I sure did get more than I could ever pay for . Thank you amazon ! As in terms of the game , plenty of action and jump in jump out servers to game on multiplier online . Love the new vehicles and map add-ons !	1
I really like this game a lot , it has quite a high ratings from IGN , prepare for full-scale war with Battlefield 3 , the third major evolution of the long-running online battle franchise . Using the power of Frostbite 2 game engine technology , Battlefield 3 delivers superior visual quality , a grand sense of scale , massive destruction , dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations . As bullets whiz by , walls crumble , and explosions throw you to the ground , the battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before.In Battlefield 3 , players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will experience heart-pounding single player missions and competitive multiplayer actions ranging across diverse locations from around the globe including Europe , Middle-East and North America.Get the premium edition which is the better choice , it 's definitely worth the price .	1
I bought this for my son who is in the Navy to play in his free time and he loves the game .	1
I actually bought this through the Playstation Network , but it was such a satisfying purchase I have to tell people about it anyway.If you love Battlefield as it is , you 'll have a heart-attack when you purchase this . It gives you instant access to all of the BF3 DLC expansion packs . This means any new expansion packs are available to you free . That 's probably the best part of Premium , but it also sometimes presents other free or reduced price downloadable content , such as access to weapons , specialized camo , dogtags , and other such content . I ca n't remember all of the content right off the top of my head , but a Premium membership does give you considerable access to downloadable content.I recommend going Premium for another really good reason . It increases the versatility of your loadout screen and also increases the number of different servers pandering to specific game modes and maps . Another great reason for going Premium is the Battlefield Four cross-over . ( If you buy premium for BF3 , the premium will also work on Battlefield 4 for PS3 . ) If this cross-over appeals to you at all , I suggest you wait until BF4 has undergone extensive updating . It 's going through its infant stages right now , so it may be a few more months before the bulk of the bugs and assorted other problems are fixed . Other than that , extend your battlefield horizons . Go Premium !	1
I do n't feel like I even need to give a descriptionI mean seriously ! This is Battlefield 3 ! ( best shooter since 2011 )	1
all right so the game is pretty good however it would have been good to know that the dlc is not on disk and you have to download an almost 2 gig . patch and the almost 10 gigs of dlc , on disk would be better ...	1
I have the limited edition on PC , and the lack of good maps and modes stink.Got the Premium edition on PS3 , and like it much better , that and the hitboxes seem better console side , I feel like I have to unload an entire clip into somebody on PC for them to die.Definitely gon na avoid getting burned with BF4 and wait for the premium edition as well .	1
Battlefield 3 is the best online shooter out there . It involves strategy and team work . If you get shot , its because you got shot . Many will say Modern Warfare it best shooter . Its simply to explain . Modern Warfare is for boys . Battlefield 3 is for MEN ! This complete premium edition has more replay value than you could imagine . Money well spent .	1
A pesar de que el juego tarda como 4 horas para descargar varias cosas , me parece que esta bien elaborado y el c & oacute ; digo lo acepta perfectamente y trae el paquete completo , no se necesita mas ... .	1
I was really really late to the Battlefield console edition train , I ended up buying this in August of 2013 just as Battlefield 4 was on the way so it was somewhat of a clutzy move but I 'm glad I spent the money . It introduced me to the BF series and it was a very enjoyable experience even though it was cut really short .	1
holy crap this is the best deal ever buy it right now if you dont it comes with every dlc , and a crap load of guns	1
love the game , the premium is worth it every penny . I rather play this MP than the garbage BO2 is .	1
i got the game on pc already since released but got it on ps3 to play with some friends , the game is awesome on pc and also on ps3 , but i have to be honest is better on pc . but overall is the same experience , this is best fps so far	1
Great game , really inmersive gameplay and settings , awesome gaming and fun for me and my family as well . I trully recomend this oneThe fact it comes with a lot of add ons , is just plain awesomeness	1
The multiplayer is really fun . Tons of different guns , planes , tanks , all of that . Comes with tons of map packs too ! Plus , the cover is pretty awesome .	1
what can I say ? this tittle has to be the King of the kings ! is just perfect , and having every expansi & oacute ; n on the game just purchasing the Premium Edition for less than the original Price , make it perfect !	1
My grandson gave this video game a 5 star rating . Because it is a birthday present I asked him to rate it . He says anyone who loves video games would enjoy this .	1
A most excellent entry into the franchise , of Battlefield . The version I purchased has all the DLC and expansion packs , and it literally took me several hours to download and install the upgrades . The gameplay is very realistic , and the aircraft are most impressive ( 1st and 3rd person ) , and of course you 're able to bail out , knife the enemy ( get their tags ) , grab anybody 's weapon and kill with no remorse . This version allows you to go prone too . The server room is so choice , and more choice so you 're able to play with people from around the globe . You 're even able to rent a server and host your own rooms . The realism in this game is surpassing BFBC2 , and I 'm already impressed with EA 's next gen BF game . Mind Candy for adults , sorry kids I hear there is a new mario kart , LOL	1
I only tried a little of the solo campaign . So far , so good.I just do n't like that in multi player , location of enemies and yourself are shown on the map . There should be an option to turn that off if one wishes when creating a server . I only need to know where I am on the map for reference.Multi player is really fun , with a huge variety of things to do . Fly helicopter or jets , drive tanks , motorcycles , jeeps , and others . Shoot them down , get run over by them , etc . You get to rank up and get different weapons and accessories such as scopes for your rifles . Play as medic , ammo supplier , sniper recon , engineer ( repair vehicles and rocket launchers ) . You can switch between the 4 classes when you die during a game . You will die a lot in the beginning . Be patient , rank up , get better stuff . Do a lot of little things to earn points , even if you do n't get many kills . Drop meds and ammo , get points for wounding a player as someone else kills him . Mostly everything gets tallied , how many kills by each different weapon , wins in each category , etc . I think it would take hundreds of hours to achieve everything , other than the trophies . Capture the flag is available in one of the add-ons . Run , drive , or fly the enemy flag back to your base.No expiration date was stated for the DLC code . How generous of EA . But the fine print says they reserve the right to make changes with prior notice on their website .	1
To make it short , this stand by its own compare to other shooter such call of duty mw 1,2,3 . Best graphics , gameplay , all around modern combat . Buy it ! NO CONS !	1
I got this game a while ago , in November . I 've played it for about two months , and I got ta say : BETTER THAN CALL OF DUTY ! I got both this and Black Ops 2 at the same time , and I find myself playing BF3 more than BO2.CAMPAIGN- I have n't really played the campaign . Battlefield 3 is geared more towards multiplayer than single player like COD is . If you want to know more on campaign , read another review.SPEC OPS- I 've always wanted to play Spec Ops , but the matchmaking takes forever and most of my friends hate Battlefield 3 ( they 're all COD fanboys ) , so I ca n't play with them . The key thing to what makes BF3 Co-op more rewarding than COD Co-op is that gaining enough points in BF3 Co-op gives you weapons and camos in multiplayer ! Big benefit right there . ( Ex . MP7 , MP412 Rex , G3A3 , etc . ) MULTIPLAYER- The best multiplayer experience I have ever had yet . Compared to COD , the maps are much bigger , you can drive/fly vehicles , there are more weapons , the graphics are much better , and the sound is , too . Ill get more in depth on that.SOUND- Exemplary sound design . The jets roaring overhead , the tanks firing in the distance , the firefights at an infested objective , all beat anything COD has to offer . The soundtrack though , was n't so memorable . This is one of very few areas where COD wins out . I think COD games have given us more memorable soundtracks than BF3 . The only track I remember in BF3 is the opening theme.GRAPHICS- The Frostbite 2 engine has , yet again , surpassed anything COD has offered . Destructible terrain and buildings , drivable vehicles , gun designs , etc . COD runs on the same exact engine since MW2 , just modified.THE COMMUNITY- Thank The Lord , no 5th graders on 10th prestige here in BF3 . Most players are 13 and up , so it 's a mature audience compared to the 10 and 20 year olds on COD.GUNS- The guns actually sound realistic ! CODs guns sound muffled and plain compared to the ACTUALLY RESEARCHED AND DEVELOPED sounds of Battlefield 3 . They actually listened to the real firing sounds of each weapon and ported it into the game . You can put 3 attachments on a gun compared to choosing a `` 2 Attachments '' proficiency in MW3 or a `` Wildcard '' in BO2 . All guns are balanced in BF3 ( with the exception of the M416 ) compared to the ones in COD ( Ex . AK74u , Striker , ACR 6.8 , etc . ) However , I believe the guns are more intricately detailed in COD . What I mean is that you can see the little curves , ridges , and trademarks on the gun more clearly in COD than in BF3 .	1

Trust me on this , if your going solo , your only going to hate the game because of the unfair advantage the opposing team has.The game is a team effort . Play with peeps you can talk too .	1
Honestly , it 's just another shooter . I would give it three stars , but all the add-on content is a really nice bonus . Battlefield is way better than COD , but it 's hard to give a FPS an amazing rating . But if you want a fun FPS , with great visuals and a huge multiplayer , pick up Battlefield 3 , I do n't regret it = )	1
All I can say is awesome , story is cool . You 'd think you were in the Darn game ! Just rock it . it 's worth it .	1
I recently purchased this game from Amazon.com and I must say that I found it to be quite challenging and addictive . I prefer playing in the single mode campaign because I am still trying to improve my shooting ability in killing as many enemies as possible without being killed myself . I 'm finding out that it takes a lot of skill to accomplish each mission but I do enjoy the challenges this war game has to offer . The graphics are very good and the multiple weapons which you can use to shoot and kill the enemy are also quite impressive . I highly recommend Battlefield 3 Premium Edition over the new Battlefield 4 game because I think that the gameplay is much better and you have more options to choose from . It 's a fun game but it can also be nerve-wracking when you 're under fire from enemy terrorists and trying to kill them off without being killed yourself .	1
There is no reason to purchase the regular version of this game.There is a small bug when you first start your premium membership where your game may freeze , but wait 24 to 48 hours and you should see an improvement.If you can get this new for under $ 45 it is a great deal .	1
So I still have n't played the story mode . But online this is without the most addicting thing ever ! Yeah sure for all the downloads you got ta sit for like an hour , and takes like 9 gigs . But after a half hour playing you already know it 's worth it ! It 's better then any COD game ever made .	1
This is an incredible value ! You get all 5 expansion map packs included in the price , an online pass , and early access to all of the maps . Even though this game came out a while ago , it is still relevant , and still fun . The graphics and physics in the game are excellent , and the gameplay is fast-paced . I would recommend this to anyone who likes first-person shooters , but does n't like Call of Duty that much . There is a lot to do as far as customization goes , so that may take up a lot of your time . A few things I do n't like about this game : no online splitscreen in multiplayer , no local multiplayer , and the new server renting service is quite annoying . Whenever you get into an online game , it essentially puts you into one that is on a server that someone else rents . This allows them to choose the game type , maps , weapons , rules and terms of the server . Since they rent it , they can boot you from it if they think you are a & # 34 ; noob & # 34 ; . That is the only truly annoying part of this thing . Other than those issues , this game is a lot of fun . All out warfare , with any weapon or vehicle . A great deal !	1
This game is so bloody amazing . If you do n't have it , stop right now and just watch the 11 minute footage that EA/DICE released before the game was realesed in October 2011 . It will really pull you in . Then go watch the trailers after it with jets and base jumping . BASE JUMPING ! First time my friends and I did it we were giddy.The single player is long enough . It varies in its action as you will co-pilot a jet on one level , drive/pilot a tank on another level , crawl along moving traines , etc . I did not totally care for the storyline on that cuts scenes . The cutscenes actually look REALLY good , but the storyline was only ok , although better than MW3 in my opinion.The online community is going REALLY strong 17 months later . There are tons of other well written reviews , go read them ! Or save yourself and hour and buy the game .	1
A lot of fun , awesome graphics , exelent online game , very realistic gameplay you feel like in a real battle field .	1
Great game	1
I 've played COD games , I 'm a fan of Black Ops 2 . However , I still think BF3 is the superior online shooter . Sure , there 's no perks or scorestreaks , and it IS a harder one to learn . However , it 's more realistic and technical , making your score more rewarding .	1
This game was awesome when I got it the same day it came out this game is still awesome . It gotten better with every map pack that came out . I had mw3 when released play 2 days got to prestige 3 lost interest and gave it away black ops 2 prestige master all diamomd camo new map pack revolution out but it boring still battlefield 3 is better then any cod game it holds its own battlefield games will always be the multiplayer game to play call of duty should just quit making games seriously any one that disagrees just ai n't good in bf3 cause they need fast reload or special perks bf3 is the most realistic war game out this premium deal is awesome for newcomers you wo n't regret it I spent 60 for game and another 50 for premium and I do n't regret it so for $ 50 u will be happy warning if u use to cod games it will take time to get use to game play maps are huge but so beautiful	1
Battlefield is the BEST online shooter period . Massive battles in tanks , helicopters and boats . No other shooter comes close to the scale of Battlefield .	1
Played this game for 5 months before leaving my little brother the PS3 and moving . A year later and I missed the game . This game came with all the new DLC I never played . I love it all . Will be getting Battlefield 4 on PS4 without a doubt , despite not having seen a second of the multiplayer yet , which is all I care about .	1
This is epic mist get there is a new update which makes it 10000 times better then the laggy one like mic probs . this is a really good game for gameplay . they fixed everything but dlc takes up like 10 gbs of your ps3 now this is as good as my xbox bf3	1
when I bought the game it was a request from my friends he said we could play multiplayer I was n't really sure about the game but after playing I start to see how good it was gameplay was great the shooting was fantastic the graphics are amazing simply out of this world recommended this gamen to anyone who truly loves battlefield	1
I love this game . although you are suppose to be able to download the others but I have n't figured out how yet	1
its BF3 with the premium membership so your just paying 10 dollars for the game for those that have n't picked the game up or gotten the subscription to premium yet	1
BF3 has been an ongoing obsession for quite some time . I got Premium on a deal through Amazon when I got BF4 for PS4 . Worth it . All the maps and guns are fantastic . Love the assignments . Love the game . A+	1
This game is fantastic . I enjoyed the single player elements , I enjoyed the cooperative elements , and I love the multiplayer battles.Fair warning : cooperative is best enjoyed with friends that will not abandon you mid-game . Also , you can rent your own multiplayer servers . This has not been a problem for me , but one may be kicked arbitrarily . Also , the game does have a learning curve.Finally , I would not get it without an internet connection , if that were not already obvious . The DLC is awesome , go premium .	1
What an awesome game in an awesome package with great price ! I 'm so happy that I bought this game ! ! ! Must buy for everyone that love FPS	1
I bought this game as my 1st Battlefield game . Very impressed by the game play and online expericene . Wanted something different form COD which i really like but it has disapointed me lately . This game is ideal for a change and great online play !	1
The delivery was so fast . This game is so classic that even if I played many times on my pc , I still get myself one for my ps3 . Do not miss this fantastic title if you are a fun of the series .	1
BF3 is simply the best game i have ever played . Finally i have found a game that matched the addiction level of the old & # 34 ; Counter-Strike & # 34 ; . I have been playing this game since 2011 's Black Friday , every day , for like 2 hours . Highly addictive in multiplayer mode , especially with the expansion packs which are released every 3 months . Highly recommend buying this game over Call of Duty if you 're looking for multiplayer gaming . If not , COD is probably better in Single Player mode .	1
I 've died so much but people are quiet and far from rude on this . Origin is a PITA as always , I wish I could just have this on Steam . The game has certainly quieted down from last year , but that 's fine with me !	1
Now that BF3 has been out for awhile this edition is definitely the way to go . You get the codes for the base game and the premium edition which contains all the dlc as it 's released . I have n't played multiplayer online since Counterstrike and BF3 to me is Counterstrike expanded and improved to almost perfection . With Premium there are more than enough maps for everyone 's playing style . If you are looking for a good multiplayer shooter this is your game .	1
I 'd played bf3 a bit before on the 360 but it never really sold me , then I got it for free on playstation plus and found that since I had n't been on COD in a long while I apparently needed a good shooter fix and found myself ranking up in a hurry , then I caught this gem on a really good sale and figured & # 34 ; why not & # 34 ; after playing through again with premium I 've got to say it 's worth what I paid for it and will surely keep me playing for a while even if it 's late into the game 's lifecycle.Only downside is it only covers my pc play and I would really love to have it spread across all my play on pc , ps3 , and 360 , because I 'm definitely not about to buy it again just to play on a console ...	1
Sweet Game its a Origin Code but still been good i like it and its good amazon continue down those bundles	1
i ca n't stop to play , you can use the code in origin , after that you will have one of the best FPS multiplayer	1
As the title says , I got this because I played the fun out of vanilla Bf3 and needed a change . Although I 'm extremely against the concept of DLCs , especially EA 's versions and how they make DLCs of everything , I absolutely love Bf3 so I was willing to shell out some money to expand this by a lot . It came with the base game too that I was able to give to my friend .	1
This game is so hardcore . Right now , mostly russian servers are open , as everyone else has migrated to BF3 , so turn your mic on beforehand for guaranteed fun . Rated E 10+	1
Ok so i already own bf3 for the xbox 360 but i though to my self you know bf4 is coming out soon it the online most likely will start to fade away on the console copys of this game so i bought it for the pc and it look great i play it at 1920x1080p hd everything set to ultra so in other words 100 % maxed out at 1920x1080 and i get well over 80 fps and i can play with my mouse/keyboard or my xbox 360 wireless / wired game controller thanks to the xbox 360 wireless receiver for windows & for me review score i give it an92/100this game is great its fun looks great sounds great plays great its an all around great game .	1
the trailer looks good but ive never played the game yet . but the game looks good . so ima save up and buy it	1
for some reason , you have to have a live account to save the game and play multiplayer . I made an account , and signed in , but it said my account & # 34 ; was n't downloaded correctly & # 34 ; . I do n't know why this account has to be downloaded.I have never had to download an account . I 'll try to get it working , but I should n't have to go through this . the only bennifit to the pc version is mods , so I reccomend the console version .	-1
I have never gotten this to work with Windows 8 . I redeemed it on Steam and downloaded and installed it several times but every time it 'll just end up in an endless loop while loading the game ( while showing the loading screens infinitely ) .	-1
Should have listened to everyone elses reviews . This doesnt work . $ 17 WELL spent.every other game on steam works beautifully , theres nothing like spending $ 17 then waiting for 2 hours for it to download , to spend THREE hours trying to get it to work . And to end up with it not working . Very Dissapointed .	-1
It 's ok , I had it on PS3 , and grabbed it on sale . Not much new here . I really hate that you ca n't just draw your weapon at any given time .	-1
The interrogation part ruined it for me . It just did n't make any sense- I mean it was illogical to me . Anyway , I was n't too crazy about the driving , are the walking , or the action part of the game in general , so when they hit me with the interrogation bit , I was done .	-1
As the Story of the game progressed my IQ seemed to lower every 5 minutes of playing . Honestly this is a slap in the face for Max Payne , The gun play is a lot of fun and all , But the story just ruined everything . Rock Star messed this one up bad , Max Payne is suppose to be dark and grim , not focused around Rich teenagers going to night clubs , partying , and being kidnapped by some mindless hoodlums who some how happen to be your opponents , and who probably could n't do basic arithmetic . I gave this two stars because of the story and the feel of the game , Its just not Max .	-1
Welcome to a shooter-gallery that holds your hand and treats you like a drooling brainless ! I could mention and rage about the fact , that max payne took 100 steps away from his noir-feeling and awesome comic-strip-storytelling.I could rage about his MTV-like flickering tranistions in the unskippable ( ! ) chores of cutscenenes.I could hit my head against the monitor after the agonizing account-hell called & # 34 ; Rockstar Club & # 34 ; ( after denying my fresh created account-data it gave me some random name and let me wait for another 15 minutes . Although my steam account should be enough ! ? ) But I will start with the one positive thing in this Game : The shooting.It feels right , it is fast and challenging.And it gives us a satisfying amount of gory killcams.The rest of the game seems to give a shat about he player and puts a fishinghook through our nose to drag us from one flickering cutscene to the next.Rockstar seems to think we are all brainless dumbsters . Too stupid to use a mouse and shoot at things.Best and most hilarious example is the first ( short ) & # 34 ; Tutorial & # 34 ; that makes us read how we move the mouse and press the left button.Seriously ! I could n't believe how patronizing and blatant despising this looks.WTF ? ! You think I am too stupid to shoot at things in a shootergame ? ! And why do you have to force me watching your flickering cutscenes for people with the attention-span of a hyperactive toad ? ! I ca n't even wrap my head around this anymore . This is just a proof of a failing gaming industry that chums up with the brainless crazies that swarm like zombies into a black friday shopping riot.I really do n't know if I have to feel sorry for you or feel angry . In either way I hope you get bankrupt after the cod-kiddies that consume everybit of your & # 34 ; interactive entertainment & # 34 ; are bored once more and need another stimulating kick in their burnt up synapses.Max Payne 3 . A maximum payne in the ... .	-1
I know cases like mine are bound to happen once in awhile , but it 's extremely frustrating nonetheless . I purchased the Steam version of Max Payne 3 and through all the fixes the furthest I can get the game to run is the second legal screen . Freshly downloaded the game does n't start at all . There are a few large threads in the Steam forums addressing this problem , but they have n't been updated in weeks leading me to believe it 's been patched and I 'm the minority still having problems . Asking to reinstall a 30 gig game is demanding , but I 've done it twice already . I 've applied every fix I can find . I have n't had an experience like this in a good decade . I 've seen 15 year old games run better than this . Buyer beware , there is a chance this game is unplayable regardless of your hardware and software setup.Edit : Okay , I managed to get the game running by modifying some launch options and running the game independent of Steam . It was a pain in the ass , and inexcusable . I would have given this game 3 stars if I had n't had to apply the workaround every time I booted the game up but I ca n't let that go . Max Payne 3 is ... okay . It 's nothing like the first two , which is to be expected , but it 's better in some ways . Gone are the cheesy but endearing comic book slide cutscenes , to be replaced by slick , superbly produced ones with great voice acting , good graphics , and well written , but still pretty cheesy dialogue . Bullet time returns better than ever with incredible animation physics that produces grim dazzlement every time you finish off an enemy . Once that wears off though , the game boils down to diving and shooting people , over and over , walking through a corridor to get to the next cutscene or checkpoint . There 's little variation and the game just gets boring . The story is okay , so that will string you along well enough and the production values all around are through the roof , which is expected for an in house Rockstar game . The multiplayer is your standard shallow Call of Duty clone , with a small number of game modes and a handful of weapon and ability unlocks .	-1
Awesome gameplay , amazing graphics , the story was okay , but why are there so many cut-scenes ! The worst part is that you can not skip it . I beat the game , lost the save files , and want to replay it , but I do n't want to waste my time watching all these cut-scenes . I did n't buy a movie . The story is n't that great anyways . I played Max Payne 1 and 2 , so his wife and child was murdered , big deal ...	-1
I think Rockstar is known for their sandbox games . This game is not one of them . This is a series of lightly user influenced cut scenes somewhat formulated into an irritating pretend plot sequence . I give this game minus one stars for forcing me to sign up for the Rockstar Social club . I give this game one star for a working Xbox360 controller on PC setup . I give this game minus one stars for a truly pedantic and annoying cover system . Max often must stand up fully to get into cover again . I give this game minus one stars for incredibly stupid cut scene gameplays ( what I 'm going to describe the game play as ) such as a monumentally dumb one where you have to escort your partner to safety by shooting attackers with a sniper rifle as he moves . This would be fine and dandy , except after the first one , the guy would/should just pick up a weapon from the corpses and help you , but he does n't . The plot was almost completely transparent after about an hour worth of play . All in all I 'd call this game a series of movies about Max Payne . Max Payne goes to San Paulo , Max Payne goes to NY in the past , Max Payne goes to Panama in the past , and Max Payne goes to the Police station , Air port , ghetto , etc etc . None of the characters in the game are in ANY way likable including Max . I recall the first Max Payne games as really fun , sand boxish , and open . This new Max Payne is not any of those things.Pros : Well rendered ? Max looks like Heisenberg from Braking Bad ? Maybe not a pro.Cons : Faulty audio . I turned on subtitles to `` fix '' this . Lame cover system . Lame bullet time triggering where you MUST defeat specific enemies . No sympathetic characters . Completely troperific . Everything said or done in this game is a trope . I think the worst thing though is the way that whenever Max gets to a save point , you get a little pre-rendered or perhaps pre-scripted game sequence where Max says some pithy things . The trouble is that Max switches to his starting weapon after each one . Max also magically *throws* away all his good weapons after `` more significant '' cut scenes . WEAK ! I 'm very glad I bought this game as part of an inexpensive bundle . I would have been even MORE angry if I 'd paid full price .	-1
There are so many embarrassingly long cut scenes that I find myself wanting to play something else during them . I was hoping for a game , not a movie .	-1
had max payne 3 stashed in my going-to-get-to pc games stack . finally decided to install since , at some point in time , i 'd played the other installments of the franchise . install went without a hitch . fired up the game only to be informed that , the game i 'd already paid for , could not be played unless I joined rockstar game 's `` social club '' . what b.s. ! I installed and registered the game through steam , why the he11 should I need an additional account with some lame third-party just to play a paid-for game ? s ( rew you rockstar games ! same to you `` origin '' and `` ubisoft '' ! i 'll never buy any of your titles just to have you hold me hostage as to how I can play MY game !	-1
Code worked but the Rockstar Games server does not . It loaded to Steam but would not launch-got refund . Buy this new , save time and trouble it it takes hours to load the 35 gbs .	-1
I swore after getting screwed by LA Noire that I would never buy another cheesy Rockstar port . I should have checked more carefully because this game crashes when I load it . I ca n't even get past the splash page . I 'm running on a 2nd gen i7 quad core on Windows 7 64 bit SP1 with 8Gb memory - GeForce GT550M.I found out how to get partially around the problem.In Steam right-click on the Max Payne entry in your Library and select PropertiesClick on [ Set Launch Options ] and enter `` -safemode -windowed '' .You can now run the game in windows mode . This should let you specify the graphics options . Once they are what you need , undo your launch options.Now I remember Rockstar wo n't let you play your own games until you give them your email address.I hate Rockstar .	-1
These games require Steam to play and Steam makes everything more difficult . It was n't on the package details but if you click through on the individual games it does in fact state that Steam is required . Crusaders actually has a learning curve but it 's fun and I would n't know about Magik and Swords because they wo n't play and after looking at the Steam forums I see there is a known fix that I need to implement . Just glad it was only $ 9 .	-1
Magicka basically requires you to memorize useful element combinations for spells and run from enemies until you can get a spell off . Sword of the Stars is SUPER slow paced , and although it has a lot of cool space ship design options by the time you finish actually building a ship you have better technology available . Do n't bother unless you have a lot of patience and nothing better to do .	-1
Why is everyone so heavily praising this fraud company ? ! ! They are constantly making these upgrades just to pillage more money out of our pockets ! ! ! Do n't they realize that some people have to work for a living and can not afford to dish out $ 200.00 here and $ 300.00 there , anytime they feel like it ? ! ! ! Are n't they aware that not everyone is a spoiled brat Millionaire ? ! ! ! Why do n't they just release it like this in the first place ? ! ! Truthfully , I 've been a long-time loyal fan of nintendo for many years . But the more these unethical business practices compound , the more I 'm motivated to shift my loyalties . Something to think about anyway .	-1
Sega releases Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection with 50 Games for 20 quidNintendo releases dated and retro Kirby Collection with 6 Games for 40 quid.Pretty unfair for Sega and rather pathetic and undeserving for Nintendo .	-1
On the outside this looks like a great package and when they reduce the price its a bargain , or is it ? These games are ok , but there is some serious faults in them . Specifically , Sabatour , which is one of the reasons I bought the package . It is BROKEN ! no doubt . an absolute graphic nightmare . I ran into so many graphic issues in the fist second of playing ? this game , that it is absolutely unimaginable how it got released . It is a waste of my time to download and suffer through the credits , only to be assaulted by what appears to be textures torn to pieces by the worst programming know to MANKIND ! This piece of software is totally incomplete and lacking any polish at all.Burnout paradise is ok , but the graphics are limited since it was designed for the 360 . Pathetic that you ca n't add upgraded graphics . AND worse that the online component seems closed , guess the servers are off-line . Hummmm , could you have informed the users about that before we bought the bundle , EA ? Since I paid 8.49 I ca n't complain too much . But I would rather have a set of working games than these buggy ones .	-1
I have to disagree with the reviewers that found this game good or even acceptable . It is n't . It 's one of the worst Xbox 360 games that you could play . Read the reviews put out by professional reviewers/critics and you 'll see they agree . The controls are completely hopeless and the game contains so many bugs it 's almost impossible to play it . Game play itself is extremely frustrating and generally unrewarding . Put your time into a game that you 'll enjoy more rather than this stinker . Do n't it buy and do n't even rent it . Avoid this game if at all possible .	-1
... ... . I had read these reviews before I bought this thing . Absolutely one of the worst games ever made . This game looks like something developed in the 90 's .	-1
Gaming headsets have come a long way in the last 5 years or so . There are pretty much three major companies now with a few more fighting for customers . Tritton , Turtle Beach and Astro seem to be the big 3 . Some are fans of one over the other for various reasons , but they all claim to do the same thing . So it boils down to performance , features , and price.Based on those three things , I think there are better headsets on the market.For starters , when I drop a couple hundred dollars on a headset I expect it to be wireless . Not so with this one , which is highly disappointing . I 've had wireless headsets for the last 5+ years no reason to take a step back now.Features and performance : Again at this level of price I expect a certain sound quality , surround sound , blue tooth , etc and the sound quality on these is very subpar . Heck the Turtle Beach X11 or X12 have the same ( if not better ) sound quality as these and are about $ 150 cheaper.Comfort wise , I have used both Astros and Turtle Beach sets in the past and those have always had a nice comfortable fit . But these just seem unnecassarily large and clunky . I mean these are big . I ca n't imagine these being used for extended gaming sessions.If you are looking for a headset with loads of features for around this price point I 'd suggest spending a little more and going with the Turtle Beach XP 500 ( PX5 for PS3 ) or the Astro A40 ro A 50 . You 'll be much happier and they appear to be much better quality than these .	-1
I give it 2 stars because of the design ... It is a step up from my tritton ax pro 's , but the sound quality is a step back . I 'll start off with the balance . The bass was overpowering , and for a high end gaming headset , you 're not in it for the bass , it just muffles footsteps , jetpacks or whatever . Yes you can turn down the bass and I highly recommend you do if you 're buying it to compete , which I did . The second problem I faced with this is the direction in which the the sound was coming . I 'm not sure that this is a real problem or maybe I just got a defective one with some crossed wires , but whenever someone would shoot infront of my I would spin around looking behind me thinking that they were behind me . I 'm not saying go back the old ax pro 's , because they were n't built well , but if you 're looking for a headset that you might have to replace a few parts here and there but get arguably the best gaming quality sound available , find yourself a pair of the original tritton ax pros . They 're cheaper too . The main problem with those were the headset itself ( $ 40 replacement every 2 years or so ) and the inline cable ( $ 20 every 2 years or so ) . I also wish this headset was n't so & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; and had the same connectors as the old headset so that I could try to plug it in to my tritton ax pro decoder box to see if it was the headset that was whack , or the decoder box it came with .	-1
This is a perfect example of expectations not aligning with reality . Our family purchased an Xbox 360 ( our first console ) a couple years ago for our sons ( now ages 10 and 8 ) . We have the Kinect but we 've never played a game that required its own controller , much less one shaped like a hunting rifle.My expectation : I was hoping for a hunting simulation that I could use to gauge my sons ' interest in deer hunting and , more importantly , enrollment in a hunter 's safety course . I thought the game would teach the importance of patience ( do n't take the shot until you 're ready ) and the value of stealth ( be quiet , you 'll scare them away ) .The reality : Packs/herds/groups of animals relentlessly charged at the screen with claws and fangs bared . Our mission was to slaughter as many animals as quickly as possible , so quickly in fact that we the gameplay never stopped to see whether any single hit was a kill shot.The only key difference we could tell betweenCabela 's Dangerous Hunts 2013and shooting games likeHalo 4 , andCall of Duty : Black Ops IIandResident Evil 6is that the mercenaries , soldiers , aliens and zombies are replaced by animals , albeit animals that are n't carrying automatic weapons , missile launchers or hand grenades.The technical points : * The all-new Top Shot Fearmaster tracks your heart rate , adjusting the game conditions and environment accordingly . * The Top Shot Fearmaster intermittently loses its sync and either lags or misses the shot . * The decorative sight serves only as a reminder of how a real rifle should be used and treated with respect . * The two-player mode ( all-new split screen Maneater mode ) was n't nearly as much fun as other two-player games with a split screen ( both Halo 4 andMinecraftcome to mind . ) In summary , it was not love at first sight . While the two-brothers storyline sounded appealing on the back of the game box , the gameplay itself was not what we expected or enjoyed.Rating : One star.DISCLOSURE : This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program , which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback .

I was excited to try a shooting game that actually had a gun . I have n't used one of those since Duck Hunt so the prospect was thrilling . I am terrible at shooting games , but I actually shoot a gun rather well , so I was hoping that I 'd finally be able to play a shooting game well.The game itself is just animals charging at you as you stand in place and attempt to shoot them . Not exactly thrilling , but I was thinking it might be a fun party game with the gunNo such luck . The gun is a nightmare . First of all you have to put a bar either under or over your TV - this bar does not come with batteries , so you need your own . The gun came with a huge sheet of instructions in many languages - but they really do n't help you to actually USE the gun . So we wrestled it into submission and managed to get everything installed and working . Well kind of working , it never really worked . At times it worked great ( for about 2-3 minutes ) then at times it would n't track across the screen properly , and at other times it did n't read the gun at all . We calibrated and recalibrated but could never get the gun to work consistently enough to finish a single game.As far as the game goes , I would buy it used , if and only if you like the rail shooter type games . I would NOT spend the money on the gun .	-1
I wanted to like this game , I had never tried a hunting game before , this was a new game and came with a really cool looking gun , I really wanted to like it , but I was alas disappointed.To be honest , the game is okay . Rather than just having a game like a shooting gallery they try to make a story and give some purpose to what you are doing . But in the end , most of the time the game plays like a rail shooter where the actions comes and goes off the screen and you do n't have to move about in the game . But like I said you get a story with what is going on in the screen , which can be nice for some . There are some more generic challenges and safari type shoots if you do n't want to deal with the story mode ( Which you can also skip through ) .The hardware is the real failure on this though . You have the gun , but you also have to install a sensor bar on top of or below your television screen , it requires batteries ( Not included ) and then I believe syncs with the gun . It only has an on button and a sleep timer , nothing else . They could n't think to put an actual on off switch on this ? Then I was excited to use the gun like a real gun and aim down the sights , but the sights never line up with what is on the screen , it just moves the symbol/reticle around the screen . So what is the use of having a cool looking gun what senses your heart beat if you ca n't aim down the sights ? Also I had problems with the sensor turning off randomly . I tried to figure out what was going wrong but the instructions ( While written in 8 different languages was pretty minimalist , ) offered no help.So even with limited play modes I was hoping to have this maybe be a fun party game , but no luck . The hardware problems and lack of imagination in using the game means it will probably just stay on the shelf.If you have any questions about the game or you would like me to clarify something just leave a comment and I will try to answer .	-1
I 've put on at least 25 screen protectors ... may of them HORI brand and this is the first one that just did . not . work . Not at all . Would not lay down well and there is only one in the package . It picked up lint way too quickly and there were bubbles as it just did n't seem to fit right . That has never happened to me before with a HORI . Very disappointed .	-1
I tried to apply these as soon as my 3DS XL was brand new out of the box . The top screen went on smoothly with no air bubbles whatsoever , but the bottom screen was air bubble galore , and I could not get them out for anything in the world ! I applied and reapplied and smoothed and washed , but that bottom one was not going to go on perfectly like the top screen . I 'm pretty good at applying screen protectors as both my iPad and smartphone have no air bubbles whatsoever ) .I tried to live with it for a couple of weeks , but ended up peeling it off . The screens look so much better ! I believe the clamshell design of the 3DS protects the screen anyway ( an open system like the PS Vita probably does need one though ) . They XL does n't have the problem of the original with the top screen marking the bottom screen . So you could probably save some money . I wish I had . ; - )	-1
I do n't have much to say . I scratched it when installing it and I did not do anything the instructions did not say . It sucks . Lost my money . It looks like an okay product but have some one install it for you .	-1
This product was advertised to fit a 3DS XL . It is the same product for the 3DS . Wo n't work at all .	-1
Simply put they do not fit the Nintendo 3DSXL ! ! ! They are too small most likely for a phone ! ! ! I waited to long to return them ! ! So this is for every Amazon shopper from me DO N'T BUY THEM ! ! !	-1
- The cloth produces lint so it makes things worse instead of help clean the surface.- The screen protectors are n't sealed separately from the rest of the packaged items . Both screen protectors contain a lot of lint and tiny particles.- All that dust and lint will surely be trapped under the screen protector after application using the strange mechanism suggested by Hori and you will be left with a mess . The slightest spec of dust ruin the 3D experience of the upper screen.This is my second time ordering the same screen protector and I 'm left with the same poor results . I have applied tens of screen protectors by other companies on my smartphone , tablet and other electronics but none of them were as bad as Hori's.- To be fair the material of the screen protector itself is okay and I somehow managed to make the lower screen protector work both times .	-1
Got when first buying my new 3DS , as I like to keep things in pristine condition . Opened up and saw that the application diagrams were really vague , but after reading the booklet it came with I figured it out . After application , there was still a number of bubbles that just would not come out after like 20 minutes of messing with it and the screen itself was still sticky . I don & # 8217 ; t know why the outer side was sticky as well , be it a factory error or what but it just was not worth it . I took the protector off and returned it to amazon . Not worth your time , try another screen protector , that & # 8217 ; s what I 'm doing .	-1
Disappointing , these things are really expensive , at 9 $ you only get ONE TRY if you mess up that 9 $ down the drain . Mine came dirty , it was full of dust particles and despite my best efforts a couple got in producing really ugly results . The method of application looks really well thought out but there 's one major problem . When you apply pressure there is no turning back and there 's noway to react in case of a spec of dust . So there 's nothing you can do but pray and roll the dice . The cleaning & # 34 ; cloth & # 34 ; is completely worthless and the piece of cardboard is a joke . For 9 $ They should had made a better product and include another set so you can get 2 tries.This product is not worth it , I should 've used the 9 $ towards Pokemon XY instead ...	-1
Not a fan of tik products . I have played a variety . Most are fun at first , but become tedious quickly . Some of the levels as in wobbly bobbly freeze so that u can not advance . I like the waterfall solitaire . Nice music . Not a fan of the tycoon series of theaters either . Tedious . I would rather try things like gardenscape , plants and zombies , bejeweled .	-1
I 'm not sure what happened but the perfect looking disc I received would n't play on my wii or my mom 's . I do n't know if this is a fatal flaw of a specific shipment of this game or if I just got one bad disc but after reading the case more closely I decided it might not be 100 % for my young child who loves all these dance games.I ca n't comment on the game itself since we never got to play it .	-1
The Hip Hop Dance Experience is a middle to lower tier dance title . It is filled with old school songs that even someone who is n't that familiar with hip hop would know since a lot of them have been popular for years . Overall the game was n't outstanding but it if you can find it decently priced then it is worth a look for the track listing alone if you are an old school hip hop fan .	-1
My daughter and I have ALL the dance games . But I am honestly just having a hard time playing this one enough times to give it a thorough review , because the game has these stupid flashes that happen RIGHT at the body part that is supposed to be moving ! Uh , kinda hard to see where I 'm supposed to put that foot if you make it flash like that ! ! The interface is intuitive enough , the songs are mostly good ( if a little slow sometimes ) , but the annoying flashes are really ruining this game for me . I 'm pretty disappointed .	-1
I bought this thinking it was going to be like the Just Dance 3 or 4 . NOPEI did not like the graphics , they move like robots . I guess if you like dancing like a robot you might like this game.PROS : Has some great fun songsCONS : You have to dance like a robotVery disappointed .	-1
You can get these games on your phone for free . Or if you want them ad free , a dollar or two . This total scam trilogy does n't even include Star Wars HD and that 's only 3 dollars on Android and iPhone ( non HD with ads is , you guessed it , free ) . Do yourself a favor -- save the 40 dollars and put it towards a smartphone . And if you already own a smartphone , why are you even reading this ?	-1
Bought it to give daughter something more to do on kinect but music was n't that good and the whole thing not appealing so she never uses it , another wasted $ 40	-1
With the economy as bad as it is today , people need to get more bank for their buck . Skyrim , Borderlands 2 , and many more have been pushing out for not only quality , but alot of quantity.Angry Birds Trilogy , has neither.Angry Birds is a series on the Iphone/Android where you fling birds at pigs . That 's it.Sure , for $ 1 each , buying 3 decent portable games is just fine.But then , bulk up the price over % 500 and you 've got yourself a stinker.Angry Birds was never even that fun anyways , it was meant to be played on an Iphone for very short time slotsAngry Birds Trilogy has Angry Birds , Angry Birds Seasons , and Angry Birds Rio . Who in their right mind would play Angry Birds Rio ? It 's a cheap , cash in for a god awful movie that blew chunks . If Rovio was somewhat intelligent , they would put in Angry Birds Space , but no.Another thing that this wretched pile of sewage has going towards it is the motion controls . And by god , do they suck . Good luck using the Kinect on this thing , you might as well be playing Fighter Uncaged at that level.But OOOOOOHHHH new levels ! More like 30 more copy and pasted levels put into Angry Birds 1 . How pathetic.Mark up the price point ten fold , put in a cheap movie cash in game for a movie that sucks , and 2 other mediocre games only worth playing for half an hour . Tops.2/10	-1
a straight forward walk , point , and shoot game . Seems like they rushed to get this out to the stores without spending the time to design it well .	-1
I 'm a big fan of The Walking Dead and wanted this game to be good . But allas is seems to be another Movie/TV Show cash grab ( Aliens Colonial Marines also included ) The animations are weak and the action is very robotic . I will admit I got scared a few times and it can be fun at time , but when you get down to it you 're just doing the same thing ove and over ( literally some stops on your trip are exactly the same map you just did ) .It is cool to get some more back story on Daryl & Merel from the TV show but not enough to justify $ 50 on this.Check out YoteSlaya 's Playthrough to see if you think it 's worth it . Search this video on YouTube : RF_1_hvY4Thanks for reading my crippled scribblesP.S . If you wondered if this game has button remapping , it does not only 4 very unusual layouts to choose from .	-1
I had high hopes for this game because I love the walking dead so much . This game is horrible compared to Telltale games the walking dead . The graphics are awful and the game play is repetitive . The best part of this game is when the credits roll at the end .	-1
This game in a few words would be : Do n't be fooled by the name because the game will severely disappoint you . From the moment I put the game on in my system , I could see the lack of quality . As noted by others , the graphics in this game are LAUGHABLE . Running on a 720p TV and HDMI cable , this game looked cartoonish : almost a Playstation 1.5 game.I think the first warning sign should have been the fact the game was cut in price by about 8 dollars from an already surprising $ 45 retail price . Coupled with the fact reviews were scarce across the internet about what this game was really even offering . The gameplay itself reminds me of old PC shooters combined with Oregon Trail . This is a first person shooter but you only get to have like 3-4 weapons at a time and if you want more then you have to give up ration slots ( that heal you ) , and also picking up fuel takes up a slot . ( Meanwhile , Lara Croft can hold like 5 weapons and hundreds of bullets with no problem ) .This game is LINEAR but you get to `` scavenge '' random places for bullets and rations . There are `` side quests '' but it usually involves you being someone 's errand boy and getting them something they need . After you complete the single `` main '' task of the area , you advance by driving to a new location . When you are driving between locations , you can take 3 routes ( high gas cost/scavenge more locations , medium gas cost/scavenge a few locations , and low gas cost/hardly scavenge locations ) . This part really reminded me of Oregon Trail because your car can potentially break down ( remember breaking an axle on your wagon ? ) and also because scavenging on the road was like hunting for food.If you 're like me you bought this game because1 ) You 're a Walking Dead fan boy2 ) You were intrigued by Daryl 's backstory3 ) Seemed like a good deal for about $ 404 ) You thought it could not possibly be THAT badWell , playing an hour I can tell you1 ) I played right into AMC and Activision 's hands by buying the game based off a favorite show2 ) Daryl is just a red neck , not much of a back story to that3 ) At $ 40 it is still a huge rip off , this should have been a $ 5 DLC game4 ) It really IS that bad.Conclusion : If AMC ever pursues a Breaking Bad video game . DO NOT GET IT . I learned my lesson , I hope you save your money . In fact I 'll sell you my copy for $ 10 ... ... ... .UPDATE : So I finished this joke of a game last night . I played a little over an hour for 4 nights after work and it was more than enough time . The most time consuming part of this `` game '' is just driving from one location to the next . I swear , you have to have a new car battery every couple of miles . So I would have to stop to get another battery , or radiator hose , or gas . And after seeing the ending for this , I have to wonder when this game began development . The story could have been one prologue TWD episode but Activision got Kirkman and AMC to make this into a game . It is semi fun to kill the walkers but this definitely should never have been released nor been priced at $ 40 . It 's worth a rent at most and that 's being generous.GRAPHICS : 1/10PLOT : 1/10LENGTH : 1/10GAMEPLAY : 5/10COST : 1/10AVOID ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
So let me see if I understand ... First the game price is $ 37.4ty..something , I signed in to my amazon account to buy it and what do I find ? the game for PS3 is no longer available any more . I signed in today to see if it 's up again and it is , but THIS TIME $ 49.96 ? ? ? ? I see a numerous amount of bad reviews , plus graphics that make you regret if you wasted money on this title . I feel like the real sad truth here is the who was in charge of creating the game design , not that I expected anything better from `` Activision '' after seeing how crappy `` Jurassic the hunted '' was . Well , it 's a shame good idea for a game based on this awesome show was wasted in the hands of a crappy company . I do n't even have to buy this to make sure how bad it is , just go to YouTube and search for the walking dead survival instinct game play ( first reviews will show up ) . And why in the heck is the price s ridiculously high ? I mean get serious please , I think that is what upsets me the most ... this should cost about $ 30.00 the most .	-1
I am a huge fan of zombies . Ever since George Romero 's Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) This game I pre-ordered with high expectations and thats where I went wrong . Expectations lead to let downs ... The graphics in this game are ( No Joke ) PS2 quality . Real & # 34 ; Glitchy & # 34 ; I dont know why AMC would sell the rights to Activision after this garbage they put out . Save your money and hope something way better comes out .	-1
I love the walking dead and love video games so I thought this would be fantastic ... boy was I wrong . It could have been a good game but it never comes together . The story takes place before the tv show when merele and daryl are together right at the outbreak . It 's just a poorly made game . It repeats itself pretty much the whole game..go find something you need and get attacked by zombies . It would be a fine rental game..you can beat it in around 5 and decent trophy count .	-1
I read the reviews before I got this game , so I knew it was n't going to be a good game . But as a fan of the TV show , I wanted to play Survival Instinct for the background story of Daryl and Merle . However , even in this , I was extremely disappointed . Here 's why : Graphics/Audio : The graphics are god awful . They 're the quality of a PS2 game 's graphics . The audio is equally crappy . The only bright spots are Daryl and Merle 's voice actors ( the same ones from the show ) . Other than that , the game sounds terrible . Also , every single cut scene was buggy . The audio kept cutting out and it could n't keep up with the video . So even the cut scenes were n't enjoyable.Story : The story is virtually nonexistent . You barely find out anything new about Daryl and Merle before the events of the TV show , which was why I bought the game in the first place . Basically , you 're just told to go here and do this , then go there and do that . There 's no plot to connect the action . This is the most disappointing part of the game.Gameplay : The core of the gameplay is good , but the overall execution is poor . While it can be fun , it 's pretty much the same stuff throughout the game . There are virtually no new things thrown in to change up the gameplay . Also , the melee combat ( bladed and blunt weapons ) is n't executed well . It feels clunky and it takes too long to swing your weapon , causing a lot of frustration when a horde comes at you . Also , the survivors that you can optionally take with you along the way add almost nothing to the game . You can send them out to get things , which is sort of helpful , but you can easily beat the game without taking in anyone.Conclusion : Do not buy this game , even if you are a fan of The Walking Dead . You will be immensely disappointed , and you wo n't gain anything from playing the game . If you really want to know what little background story on Daryl and Merle the game contains , just look it up on the Internet .	-1
Overall , this game is horrible . After finishing the game in two or three days , I deleted it off my PS3 to never be played again.The game has the rare good points , but overall , it was a waste of money . I enjoy the walking dead series , the comics , and somewhat Telltale 's game.The game takes maybe five hours of game play to finish it . Estimating the time is difficult because there is like a 4 minute load time every single time you die or have to stop for gas or supplies , and I also lost interest until I forced myself to play again.The only interesting mechanic in the game is that there are no powered-up enemy/zombies . Still , you can fight off one zombie easy enough . Put two zombies together and the game makes fighting them stupid . You have to continually push the zombies to stun them , but it only works with one at a time.The mechanic is usually push the zombie , bash the zombie . The number of bashes/slashes depends on the weapon equipped . Use a gun , all kinds of zombies show up to kill you in no time . The crossbow is cool . Still , keeping track of the reusable crossbow bolts is a pain , and it comes in maybe the last level or two.There is an RPG element to it that is really only surface deep . The NPCs pick up like one MRE and need like three to get their health back . The biggest car allows you to pack three people in , but by the time you get it , you will only have like two NPCs . Still , the NPCs are worthless to begin with .	-1
I am a huge fan of Walking dead ! I have watched the show , read the comic books and played the games . This is one game that I wish I did n't even know existed . It almost ruined walking dead for me ! The game follows Daryl in the first days of the apocalypse , as he travels around doing what Daryl does , which usually involves stabbing zombies ... Er ... I mean Walkers , in the head.The game is labeled as a FPS , but you really ca n't do much first person shooting ! You see , ammo and weapons are limited , and to be honest you would have better luck without shooting things , since the sound of gunfire will draw every walker right to you , and odds are , you wo n't have enough ammo to fend them off ! If you are a hardcore fan ( Like myself ) , you will likely enjoy the game at first , but the novelty will VERY quickly wear off ! This is definitely a rental , and not a purchase .	-1
the first game was a blast , this one is repetitious in every area the same zombies and yes you go back to the same areas .	-1
I am a HUGE Walkind Dead fan but this game is just plain boring . It 's so repetitive and the graphics are terrible . I would avoid this purchase .	-1
Got the game for my 5 year old who is obsessed with angry birds . He really did love it for a few days , but went right back to the free or $ 0.99 app downloadable on any phone . Honestly is n't worth the price . This is what happens when developers get too cute with a good idea .	-1
So , I 'm noticing a pattern here . Someone does n't like the game and it does n't matter why , or what reasons they give their review is toasted from the jump . 2 thumbs up and 12 thumbs down for a review that actually holds vital information about the game ? Get real . Seriously . Or get a life.Ok . Here 's my review , which I 'm sure will parrot back some of the things mentioned in other reviews , but I also KNOW FOR A FACT it will have information not spoken of in any other review so far . So try and base your judgement on how helpful it could be , and not how much you personally like the game . I too was highly disappointed when I saw how this game looked . It seemed from the jump an attempt to cash in . Even though the trailer was fake it still had gameplay , so it still counts in my eyes . I was n't thrilled to see nothing was being done to promote this game . AMC is n't going to run an ad for the game during the show the game is based on ? Seems like a rug sweeping to me.I preordered this game to get the ear keychain . I was expecting a rubber ear . What I got was a print out of a picture of an ear sandwhiched between two pieces of plexiglass . Awesome . They could n't have cheaped out more . The ominous signs just kept coming.I got home and I started playing . Right away I noticed the graphics were n't as terrible as I was expecting . The game had a solid opening . The voice acting is fairly well done . The shadows for the flashlight were pretty great . Actually , the whole flashlight system was pretty fun . It brought me back to the feeling I got playing Doom so many years ago . But eventually flaws came trickling out , and for the sake of making this a task to read I 'll list what I can now:1.One save game file ? Are you for real ? For what basically amounts to the video game equivalent of a choose your own adventure story you have a lot of gall giving one save slot.2.Every time you run out of gas or break down from what I can tell you go to the same gas station . Really ? You could n't change the cars on the road or the color of the sign ? or the layout of the office building ? There are four side mission levels that get used way too much and cycled through way too little . This game is like the background to an old Hannah Barbara cartoon . Same thing over and over and over on an endless loop ) 3.If I ca n't hit a zom with a led pipe in my hand because it 's too far away how can that same zom hit me with nothing ? Inconsistent battle physics make for terrible gameplay . Fix that.4.Randomly spawning zombies . Clear a courtyard or parking lot and suddenly it 's full again when you turn back around . Really ? I get that some of the bodies on the streets get up , but zoms seriously magically appear a foot behind me when I just cleared it.5.Go fetch go fetch go fetch . That 's literally all this game is . I hate when people complain about that in games like Red Dead and Dead Island , but there is next to no background story . Find Merle . That 's the story . Now go get me batteries and food kid.6.I 'm supposed to scavenge for supplies in one of the most linear games I have played in the last 4 years ? Lollipop Chainsaw offered more room to explore . Every level is a box roughly one or two blocks in size with a maze of debris guiding your journey.7 . TRASH ! I get it 's the apocalypse . Street sweepers take a lot of gas so nobody is driving them , but items are a range of colors . Did I say range ? I meant three colors . Green energy drinks , white food packs , and red ammo . Now , guess what colors the garbage is ? Red soda cans , green soda cans , white newspaper scattered about . It 's almost impossible to differentiate at a distance . Items light up , but only when they are directly in your cross hairs and you 're close to them . That helps.8.Stealth that is pointless ! You 're told in the opening walkthrough that crouching dampens your noise levels , which it does , but who cares because the zombies do n't hear you ? You can crouch , walk , or run right up behind them without alerting them to your presence . The only time crouching is n't pointless is when you 're hiding behind a sedan.9 . stealth that is repetitive ! Alright , so picture this . You 're creeping around armed with a knife . You sneak up behind a zombie and bury it deep in his skull . Soooo satisfying . Now picture this , you 're armed with a hammer . You sneak up behind a zombie expecting to cave a skull in , hit the stealth kill and BAM ! Oh no wait . Not bam . Bam is the sound of a hammer . But you just inexplicably pulled your knife back out and sunk it into the skull of the zom . You have multiple melee weapons you should have multiple melee stealth kills . It really would n't have taken much more to add.10.There are about 4 different models for zoms . Maybe others are hiding ? Maybe ? 11.Herd Mode is the call of duty bonus game . Shut up . It is.12.So , I can push a car that has an alarm but I ca n't step on one ? Great . Thanks for the zero warning.13.I can step on trucks with alarms ? Really ? Because it really seems like that should be explained . Flashing lights apparently signify both the need to not climb on something , and the need to climb on it . That 's laughable.14.Inventory . How do you know when you have too many weapons or are getting close to your food limit ? Simple . You do n't until you ca n't . So you put some things in your bag and start off on a mission . Then you find a big ol juicy shotgun that would be perfect for decorating the walls of the police station with gray matter . But you ca n't pick it up . Because you have too much stuff already . Sweet . If you want it throw something away because even if you go back to your vehicle you ca n't store anything once the level starts.15.No difficulty level settings ? What game in the past 10 years has n't had difficulty level settings ? For those of you who like to beat a game on Normal and then come back for a slightly bigger challenge on hard forget it.16.There is no going back . My first time through this game I got to the third stop down the road and had no food left . Remember when I said zoms respawn ? This was where it became asinine . There was no food to be found no matter how far into the level I made it , but there were always more zoms bringing me down . So I figured , hey , go to the last post and stock up on juice and food . Except ... you ca n't go back to the last level . So I had to restart the game . Not a big deal since the game is about 3 hours long , but still . You ca n't replay levels at all ? Bunk.17.The game is all of three hours long . To put it in perspective , Colonial Marines is a bigger file size than this title . Sure it has replayability , especially if you love the characters , but that 's not really good enough to warrant the 50 bucks this game cost me.18.It 's a stealth game WHY CA N'T I PEEK AROUND CORNERS ? ? ? ( edit : A commenter was gracious enough to point out that LB makes you peek aroound corners . I 'm not removing this as a negative however , because that 's something that should ahve been explained in the game , not something you accidently figure out on your own . ) 19.One of the most heavily advertised aspects of this game is the fact that you find out the origin story of Darryl 's Crossbow . You do n't . I really wish I had to say spoiler alert right now , but I do n't . It turns out you had the crossbow prior to the game and Merle was just holding it for you . Gripping . That 's not an origin story . That 's a poor excuse for writing . And once you get it , do n't miss . Because even if you hit the wall directly behind the zom you were aiming at your bolt is gone . Poof . There are bolts sticking out of walls and on the ground that you pick up along the way , but for some reason once you touch it they no longer stick around unless it 's in a corpse . ( sidenote , after downloading an update for this game yesterday I noticed the bolts now only disappear if you completely miss . They will now get stuck in walls behind enemies , slightly better , but still not good enough ) 20.At no point in any of the times I 've played this game did I ever feel like I was playing as Daryl Dixon.Ok . For right now that 's what I find wrong with this game . I 'll add to it as I see fit . But honestly , if you did n't find any of that information helpful or informative there is something wrong with you.Now , what I LIKE about this game is a much smaller list , but here it is ... 1.Decision making . Not just where to go , but how to get there . So even though this game is one box to the next the trip in between almost feels like a game in of itself.2.Decision making . Who gets what gun ? Who comes with on the trip who stays behind ? What do they scavenge for , or do they not scavenge at all ? It adds a sense of urgency every other zom game is lacking.3 . A wide and very forgiving cross hair section means you will definitely hit a zombie in the shoulder and see his head vanish . Why is this good ? Because the aiming system is not all that great.4 . Distraction tactics . It 's cooler than it should be to toss a bottle and watch a wave of zoms turn and scuttle off in it 's direction as you sneak behind them . Cool and satisfying.5.After you beat the game depending on what you achieve while playing certain options will be unlocked for the next time you play . Things like silenced weapons , unlimited ammo , starting with the crossbow and m16 , etc . etc . These things can make the game slightly more fun to play . Unfortunately they only come after you beat the game and probably never want to play it again ... and you can only use one at a time . ( Unlimited ammo and starting the game with the crossbow combined would have maybe made this game worth another play through ) So there . As a huge fan of the books before the show , and the show after the books , and the other game I have to say if they spent all this year working on this game it would be ten times better . As a comparison I played The Road To Fiddler 's Green literally dozens of times and as recently as last month . I like that game more because it did n't try to stuff a bunch of crud in , it just took what it had and did the best it could to make it as good as it could.And , after an hour , my helpful rating is already proof you people are tanking reviews . Take issue with my review ? Feel free to leave a comment .	-1
They should be ashamed of themselves for just trying to cash in instead of allowing production time to come out with something decent . I woulda bought it if it was worth it , this is only worth a rental though .	-1
This game SUCKED . Such a cash grab . You should n't pay more then $ 10 to play this . If you do I 'm sorry	-1
Telltale 's Walking Dead was a gaming masterpiece . Not only did it stay in canon with the whole mythology of The Walking Dead as a whole , but it also did it 's own thing and is unarguably , the best thing in the Walking Dead universe.Now we have The Walking Dead : Survival Instinct , also known as Cash Grab : The TV Show The Game.Story : This area triumphs all other areas of this abomination by being just plain bad . There is pretty much nothing other then hunt this , kill these zombies , walk over here , over there , walk around some more and yeah . Merle and Derle is in it , so you little mongoloid sheep will eat it all up . 3/10Graphics : Nasty . Ugly . Atrocious . Abysmal . Fugly . This makes Colonial Marines look like Crysis 3 . It 's that bad . 0.5/10Gameplay : Stab zombies in the head . Rinse and repeat . Eventually you get a crossbow and maybe , just maybe you can PRETEND to be playing Tomb Raider instead of this garbage . Walking around is abundant as well . Hoorah . 2/10Length : 3 hours . 'Nuff said . ZERO / 10Overall : 1.5 / 10 .	-1
I was contemplating giving this review a title Pathetic Game , but settled on Poorly Designed Game . I love the real AMC TV show , and October can not come fast enough . All I can say is , even the cover is wrong on this one as they claim it is based on the AMC TV Show . The only relation to the TV show at all besides the name is the music , the main character name , zombies , and voices . Otherwise its nothing like the TV show at all.There are a lot of low rated reviews here and I have to agree with most of them and what they have to say . The graphics leave some to be desired . They are dated and Activision should have been able to do much better rendering of the scenes . But they were not that bad , and the game is playable with the poor graphics . My biggest beef is with the save points . Pathetic . Whom ever designed this part of the game should be fired immediately . What kind of moron designs a game with one major save point in a mission ? ? Basically , at some half way point , which many times you are unaware of , the game will place a restart point . It will not SAVE the game , its just a restart point . This is also dumber than a rock . In other words if you do not have hours to play all the way through an entire mission , and you have to exit the game , next time you play , ALL progress will be LOST . Even if you make it to a check point . I got so tired of playing the same area over and over and over and over and over again from the beginning or last check point because of the poor design of this game.In the hospital for example at first I examined each room looking for moving zombies , and much needed supplies . I got pretty far the first round , I got into the cafeteria then got mobbed by 8 zombies at once . I had to start over from the beginning . I had to do this repeatedly until I figured out how to safely clear the cafeteria and the following hall . Then finally I got to a check point after running down the foggy hallway and ending up crashing through the floor into a room with , active zombies of course . In that entire first section before the check point there were plenty of zombies that would take huge amounts of health and they were not even close enough to attack or shove away . WTF ? ? There is one measly soda for health available . The second leg is worse , you have to get out of the room you dropped into with the active zombies in it and run down the hall to a room where you find some guy who wants to help , and you can not accept his help or even talk to him , so why bother ? Plenty of ammo in that room , can not use it though , or you 'll draw dozens of zombies , and of course NO health items at all . You have to run down the other end of the hall into a meeting room to find another measly soda , and more useless ammo.That is just an example of how poorly the game design was in this game . Ammo you can not use or you draw dozens of zombies . Little to NO health items . Zombies that take huge chunks of health off , that you can not run away from . Shoving does not help at all . They either will not lose grip on you , or bounce right back faster than you can turn and run . When you have to deal with more than one or two , consider yourself dead . You have no chance of getting away alive , and if by chance you do , there is no health what so ever to be found so the next zombie that you happen to encounter only needs to look your way at close quarters and your dead ... back to the beginning to play it all over again . BORING ! ! ! ! The controls are stupid . Game designers who are stupid enough to design a two stick control scheme should be banned from the industry . Yes , you need to control Daryl with two sticks . The left one controls forward and backward while the right one controls turning . If a zombie attacks you from the side you lose most of your health trying to turn around to face them otherwise you inflict no damage if and when you can get to those controls because you were using your right hand to try to turn when you should have been attacking while you turned . Lastly , you can clear a room , lock the doors , and zombies appear out of nowhere . Of course , unlike the show , they make no noise what so ever , its all of a sudden a huge chunk of health goes away as they start into you . What is up with the other survivors thing ? They are useless ! ! They can not help you , they can not do anything . Half the time they are gone when you get back or failed their mission.The only thing they did get right with this game was the creepy . It is about as creepy as you can get knowing they are everywhere , and can appear or animate at any time . Dark places , dangers , you never know what is behind the next door or partition . Unfortunately the bad aspects of this game negate anything the creepy can do for it.If they were real game designers , they would have had save game points every new room or end of hall area or at least in every new large room or something . Going back to the beginning was boring and frustrating . There would be no appearances of zombies in rooms that were cleaned and closed off . There would be more opportunities to use guns and not attract more than one or two zombies instead of 20 . Less health damage to Daryl each contact , and much easier to take out a zombie with a basic weapon like the knife . Some way to take on multiple zombies and live , or better yet break way and hide . One stick control ! There would be much more health scattered about.Over all , I found this game frustrating mostly because of being sent back repeatedly to the beginning when killed . Mission areas between restart points were too long and if you go very far into it then died , you had to go all the way back to the beginning . Stupid . Total lack of health to be found . If I 'm going through room and areas rummaging , toss us a frigging bone and give us some health rewards ! I would not recommend this game , not unless you pick it up on the $ 9.99 rack .	-1
I was forced to delete my first review of this game , my opinion changed a lot after getting more time in on it ... I have a couple hours wrapped up in this game , but I have lost all desire to finish it . It has just become so repetitive that I 'm bored out of my mind . Boxing it up to trade in to amazon as I write this review . I enjoyed the first act , but after that I was just not even sure what the overall objective was in the game ... You drive to one spot ... kill zombies ... find new weapons , and maybe a new person . Drive to next spot ... passanger dies because you sent them out with a weapon that they 're not good with to collect gas , food , or ammo , and this just seems to be an on going thing . It 's not really fun at all.I was also able to try out the herd mode because I ordered from gamestop . It 's just like COD zombies without the bells and whistles . No power-ups or anything of that sort , which I kinda like ... you start out in one zone , and after every few waves a new area opens up . The biggest shock about this for me was that it 's only single player , the draw for COD zombies is getting your friends together to play . I also found a spot where I could hide where zombies could n't touch me , I made it to wave 33 like this , and only died because I decided I did n't feel like playing anymore . I pretty much could have went on forever like this ... So this mode is flawed , and I doubt it will ever get patched.Overall the game is just incomplete , and a letdown . I hate to admit it , but like everyone said ... It 's just another quick cash-in by activision .	-1
I 'm a big fan of the series and a moderate gamer . My observations:1 . Linear . To the extreme . The game basically tells you where to go . It will place debris in your way to funnel your path . Not only that , you have the option to jump , but if the computer does n't want you to jump on something , it wo n't let you . Something as simple as climbing on a crate of pallets , or climbing a fence is strictly not allowed . It becomes frustrating after a while because it severely limits your course of action.2 . Respawning zombies . You can never clear an area , no matter how isolated . You can be in a room and kill every one of them , turn around and bam ! A room full of zombies . This is also very frustrating.3 . There 's something wrong with the fighting physics . I can swing a pipe/axe/baseball bat , miss , yet he will somehow damage me with his bare hands . Again , frustrating . Especially since ... ... ... .4 . Food is extremely scarce . You 'll be getting through a level/mission , watching your health bar go down and not find any food at all . Then you die . Which is also frustrating because ... ... ... .5 . There is n't really a save feature . The missions/levels are usually made up of several linear checkpoints/mini-missions . If you begin a level/mission , make it through a couple checkpoints and die ( and you will ) , it will throw you back to the beginning of the checkpoint . However , of you leave the game altogether , it will take you back to the beginning of the mission . This means unless you plan on playing the game from start to finish in one sitting , expect to play many missions over and over.6 . There are several instances in the game where you can not avoid getting grappled by a zombie . It 's a hard-coded event when you pass by a door , or fence a zombie will grab you . There 's pretty much nothing you can do ( if someone has an answer , please share ) . This is frustrating because ... ... ... 7 . When a zombie grapples you , a moving circle appears and you have to time your attack with precision . All the while you 're taking damage . There 's really no way to master this as far as I can tell.8 . Killing zombies is n't as much fun as it should be , mostly because of # 2 . There is satisfaction in sneaking up on a zombie and performing a stealth kill , or ( especially ) using the crossbow ( when you finally get it ) . BUT , loiter too long , or backtrack a little and it was all for naught as suddenly there are multiple zombies again . If you really think about it , there is little reason to kill zombies in this game.I really wanted to like this game , and I slogged through it because of that . That damn train-yard mission alone made me want to give it one star . It has it 's moments , but for every one good one there are eight bad ones . Such missed potential . Imagine the Walking Dead franchise using the Fallout/Oblivion concept . Now that would be a game .	-1
I love the series , and I loved the Tell Tale game , but this was just lack luster at best . Graphics aside , the game-play is just too stiff , and inconsistent . I may have been ruined by playing better games like the Left 4 Dead series , or any other half way decent first person shooter , but Survival instinct does n't bring anything new , or even improve on any of its predecessors . I would be a little more forgiving if they were going to try and do something new , or took a chance to create something innovative , but it failed to do any of that ... So what 's the point ? ( the point was to get our $ $ $ because we love the franchise so much , and they figured they would get our money no matter what . ) The potential was there , but just failed to follow through . Rent the game first and make your own decision . I do n't recommend buying unless it comes down under $ 25	-1
I am a huge Walking Dead fan so had high hopes for this game . It failed miserably on all fronts . the graphics are terrible . The gameplay is totally linear practically a rail shooter . The zombies pop up out of nowhere and completely overwhelm at every turn which makes it very frustrating but I guess that is the only thing that keeps you from completing the game in about 15 minutes . It 's short no matter how you play it . You have a few options that do n't really end up making that much of a difference in the long run because the game just does n't go anywhere . Like an idiot I kept at it , kept trying to find some redeeming feature and just as the survivors are getting airlifted and you think that maybe this is where the good stuff starts , the games ends . The gamer is playing as Daryl Dixon . He goes through a few towns , meets up with his brother Merle and finds a few survivors . There is no strategy , few chances offered to outsmart the zombies . Your options are mainly just blowing heads off or running . Activision obviously made this game to cash in on the popularity of the television series right now but it 's not worth your time or money . TellTale games has a great Walking Dead game series going on . I 'm waiting for the next installment . It 's a DLC series . It lives up to the name Walking Dead . There are so many good zombie games out there , Left 4 Dead , Resident Evil , Dead Rising . I do n't understand why Activision could n't have taken some cues from some of the existing games and done better with this one . It truly just sucks . The voices of the actors for Darryl and Merle from the show were the only good part of the game and earned it one extra star . But please do n't waste your money or time on this one .	-1
The gameplay is boring and stiff but can be ok at times ... full of tedious dull moments the graphics are crap the gameplay is stiff and buggy as times . The other walking dead game is better .	-1
This was put together quickly to capitalize on the series and would only have been good if it came out years ago . Playability is mediocre and the whole thing is rather boring for a first person shooter . The First Dead Island was better . Do yourself a favor and wait until its $ 10 .	-1
When I say `` this needs to stop '' what I 'm talking about is these garbage cash in games . These companies just quickly throw together some crap game and slap a brand name on it that is popular and people just eat it up . Anyone rating this game above a 2 out of 5 stars has no clue what a good video game is . Sorry to be so blunt , but it is the truth . If you are somehow able to find some way to have `` fun '' playing this game , that 's great , I 'm happy for you . That does NOT make it a good game.The graphics are some of the worst I 've seen on the xbox 360 . The environments are just terrible . The player models and animations look like something from the early ps2 or xbox generation.The combat when attacking a zombie is downright laughable . You just kinda stand there slapping them a few time with a knife or baseball bat . There 's no hit detection or anything like that . It 's just all pretty awkward to watch and play.The absolute worst part of all of this is that you can see the potential in a game like this . There was no chance that potential would be realized however . They know if they slap on the Walking Dead name on the game it will sell no matter how bad the game is . With the popularity of the show and the telltale Walking Dead game , it was a no-brainer . Why spend the time and money putting together a quality game ? They made their money and at the end of the day thats all they care about . It 's not going to change until people stop buying these games . You are hurting yourself and the entire gaming community by supporting this game .	-1
If you take graphics that look like they were recycled from 2004 + repetitive , predictable , brain-dead gameplay mechanics + decent license + good voice acting + outdated game engine + small budget -- - > what does that all equal ? This horrible steaming pile of a game that would n't have even gotten published if it did n't have a license on it , and would n't have gotten made if the developer was n't desperate for $ $ and was just trying to keep the doors open.Do n't buy it , do n't play it . Friends do n't let friends play games that are this bad - and no matter if I love you , hate you , or most likely never knew you - you are at LEAST this level of friend to me . Plenty of other games to spend your money on that wo n't contribute to this travesty .	-1
Not nearly as good as I thought it would be . levels are small and very linear and the gameplay is repetitious . Go here , get this , go back and avoid constantly spawning zombies . Once I finally finished it , I did n't have any desire to play it again .	-1
Brought to you by Terminal Reality people who recently not even turned one decent game , and managed to butcher Star Wars universe with awful Kinect shovel-ware . This is another attempt by a game publisher ( Activision ) for a quick cash-in on a really popular AMC series . Not much to say game is extremely linear with really crappy animations and graphical fidelity from 2005 certainly not worth $ 50 ! Most likely you would end up better getting Dead Island for $ 20 with ability to play whole game in 4 people co-op , wait for Riptide sequel this year or State of Decay ( XBL , PC ) ... both look to be a lot more for the price besides familiar title , intro music and two side characters borrowed from the show .	-1
As a zombie enthusiast , I 've liked the Walking Dead AMC TV show . It remains true to the Romero shambling/walking , survival horror genre . So , when a game is made by the same title , you 'd expect that , at the least , the zombies would remain true to their nature in this Walking Dead mythos . You 'd be wrong.While not the biggest complaint I have , the game should rightfully be called the Jogging Dead . That the zombies run at you , could have been a minor annoyance , if not for the slew of other obvious let downs in this product.The dated graphics are the first thing you will notice . They might be considered good on the original XBox , as for the XBox 360 , they are exceptionally dated . The terrain is simple , the stages are pretty small . Even their LOD system for textures seems to be broken - at only about 7 feet away from your character textures look blurry.The pace of the zombies , as I 've already mentioned , is not of the `` walking '' nature . They pretty much jog . Stealth works marginally well , however , where this game breaks a cardinal rule of stealth and survival horror games is that , even simply turning your back on an area/room you cleared can result in zombies spawning behind you . You can clear a room completely , close all the doors , and return to a room full of zombies . IT has limited ammo , as a proper survival horror should , however , it 's random spawning is a huge let down.I was very excited to see an element used in this game that I had n't seen done in years , and out of stage over-world map traversing system , with the possibility for random encounters and events . Once you leave an area , you get to choose where you will go next . You can customize your experience to maximize your travel speed , at the loss of possible random encounters , or vice versa . Here was a great opportunity for this title to shine . However , the random encounters are all pretty much the same - very limited in what you can find , and even the stages look all the same ( a bout 5 different random locations , give or take ) . It is very similar to what the 1998 Fallout 2 game did , however , in this Walking Dead version , most of the time you only get one choice of destination . When you get a choice , it 's between two locations , and there is no back tracking . It 's really just a slightly branching path . The encounters are more boring then they are worth.You have a limited inventory , and it looks like no way to increase your personal store . Nor can you get your other team members to literally pull their own weight . This could be less frustrating if you could return to your vehicle and swap out inventory . This is just another indicator of the stage-by-stage design of this game.This , AMC Walking Dead game , has , in the end , many minor problems , or more , poorly implemented features - each of which , in of themselves , could be overlooked if this product did anything that it does do , better . However , it 's just not exceptional in any way . And , for a 360 title , it 's not even average . The production value is far less than I would expect , even if it were an XBox Arcade title . Doom 2 had more depth and freedom than this title . Wait for the price to hit the single digits , which I am predicting will happen in less than two months , then it 's worth a look .	-1
I will admit I love bad games , but I can admit when a game is a bit of a stretch . This is one of those said games . I love zombie stuff and really love the walking dead but this one just drags , is slow , and honestly kinda boring . I 'm still trying to will myself to enjoy and finish it . Maybe a New Years resolution	-1
Being a big Walking Dead fan , let me start off by saying I absolutely loved the other Walking Dead game ! In my opinion that was one of the better games of the past year . The only problem I had with that game was the lack of characters from the television show , so naturally when I heard of the new Walking Dead game , I could n't wait ! Well ... .I should have . Darryl and Merle are two of the most popular characters on the show , so this was going to be a slam dunk right ? Wrong ! Here 's the problems I have with this game ... ..1 . This game is an obvious attempt to cash in on Dead Island 's success . The same sort of game play , clumsy weapons that do barely damage , lack of ammo , and a lot of time passing between missions and levels.2 . ONE game save slot ! The reason I quit playing this game is when you save it , the next time you turn it back on , you are way behind where you actually were , so you find yourself playing the same ( long ) levels several times.3 . BORING . Sorry guys , this game lacks much action , It may actually put you to sleep . I know I have fell asleep playing this game . The story sucks so bad , which does n't help.4 . BORING ! oh yeah already mentioned that ! 5 . mediocre graphics and horrible controls . This is 2013 , yet I have seen better 360 graphics in 2007 . The horrible controls make this game unplayable . When a zombie attacks you you have to maneuver R-stick just right to kill a zombie , or sneak up behind a zombie , press RB to execute , which does n't always work.6 . Lack of character story . This is the Walking Dead , one of the greatest character driven television shows of all time . You think that the game would involve more story and add something to already established characters , but nope ! They were working with Darryl and Merle , two of the greatest characters of the greatest character driven show ever and they still could n't do it.So if you are thinking of buying this game , do yourself a favor , go to your nearest Redbox , shell out $ 2 and rent this game before you buy it , because that $ 2 may actually save you $ 40+ and a whole bunch of disappointment in the long run .	-1
This game looks like COD2 or another launch title for the 360 . The game play is slow and running is all you need to do to survive not even worth a rent .	-1
The walking dead is a great television series , and it is even better that they are expanding their franchise into the video game industry . I am content with their talltale series , however I am not pleased after playing Survival instincts .Lets break it down.The game takes place in the early stages of infection where you will navigate the game as Darrel Dixon . You will learn more about the characters from the original walking dead series and get a better understanding of their whereabouts before their encounter with Rick Grimes ( note - rick is not in the game ) . You will play through a detailed campaign meeting unique characters and a variety of weapons . When you are scavenging through the town you are able to obtain new vehicles and strangers that may join your survival party . Different vehicles have different perks some can carry more people , while another is more fuel efficient . Supplies are limited therefore you must stockpile a good amount of ( food , ammo , fuel ) . When traveling you are able to pick the destination you are traveling each destination with different scenarios . Your car may break-down mid journey or a herd of walker maybe in your way so be prepared to improvise ! Things that may bother users1 ) The graphics are not the best but still do-able , however I do not like the flow of the game it does not seem very smooth to me.2 ) When using blunt object , it take a lot of hits to take down a zombie , which can cause a large mob.Then when a herd of zombies trap you , you are left to knife 25 zombies individually in the face one by one.3 ) Your survival companions will not fight along side with you and is very disappointing , your companions will just sit in you car or wander separately if ordered to find resources , they will not aid you during missions.4 ) There will be a lot of loading screes and you will find that many of the towns are copy and pasted therefore you already know the map 's layout which I personally find very irritating and lazy of the game developers.Things to improve the game , I wish you are able to upgrade your load-out/gear , for example upgrading your backpack capacity or modifying your gun.Overall i would not spend the money to purchase this game , however if you have a friend that owns it already it isnt a bad game to borrow or rent . There are not many zombie games out but it will not flow like `` left4dead '' . I would purchase this game for maybe $ 15 or $ 20 ( generously )	-1
Quit making these games for Walking dead cus you are making them look bad and its 2 stars only cus i like walking dead	-1
I got this for around five dollars with free shipping , even at that price , its awful . The mini games are not fun . They are glitchy . I can not find one thing about this game that makes it worth paying anything for it .	-1
Just bad . I figured out of 30 games we 'd find something in this heap that was enjoyable , but sadly , nope . This one was clearly rushed to the market and was not very well thought out . I have n't come across a game I found this utterly terrible in a long time . Unless shooting ketchup at hot dogs and picking up balloons with poo on them is your idea of quality entertainment , save your money .	-1
I would ABSOLUTELY pay $ 20 for a collection of 30 games , EVEN if 20 of them suck . I 'm soooooo sick of games like THIS that really only give you a select few games to begin with and force you to try to beat/win THOSE ( usually ) lame games in order to unlock another few , and so on . Come on ! ! People BUY this because it APPEARS to be a `` collection of games '' , offering variety , NOT to `` beat it '' and be challenged by `` leveling up '' in attempt to FORCE repeat play . MOST consumers are genuinely angry to discover the `` unlock '' feature , not challenged or excited by it . They lose interest in the game , trade it in and it gets a low rating .	-1
I do not know what else to say other than `` AWFUL '' ! ! ! This/ these game/ games is/ are garbage ! ! ! ! Sorry , but it 's the truth !	-1
Like the title says , the game is trash . Linear as you could ever imagine , retarded AI , dated graphics and an idiotic kill cam , as if I care to know ( and even less so , see ) exactly what damage my bullet did.Call of Duty with sniper rifles.You know , it 's such a shame because the original Sniper Elite is easily one of the best games ever made and bears absolutely no resemblance to this tripe . Why oh why do video game companies continually , and nearly without fail , insist on releasing stellar first entries then utterly ruining the franchise with cheap , dumbed-down garbage ? This is what fans of the original Sniper Elite waited so long for ? Seriously ? What a waste !	-1
The Good : Satisfying kill shots , good graphics , gory X-Ray kills are fantasticThe Bad : Dumb AI , poor stealth mechanics , drab level design , frustrating shootouts , boring everything elseSniper Elite : V2 does n't stand for version 2 as some people may think . This is about trying to stop the Germans from using V2 rockets in World War II . After seeing those three words you probably left this review already . Another WWII game ? V2 has a lot of potential , but is lacking in many areas due to the developers laziness in design . The story is nothing special with the only satisfying thing being sniper shots.The game is all about stealth , but right away you will notice this is broken . The enemies are laid out in a poor manner in which it is hard to figure out how to take everyone out without raising an alert . If you do so you have to fight it out with limited ammo from your other weapons and you die very quickly . Using the sniper rifles is just fine with an ability to hold your breath to steady your aim . Slowly a red diamond will focus on a part of an enemy and that is where your bullet will land . Once you fire the game uses a bullet camera and some times you will see an X-Ray shot of the bullet penetrating the targets organs ( the nut shot is awesome ! ) You will see the skull shatter , organs burst , and eyes explode . This is the most satisfying use of a sniper rifle in any shooter . The problem is , the fun stops there.Of course sniper rifles back then really did n't have silencers so once you make the shot everyone knows you 're there . Some levels have loud noises you can mask the shot in , but this can be difficult . The enemy AI is extremely dumb in which they wo n't notice a dead comrade right next to them , or they will spot you from hundreds of yards away with some sort of eagle vision . On top of the all that enemies spawn strangely out of some sort of ether because you will walk a hallway with no enemies , circle around , then somehow there 's an enemy there . This makes stealth frustrating as hell and you will rage quit often . It does n't help that the forced shootouts are frustrating and hard because you die almost instantly.You can lay traps for enemies and such , but I honestly did n't find any reason to do this much . Even the level design is screwy because the hallways are confusing and everything looks the same . There just is n't enough satisfaction from finishing levels and out smarting enemies because in reality your exploiting the dumb AI to advance through the levels . After just about 3 or 4 you will probably have enough and call it quits . It is just so sad that the great sniper mechanic was wasted on such a boring and dull game . The graphics look pretty good , but other than that you wo n't stay interested . I had this game on my HDD for about 2 months and even when I had nothing to play I could n't go back to this drab game.Overall , V2 has some awesome kill shots and great sniper rifles ; everything else is a bust . Dumb AI , poor stealth mechanics , boring level design , uninteresting story , and frustrating shootouts . The multiplayer is pretty satisfying , but you wo n't be coming back for long . V2 is a huge disappointment over a prequel that was fairly decent . Even the most patient gamers wo n't last here .	-1
..if the game would be well ported to pc , if it would not piss me off by spawning me from far away from my death , meaning I had to do at least 4 minutes of the same things I 've done before death , which were totally unnecessary . And that you repeat every time . The plot is not all very exciting . The characters are okay and graphics are all right too .	-1
Ca n't even play this game , I bought it with Enslaved ( which is n't region locked ) and did n't care much about Inversion , but the fact that its region locked is pretty annoying .	-1
The Good : Some good gameplay ideas , decent graphicsThe Bad : Broken game mechanics , massive plot holes , uninteresting characters , boring weapons , boring multiplayerInversion is a game about gravity manipulation that fails to work . How a single element that an entire game evolves around fails is beyond me . You play as a man named Dennis trying to find his daughter after an unknown enemy destroys his city . Unfortunately , that 's about as far as this ridiculous game gets . There are massive plot holes , completely broken game mechanics , and some very monotonous shooting segments.The game gives you a Gravlink that allows you to make objects light or heavy . You can use this on enemies as well , but it does n't work as well as you think and feels completely useless most of the time . Why shoot a barrel to make it light , aim at it , pick it up , aim it at the enemy , then toss it when just a few bullets works twice as fast ? The only time this is useful is when the game forces you to use it during the many boring boss fights . You can acquire upgrades for it as you go along like being able to pick up heavier objects , and the heavy gravity is n't unlocked until much later . This one mechanic just felt completely useless to me except for when I fought larger enemies , and that was n't very often . So hats off to Saber for screwing that one simple thing up . They made a major game mechanic uninteresting and useless.Secondly , comes the inversion gravity that effects your navigation . This part was fun until you realize how broken the cover mechanic is . One type has you flipping around walls and buildings which reminded me of Prey a lot , but not as fun . The second type is where you 're in Zero-G and you can float around by moving from pieces of debris . Here 's where the mechanics suddenly break down and make the game a living nightmare to play . You can somehow still get injured when behind cover whether it 's Zero-G or on the ground . I died so many times because a rocket somehow killed me by hitting the object I 'm hiding behind . Secondly , if an enemy throws high gravity at you you ca n't land even if you move away from the area . You can try to push yourself around , but some times it does n't work and you are left vulnerable for a good 10 seconds . That 's enough time to die . If an enemy uses low gravity on you you go through this stupid long animation of recovering your sense before you can aim your gun and fire while on the ground . After that you ca n't move and are just laying there taking shots , and 99 % of the time you will die during this stupid animation.Why all this was n't tested and thought of is the obvious question . On top of all this you get some guns that are n't fun to shoot and have no impact or weight to them . You get the same types of guns in standard form and plasma form . The boss fights are even repetitious and boring because the game throws the same exact boss at you several times . I fought the slave driver five times , and the security bot about four . Each time you fight them the same way with no changes . All I wanted to do was shoot myself because of this . On top of all this you 're sitting there wondering why you 're even bothering because the plot has so many damn holes . Why are these guys invading the city ? Where are they from ? What do they want ? None of those questions are answered . You just go along trying to find your daughter and that 's pretty much it . The game is a seriously huge waste of time and I ca n't recommend this to anyone.Overall , Inversion ` s graphics are pretty good , but the art style is generic and boring . All the gameplay elements and mechanics are either broken or useless and the game has more plot holes than LA 's streets . What 's the point of playing ? Sheer boredom is all I can think of . Do not waste a single penny on this game , but if you have to just rent it . The multiplayer is incredibly boring as well so do n't even bother with that either .	-1
took some time and checked few youtube vids on this title and must say look really boring . i belive game is well done and all that crack but cmon gameplay is just too boring for me action is non existent in this game	-1
This is not a sequel to my favorite Sonic game , Sonic 3 and Knuckles . It is simply remade Sonic 1 levels . Splash Hill ? Lost Labyrinth ? Those levels sound a lot like Green Hill and Labyrinth Zone from Sonic 1 . Do n't get me wrong , I am all for redos , but the game has other flaws . The game only has 4 knockoff levels , so your basically paying a dollar per level . The controls are garbage , as the D-Pad is too small and slippery . As for speed , it occasionally lags and every time Sonic runs through a loop the entire screen does a 360 degree turn . Get Episode 2 , the true sequel to a game like Sonic 3 . As for this , it is quite a dreadful try to bring back the golden Genesis era .	-1
This game is not meant for the tablet . Only get it if it 's free , because sonic requires some sort of a controller .	-1
Sonic + touchscreen = MEHHH . If you have a device with real buttons its okay .	-1
It may be one the best of the good old school Sega days but these days of high-tech graphics and fluid smooth game play of console gaming kinda renders this game less appealing for the masses . I am not a big fan of side scrolling games so my review may be biased by it . If you like old school games then this might appeal you if you want to dedicate 250+MB for a poor looking graphics on your phone . Nostalgia alone can not justify $ 3 dollar price tag . Sorry I can not rate it more than 2 stars .	-1
Hard to review an application that I was never able to download . So nice of Amazon to charge for something that does n't install .	-1
Carrier Command : Gaea Mission is half action game , half RTS , but it does neither very well and becomes way too complex , way too soon . Perhaps this game is even too hardcore for me , but I felt like it kept throwing so many unnecessarily complex gameplay systems at me that I just ended up giving up on it . Also the fact that the controls for the first-person shooting sections are terrible does n't help.Not a great game here . Interesting ideas undone by sub par execution.Avoid .	-1
Clearly triton put their money into sound technology , because it 's awesome . However , the earpieces are attached by two flimsy plastic pieces that wear out or break far too easily . These were great for a year . The the attachments plastic wore out/broke . Triton customer service was useless -- in response to one email , they sent me an auto-response , then No emails for 6 weeks until they sent me a `` your case is being closed as successful because we have not heard from you '' ! ! ! ! My emails asking for an explanation were unanswered.I 'm buying a PS4 this fall and am researching headphones . Triton is NOT on my list.Update : bizarre customer service issues persist . Headphones now held together by duck tape . DO NOT BUY TRITON if you expect your product to last more than a year or so .	-1
I 'm about 95 % certain that MadCatz does not know what the words & # 34 ; Surround Sound & # 34 ; mean . I 've owned lots of gaming headsets , from Turtle Beaches , to these , to Astros , and I have to say that these are undoubtably the worst . It is nearly impossible to wear these for more than an hour without a headache from the discomfort . They are extremely cheaply made . Mine snapped in half just trying to adjust them to my head . My friend 's set came IN THE BOX already broken . The sound quality is just plain not good . Even only turned up halfway , & # 34 ; loud & # 34 ; noises like explosions or gunfire crackle and pop like Rice Krispy cereal . My old Turtle Beach X31s from 2009 sound and feel better in EVERY way than this sorry excuse for a premium gaming headset . Save you money and buy either Turtle Beaches or Astros .	-1
The Kunai is a good headset for the price but its just not just for everyone . The headset for the first hour or so is comfortable then it really starts to bug my ears since the ear muffs are so small . The sound quality is very good and overall this device is easy to plugin into the PS3 , Phone , or PC . All though today I might have to return it while putting the headset on my head ( which is big ) the right side of the headset broke so I ca n't adjust the size and if I do it just breaks off and dangles the earmuff by a wire . One suggestion also is a feature so you can hear yourself while talking so your not yelling.Overall if you 're looking for a gaming headset that gives good quality and one that is of course small and light weight this is the one for you.Pros-Excellent SoundPriceCons-Size of ear muffsCheap plasticUPDATE 4/13Well the headset broke completely . I have owned Turtle Beaches that last longer , brought it down to a 2 just due to the fact that its weak .	-1
this is an overall good sounding low-end headset . great for everyday gaming . downside is that the ear cups are small , your ears will eventually start hurting from prolonged use with this headset . this is only if you cup them over your ears.best suited for those under 16 , or someone with small ears .	-1
Thought this would work on the PS4 to hear in game audio and Party Chat simultaneously , but all I could hear was chat , the audio was coming thru the TV.It does seen like a solid headset , the ear coverage is quite small , I have medium sized ears , this would be good for smaller ears , but otherwise , it might get uncomfortable quick .	-1
First of all the concept is so dated and so been dne . Second you ca n't move the ship , without shooting the balls so there is hardly any way to aim and time a shot . Yes you can tap where you want the ball to go and the 'ship & # 34 ; jumps there and fires but if you want to do a trick shot that instant of time means you miss . If you want to do a marble marching game right , do it in 3-D	-1
While the game is visually appealing and playable but Access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service and advertisements in a paid game like this is totally unacceptable . The game would not launch until it was connected to Wi-Fi the first time as it needs to authenticate and possibly send vital account information out . Almost all of the games made by Big Fish Games free or paid has this permission requirements . IMHO , While it may be okay for a free game to have such permissions , I think the developer must forego such requirements in a paid app . Revise the permissions and let users play the game they love ( Especially when they paid for it ) Two stars for now . If the developer changes their mind and removes the permissions I will revise this rating to 4 stars !	-1
This game should be called 'lame rolling marble game ' . Much of the time when I shoot a ball at the group , the ball is included in the group instead of destroying what it 's shot at . Other times , the ship wo n't change to the Color needed to destroy the balls . Just a bunch of aggravation in a game with no real point to it .	-1
This game is fun with friends but the career mode is rather dull and boring . It 's not very challenging , the characters are so random and the stages feel very repetitive . I bought this as a holder until the new Mario Kart comes out but I would advise against it .	-1
Absolute trash . The controls are horrible and binding do n't work properly sometimes . Graphics are PATHETICLY BAD . Soundtrack ? I 'd rather kill myself than listen to that drivel . Then there 's the actual driving : I like all types of racing games from Blur , Gran Turismo and everything in between . But this is just not acceptable . There is literally NO DEPTH to it AT ALL ! The drift mechanic is completely broken , since you accelerate AND brake at the same time and it will automatically drive for you ! The only credit I can give this game is for the number of modes there are and custom games . Everything else about this game is totally terrible . If you have never played a racing game , have an IQ of 55 and are below the age of 6 , you might enjoy this . Otherwise , avoid at all costs .	-1
one or two of the games were interesting . a couple of games were impossible to get past the second stage , no direction as to what was needed to progress . some of the games were just downright boring	-1
I love most Alawar games , but these , aside from being rather juvenile , just did not work . I would get part way into a game and then it would quit working and there would be nothing that I could do to finish it . It is a bundle of a bunch of games and I tried about 4 and really could only complete 1 . I just gave up on the rest and deleted it off my computer .	-1
Games in bundle are weird . I prefer the adventure hidden object games much better . The games in bundle are not good quality nor fun . Very boring .	-1
I played on this for about 2 weeks and it was great . The controller is responsive , the buttons sensitive , and it was a good time overall . Then the control stick fell off . It was n't because I played too hard and broke it ; it was never really attached in the first place . It fell off in my backpack and fell out of a hole so now I have a useless controller sitting in my room collecting dust . Not worth it .	-1
This game is AWFUL ! ! The constant annoying character speaking is diconcerting and totally distracting.The graphics fall far short of those in the Gears of War series and the camera never gets the right angle for viewing anything . Also , for a 50 dollar game , I can ' t move under cover to shoot enemies ? That is L A M E ! ! ! Don ' t waste your money on this garbage ! ! If you want a 3rd person shooter , go with the G o W or Spec Ops the Line or even The Punisher video games ... . for what it ' s worth , as rotten as this game is .. I would choose it over any of those Dead Crap ... I mean Crap Space .. oh , sorry ... CRAPPY Dead Space games .	-1

I might not be the biggest Deadpool fan , but I have enjoyed his comics from time to time . The thing that made him a cool character was his fourth-wall-breaking , psychotic and crazy routine along with his sarcastic and perverse humor . However , you never had to actually hear him ( or the voices in his head ) talk , just read the talk bubbles . In the game you do n't have to just deal with a bad game in many areas , but you have to deal with him coming off as an ADHD ten-year-old child . He has his moments , but after a short time , it all gets stale.High Moon Studios ' Deadpool is the merc with a mouth in his first ever video game and while he continuously breaks the fourth wall , he will never let you forget you are playing a video game , as if everything about the games mechanics does n't do that already . Deadpool as a game comes off as kind of a parody of action games , which works for the character being Deadpool , but it constantly being thrown in your face gets annoying and old . Even when they use it to break up the game play , such as in one short part you are playing top down in 8-bit graphics like in the original Zelda game . Also he is constantly commenting on various video game tropes , the script for the game and now and then complaining about you the player.Being that I am not the biggest fan and do n't have anything to do with Deadpool regularly , this is my first time dealing with him as an animated character with a voice , so maybe it is something I am not used to . However , some of the comics I have read have him dialed back a little compared to others and unfortunately High Moon has him cranked up to an eleven in this game . I am sure to those that absolutely love everything about him will see this as great stuff , but for the rest of us it does n't work as well.It seems that High Moon used Deadpool to do crazy things with everything about the game and even maybe use the whole fourth wall stuff to hide technical problems with the game , such as loading screens that are put in place in areas where he runs into the game being unfinished . However , there is a few times that while running around a corner the game will freeze for a few seconds with a regular loading screen . It seems abrupt , so it is hard to say if the game all of a sudden needed to load in strange place or that part of the game was trying to be goofy . There are instances of technical problems that are clearly spotty work on the game , like constant texture pop-in issues . Almost every scene seems to take a few seconds before everything becomes clear . Also Deadpool likes to stick to things it seems . If he runs up against any kind of wall or other structure in an area , he will stick to it . This seems to happen mostly in combat situations or at least that is the most notable because you are trying to get away so his healing factor will kick in . The combat gets intense at times , so running into something and have it be a stumbling block gets very aggravating quickly . There is the teleport ability , but it is nothing grand at all . If you are up against a wall and teleport , you might just end up in the middle of all the baddies and take even more damage . You can only teleport a few steps at most and it rarely gets you out of trouble.What makes the sticking to walls and such even more annoying is the game play itself . The aiming feels off . There is a lock on , but if you so much as tap the right analog stick it stops being locked on to an enemy . This is alright , but when you are used to using both stick a lot to move around and kill it can be tough to keep it in mind not to touch that right stick at all . There is also the issue with the camera , you control it thankfully , but it still seems to box you in at times if you are not in a very open area . This is more harmful when as stated before , up against a wall that wo n't let you go and it means you are constantly being hit by something off screen . On top of the controls being clunky , the killing and murdering that makes Deadpool so cool is completely unsatisfying . All the enemies are fodder , with a few more challenging enemies here and there , but even those are unimpressive and never really giving you any feeling of dread . Most enemies you cut to pieces and the others you have to work a little harder or maybe have to use the lock on aim exclusively . It all makes all the action boring and repetitive.As Deadpool kills he gets DP points , why is it DP points ? Because Deadpool . I do not understand why it is n't just money . Everything else in this game is pulled out of Deadpool 's ass , so why not make money just appear as well ? Makes sense to me . The DP not being money is nitpicking sure , but that is because everything else has problems . It is easy to nitpick something when everything else seems to be in bad shame . You use these DP points to unlock new weapons . You starts out with his trusty swords and pistols and you can upgrade those with DP points . You can also use these points to unlock new weapons like Sais , machine guns and bear traps . None of which helps the game from feeling repetitive and are just as average as the weapons you start out with , although the Sais so help build up your combo , which can help get you more DP points . So using the Sais seems like the best bet . You can also upgrade Deadpool as well with these points to have his healing factor kick in fast and some other abilities , but again , nothing great.High Moon trying to make Deadpool seem like a bad game as a joke comes out making the fact that it is a bad game that much worse . Maybe they will tell us `` hey , it was all just a big joke '' and play it off that way to try to make it seem very Meta , but I would n't believe them . The chugging issues , weird loading in the middle of running down a hallway , the boring game play , the annoyance of Deadpool , bad game mechanics and on and on makes this game not worth playing unless you are a die-hard fan or love trophies/achievements . This game gives those out like candy and most of them are for the joke of doing it , which is fine . It gives at least some value to the Deadpool game .	-1
Fist of all it 's PS3 , so it has the usual random rotation problems that all PS3 games have . It 's a button masher with endless combinations designed to promote carpel tunnel . You ca n't adjust the brightness as you can in real games so you can only play at night or with the curtains closed . The dialogue is strictly junior high , but with obcenities thrown in so that no parent would want their kid playing it . You can at least turn off the dialogue , which I did . The main character is a moron . There is really no plot.The fighting is repetetive . The first female enemy was supposed to be a big battle and she killed Deadpool a bunch of times . Then I just used the square button , pushing it about once a second while looking out the window at the sunny day . She was killed in about 15 seconds with no fancy combos or jumping like a spastic tree frog or even looking at the tv.I 'm on the second chapter and it 's already boring .	-1
something wrong w/cd would not load , in fact my system didnt even notice that there was one in the slot to be loaded	-1
this game is a slow starter , game has great graphics . It will , however , restart you from the beginning at random . It was very frustrating . I do not play this anymore ... tried several times.got almost finished and it restarted on me .	-1
This game is very predictable and the narrator ( who is suppose to be the bad guy in the game ) talks too much and I found myself muting him .	-1
See headline . I can not complete describe how crappy this piece of crap is . If crap was n't crap , I 'd be speechless . This item is crap . Screw you turtle beach .	-1
Guild Wars 2 promises a revolutionary MMO experience that fixes all the `` problems '' of past games in the genre . I would argue that the game is more of an Action RPG ( like Diablo 3 ) than a traditional MMO ... and not a very good Action RPG at that.Coming from a Blizzard gaming background , GW2 feels a lot more like D3 than WoW . The ambiance ( particularly in cities ) , skill/talent systems and small group PVE ( 4 players for D3/5 players for GW2 ) are remarkably similar , and neither game allows real UI customization or add-ons . The camera and combat in D3 are far more responsive than GW2 . In fact , GW2 's clunky camera , combat and UI are what ultimately soured me on the game.Like D3 , GW2 also lacks any dedicated healing class/role and also does away with a pure tanking role as well . While this may be welcome news to the millions of kids who like doing `` sick DPS '' in a multiplayer game , it is not without its drawbacks . Defined roles help keep combat more organized and fluid , as each player knows ( or has a better idea ) what is expected of him/her . The PVE and PVP groups I experienced in GW2 felt utterly chaotic , like a football team comprised solely of QBs . Classes in GW2 do have fairly weak self-heals , but no worries ... if you `` die '' you can enter into one of the worst ideas ever implemented into a video game , `` Fight to Survive ! '' While you clumsily spam buttons ( much like being knocked down in the Punch Out ! coin-op 30 years ago ) , you hope one of your teammates/dungeon buddies completes a slow/awkward cast to revive you and put you back on your feet . This mechanic works awful in practice and is horribly designed IMO ; it also gets much , MUCH worse in PvP.The `` new and improved '' questing in GW2 is something we have seen before in the public quests of Warhammer Online and the `` rifts '' of well , Rift . There are no `` ! '' and `` ? '' NPCs like WoW , but in the end you are still `` killing x '' and `` gathering x '' just like every other MMORPG out there . Personally , I found GW2 questing lacking in variety even more than WoW . For example , by level 10 of my Human Thief questing , I had killed literally over 1000 centaurs ... Believe me , I love killing centaurs as much as the next guy , but this repetitive theme felt rather lazy on Arenanet 's part.Overall , I was greatly disappointed in GW2 . Was n't expecting it to live up to all the hype ; just wanted a solid game to play now and then . After a weekend of playing the Beta , however , I could n't justify spending even $ 40 on it ( had a $ 20 credit with Amazon ) . The lack of raiding , traditional roles , queuing for dungeons/bgs anywhere , UI customization , and add-ons were all negatives for me , but , ultimately it was the games sluggish camera and horrid combat that forced me to stop playing completely .	-1
While there 's certainly a lot to like and a few unique mechanics , there 's no big draw here . The game is convoluted and confusing , PvP is just a cluster , and the innovative no-quest system gets boring fast . Uninstalled after a month .	-1
I was always on the fence about whether it was okay to slam games for DRM-implementation rather than quality of content , but in the case of MMOs , a publisher that treats fans badly for no discernible reason whatsoever is absolutely fair game for one-star reviews on all their MMOs , IMO . Subs are an investment and when you make a micro transaction purchase , I think it 's reasonable to assume they 'll be giving me more than three months to use it . After all , I 've spent hundreds on their MMO but at most 60 bucks on games I still play that I purchased 20 years ago.Do n't confuse this for butthurt , I just honestly do n't want to ever touch another MMO from these guys based on how we were treated as long-standing customers ( 7 years ) and I think every NCSoft MMO deserves this caveat.At the very least , do n't spend a dime on micro transactions until you 've thought carefully about the fact that COH fans were allowed to make micro transaction right up to the point where Paragon was shut down with zero notice and it was declared that the game would shut down in three months.And no , as far as we can tell , it was doing fine . Not great but actually improving and not in any peril of plunging into the red . Yes , I understand how public companies work and think . That does n't mean I 'm not going to object as a customer when they treat me like dirt.More details here : http : //www.amazon.com/Would-Touch-NCSoft-After-What/forum/Fx14756GUYMB4Y5/Tx32HKMPY66OZ14/1/ref=cm_cd_et_up_redir ? _encoding=UTF8 & asin ; =B008MAZ0PU & newContentID ; =MxHIEU0312NBJ7 # MxHIEU0312NBJ7	-1
I installed this game on my desktop and laptop . I managed to get it working on my desktop but tried and tried to no avail on my laptop . I completed every step listed on their support page and my laptop exceeded all requirements . What a disappointment , especially since some of my favorite IGT games are on here , like Kitty Glitter , Siberian Storm , and Bombay . The interface is disappointing too - on my one machine that the game will launch on . They desperately need to release an update so that the game will launch on every computer that meets the requirements , because as of now it does not .	-1
I enjoy playing Aztec Temple and Wild Wolf in the casinos , which is why I purchased this game . I bought it as a download directly from the company hoping they would have fixed the problems by now . Unfortunately it will not work properly . After every free spin , my balance returns to the amount it was before I won the free spins . Whatever I win in the free spins I lose when the game returns to normal play . I sent a email to customer support but I suspect I may not hear from them based on the reviews . That 's too bad because the company could have had a winner in this game if they supported it properly .	-1
Boring button mashing game with horrible online connection . Game is flooded with annoying DLC costumes rather than fixes for the terrible frame rate issues . The story is boring . Everything about this game is bad ( in my honest opinion ) and I only recommend buying this game if you 're a die hard fan .	-1
This game could have been great considering giant enemies , cool tanks and nice weapons ... ..However in reality worst 20 $ spent ever ! The gameplay is extremely basic and weapon system also.The first 5 minutes youll be amazed by the enormous enemies but you will soon realise how boring this game is . You basicaly just shoot with one button and go around an extremely small closed circuit city . When i brought this home , we were four and we were super hyped up looking at the back of the game . Afer 5 minutes , everyone had the same feeling which was to change the game .	-1
This game is fun for a few minutes but it is pretty much a one trick pony.I have n't had a chance to play with other people but I think that would be more enjoyable .	-1
not even worth the 5 bucks i spent on it . really regret buying it . regret playing through all of it even more	-1
this game is just sloppy , glitchy , and uninteresting . It 's worth playing if you 're a forgiving sort that just needs an open-world zombie game , but there isnt much to do here thats any fun .	-1
Not liking this . Graphics look so-so , and I do n't like FPS 's , because most of them are mindless b.s . Only purchased this because it was five dollars . Should 've gotten a hamburger .	-1
Your weapons break in a few hits , then you do no damage . You do get guns until later in the game . I do not care for the setup of the game , picking a class but anyone can wield that weapon and you do not get your class weapon unless your just melee at the start then you get oars from boats . Very little creativity went into this game in my view .	-1
This game is so bugged it 's ridiculous.The quest system flat out does not work in the PC version . Quest tracking on your map do not work in the PC version , so you do n't know where to go . I came also came across a situation where i literally just completed a quest for an NPC , and right after handing it in , I talked to him again and he assigned me the exact same quest ( this was a one-shot quest where you had to fix a lighthouse , not a repeatable quest ) .I played co-op with my brother , and since I had handed in a quest before he joined my game , he was not able to see what quest we were doing , because if a joining player has not made it at least to the present quest of the host player , they can not `` see '' any quests beyond what they have accomplished . So even though we made it to chapter 3 in the co-op game , according to my brother 's quest screen , he 's still on the very first quest of the game.Pile of garbage . Do not buy such an obviously half- @ $ $ ed port .	-1
Let me first off say if a game does n't support Triple monitor gaming , I generally wo n't play it . Most AAA games these days support a variety of resolutions , so to come across a game that does n't support such features is disappointing.However a friend convinced me to play through it anyway ... I am no longer friends with that person.It was super buggy , several crashes per section , long load times , keep getting stuck in the games geometry , the list kept growing . But still I powered through . I thought a game with a unique twist on zombie gameplay would eventually make it worthwhile . There were a few moments that I got excited , but they were quickly destroyed by the lame plot and annoying bugs.I would n't recommend this game to my enemies ... let alone a friend .	-1
I tried to like this game , I really did . For the first couple of hours it 's a lot of fun . You are creeping around trying to survive the zombies and helping out survivors . However , once you 've played for a while the scenery just keeps repeating itself . The general system is that you accept a quest , search every single bag , drawer , and cabinet in sight , fight off a few zombies until your weapon starts to break , then switch to another , get back to base , fix the weapons , and head back out on another quest.Along the way you also need to find things ( the aforementioned searching ) to help you in your quest . It 's not very well explained exactly what is useful , but you should figure it out . Even though the fighting is a bit repetitive I could forgive it , if it was n't so frustrating . After the fifth time my character was going into battle and the game suddenly on its own decided to change from a powerful machete to a bottle of alcohol , which my moron character drank instead of doing anything useful with , I let out a string of profanity that brought my wife into the room asking what was wrong and ended with me deleting the game . There was nothing fun about sneaking/fighting my way through a long quest just to have her start flailing around like a drunken monkey ( not to mention wasting the makings of a Molotov cocktail ) and getting killed ( costs you money ) when she could have easily prevailed otherwise.Fighting zombies is fun at first , but gets a bit repetitive . I 'm sure it 's probably more fun with multiple people like Left4Dead is , but single I just ca n't recommend it . I 'm sure it 's good for some , but with my own character sabotaging me it was n't any fun for me .	-1
As other reviews have pointed out , this case is too big for the 3DS XL . I would not trust it to protect the XL fully if I were to put in a bag . Also , as another review stated , the case has a pungent odor that smells like plastic . I left the case to air out for 3+ days and while the smell relented somewhat , it was strong enough to dissuade me from keeping the case even as a stationary storage option for the XL . The smell would also rub off on my fingertips which was doubly annoying.I had purchased a case before from Hori for my DS Lite , and the quality difference between that case and this one is substantial.In conclusion , the case smelled really bad . This might not annoy you , and it might not be a general issue for every case , I do n't know . But both the case 's dysfunctional size , and smell make it a bad buy for me .	-1
With the 3DS XL being so new , there are very few case options available . In the past , HORI has done an excellent job with their cases , so we 're not sure exactly what went wrong here.The immediate issue is that the case is too big . I do n't mean too big in the subjective sense . I mean it is `` literally '' too big . You put the 3DS into the section designed for it and it slides around in ALL directions . It 's approximately half an inch too big length and width-wise . I would not feel comfortable throwing this into a backpack , knowing my 3DS XL is bouncing around inside its case.Aside from this , it 's a solidly-built case and worthy of 4-to-5 stars . It 's just a shame it was manufactured with faulty measurements.2 stars out of 5 .	-1
Had this mouse for 4 days , sent it back . First the rubber coating is very slick , second the buttons on the right side are very hard to push one , without pushing both , and when gaming get pushed by accident all the time , and lastly after I upgraded the firmware and DL'ed the steelseries engine , my PC would n't shut off anymore.I would say this is definitely a no-buy for most users.I gave it a 2 star just due to the fact it seemed fairly well built .	-1
Yet another game were hard means that all ai will target you even if you are in last place . Total punishing gang up . Intended audience , the ai opponents . Coming from a guy that full cleared mario kart 64 and diddy kong racing . Now that I am older I see it for what it is ... a crap-shoot where skill matters just a little . Keep trying until the ai gets lethargic and forgets to attack , or you get that miracle breakout before the ai is armed and ready and can not catch up .	-1
They were n't even trying with this port , very low frame rate even with 3d off . Draw distance is tiny . U can not see boost our pick ups until you 're right on top of them . The controls are uncomfortable and oddly placed . Graphics are ugly and blocky.audio is low bit rate.I would get the pc version or console version instead of this .	-1
i think this is a great racing game . i 've racked up many hours playing , it 's actually a surprisingly good racing game . the thing is , for 3DS not so much . the graphics on the 3ds version are pretty subpar , the gameplay is n't as good because it uses a different button layout that is less comfortable than the other versions , and it just looks ugly overall . so for the actual game id say its a solid 4 out of 5 stars , but for this version , 2 ... go with another console for this .	-1
This game is broken . I 'm really sorry to say this , but this is probably the last 1/4 decent Sonic game we 'll get . Trying to rip off Mario Kart has never worked for anyone , SEGA included . But enough rant . I 'll get to the game review.This is a game of purely & # 34 ; Hope no one glitches past me & # 34 ; Graphics are subpar for this game . And we had to wait 6 months for this & # 34 ; polished game ? & # 34 ; I do n't think so.Gameplay feels slippery and uncontrollable . Not to mention BAD transistions between air land and sea modes.There are a good number of characters and stages to leave you entertained for about 5 hours . But that 's about it.Drifting is more broken then Asphalt 's drifting . That 's HARD to do.I liked the vehicle designs.The races are challenging , but it 's mainly because everyone 's glitching ahead of you , one way or another.PROS : Character selectionVehicle designUpgardable carsCONSWaited 6 months for this polished ****Broken physicsBad graphics for the timeBad transistionsLaggy onlineSince this is arguably Sonic 's last game , at least we can go back to SA2B and SH . Those were the good days .	-1
I entered the premium code..and I 'm considered a premium member ( says so in the game ) - yet no option to download the maps ! And when I go to the store section , they still want me to pay..and when I enter the code that I originally used for the premium edition content , it states , `` code already used '' lol ... no wonder EA is going downhill . This is too bad - I 'm sick of CODEDIT : I finally figured out how to download - it 's def . not what you usually get from a game . Usually you enter a code and BAM it does the work for you . But you have to actually go into PSN ( or Xbox store ) and find the little downloads that will trigger permission for you to manually download the bonus content . Be prepared to get a pen and make a checklist to make sure you do n't miss anything . Very cumbersome ... i would have just bought the original battlefield 3 instead of dealing with this premium pain in the you know what .	-1
to many hackers and slow server , also aim bots and overal lots of servers hosted by people who either kick or ban you quickly for no reason.or an admin kills you and switches you to another team.overal i liked the guns , but the gameplay and other BS i and my buddies deal with is annoying and overal not worth the time or effort	-1
It might just be me about playing online with friends , so anyway has a good single player game and great graphics would not recommend to someone who likes to play online .	-1
DO NOT BUY this `` Premium '' edition because it DOES NOT INCLUDE PREMIUM SERVICE ! ! ! The USED version of this game DOES NOT include the PREMIUM content that the new copy does . I got this item and when I went to use the code to get the premium content it was ALREADY USED ! This edition is no different from the regular edition ! Do NOT BUY !	-1
I can not believe they are still making these terrible `` arcade '' like games . You MUST follow a pre-written path or you die . You can not do anything off the path or you die . The `` hand to hand combat '' is a joke . You 'll have troubles with the prearranged melee scenarios . Supposed to be simple ( push button , kill enemy ) however the game does n't like to play by the rules which means you are STUCK ! Terrible , terrible , terrible . Did I say it is terrible ? Buy donkey kong or solitaire that 's at least fun or just put your head in a metal barrel and bang the outside with a hammer . Another thing : you 're going to need allot of hard drive space for the `` updates '' both just to get started and for multiplayer ( about 4GB ? ) In fact it is so horrible , I 'm just throwing mine in the trash . I should have just burnt the $ 64 dollars and saved myself allot of aggravation .	-1
PROS : - Ultra-intense combat with great vehicle mechanics and roles to fill.- Absolutely gorgeous . Staggering destruction effects , lighting , shadows , and just plain impressive.- Excellent sound design , and technically wonderful . A joy to listen on 7.1 headset.CONS : - Very little to no actual team-play and surprisingly more like a solo online game , despite its intentions . Astonishingly , while this is an EXP-based game that is largely team-based , the EXP system does nothing whatsoever with this and there are extremely few team-based EXP bonuses , as almost all EXP is gained individually , and generically ( kills and capturing flags make up the majority of it , sadly ) . & # 34 ; Assists & # 34 ; are barely touched on , and winning as a team means almost nothing.- No microphone support whatsoever . So much for the idea of squads , since you can only communicate via typing . For a game like this , that simply does n't work . It makes being in a squad almost totally pointless to begin with , since squads that are randomly matched up do n't even talk to each other most of the time.- No level-balancing of any kind , meaning you could be matched up with extremely high-level and decked-out pros from the start . The game is EXP based , but the matchmaking service does n't care what level you are or what you 've unlocked or not unlocked . New players will get completely obliterated until they get a strong hold of things.YMMV : ( and regarding the ridiculous hate for Origin that holds no merit at all ) - Let 's just be clear about this : There 's nothing wrong with Origin . Nothing whatsoever . If you think otherwise , well , you 're wrong . I can see two sides to an issue , but for this one , no . Origin does not hinder the game in any way . There 's literally no reason to dislike it , as it runs better than Steam , anyway , and has its own Offline mode . In fact , it uses less system power to run than Steam and is certainly a bit snappier . But even so , you can run Steam and Origin both at once , and encounter no hiccups at all . The complaints about Origin are , for the moment , absurd , and I have had no problems using it . It seems like people just ca n't stand not using Steam and only Steam , which is a ridiculous argument . Origin is its own service , and it works functionally identical to Steam . There 's nothing else to discuss.BOTTOM-LINE : Do n't come in expecting a good team-play game , but if you just want to be awed by the Frostbite 2 engine , there 's no better place to show off your computer ( at least until BF4 starts to work and is totally completed ) . It 's not there . This is almost entirely a solo game , which is not what I was hoping for . With a broken EXP system , no mic support to speak of , and no level-matching , there 's a lot of frustration to get through .	-1
I got banned from all servers becuase i was suspected of using a aimbot when it was a virus on my computer . What ahppened was i got banned from one server so punk buster ( the anti cheating system ) banned me from all the servers so anytime i join a server it says i was kicked by punkbuster for 99999 minutes ( 1600 hours ) which is like a month all for something that wasnt my fault . Very disapponited in this game . I have seen hackers hack and get oveer 80 kills and 2 deaths and i get perma banned for a virus on my computer.Dont buy this game noone is safe you can get banned at any given chance dont waste your money	-1
this game a dont like it is bouring the campaing , and is only in inglish and is in Origin and you can change the language	-1
Issue is n't with the game , it 's with Origin . Long story short -- I originally ordered BF3 in 2011 in the `` Limited '' edition ... and went thru the registration rigamorole with Origin . But game would n't play on my machine . Sent it back ; amazon gladly made a refund . I recently got a new video card , gave BF3 a shot -- but there 's no way to convince Origin that I do not , indeed , have BF3 Limited , having shelled out an extra $ 20 for the Premium edition . Nor is there any way I can enter the code for the Premium edition Their `` help '' page is opaque.Catch-22 ... joke 's on me .	-1
This game does n't even have a server browser in the game , it uses your internet browser . Then you have to install a plug-in , but it 's not even a plug-in it 's a seperate executable that just sits in the background all the time . I ca n't believe how awful this is . Do not purchase this game , do n't even install it if it 's free . It 's not worth it .	-1
My kids love this character and I would give it 5 stars because they still love to play with her but shortly after it came , her wing fell off and her head became loose . We have had this character for a few months and the kids still play with her in spite of the loose head and broken wing .	-1
I got flashwing for my sister , because she loves the game and she is big on sparkly looking crap . So I bought this for her and it was not compatible with her game . She was disapointed to the point where she cried ..	-1
This is one of the weaker Skylanders figures in my opinion . He looks cool and has some funny catch phrases in the game , but he is just not as powerful as many of the others .	-1
My son does n't have many water Skylander 's only Thumpback and Gill Grunt other than Chill . She dies way to easily , if she gets hit twice you have to & # 34 ; remove her from the portal & # 34 ; My advise on this one consumers look elsewhere for a better Skylander because she does n't make the cut .	-1
I just got this controller in and tried to program it to my PS3 , it did not work and i looked closely that it is not the original PS3 Controller . i was very disappointed with this item . i will not return it but i can use this for parts . LOL .	-1
It 's not a great game , that 's not hard to get , but when I bought this game I thought I would play it for more time . To be honest , I start it two times , maybe a hour total , and I never played it like I thought . It could be a lot better , but ...	-1
I got this because I wanted to play through the Killzone series before I got my PS4 and Killzone Shadows Fall . My whole experience with the original Killzone was basically trying to figure out where it wanted me to go - there 's no tactical map , compass , or objective markers of any kind , so most of my time was actually spent backtracking and wandering.Skipped Killzone 2.Killzone 3 is okay , not great though . Might be worth your time ... if you have lots of it .	-1
The deal is fantastic , however , the Killzone series is seriously lacking in fun an playability . While it does wrap itself up in a shiny coat of CGI it can not escape the truth of its sloppy mechanics and less than fluid gameplay . If you are a HUGE FPS `` multiplayer '' fan then grab this title because that is all this game is good for ( similar to CoD and the Battlefield series which I recommend over this title in all aspects ) . Grab the Resistance Collection if you are looking for solid controls , gameplay , story AND multiplayer ( and want a Playstation exclusive ) .	-1
The bugs in this game makes it really hard to enjoy . Lag lag lag . But still alot of fun . Ea fix the bugs . But i still love the sims 3 .	-1
This would be a great expansion pack if it was n't for the glitched leaf cycle . Once it turns fall , every community lot and neighbor 's lot will be covered with leaves forever . You could have your sims rake 24 hours a day for the rest of the game as an option , but that would ruin the game . Do n't buy this until they fix the leaf cycle . EA blamed it on mods , but I played without mods and experienced this after freshly installing a plain vanilla game .	-1
I have been using QuickBooks since 2008 and overall have had mixed feelings about the experience since then . While I love that overall this is a functional piece of software that lets me manage my employees and payroll as well as do normal business functions like invoicing and taxes , I hate how bloated the organization is . The help manual is decidedly unhelpful and ignores a number of simple questions . Then , when you call support , it takes forever and the representatives are generally rude and do n't speak English very well . Worse , their company policies are unfriendly and it 's like they know they have a monopoly on the market as most tax pros use QuickBooks , so small businesses like mine are forced into it unless we want to go it alone.I upgraded to QuickBooks 2013 because Amazon provided a free copy as part of their Vine program to top reviewers . QuickBooks has a forced obsolescence and so since I was running 2011 , I knew that I would be forced to upgrade by 2014 or else not be allowed to continue running the payroll software . This is why I had upgraded from 2008 to 2011 though 2008 had been working perfectly well . While the upgrade from 2008 to 2011 went surprisingly smoothly , importing all of my settings and preferences with no drama , this latest upgrade from 2011 to 2013 was a mess.While it imported all of my company information and many of my settings such as the logo that goes on my invoices , 2013 changed the look of the user interface to make it much , much harder to read and impossible to personalize.I am 34 years old with reasonably good vision , and after five hours of using QuickBooks yesterday , I retired for a nap with a headache and eyestrain . The new interface has a monochrome gray on gray look which makes it exceptionally hard to read the text . A lot of the text is a light gray on a charcoal gray background , which is notoriously hard for people to read . In addition , the font size looks much smaller than on previous versions . Looking through the help section , I found many complaints in their online forum about this new look , and found that unlike in previous versions where you can customize the look , in this new version QuickBooks has decided that we are not allowed to make any changes in how it looks . In fact , if I want to enlarge the text , I need to change the screen resolution on my monitor . I do n't need to change the screen resolution on my monitor as everything else is just the right size , it 's QuickBooks that is the problem ! Then , the software seems less stable than 2011 . I 've had it running for only a few days and it has already crashed ! I do n't think 2011 crashed on me more than once or twice over a course of years , so the fact that this new version has crashed in the first few days is very alarming.Lastly , I have n't yet figured out if I can input the new payroll code without invalidating my previous payroll subscription . The last time I purchased the enhanced payroll in July of 2012 , I had to call support to have them input the code , and they said that as soon as the new code was input , the previous code would be invalidated . That means since I called in two weeks prior to my previous subscription ending , I essentially lost two weeks of payroll subscription that I had paid for . The customer service rep I spoke to at that time said that there was nothing he could do besides advise me to call back the day before expiration to have them input the code , but given that I had been on the phone for 45 minutes already , most of that waiting for a rep , I was n't keen to waste another 45 minutes to save a few bucks.The problem here is that this software bundle that comes with QuickBooks enhanced payroll says that you must begin your payroll registration within three months of installing QuickBooks 2013 . Does that mean that the payroll subscription I purchased back in July will be invalidated as soon as I enter in the new code ? I 'm planning on calling QuickBooks shortly to find out for sure , and I will update this review as soon as I learn more.I am extremely unhappy with the new QuickBooks and would advise that if you possibly can , do n't upgrade to 2013 . Perhaps by 2014 they will have sorted out these issues and this will be a workable piece of software again . Until then , I 'm undecided as to whether I 'm going back to 2011 or not . I guess I will see if the eyestrain subsides .	-1
As a small business owner , I have used QB 2001 , 2005 , 2012 and now 2013 . While the changes between the previous versions were substantial ( 2001 & 2005 do n't even work on Windows 7 ! ) , this one contains only cosmetic differences . Unfortunately , these differences involve mostly the user interface , so for experienced users , significant relearning is required . It is not unlike the move from Windows 7 to 8 . In cases like this , if you already have a recent copy of QB , do n't bother . If you have never used QB , well , it is still far superior to Peachtree for normal accounting needs , and any QB interface layout will be new to you anyway . Go ahead and dive in . Just pray that Intuit does not do this again for QB 2014 .	-1

Look I love KH . I 've played it many , many times . I have n't played it in a few years , but the problem for me with this remake is mine seems a little glitchy . I 've seen pieces missing from objects in the game , and many times when going to a cut seen it 's like it 's muted for a second or so before the volume comes on . I also believe I 've seen 1 or 2 cut scenes that are missing just a little spot from the original scene and I 've just now made it to Traverse Town , but again I have n't played it in a while , but I am pretty familiar with this game . Also while I preferred the controls of KH2 to the controls on KH , after being forced to play this game with the KH2 control setup I realize that I prefer the original control setup for the original KH.This is probably a 4/5 start rated game for someone with a PS3 that does n't have backwards playing capability , but my PS3 does have backwards capability , and plays both playable games on here just fine . Still with this game you get a little better graphics , and the Final Mix version of KH , and the 358/2 cut scenes so I 'm sure it 's an okay buy even with a backward capable system . Still these little glitches I 'm getting are just annoying , and makes it seem like it was kind of cheaply put together which is a shame as it takes away from the improved graphics in the cut scenes . IDK maybe I 'm the only one experiencing them . I will say that while very much the same game it does feel just ever so slightly different than the original game , and not just the control setup . IDK if it 's from the Final Mix version , or the PS3 redo , but some things about it seem just slightly different to me , but maybe I 'm just imagining things.I think this game is a pretty good buy if you are a KH fan.EDIT : After spending a little while playing it I 've come to the conclusion that this game sucks . It 's nowhere near as good or fun as the original . And it 's just little stupid things that they change for the sake of being able to sell something different that ruin the game . First the new heartless that they add to each world does nothing to make the game better , and it in fact makes the game worse as that 's just more time required for you to have to research they unique way that 's required to defeat them on the internet . One of the cool things about KH is it 's not complex . You run around , hit enemies with the keyblade , and you either beat them or die . Theirs no real complex s*** required to learn to defeat a enemy like you might see in a hard/more complex RPG like FF.Second and this really has me pissed is where are the Rare Truffles in Neverland ? Replacing them with the new PITA Heartless that takes your Mummy really does not make me happy . That was a good secret to get some good items you need , and it helps you level up fairly easy which is even more important in this game as they changed up the order you gain certain abilities , and most noticeably Sora ca n't get Second Chance until much later , and I do n't feel like spending hours upon hours running around killing heartless to level up , but I ca n't get the Rare Truffles to appear in Neverland.To me one of the things that made KH good was it was not that hard , but it was fun . Final Mix takes away from that IMO in an attempt to be a more challenging game with more sidequest type things to do , but not really in a FF kind of good way . This is n't just KH 's with an extra boss . It 's noticeably different to play while keeping the same story . Compared to the original KH I rate this 2 stars as I just do n't have as much fun playing it , and then you have all these audio glitches on top of it . I know many probably wo n't like reading this review , but it 's my honest opinion of the game . I give the original KH 5 stars .	-1
I love JRPG 's . I just finished Tales of Xillia and Ni No Kuni before that , both of which I enjoyed a lot . I even like the younger age JRPG 's . Blue Dragon I thought was a fine game . So after seeing this review I assumed Kingdom Hearts ( the original game , I only bought this for that game ) would be just as good as all the other JRPG 's I played . But this game just flat out sucks . I do not understand how anyone who even remotely likes RPG 's or JRPG 's can possibly like this game.First of all the camera controls are very twitchy ( as others have said ) and even controls like jumping can be hit or miss . Also there is no way to turn down or off the horrible music . But those things I could live with if the game was good . But it is not . I gave it about 5 hours but it never progressed to be anything I cared about . The constant fetch missions were as monotonous as one could get . I do n't know , others like it , but all I can say is that if you are into JRPG 's do n't just assume this is a good game . I totally wasted my money !	-1
Why in the world is everyone so hyped for this game ? You can go on amazon and get Kingdom Hearts 1 for 6 dollars , kingdom hearts com for 10 , and kingdom hearts 358/2 days for 10 . That is still less money than this edition . I love the games and I love the gameplay of all of them . I adore the first kingdom hearts the most , I grew up with the series . but I do not support the fact that this is nothing special other than a ploy for money and to garner more fans . It is time to move on and stop with this . Hate my review all you want but I love Kingdom Hearts 1 , I just do NOT support this and will not . I already own these games and beat them dozens of times , I do not need to purchase this . I guess for new fans YAY . But for veterans of this series no thanks .	-1
Kingdom Hearts : Good story telling with interesting characters . The camera issues really hurt it and make platforming a pain . I wish the combat was more Final Fantasy like instead of the typical hack n slash.Chain of Memories : A crappy card game . While you can still run around and attack enemies , How much damage you do is based on how high the number on the card is . I just did not care for it at all.358/2 Days : Very annoying that I was mislead into buying it thinking I would get 3 full games . This & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; is simply the near 3 hours of cut scenes from the DS version of the game . Talk about a rip off . I did n't shell out 30 bucks to get cut scenes .	-1
I already completed both kingdom hearts a long time ago , so why not just make a new one instead of bring old crap out . and make a new final fantasy while you are at it	-1
Drobot , the new lightcore character from the tech is not being sold a lot . Why ? Well first you ca n't switch paths , you have to reset it . Anyways , he helps a lot whens its like four Arkeyan Defenders or Axecutioners . His attacks are pretty weak , but his soul gem makes his thrusters damage enemies . Activision really needs to think it again . You know , I thought Activision was going to take a step forward in Skylanders , but did n't . The blasters and bladegear paths do n't really make a difference in the character and really I think you can expect more from the giant , Bouncer in this case . I would n't say that Drobot is the worst in my conclusion , but that drobot is n't like the rest of the Skylanders . Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants . : - )	-1
Drobot is a great character to play with . He flys eventually , and can shoot lasers from his eyes . His attack has more of a wide ranged span that can wipe out alot of enemies . If have purchased Skylander 's Spyro 's Adventure and played it with Drobot in the past there is n't a whole lot different from this one . But if you are buying the GIANTS version of the reposes for the ability to switch upgrade paths back and forth.. DO N'T BUY THIS ONE ! ! Only the reposes , or Series 2 figures of the original game characters have that ability . LIGHTCORES CA N'T SWITCH UPGRADE PATHS ! ONCE YOU MAKE A CHOICE YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT OR RESET THE FIGURE AND LOOSE ALL THE GAME PLAYING EXPERIENCE ON IT.EXPALIN LIGHTCORE : Each element has one Lightcore figure available and Drobot is from the TECH element . All lightcore figures `` Light up '' somewhere.. Prisim Break is the best I 've seen yet and his crystals glow green when put on the portal . I now have Jet Vac and Shroomboom in Lightcore also . Jet Vac looks pretty cool too . He lights up with a blue dot on his chest plate and his air gun lights up blue in a tunneling effect . Shroomboom 's eye lights up a little bit , but his green transparent mushroom at his side lights up brighter in green than his eye does . Drobot is the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT when it comes to a Lightcore figure ! He has a small gold round circle on his back that lights up ... That 's it..No Glowing Eyes..Nothing ! You ca n't even see his `` special light up ability '' from a distance while playing . Lightcore figures have a special ability that the Series 2 versions do n't have..they wipe out close surrounding targets , for about 1 second , when initially put on the portal . That is what you will have with this figure which retails for $ 2.00 more than the Series 2 version that will be coming soon . There will be a Series 2 Drobot released during another wave that will have a slightly different pose and not be Lightcore . This repose will have the ability to switch between upgrade paths ( Master Blaster or Clockwork Dragon ) at any time throughout the game . This figure will also have the `` Wow Pow '' upgrade called `` Supreme Bladegear '' ( it combines bladegears into one controllable super bladegear ) available that this Lightcore version does n't have.If you are on a budget , save your $ 2.00 difference for the Series 2 Drobot or buy the Spyro 's version on sale ! Otherwise..Here is a speck of light to add to your collection that can only be seen when looking directly down on it .	-1
having to change gear to harvest minerals ? Too linear in its gaming theory . Not a terrible game just not my stuff .	-1
The log in issues/Character creation has been fixed today , but many people still ca n't play the game cause of the simple fact that there still no room . I 'm pretty sure SE is probably working on that as we speak , but it still a big problem worth mentioning . The game sales for the time being are on hold ( about time Amazon ) which is good , so that those people who do n't listen will buy this , and complain that they ca n't play or consistently play , or can only play at times where most people are n't on , because their either sleep , or at work or school.It no question that SE wants this game to succeed , and with the recent offering of compensation for people who bought the game , and I can only see good things happening with this game at this point now .	-1
Patch progress simulator score-5/5Actual MMO score- ... .could n't say , as much as I 'd like to.Bought this game a while back on sale , so my loss here is negligible . I had been wary of jumping in seeing as how this game has had a rocky history , as far as I can tell.Decided now 's a great time to try it out , as I am in a bit of MMO limbo . And well ... it just really sucks that I ca n't even play it . I 've resorted to Reddit , Gamefaq forums , and the actual FF14 technical forums . Nothing has helped ( uninstalled and re-installed at least 4 times now ) , ran as administrator , checked my ISP , no firewall ... .still keep getting this error every single time.Some of the more vocal fans might be offended by the 2/5 I 'm deciding to give the product right now . I understand that giving a product a bad rating because of say , issues with the delivery , or the packaging ( issues that might definitely impact your enjoyment of a product but are not inherent to it ) is akin to throwing a temper tantrum.But the client download , the patching and troubleshooting any issues are all part of the inherent MMO experience . I 'm comparing this to previous experiences with Rift , WoW , LOTRO , Tera , Neverwinter and SWTOR- all have had some issues at one point or another , none which brought the installation or update process to a full stop.What 's most frustrating to me is that per FF14 's forums , this technical issue is 'Resolved ' , yet there are new threads , as recent as 10 days old , same exact issue . ( If anyone is interested in troubleshooting , the issue is , patcher starts , goes for 90 seconds or so , starts dropping mbps DRAMATICALLY , errors out with the error codes on the subject line- already tried making the boot folder not read only , it does n't stick . Boot file is not read only though ) Once I actually play the god damn game , I 'd be happy to edit my score and give it a fair go . I just ca n't divorce a shoddy install and update process from the product overall ... .thus , shoddy product .	-1
game is still terrible and not worth the money it cost to buy it . they should have just made an xi part 2	-1
Game has so many problems its hard to know where to start . The quests are broken and you ca n't even complete the main quest on some servers . The game lacks quests to finish up even one level 50 . The crafting is long and boring and tedious . They stole many ideas from guild wars 1 and 2 and never did them right just half ass . They added rep grind in the 2.1 patch . I could go on but the fanboys and shills will just go postal and mark down whatever negative comments are said about this game . If you buy it 30 days later you just end up angry and disappointed and quit . If this game did n't have final fantasy in the name it would be just another lame free to play game .	-1
This was my first Final Fantasy game ever . I have played a lot of MMO 's I have played Warhammer Online Star War Old Republic MMO Few other NOT WOW though . Where to start.First The opening Sequence is utter Trash Cant skip it cant do anything have to watch like 5-10 min open Sequence of the game . That 's all fine and dandy but Atleast let someone skip the intro Movie . Gold or What ever currency there is in the game getting Private Convoed a lot for wanting to sell Cold . I am used to that but not as much as there was in this game first 3 hours playing the game I got atleast 300 if not more for them selling currency . Customer Service you might aswell forget about it I put in a ticket about a week ago and still no response I cant get past my story line atm due to a bug . I have few friends that have this game and they made sure I Did n't mess something up I did n't . But like I said this is my first Final Fantasy Game so take it with a grain of salt.The Graphics on this game is cartoonish . The people you get quests from there is no Voice over what so ever . All in all I would give the game a 0 But Amazon wont let me . If you like reading this game is for you .	-1
You ca n't even log in . You ca n't choose a specific server to create your character . Forget about playing with friends and family . This is basically a scam right now , taking people 's money but not allowing them access to play . SE has not communicated to us during launch day for the server error . Of course Japan has gotten new servers , but not the rest of us where it 's actually needed ? The overall rating here on Amazon says it all right now . Buy at your own risk . I can not access my character along with thousands of others .	-1
Every Review thats telling you that the servers are either down or full is the truth . We are not talking about a game thats F2P ( Free to Play ) .We are talking about a game that you paid for and that part of that payment is the ability of course to play . A lot of companies have had terrible launches with bugs in the software and server problems . We need to stop being so `` loyal '' since they are games , and start expecting to be able to use the product that we bought.No where else would we be so forgiving as to buy a product and not be able to use it . Sorry but constant apologies from Square Enix does n't cut it.It was their poor planning and lack of investment in servers that could handle massive traffic.It is after all an MMO , the key being Massively Multiplayer.I would never expect to buy anything and then not have it work properly , whenever I wanted to use it.It is also not a product that you can just walk back into the store and go 'hey this does n't work , I want my money back '' . Software companies do n't work that way.So bad reviews may be the only way to get these very poor launches to attempt to better themselves . The game plays ok when YOU CAN play it , but forgiving this all the time by loyal fans who love the series and defend it by stating `` dude its just very popular , give them a chance '' , is misguided . Then put a disclaimer on the package that states `` purchase of this product does not guarantee a chance to actually use it '' .	-1
This game is awesome , i really do not think there are any other MMO that can beat it visually in the upcoming 4 , 5 years.Game play is good , the only bad thing about it is the server and customer serviceServers , for obvious reason , players can not log in and play due to congestion , I believe a lot of other review has covered this already.Hopefully in a few month the problem will be resolved , so i wo n't get into it in this reviewNow , customer service , and when i say customer service , i meant the NA square enix team , is absolutely terrible.- They always seem to be busy , the average wait time to get to a customer service agent is 2.5 hours- They are slow to provide any news update to customersand worst of all , they never replied , if you have any issue , you have to keep trying and trying until you actually get to an agent , otherwise it 's like writing an email to a celebrity and asking for an autograph = you will never hear back from themWhat surprises me the most was , as I am writing this review , i got an customer service survey emai from square enixreally ? square enix ? anyway , the game itself is a 5 star for surethe server issue , the bad customer service , and square enix does not appear to care about dealing with troll players / RMT , i will give the game an overall 2 star	-1
The good about ff14 is the graphics . It is simply beautiful . I purchased the downloaded version of this game . Installing took about 5 hours including upgrades . Getting setup with a id name and password went smooth and I was ready to play . Creating a character was somewhat tedious , for only the gladiator looked human . You start the game with a quest giver and go out to fill that quest and return to get your reward , which is peanuts money wise.The BIG problem in the game is SOUND , except for the music . There are NO VOICE OVERS from any of the quest givers and no animal grunts , moans , and yelpings from any beasts you slain either . All the conversation from Quest givers is IN TEXT with no sound and you must constantly click on it to find out your objective . It is like watching a silent movie with no voices being heard at all . This really irked me . Also trying to figure out the map symbols is hard as well . The symbols are small on the map to read.The chat text is difficult to read and is set at about a font size of 6 and if you wear glasses , LOL . Lastly there is no in game manual . Maybe with the console version one came with it , but with the PC download version none is supplied . I realize ff14 just came out and perhaps the programmers will fix these issues . But I doubt they will fix the main issue of no voice overs . So , in the meantime I will stick with World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 for the console . Happy gaming !	-1
Not just a bad launch , I know , that 's what everybody 's complaining about . I put up with the terrible launch but there are worse issues . The reason I put 2 stars is because all of the 1 star reviews already address this problem . My issues come from slow and bad customer service , graphics issues , login issues ( even still ) and overall game smoothness and quality . Within days of actually being able to play after the launch , I had severe graphics issues . In an attempt to fix it I set the frame rate to 30 instead of 60 . Never got to play again . It was all I could do to contact customer service over and over again . After a couple days of no response , I decided that this was n't a game that I was going get along with.My computers performance is not the issue here , trust me . I am a huge square enix as well as a final fantasy fanatic but this game is insulting.Learn from my mistake , do n't get this game .	-1
You know , I 've played a lot of MMOs ... but this one has frustrated me the most ... it 's beautiful , and the game is a great RPG to level 50 but the endgame is GARBAGE ... be prepared for endless grind in a few horrible dungeons , extremely poor planning and bad difficulty curves on `` Titan '' and other bosses , 2 hour queues and general boredom while you wait . There are so many other good games out there ... I guarantee you are going to end up as irritated as I am if you expect this to be more of a standard RPG with about 20 hours of actual gameplay . As an RPG , this deserves a higher rating but as an MMO it FAILS . Bad work , Squeenix ... stick to single player games .	-1
Final Fantasy 14 started to become a chore to play . Dungeons and such were getting to the point that if the healer or tank messed up once or twice on a boss fight , the party would wipe out . I played a conjurer ( healer ) and all I could do was spam healing 1 to keep party alive during boss fights . If your tank is not outfitted correctly you will not be able to keep him alive . Also forget about using heal 2 , you run out of mana so fast I had to stop using it and go back to heal 1 . As you level the spells like heal 1 uses more mana but still heal for the same . THIS MAKES NO SENSE . Get use to your skills as you just use them over and over and over . You dont get a lot of skills . I just plain got bored with the game after 1 month of play .	-1
My son reaches for Hot Head all the time and he 's played him so much that he 's almost got him fully upgraded . He loves to `` bring down the rain ! '' which is apparently super cool . He 's a definite must have for your collection.If you go to the skylanders.com website , you can look up the various characters and you will find that some of them , including the overpriced Giant figures you find on Amazon and other resell places , are listed as `` Available Soon '' ( Hot Head is was of them until recently ) . The ones currently on the shelves are listed as `` Available Now '' . Go to the `` support '' link at the very bottom of the website and click on `` Toy availability '' and you will see an announcement on the website ( dated Dec 2012 ) stating that characters will be released through the summer of 2013 . I assume that some people have gotten their hands on either early releases of characters or that some of the characters initially released just have n't come back into stock yet . I did n't see a single Skylanders Giants character on the Activision website that was listed as `` Retired '' . So , do n't be fooled into thinking that the big retailers wo n't be getting them in their stores at some point , at regular prices . Even if you go to that ToyWiz site , they offer a `` Pre-Order '' for Thumpback ( overpriced of course ) with a scheduled shipment for February . So , how is that possible if the manufacturer is n't planning to produce more ? I say just keep an eye out on the major retailer websites and be patient . *****UPDATE****** Jan 25th . I just bought him today at Game Stop for $ 14.99 . I also saw him when I went to Wal Mart and in Best Buy . Be patient and you will find them , at regular prices . ****UPDATE**** Feb 1 . We found Thumpback and Eye Brawl at Game Stop this week . Patience has paid off .	-1

I was looking for a good , cheap replacement for my wireless 360 controller and I did n't want to spend a ton of money to buy a new one . Since this one has gotten good reviews , I decided to give it a chance.At first , I thought it was pretty ok . The buttons and sticks , which were a little too loose in my opinion , took a while to get adjusted to . Once I was use to it though , I enjoyed using it far more than my 360 controller because it 's slimmer and easier to handle.That being said , There are problems with it . Sometimes it will not sync up to the 360 at all despite being plugged in and syncing the previous time so I will have to unplug it then plug it back in , Does n't happen often but when it does it 's annoying . The controller will constantly act up as well , such as moving on-screen on it 's own without me touching it , so I have to constantly unplug it and plug it back in in order to fix it . As of late though , It 's been doing it far more frequently and it 's getting on my nerves . So a little over 4 months after owning it and it 's already on it 's way out.That is why I give this controller a 1 star and would not recommend it . Better off saving your money and buying a legit Microsoft 360 controller that will actually last . Then again , That 's the risk you take for trying to save a buck .	-1
I currently own two pairs of Sennheiser headphones and have always praised them for their quality of sound and comfort , but they do n't know the first thing about designing a gaming headset . After the initial excitement of unboxing the U320 , I quickly learned that they were terrible in almost every way imaginable , so my review is all about cons.1 . The ear cups are angled so far upward that there was a very noticeable gap between the tops of the ear cups and my head , and I do not have an abnormally thin head . Also , while the padding and fabric on the headband ( and ear cups ) is very nice , as I expected from Sennheiser , it is too straight to cup the top of my head at all , so the entire weight of the headset rests right at the center of my scalp . Not comfortable.2 . I plugged the U320 into my laptop to test them out on Skype first , and discovered that the `` Game '' volume actually controlled the chat , and the `` Chat '' volume did nothing . And after plugging the RCA audio cable into the inline controller on the headset , the person I was chatting with could no longer hear me , although I could still hear him . Which brings me to my third con:3 . ( This will only be an issue for PS3 owners ) 12 ' feet of cable is fantastic for me . I was glad to know that I could use this headset from anywhere in my livingroom , but boy was I wrong . Yes , the USB cable is long , but the included RCA cable - which runs from the inline controller to the TV/sound system - is only 6 ft. HOW did Sennheiser decide that this was a good idea ? Yeah , I can easily plug the USB cable into my laptop or my PS3 , but I ca n't plug the RCA cable into the TV . For those that are new to wired PS3 headsets , the RCA cable is how you get your game audio and the USB connection is for chat . I have used Turtle Beach 's PX21 's and P11 's , and what I love most about those headsets is the ability to plug the USB cable into my laptop to chat over Skype while simultaneously receiving game audio via the RCA cables . With the Sennheiser U320 , this is not a possibility for me unless I want to pull my chair forward 2-3 feet . I 'm only about 8 ' away from the TV as it is , but even that is too far.I ca n't comment on sound quality because there was no sense in testing that out after I realized that this headset is useless to me , but my friend did tell me that my chat mic . on my P11 's sounded better than the one on the U320's.This is such a disappointment to me . I am a big Sennheiser fan and was desperately seeking something comfortable to replace my P11 's . After searching for a good headset for a while , I decided to check and see if Sennheiser makes a gaming headset . When I saw that they do and that they offer a 2-year warranty , I thought I 'd be set for at least the next couple of years . Now I have to keep searching .	-1
I actually do n't know , as it has never actually been activated in my system because apparently I do n't have enough room in my computer . So , basically , I completed wasted my money on it . You might try to download it free to see if it will actually let you get into the game . I 've never gotten that close . Just lots of wasted time and money .	-1
So playing my new 3DS I figured out real fast my hands would cramp up bad , so off I went on the interwebs looking for a grip and this is pretty much the only one for the 3DS XL . The bottom part does not fit snug , when I want to charge my DS I have to make sure I pull the silicone out of the way or else the plug will not fit snug.Also the case also covers the L/R button and I thought no big deal but this issue make my hand crap up just as bad on Mario Kart , I hold the L trigger down to hold a green shell behind me to stop a red shell hit and I will drive the whole race like this but because of the case it kept letting go of the green shell . So I found myself pressing the L/R buttons down really hard to make sure they stayed down and the extra pressure I put would crap my hands up after bout 30 Mins.So for now I took this off and ordered me the circle pad pro , Not for the 2nd analog stick as I have no games that support it but because it seems to be the only other grip on the market . hope it works well .	-1
I used this comfort grip for awhile but it does n't quite cling to the system as well as I 'd like and in my case my thumb would get under it while using the Circle Pad Pro . It also never quite stayed on near the triggers , and in fact using the triggers pulled it right off . I eventually switched to a different product .	-1
I read some of positive reviews , and lead myself believe this is a grip/handle for Nitendo 3DS XL . In reality , it 's a cover with heavy rubber that you can grab on . I did n't have much hope for this product in the begin with , but I never expect it 's this bad . I agree that it 's very difficult to judge the comfort level of the grip since people have different sizes of hands , it may work one may not work for others . However , if you compare the handles to Wii U pro , Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers , you will see the different , UNLESS everyone have hands that bent inward , this grip may actually work . Sorta of like having a square wheel when you 're driving . Furthermore , it will also depend on the games you 're playing . CHECK before you purchase . This grip is not for any game . If you use a lot of L and R button , this grip hurt your inner palm . Of course , there are some positive features . One of them is the cover over L and R buttons prevent you accidentally activate them which I did often before . Now you have to press a bit harder without interfere too much of game playing . Another thing is there are two stoppers beneath the bottom that prevent the 3DS slide away from hands . In the end , I simply ca n't say that I 'm happy with this one .	-1
The screen protectors were nice and the car charger but the case zipper was broken so that did n't work out so well . It may be better to just just the accessories that are truly needed . **UPDATE**After only a couple weeks of use the earbuds broke ! The plastic part that goes into your ear fell apart and you could see the wires etc . So they have already gone to the trash . I would recommend getting a different kit for your 3DS XL .	-1
I 've been told my reviews are too long , so here 's the gist : do n't bother with this game . Even as a free game , the time cost is n't worth it . Remember me has some great ideas , but stale , repetitive gameplay makes this a forgettable title . Stay away.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To go into more detail , Remember Me is an attempt to fuse ideas from a few good games ( Uncharted and Arkham Asylum immediately come to mind ) with a great story concept . The result is a horrible mash-up of elements that just do n't mix , and are poorly-executed to boot.If Remember Me was graded solely on its concept , I would probably love it . The plot follows Nilin , an incredibly sexy French girl who has lost all of her memories ( if it seems strange that I am mentioning her sex appeal , read on for the reason ) . During a final mindwipe session , she hears the voice of an old colleague who claims that her life is about to end as she knows it , and instead he plans an escape for our heroine . The story seems like a cut-and-paste of some of Philip K. Dick 's stories ( We Can Remember For You Wholesale and Paycheck come to mind ) , but that 's a good thing . Sci-fi should be more omnipresent in video games.Unfortunately , the developer has taken the low road in developing this story . Your plot will be delivered to you through a glut of cutscenes ( which can not be skipped ) , and the lore of your surroundings is delivered through collectables . Thus , as in many Japanese games ( both developed and published ) , there is a complete disconnect between the character you watch on the screen and the character you control in the game . For me at least , the cut scenes served as little more than a break in the action , which is unfortunate when a game 's story has the potential that Remember Me does.Nilin is one of the most boring characters I can remember in a game . It 's not that her voicework is bad ( actually , the voices in this game are pretty good , by video game standards ) . She 's just boring . Her only asset is her as ... uhhh , derriere . I mean , just look at the cover of the game . That pretty much sums up Nilin.Gameplay completely wrecks the proceedings . Here again , a high concept is laid low by reprehensibly lazy development . Early on , you learn that your character has the ability to interact with the minds of other characters ( both NPCs and enemies ) . in particular , she has the ability to re-write a person 's memories , in instant time . She can also steal memories from people , and use her power to overload the brains of enemies . That alone should be awesome . In fact , when I heard about the concept , I was absolutely champing at the bit to dive into an open world stealth adventure with multiple plot lines depending on how I interact with others.And then I played the game . And unfortunately , Remember Me has my character walking on linear paths with invisible walls fighting tons of generic enemies , before the proceedings are broken up by standard boss battles . When my character was n't fighting , she was going through the slop called & # 34 ; platforming & # 34 ; in the PS3 generation ( i.e . walking forward and hitting a button when you ca n't go anywhere ) . This kind of platforming has been stale for years now , and it certainly is n't improved here . Fighting is n't much better . Trying to take a page from Arkham Asylum , Remember Me attempts to base its combat on a free-flow system , where timing , dodging and counters are the key . What a shame that it does n't work at ALL . You initially start with a 3 hit combo , although later you can unlock larger combos . In addition , you also unlock button presses to put in these combos . It 's hard to describe in words , but I 'll try . You are initially allotted 3 button presses ( all of which are square ) . Thus , you can fill a single 3-hit combo . Later , you unlock a 5 hit combo , and three more button presses . Thus , you can fill three slots of your new 5-hit combo , or borrow button presses from your 3 hit , and fill a full 5-hit combo ( actually , that 's not entirely accurate , but I do n't feel the need of explaining the minutiae of this stupid system ) . Amass more experience , and you will gain more combos and button presses , until by the end , you have multiple filled combos to do what you want.The problems is I never saw much need to go beyond the 3-hit combo for non-boss battles . In short , I would hit an enemy twice , and jump over him . Hit him twice more ( your combo wo n't break , so you will gain the 3-hitter , as well as begin a new 3-hitter ) , and jump over him . Rinse . Repeat . Sometimes I might get swarmed , but even on the hardest difficulty , this served me through most fights . Early on , you also learn finishing moves ( such as the memory overload mentioned above ) , which shorten battle . But it 's a boring affair , only made interesting because the platforming segments are even more so.Bosses are more interesting , but only slightly so . For example , early on , you learn how to go into special combat modes which ignore defense . This is useful , as the first boss defends well . So , you charge up , go into your special mode , and beat him down . Then , you run away while you charge again . This can be sped up immensely by augmenting your 3-hit combo to lower & # 34 ; cooldown & # 34 ; , but really , this is only necessary if you want trophies . Other bosses have similar shticks.The worst aspect of the game is the collectables . As I said earlier , gameplay progresses on rails . Well , mostly . Occasionally , though , an invisible wall might break down , allowing you access to a separate small path , on which will lie one of the games many collectables . If collectables were only lore , that would be one thing . But in fact , much of your character development depends on finding these collectables ! It makes no sense in this type of game to put so many collectables about , and it further ruins the game.And finally , we get to the most disappointing and downright distressing part of this train wreck . Earlier , I mentioned that our heroine had the ability to complete re-write the memories of NPCs . During the game , if I recall correctly , you do this exactly 4 times . Moreover , you must re-write memories in a specific way . To give an example , in the initial re-write , you must convince a would-be assassin that in fact , the man she is working for killed her beau . You are sent into one of her memories , and given the ability to alter small portions of it to serve your purposes . One thing I immediately did was change the memory so that the doctor tried to kill the bounty hunter , and was told this was a & # 34 ; memory bug & # 34 ; with the explanation that & # 34 ; you ca n't remember your own death ! & # 34 ; . What ? It seems perfectly reasonable that you would remember your own death ( or attempted death ) . After all , I 'm attempting to implant a memory that your husband died , when he 's clearly still alive . Why ca n't I just implant that you died , or nearly so ? You might take me to task for this , but the point is the following : this mechanic has a ton of potential , and it is n't developed in the least . Re-writing memories is just a MacGuffin . It serves no purpose in the grand scheme other than as a plot coupon to continue delivering the game 's storyline . I could just as well offered the would-be assassin her favorite fast-food burger.And this really crystallizes the problem of Remember Me . The ideas are great . But the implementation is lazy , and as with anything , the devil is in the details . It 's not worth the 10 hours invested , even for free . I only give it two stars because , in the hands of a capable developer , this could have been a tour de force . I salivate at the idea of Eidos developing another Deus Ex around some of these ideas .	-1
ps plus saved me from another trashbutton layout is terrible . combo L1+R1 or L1+R2 technique is not comfortable . L3+select action+X is also not comfortable . whole control is not comfortable . targeting system jump all over enemies is ridiculous . quick time is terribly done . story is boring.i am glad , i got this on ps plus free . ps plus is money saver ...	-1
I 'll start with the amazing things about this game . First , and most noticeable , are the graphics . Absolutely stunning . This is exactly what you would expect to see on a next gen console that is on its way out the door ( presumably later this year ) . The lighting is superb and even plays a pivotal role in several fights later in the game . You can tell that this game is a labor of love for the developers here , because detail is everywhere.When movies first came out there were no extras , or at least very few . Then some director , probably someone like Howard Hughes , decided to add extras . Doing so added a sense of realism and attachment to not only the scenery , but also the scene taking place . In the game , there are robots everywhere , cleaning this and that , and there are signs that pop up as you get near them - even telling you what 's on special in that restaurant that day ! There is stuff on the ground , blowing around , hanging , and I could go on , but I 'll not bore you . While this may seem like typical stuff common to games these days , the sheer level of detail in trivial things like this is enough to gawk at.Also , the over-arching premise of the game is pretty cool too . According to the game , in the not too distant future , memories and experiences , essentially , will be recorded on a huge mainframe somewhere . Thus , memories become digitized . The developers show how this could be used recreationaly ( a guy buys a first kiss memory , and a `` drugie '' talks about `` just wanting to remember something happy , man '' to a dealer ) and how this sort of digitization can be abused by the powers that be . This is where the story comes in.While I 'm not going to give a synopsis of the story ( that 's what playing the game is for ) , I will say that at 43 % completed it feels predictable . The guy that helped you out may not be such a great guy after all and your character , Nilin ( yes , she 's a girl , deal with it . She could kick my butt ! ) , is feeling not so trusting of his motives , behaviors , and rationale . We 've heard this one before . While not uninteresting , it is nothing new . There are great moments after each Episode ( or level ) where Nilin has a monologue and tells her feelings on the state of things within her head , and outside of her control . This creates a depth in character as she wrestles with morality , a shocking feature to be included in a game.The gameplay is also pretty predictable . You run here , fight these guys , then jump and climb there . There 's no new life being breathed into this genre , in fact , some is being taken out . As you approach an object , an arrow appears above it in accordance to your own position . Basically the route you need to take is mapped out exactly for you when climbing . So , yes , this is a rather linear game . But it is n't so linear that it is abrasive . The desire to just explore Neo-Paris is certainly present throughout the game so far , but is left unfulfilled due to lack of ability to do so . Oh well.As far as the gameplay is concerned , the creme de la creme is the ability to remix memories . A good example of this is when a general , or some such official , remembers having an argument with his girlfriend . Nilin comes in and enters his data memories and tweaks certain things to get the desired result . So , you , the player , have to manipulate certain objects until the aforementioned result occurs . In this particular situation , you must make the general `` remember '' that he shot his girlfriend in a drunken rage . The result - he comes to after Nilin escapes and he realizes what he 's done and kills himself in real life . Crazyness . Unfortunately , this system is used all too infrequently . I 've used it maybe twice so far . If they had utilized this gem more often this game could have easily been a 5.There is an interesting innovation for the fighting , too , though . It is simply punch and kick and then dodge and repeat , BUT , you can customize your own combos ( within preconditioned parameters ) . The game provides a combo layout ( square , square , square , or square , triangle , triangle , square ... . ) and you fill it in with your choice of three `` types '' of attacks - either power move , regenerative , or cool down . These are all explained in the game , and if you 're interested enough , you 'll buy the game so I wo n't describe them here . Besides , if you 're a crafty gamer , maybe you can already figure out what they do ? Overall , this is a fun game , but so far it has n't captivated my heart to the point that while driving back home I think `` Ca n't wait to get me some of __________ ( fill in blank with awesome game ) . '' If you 're looking for a mindless good time with a story that is engaging but not spellbinding , and gameplay that does n't scream revolution , but is fun nonetheless , then this is for you . Also , I thought I would mention that thus far , again about 43 % into the game , I have seen no reason for this to be rated Mature . There has been some slight smear of blood on the wall but that 's about it . When you , or an enemy , gets hit , there is no blood that flies out ( God Of War style ) . The language has n't been offensive either.EDIT 8/1/13 : Ok . So I put this game down to play The Last of Us ( which if you do n't own , then you should really stop reading this and go buy it now ) . In my opinion it was poor timing to have this game released so close to a monstrously anticipated title such as The Last of Us . Well , I beat that game , and so I returned to Remember Me , as it was left unfunished - about 50 % through when I stopped playing.The problem was that once I started playing again , I was bored immediately . I did a few fights , even remixed a memory , ( my favorite and the most redeeming value of this game ) but I still just lost interest within a few seconds . It was n't because the Elite Enforcers are a lame enemy , it was just SO boring.Part of the fun of games is figuring out where I can climb next , and if the developers ca n't create an intuitive `` flow '' of climbable objects then phooey on them . Do n't put an arrow telling me where to climb , I should be able to figure it out for myself . I would n't go so far as to say that doing so is `` offensive to my intelligence '' but it is downright unnecessary.Also , the fights are very tiresome . Even with a break of about a month between where I left this game off and where I picked it up , I was still bored with the fights.This game boils down to one thing : predictability . This is why my title says `` 3.7 ... . '' yet I switched my four star original rating to a two star . Remember Me is fun and endearing at first , but once you play a bit , you realize , `` Hey , I 've done this before ... like a thousand times . ''	-1
I wanted to like this game so much more than I actually did . On the surface it has a lot going for it : A female protagonist in a futuristic city gives it sort of a Mirror 's Edge vibe . The ability to create your own fighting combos sounded like a great way to customize the game to your own play style . And the plot about stealing and remixing memories promised to be interesting . Unfortunately the developers of Remember Me seem to have forgotten a lot about good game design along the way.To start with , the game is quite linear , with only a few slight deviations from the main path to pick up a collectible ... most of which are telegraphed in advance in the form of hacked video screens providing a hint that something is hidden nearby . Remember Me looks great , and the city of Neo Paris sprawls out in front of protagonist Nilin , just begging to be explored . Except you ca n't . I wanted to climb up every building like an Assassin 's Creed game , but you 're pretty much stuck on a fixed path.Compounding the problem , in a few instances I actually had trouble figuring out where to go . For the most part the game uses Nilin 's cyberpunk implants to hover visual-aid arrows over climbable areas , mostly because the handholds blend so well into the futuristic scenery that they 'd otherwise be unnoticeable . But in a few cases they were n't immediately obvious , and I spent a good 15 minutes looking , which drags the action to a complete halt . Thus the game manages to make navigation too easy most of the time , and frustrating the rest . There 's an augmented-eye function that sometimes pops up if the game decides you 're not progressing fast enough , and it will point you roughly to where you need to go next . Why not just have that feature available any time the player wants it ? I simply can not comprehend this design decision.The problems continue with another major part of the game , the combat . It turns out you ca n't actually create your own combos . You 're given a few blank sequences of button presses , which you ca n't change . You can only choose the effect of each step in the combo , and there are n't many choices . There are standard damage moves , attacks that also provide a bit of healing for you , and some that reduce the cooldown times on your special attacks . And I have to say , those cooldown times are way , WAY too long . Especially in the later half of the game , I 'd find myself up against numerous enemies that could n't be beaten with regular attacks , so I spent a lot of time weaving and dodging around them waiting for the special abilities to recharge . They would follow me around the room like zombies the whole time , repeating taunts and threats , and it looks ridiculous . Really ? The entire development process went by , and no one noticed this ? The third and final part of the game is remixing memories . In it you 're presented with a key memory from another character 's life . You can pause , forward and rewind the events , and you can change minor details to affect the outcome and thus , the character 's memory of what they believe happened . It ties in well with the story , which is pretty decent even though Nilin , being basically an amnesiac , is n't as interesting or likeable as other recent female protagonists . And the puzzle-solving is a nice distraction from the repetitive combat and tedious platforming . Out of the entire game , I enjoyed the memory-remixing sequences the best , but there simply are n't enough of them.In the end , I 'm afraid I ca n't really recommend this game , especially when there are so many other must-play titles being released . All I can say is that years from now , I 'll remember this title with a certain bitter regret , because Remember Me had so much potential to be great that it was truly upsetting to see it squandered .	-1
This game left me profoundly disappointed . Before I catalog the mistakes made by the developers , I will warn others of the mistake I made . I first learned about this game through the Gamescon 2012 Gameplay Trailer . That was a mistake . When I saw the trailer , I thought , wow ! What a great game this is going to be ! Since the days of pacMAN , video games have had a very strong cultural bias towards men . Macho guys doing macho things with guns and muscles . I do n't have anything against that , but that does perhaps leave a rather conspicuous market under served.This game looked very different . The obvious first signal was the female protagonist . I wo n't say much about her looks except that she was at least not a completely ridiculous cartoon of some male fantasy . What about the game play ? Watching the trailer , the only gunfire was an accidental shooting and a suicide . Great ! I do n't have a problem with gun games per se , but it does seem overused in movies and games . To have the only gunfire be unconventional was , to me , like blowing a hole in the typical video game gun play trope . This made me think that the designers were going to think differently . It was going to have a different kind of mechanic and emphasis . A game play mechanic of memory manipulation . How interesting ! Like a Phillip K. Dick novel . Could a video game character actually win battles the authentic way that wealthy powerful people throughout history have , by manipulating others ? That would be interesting ! Sign me up ! I showed my wife the trailer and she agreed that in contrast to typical games , this one looked thoughtful and interesting to her.When we sat down to play this game , however , I was pretty disappointed . Here are the things I did not like about this game.While the main character was female , that almost seemed to be calculated posturing . The gender was completely irrelevant . That would be fine if some of the 1000s of enforcers or leapers ( a type of overly abundant opponent fodder ) were female . Compare with Skyrim where you 're as likely to find male as female opponents.The main character , Nilin , at least did n't wear tall high heels . They were short high heels . Perhaps this is why she could n't jump onto a coffee table or small box . That kind of ineffectiveness was constantly frustrating . The frustration was especially absurd given the character 's unnatural ability to climb walls like a coked up chimpanzee.The reason for this feeling that sometimes you have superpowers and sometimes you 're an invalid is the extremely linear flow to the game 's progression . I watched my wife actually handle the controller and I felt I missed nothing . I had no desire whatsoever to experience whatever frustration she was contending with to move the story along . It 's really almost like a movie was made in the Unreal game engine and to watch it you have to press some buttons on the controller to unpause the video . Of the annoying effects of this , the worst was unknowingly walking into a new area and then finding yourself locked out of going back ( perhaps to look for the hidden power up ) . Combine that with an inability to save games at exact user defined points ( well , we never figured it out ) and it can be very frustrating . Considering other games out there ( Skyrim , GTA , Minecraft ) , it 's inconceivable that in 2013 a game was released that was so restrictive.This is especially tragic given that the highlight of the game was the world and its artwork assets . There was essentially zero interaction with this world . The character moved along her track . She would pass by stores and stalls but there was no interacting with the vendors . No interacting with the humanoid robots , the furniture , the garbage , nothing . It was a mild Disneyland ride . Video games are better than Disneyland because they can do better.Walking along a well-decorated path is hardly a compelling game experience . What was the game aspect ? The memory stuff , right ? No . The game play was Street Fighter . Whaaa ? Remember Me and Street Fighter are both Capcom games . In my opinion , this is no coincidence.Nilin 's Disneyland ride through Neo-Paris is heavily punctuated with street brawls . That 's it . That 's the `` game '' part of the game . Street fighting . With fists . If you love street fighting games , maybe this will appeal to you . The petite main character needs to literally beat to death hundreds of people with her own hands . When I realized this , I was horrified at having introduced my wife to this game . This was not how I wanted to demonstrate that some video games were n't exclusively consumed with testosterone soaked machismo.The combat , such that it was , seemed to me completely uninteresting . A common necessary strategy was to run around your opponents ( who were always only half as fast ) for literally minutes at a time while a recharge timer ticked down . Maddening . While there were ways to speed this up sometimes , sometimes there were not.The weapons and combat perks seemed weird and contrived ( like Street Fighter 's fireball ) . Nilin has some kind of gun thing that might be a gun or might be something that acts like a ( weak ) gun . My question , why not just carry a gun ? We know from the 2012 trailer that big single-shot-kills guns exist in 2084 . Why not skip the Chuck Norris routine ? Although the captain of the police has a serious gun , no other police do ? Sometimes it was very confusing how to move along the track or win against a certain collection of opponents . Sometimes , for example , the boss fights had a status bar for the opponent and sometimes not leaving you to wonder , am I doing something wrong ? No , you just have to keep doing the same attack for 10+ minutes and he 'll eventually die.What about the advertised premise of the game , the memory stuff ? I found it extremely disappointing . The trailer showed an example , and that exact example was one of the `` remix '' sessions . Unfortunately there were only about 6 or 7 such sequences . Incredibly one of the memory remixes was the one from the trailer and in the game , it was completely out of context . Maybe this is why a serious firearm was in that scene but no where else . Each sequence was basically trial and error guessing a 4-5 digit binary number ( technically ) . In practice it got rather repetitive . It was so highly scripted that this superpower which the main character possessed was essentially useless during the other 99 % of the game . As with the gun , I was left wondering why would n't Nilin just scramble her opponent 's memories instead of beating them to death with her fists.For all the good design work , there were some terrible lapses . For example , the font on help screens was microscopic and unreadable . Often the indicator showing the correct path to follow looked like other signage . Though they were usually very nice , I felt that there were some serious anti-aliasing issues with some of the scenery graphics . The music reminded me of 80 's arcade music . The camera angle was often annoying and unhelpful.Sometimes the story got into trouble too . As with the fist fighting over gun or mental trickery , another weird inconsistency was the fact that a car crash is a big plot device . Cars , driven by humans ? In 2084 ? They have sophisticated hominoid robots all over the place ; could they not have autonomous cars ? And there are personal helicopters . And there are no roads for cars anywhere . Etc.I can not understand why they let this game be rated `` Mature '' . I did not notice any nudity , partial or otherwise . They could have easily changed the half dozen times they used a naughty word with no change in effect ( except the rating ) .Given the fact that this game is misrepresented as something other than a visually attractive street fighting game , I consider it somewhat cheeky to ask for $ 60 . My wife played through this game in maybe 16 hours of taking her time . It is definitely a good candidate to rent if you really feel you need to see what it 's all about . Watching someone else play through on YouTube is probably an even better value.If you 're interested in this game , I highly recommend Force Unleashed . The format of the game is actually very similar . Though it came out in 2008 , the graphics are great , the story is excellent , the combat is interesting , and the sense of agency with the eponymous special power is very `` forceful '' . Ironically , it is far more memorable to me than Remember Me .	-1
So this game has problems . I want to suggest it but honestly the problem is that it does not know who it was made for . I am an avid RPG fan and this game 's premise seemed so interesting to me . The part that sold me on getting it was the ability to change memories and having that immediately affect the person you are with . Just doing this as a play feature could have been very interesting . But those are the special moments in each subsection . They are not the main playing mechanic . There 's closed off levels of uninspired platforming that lead you to boring brawling sections that you get to create customized fighting combos between 2 buttons . And by customize I mean pick wether the punch or kick is healing , punishing , or cooldown reducing . You do n't really pick the length of the combo or order of buttons . The story is very interesting . Gameplay is meh.PRO : + Interesting story+ Memory changing portions really coolCON : - Unfocused gameplay.- Bad platforming- Ignorance of core audience- Poor fighting mechanics.- Rare use of memory mechanicI really want to like this game for a good story but basic gameplay issues eliminate that possibility .	-1
I did n't enjoy this game at all . The acting is pretty bad and drove me nuts from the start . The fighting and combo system is n't done very well and it just is n't fun to play . The story did n't get me involved and the overall direction was just not my thing . A waste of time . Compared to The Last of Us , Bioshock and Beyond Two Souls this game just feels dated and weak .	-1
the game is repetitive and get 's boring . the story goes as you are a sexy girl who 's in a communist world and prisoners are having their memories wiped out and you have an old friend that helps you escape and you manipulate and take peoples memories as a finishing move . the concept and story is n't bad at all . the detail is beautiful . the gameplay is just not there . you acquire combos to take on enemies and get a new robotic arm that shoots beams . however you 'd think in 2085 there would be guns or laser beam cannons . no . just fighting and techniques to stun enemies with a focus gauge . if the game had weaponry instead of button mashing combos . I would have enjoyed it . not a fan of Unreal Technolgys it 's not unreal it ; s uncanny .	-1
When I saw the trailers and the gameplays previews for this game I was pretty excited about it . However that was not the feeling I got after playing it . I would define this game as a great story trapped in a lousy game . Just to summarize , the gameplay usually combines tons of arcade style fights with a lot of bad guys with platform style and big bosses to make you waste a little more of your time.The biggest disappointment for me was , that there is only one way and only one to do things . To go from A to B you just have to follow the yellow arrow pointing you where to climb or where to go . After playing games like Assasin 's Creed , GTA , or even not so big map games but still open worlds like MGS , this game brought me back to the previous gen games.It has a great story , but the game , it just sucks too much.I really felt I was playing a really old and boring game . I ended up playing it just to give value to my money , but for no other reason . Zero fun .	-1
I had some hope for this game - not too high , but high enough that I ended up getting let down . However , that wo n't come into this review ; I 'll try my best to make it as objective as I can ( as -any- opinion-based piece can be , anyway ) .Here 's the thing - I really love the story of this game and the main character , and especially the world . I think it 's all really unique and interesting , and very well written . In fact , the writing is the entirety of the two stars I gave this game.The problem is the gameplay ; an unfortunate problem for a -game- to have . What it comes down to is that everything is repetitive , and does n't seem very well thought-out . The combat in particular is the worst part of the game , uninteresting at the best of times and extremely irritating at the worst . The entire combat system is based around getting interrupted , for some reason I ca n't fathom . It 's combo-based meaning that you 're hitting the same sequence of five buttons for the entirety of the game , except that you 're forced to dodge between every one or two button presses because you 're surrounded by enemies who will knock you out of your combo . It makes combat not only boring , but frustrating as well , and it does n't help that the last third of the game pits you against -waves- of the same enemies over and over . Also , while it states you can create your own combos , you 're actually not able to change any button presses , only the cosmetic appearance of the moves and the attributes the moves have.The rest of the gameplay is n't quite as bad , but it 's nothing good , either . Most of the game has you moving down linear corridors , and while linearity is not inherently bad , it is when your movement is often through climbing that 's oftentimes glitchy and causes unfair deaths while also being slow and boring instead of the freeing kind you get in games like Assassin 's Creed or Uncharted.The high points of this game are the writing , the world-building , and the art direction , but even they are n't good enough to make it worth suffering through the awful combat and boring progression that makes up the majority of the game . Give this one a pass .	-1
This game had all the potential IN THE WORLD to be brilliant . I mean we finally have another female protagonist that dresses with some self respect , beautiful graphics and set pieces , and an original idea that drives the game . But it all falls flatter than a pancake due to repetitive game play , a dreadfully bad story , and being handheld every step of the way . Now I will honestly say I did n't beat the game . It was a complete chore to play and I just could n't see my self wasting anymore time with a game I was n't enjoying . I made it to chapter 5 and called it quits . The story so far is pretty non- existent from where I left off . You have no idea or pre-determined goal to reach . Just go from point A to point B and fighting with the button mashing combat system which is very dated . The platforming could have been fun , but you are literally handheld and told where to go due to the yellow chevrons posted every where . The game is very linear as well , your basically walking in a corridor . You wa n't to explore the beautiful world of Neo Paris ? WELL TOO BAD . There are invisible walls every where , look but do n't touch . The only positive about this game is the memory remixes , which allow you to rewind and fast forward a person 's memory and change their knowledge of the outcome . But overall this game is n't even worth a rental to be quite honest . Nothing to see here , just another flop summer title .	-1
This game fails to capture the player . The story and concept are very interesting and have so much potential , and the whole memory remix thing you are exposed to early on is pretty awesome . But sadly most of the game is spent looking for obvious collectibles in on a linear path , and fighting waves of enemies with one of the most boring combat systems I have seen yet . Consisting of a couple combos , you end up just dodging and button mashing your combos until everyone is down . As for the story , it seemed very interesting to start but you end up just going on aimless random missions for this revolutionary leader guy Edge which makes most of the story itself pretty invalid and non-existent . Its not an absolute terrible game , but its not very good , especially for a Capcom game , who I love dearly . If you are that interested , rent it ...	-1
This is proof that originality is dead in video games.And the public is suckered into it , especially UN-EXPERIENCED gamers , who think this is original and includes brand new ideas.To summarise : Platforming + Fighting + MemoriesOR : uncharted + arkham city + Animus from Assassin 's CreedNow , only an experienced gamer would know this because I played and studied various games across platforms . Now that I have put it across this way , you must be going : `` WOW ! You are right ! I never knew ! `` That is how industry players do it . They take ideas from best-selling titles , mix them up , and make 'a new game'.And it works ; the PS3 version is sold out on amazon when this review is written.If you have been tricked , well , do n't feel too bad . You are just part of the general population .	-1
okay . i beat this game , managed to get a platinum ( yes i know it 's not the most important thing ) .i actually did not enjoy this title , that does n't mean you wo n't . i just could n't get into it . 1 example would be the fact that you are in Neo-Paris , but everyone sounds British . Linear as linear can be , no French names except for Philippe whom we hear over an intercom . For a nex-gen game , i do n't get why the bad guys all look the same , the only way to differentiate was the uniform , but it 's still the same face , hair and beard . somehow losing your memory turns you into a pale freak.you can access the memories of managers like it was nothing ( though they are story related , but come on , if this guy is in charge , he must have a firewall or a 'tamper-proof ' chip for his own memories.I wo n't lie , this felt rushed , i did not enjoy it at all , all it did was raise my trophy count . The 'personalized combat ' in which you actually 'have to follow specific combo successions ' sucked like crazy for me.I would seriously give a lot to actually forget this experience.Then again , it might be exactly what you are looking for .	-1
I had high hopes for this game , but I 've been disappointed by the poor combat system , the repetitive memory mixing scenes and by the overall flow of the game . What was particularly frustrating is that the enemies tend to swamp you , and the combat system does n't work very well because you need to memorize what combination of buttons will get you desired results , while also pushing them at just the right time . I would n't recommend this game unless you want to punish yourself .	-1
The game is one bad fight after another . The game is extremely linear ; go this way or no way at all . If looks like you would be able to go another way but no you can only go the way they want you to go ... and once you 're there you ca n't go back to check something out . The climbing was also only one way to climb . You walk a narrow path that lead to an open area , usually in the shape of a square and you fight the same boring enemies over and over and over and over and oh yeah OVER AGAIN . Even the idea of making your own fight chains was interesting but the game made it boring . It still was basically preset on which buttons you 're pressing.When I first heard about this game I was excited . The premise of the game sounds very interesting . The idea of being able to steal and remix someone memories sounds fascinating but the game was nothing like that . Even when you could change a memory , which was rear , you could only change it for the out come the makers of the game wanted , so only one way.I 'm an adult gamers who really enjoys the Tomb Raider games , which are also linear game and the fights are in open areas . This game was the same concept but was VERY poorly done.I found the story was very weak and you could n't put much thought into it or it really would n't make sense . Just because you change a person 's memory does n't mean it 's going to change the outcome of events . Memories are perceptions not actions . If you 're in a car accident , if you change your memory of the accident , you would still have been in an accident just you views on the accident change . In the game you change a memory and you change an outcome . This could have been a fun part of the game but as mentioned before you could rarely do this and you could only change it to get the outcome the game makers wanted.There must be some people out there that liked the game based on the reviews but I would n't recommend this game to anyone , even if it was free . It 's just that boring.P.S . I discovered most people on Amazon do n't like negative feedback and just check the not helpful button because they disagree with the poster 's opinion . If you did n't find this helpful , please tell me in the comments why and I 'll try to update this to provide more information .	-1
Combine Super Mario Brothers with better graphics driven by the `` idea '' of Memory Control and you have Remember me . The concept of Memory Control is not a big part of the majority of actions you are asked to perform . They are a quick and easy button push on `` missions '' while you spend the majority of your time `` fighting '' without using your powers at all . That does n't even make sense . If she is so good a memory blanking why does n't she blank the memories of guards and other adversaries you are constantly meeting ? And you spend most of your time jumping , running and fighting along a predetermined path while trying to get to the next cut scene..thus the Mario Brothers reference . Along the way you learning new fighting moves . How does that differ from even the earliest XBOX games ? ? So what are the challenges ... when precision moves are required to travel between destinations ( that do n't really qualify as `` missions '' ) , the game suddenly skews your controls slightly to make it harder to get there . Add to that a few puzzles that involving moving across signs with flipping parts . Once you realize that moving along ledges IS the better part of the game , those are annoying enough to cause you to put your controller down and read a good book . This is fun ? ? ? ? Fighting and killing is pretty boring at this point , especially given the advanced capabilities of platforms like Xbox and PlayStation to provide true character interaction and growth . And hey ... you did n't buy this game with the promise of more head bashing . You wanted to use your brain more than your thumb . Forget it ! If we all refuse to accept violence in the place of creativity maybe the gaming industry will wake up . I expected better from Capcom .	-1

While the graphics of this game are stunning and the story is original , the gameplay just was n't impressive . I found the whole thing to be overly complicated and hard to follow . The fighting/melee controls are upgraded through a system that makes no sense to me . The main character moves through neo-Paris via jumping from building to building similar to Lara Croft 's ledge climbing and swinging . The biggest disappointment for me , however , was the memory rewind sequence . The main character has the ability to go into a person 's mind , rewind their memories and change them subtly to make a specific outcome be what they believe as truth . Again , visually stunning and the controls work perfectly . The actual application of this ability just was n't exciting . Also , I found that I just did n't really like or care about the characters . The whole gameplay experience was just very blah . I am a huge fan of Deus Ex and I was hoping for a similar experience with Remember Me but it just was n't there . My advice would be to wait for a further price drop or buy a used copy . It seems to be falling in price every day so apparently I 'm not the only person who is n't a fan .	-1
This game is not worth 20 dollars.pros-nice graphics and imaginative environmentaudiocons-multiple glitches were i was forced to reset the game and lose my progress ( 2 boss fights ) story is different , but i found myself not caring about the character in the story.most of the characters were not developed well as the story progressed ( again added to not caring about the story line ) the rewind feature interface is highly annoying ( you will have to rewind in game cinema like you are reeling in fish with your thumbstick ) did i mention the glitches ? I am currently stuck within a boss i just defeated ... great game right ?	-1
This is a game with a ton of potential . For every point in it 's favor , there is a counterpoint . The acrobatics are nice , but the world is so linear , and you will almost always make the jump . The story starts out in a compelling world , but eventually just drops you off in a world full of zombies and robots . Combat is done in the style of God of War , and you have two- to four-button combos that you can create yourself . Unfortunately , all strikes are very plain , and combat is a chore , as is the climbing and exploration aspects of the game . I 'd try a sequel , if just because the setting and story are so unique , but like Mirror 's Edge , if the whole game is broken , a few great ideas do n't make it fun .	-1
X-Blades is a gorgeous game to look at , but the gameplay is extremely repetitive . It gets boring very quickly . I wish it was a movie or an anime instead of a game .	-1
Yes this ins't much of a game , but for $ 1.99 I really ca n't get mad . Broken up area levels , just seemed like a 5 year old laid out the levels .	-1
Bought this game to pass time between Diablo3 and Metro 2033 . Got $ 5 direct download from Amazon . Price was good . Game is OK ; too linear way too linear . You can only go so far left and right and you ca n't go backwards . Definitely not an open searchable environment . Go forward ( only way to go ) and swing axe - repeat . It is kind of hard to die too . Minimal character development , single plot , etc ... . Did I mention it was linear ? If I could turn back time I would not buy this game . The $ 5 was the only decent part of the game . The game seems like the neglected child of a side scroller like Moon Patrol or Zaxxon ( remember those ? ) mates with a budget Oblivion . the game is linear .	-1
Still trying to get through this thing , but there are many bugs . I wo n't sit here and list them all because it would take too much time and space . Besides , who wants to read all of that ? All I will say is that this game is a poorly done port . It might be better on a console , but for PC users it 's a buggy mess .	-1
This RPG had some interesting ideas in it , and a massive body of mythos to work within , but it fell short of being an interesting game . The characters are entirely forgettable , the dialogue is mostly terrible , and the gameplay is rather unpolished . This game is a hybrid between a hack & slash and a tactical RPG , but fails to synthesize them into a fun package . If you 're a diehard LOTR and RPG fan , this might be worth getting on sale , but for me , even the $ 5 I spent on it was too much .	-1
These items were scratched before we could get them in place and that was only with the pressure of a very smooth finger . We were not pleased at all and will have to replace them as soon as possible .	-1
I bought this thinking that after buying Cradle of Rome a few years ago , there would be some changes or upgrades or something more sophisticated . It 's exactly the same game except you 're gaining materials for building Egypt . I just was n't very impressed . I could 've gone back and replayed Cradle of Rome . The & # 34 ; jewels & # 34 ; are even mostly the same . Also , Cradle of Rome was a little tougher . It 's taken me too short an amount of time to get through all the levels . I would not have bought this if I 'd known it was so similar to the other game , and it will prevent me from buying any others in this series .	-1
It is a little big and it makes using some buttons hard . There are a lot better options when looking to protect your device .	-1
I enjoyed the tutorial , but even the & quot ; beginner & quot ; levels were frustrating to navigate . I like my learning curves to be a little less steep.Two things in particular struck me as unnecessary : -Death : why would a puzzle game introduce death as an optional outcome ? -Chance : the acorns fall at random . I love puzzle games , but strategy and skill should determine your success , not chance .	-1
Greetings fellow amazonians as you all know I love my video games so when I saw this I jumped at it . the games are good though slightly dated , but really gets me excited is the fact that after blowing the brains out of the baddies on my games I can finish my fifth of vodka and take my shotgun outside my trailer and take pot shots at my neighbors trailers . Thank god for these games and my second amendment ! Five stars !	-1
i really wish i did n't buy this . i actually just wanted to play max payne 3 because it looked interesting . gtaiv was not good in my opinion .	-1
Several buttons do not light up , the software has become buggy as heck and now does not light up at all except for the screen and prevents computer from launching windows ... What a collossal waste of 300.00 . The screen never ever lived up to the hype and i could have bought 2 razer mechanicals for the price ... The Cyborg STRIKE 7 keyboard is almost perfect . I am replacing a Razer Deathstalker keyboard with their new Blade screen . Though the Blade screen is prettier , and more customizable the absence of a number pad and its shoddy construction left me wanting . I have owned every high end keyboard save from the company that makes DAS keyboards and by far the Strike 7 is my favorite . Below is a list of the pros and cons I have found : Pro's1-Completely Modular design . Modular seems to be a buzz work nowadays but to most companies it seems to mean t can just be taken apart and put back together . And while that might be the technical description , I do not feel that it fits . The Strike 7 not only comes apart but you can put it back together is several different configurations . The screen section can go in 2 spots or somewhere else on your desk , the keypad can go on the left or the right or somewhere else on your desk . It is actually pretty amazing AND unlike the Razer Deathstalker it has a metal frame which is anything but flexible.2-Key feel , this is a non mechanical keyboard which is one of my only complaints . At $ 300.00 why not go a little further and make it mechanical . Anyway with that said it is the BEST membrane keyboard I have ever with NEAR mechanical feel without the click.3-Lighting- I broke my Razer Black Widow Ultimate and though it had good lighting , the Strike 7 not only illuminates the keys but the entire membrane layer . SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE.4-Size , if you do n't want or need all the add ons connected or are in a space limited area the primary keyboard is a wonderfully small form factor , and unlike many other premium keyboards which are justifiably huge , this one CAN be huge or can be small , nice to have the choice.5-Website-Unlike Razers site the cyborg website is easy to use , navigate , and is good looking . I LOVE razer stuff but have never really liked the website beyond the color scheme.6-The screen- I LOVE the launcher screen , you can fit 3 rows of 4 icons ? And they are actually the icons on the program . The screen is MUCH more responsive and stable than the deathstalker screen . It is simpler granted , but ill take simpler and always works vs. powerful and unreliable.Ok the fanboy section is over , here are some dislikes and criticism'sCONS ( not actually cons just things I would have liked or am nitpicking ) 1-Out of the box the caps/numlock/scroll lock lights did not work , a quick call to cyborg and they told me to install the drivers ( I did not in my excitement ) and problem fixed.2-The macro creation on the screen is IMO unnecessarily complicated , im not new to this feature and found it a bit of a pain . However I was doing it at 11pm so maybe im just a moron.3-Color changing based on section would have been awesome , but seems not possible.4-It is not a mechanical keyboard . Seriously who do I have to bribe to get a keyboard as awesome as this or the deathstalker in a mechanical version ... WTF guys at 300.00 whats another 100.00 ? 5-Out of the box the directional keys to the left of the box control volume , and so do the controls on the screen section . I kept messing with my volume accidentally.6-The 3 large buttons on the right hand side of the screen had their use squandered by using them to change colors ... . Profile selector would have been a better use for buttons so big.7-The large glowing circle ... .MAKE IT DO SOMETHING ... I do n't know a volume knob , or brightness level..something ! 60 DAY FOLLOWUP REVIEWAfter about 30 days with the keyboard here is what i have to add to my previous reviewPRO'S-THe key feel is still better than any membrane i have ever uses , NOT as good as mechanical , but far better than any membrane.- the lighting is fantastic far better than anything else out there as both the keys and the surround glow-the screen is good as a clock , or a stopwatch..but thats it as of right now it is a reallllly expensive clock.-the construction is first rate except for the things noted below.CONS-my keyboard was missing a wrist rest and cyborg has beeen suppppppper slow to fess up-the wrist rest with the button and wheel on it simply does not work , ive tried everything DOA-THE SPACE BAR IS PATHETIC ! ! ! ! seriously it squeeks and clacks like a 5.00 walmart keyboard.. for 300.00 thats absolutely pathetic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it feels flimsy as hell-the left shift key is loose and loud ... seriously for 300.00 this is the construction i get ? -the wires to allow the AWESOME modular feature are NOT sold in longer lengths for those of us who would like to move stuff around.Overall i actually like the keyboard IF IT COST 150.00 or less for $ 300.00 IT SUCKS ! ! too many damn issues and not enough functionality in the screen . It will get replaced the milisecond razer pulls its head out of it behind and makes a machanical version of its deathstalker .	-1
I am not sure why but it did n't download correctly . I love the twisted lands games and have played all but this one . Me and the kiddos are playing it now but getting it to load is a pain in the butt !	-1
I bought this game because I enjoyed the first Twisted Lands game ( Shadow Town ) and thought the second game ( Insomniac ) was ok ( if not up to par with S.T. ) . Started playing , but was very disappointed in the storyline and the graphics . The hidden object locations consist of but a handful of locations that you play over and over again , and the graphics within the H.O . portions are muddy . Also , each time you get an item to use ( key , puzzle piece ) , you pretty much have to use it right away at its designated location to proceed -- rarely do you have multiple items in your inventory and have to put thought into where you could use it . The exception to this is when you get an item and have to use it in a way that does n't make sense ( using a pair of handcuffs to lift a manhole cover , for example ) . I got most of the way to the end before a huge electrical storm hit and blew the circuit in my house , and when I went to start up again , the game said that the file was corrupt and I would have to start over , but ... nah , the game was n't interesting enough .	-1
This game is not worth the $ 30 ... more like a $ 10 game . The graphics for the Xbox and PS3 versions look like Wii graphics and the game looks rushed.Do n't expect any bug fixes from THQ , they are known for making low quality games without supporting them .	-1
Title says it all . I played Demon 's Souls and since that game was a sloppy mess , I had hopes for improvements since the combat was one of the best . Sadly , no improvements have been made . Demon 's Souls to Dark Souls is CoD MW2 is to Ghosts . Same crap , new title.The coop is slightly better , but still poorly designed . Yes , it is done on purpose , but that 's what makes the developers such poor developers ... it was a decision to make coop an annoyance . That 's not great design , that 's just a stupid design.They throw in a dodge system , then allows bosses to hit you even when you go under a swing or avoid a slam . I 'm sure there are great players who have mastered the combat system , but do n't put in a dodge if it 's not going to dodge.It 's poorly optimized for PC . Feels great with a 360 controller , but in just a tight little area the first boss fight causes a significant drop and frames and it looks terrible . Is it my PC ? Absolutely not . As a PC gamer , you 'd know you can tell bad hardware from a poor port.This game is just boring . The only way I would really give it any more than a 1 star is if there was a simplified party system so I could at least have the company of a friend to keep me from falling asleep.The reason it 's a 1 star game is the fact that the developers kept just about everything the same except for a map design and new clunky enemies that were just as clunky as the last game . Poor effort on the development side .	-1
This PC version of the game , as it stands , is unplayable . The game is extremely hard , which I would consider a positive if I could actually maintain control of my character . For whatever reason , on my fully updated PC , the game opens in a distorted windowed mode where I have to extend the sides just right to get most of the game to fit on my screen . If my mouse goes off screen , which it often does in a battle , and I accidentally click before centering things again , then I have clicked out of the game and ca n't move my character until I alt-tab back into it . This almost always leads to me death , which , if you know anything about the game , there is a very harsh penalty for.The camera also moves way too fast , and I was getting very disoriented and dizzy while moving around until I lowered the sensitivity . Still , though , with the resolution being so bad I still get headache after 10 minutes of playing . I 'm sorry , but there is no excuse for needing a community modder to fix your resolution issues just for the game to be playable.I actually considered buying an X-box so that I could play this game way back when it first released . It sounded and looked so amazing . I was very exited when I heard about the PC version and knew I was going to purchase it immediately upon release . I will admit that I should have researched more about this , but I guess I just never expected this level of unprofessionalism . It 's not just a lazy port , but an utterly unplayable one . The developers might have somewhere suggested that it might not be a great port , but they certainly did n't advertise that fact in the ad/hype I was reading about overcoming a million deaths in this acclaimed cult favorite.Do not purchase this game until it is fixed , if it ever is . I will keep checking on it and update my review if necessary . I am particularly disgusted by the `` blame the uninformed consumer '' mentality of so many people discussing this game . I ca n't fathom why people do n't believe consumers are entitled to a enjoyable ( or at least functional for goodness sake ) product or their money back .	-1
They made a good game ( I 'm told ) for console and decided to rip people off with a pc port.The controls are horrible , the graphics crap . Even after applying various mod fixes , its still crap.This pc version is just a company trying to make some quick and easy money.Why does the escape key do nothing ? Why do I see the windows mouse pointer in game ? Why do the graphics in some parts look 10years old and in the others look okay ( not great ) . What is my character doing I did n't tell him to do that . Why does the game keep popping up hints about how to use the xbox controller ? Why is the game telling me to press the start button , i 'm using a keyboard and mouse not a controller.Bad beyond belief .	-1
Dark Souls- Consistently given extremely high ratings and many will say that it 's well deserved . While the combat is interesting and somewhat entertaining , I found myself bored rather quickly . I also found the world and story to feel bland . Others will surely disagree , but I feel this game to be successful simply due to it 's & # 34 ; Hardcore & # 34 ; Nature , even going as far as to call the PC version & # 34 ; Prepare to Die Edition & # 34 ; . However , While buying and enjoying a game due to it 's difficulty is seen by some video game purists to be the pinnacle of entertainment , I found myself underwhelmed not by the difficulty but by a bland art style and a lack of compelling story , although the combat is robust and offers a few different ways to play , I was bored quickly . There was nothing to keep me coming back.During my time playing this game , I also experienced a strange sort of peer-pressure from a group of friends who thought that by beating the game by using slightly different characters or using slightly different weapons , and putting untold , ungodly amounts of time into the game somehow raised their worth as humans . As if somehow they were proving how great they were to be playing a hard game . My response to this is simple , I do n't really care about all that . The 500 hours spent on some individuals on my steam friends list could have been spent working for an equal amount of fun socializing with customers and ensuring they got the products they need . That 's 500 hours at 10 $ an hour . That 's 5,000 $ . Now , I have no doubt that they at least somewhat enjoyed their experience , but I found it dull and uninteresting , and not in the least bit challenging thanks to that fact.I 'll end this review with a bit of unconventional wisdom for you folks reading this : If you have to motivate yourself to watch a movie or TV show , that does n't show how good you are at watching movies or TV shows , it shows how much time you 've wasted doing something that genuinely does n't stimulate you . While that might be applauded in some circles , It leaves a bad taste in my mouth . Some may argue that Videogames offer a challenge that movies do n't , but I disagree with that . There 's nothing too challenging , as long as you work at something , you can improve , develop new strategies and succeed at whatever that thing is . I would rate this game a 3 , but I found the community to be full of children who felt they had something to prove . So I 've adjusted my review to give it a 2 out of 5 .	-1
The game is awesome , have a great history , awesome bosses , it 's hard as hell , but only if you play it in a console.The port of PC is horrible . The graphics are really bad does n't matter if you have a nVidia or ATI High End graphics card , the problems is with the game . The controls ( Using K + M ) are really bad , you need a Game pad to play properly . The character personalization is really bad . The game maybe can be a worth buy but not for more than 10 usd . I know that the developers never coded for PC but it 's better do n't release a game if you know that it 's going to sucks	-1
It would have been nice to know before I bought this game on another site that the controls are absolutely abysmal . Not all of us are rich and I would have spent my $ 39 on another product .	-1
I really hate buying games that do not have a trial . If Dark Souls would have had a trial I would never have purchased it . If you like playing the same scenarios over and over and over and over , then this is the game for you . Every time you die , which is about once every min , you have to fight all the previous mobs that you fought before . This is most likely the worst game I have ever played . I wished I could get my money back .	-1
I could n't get the game to launch in Windows 8 . I had to install a lot of additional software to try to make it functional , and it just was n't worth the effort that was outlined in the game 's forums . It 's a shame , as it looked very entertaining .	-1
Not sure why this game is so hyped , particularly by the hardcore gaming crowd . Even with a controller , it 's just not all that fun . The difficulty of the game itself has almost nothing to do with learned skill or gameplay design and everything to do with just going through the motions of failure until & # 34 ; the answer & # 34 ; comes along .	-1
The port from console to PC was done VERY badly . The game is slow , choppy and none of the fixes work . Do n't waste your money . If I could give this a negative number I would . A game is no good if you ca n't play it !	-1
Can not get it to work on Windows 8.1 . I have tried a number of methods but can not get it to start . Once that is fixed I 'll be happy .	-1
The controls suck . you need a controller . exact port from the console . can not be played with mouse and keyboard without modifications from a community .	-1
I do n't even know why I bought this game . I guess just to see what all the fuss was about . People rant and rave about how great this game is , and I think sometimes people just enjoy the ride quality of the bandwagon . The game was a horribly ugly port to PC , the devs could n't even be bothered to make the game look good by PC standards , so some modder quickly put together a hack to bump up the visuals in the game . That at least made the visuals go from being too ugly to bring out in front of company , to just regular ugly . A couple hours into the game and I do n't get much of a storyline , there 's not much in the way of dialogue , and all I 've done is go from one area to the next , killing annoyingly cheap monsters . Yeah yeah , there 's the huge dragon near the beginning of the game that kills you in maybe two , three hits tops . Once you figure out the right way to attack him , it 's no biggie , but aside from that , the controls are dreadful . When you are attacking a foe , you have to make sure the analog stick is aimed just so , and if the foe moves the slightest bit , you have to readjust -- your character does not lock onto the character you 're attacking so it feels a bit clumsy . Also , the skeletons can take one last cheap shot at you as they 're falling to the ground , & # 34 ; dying & # 34 ; . That is annoying as well , since you ca n't afford to lose energy b/c if you die and get resurrected , all the enemies you 've killed are resurrected as well . The game is very grainy and abysmal looking , with very uninspired visuals , and with not much of a story ( so far ) I just ca n't force myself to be tortured any further . I doubt I will bother with this game anymore . It barely feels like an RPG and more like a 3-D version of Final Fight , except way more difficult , uglier , and even less rewarding . I wish I could get my 6 dollars back .	-1
Installed the game , played for like 5 minutes , uninstalled . Bad console port . Should have known better before buying it at $ 19.99 .	-1
I got this on a gold box deal , otherwise I probably never would 've even seen it . I have a 9 year old son who goes by my mom every other Friday after school for babysitting until I 'm out of work , and sometimes now he 's starting to do sleepovers there . She has a Wii , but that 's it . Here at home we have three Xbox 360 's ( and will have the Xbox One when it comes out ) , a Wii-U , a Playstation 3 , and all sorts of handheld consoles . So at home , we can change up when we want to do something different , but by my mom 's , he only has the Wii Sports Resort to play.When I saw this on the gold box offer , I spent most of the time it counted down researching things , looking at You Tube videos , and reading reviews . I mean , I did n't *NEED* this . It 's something nice to have , but I really did n't know if we 'd use it that much . But I thought about how nice it would be for him to have an Xbox by my mom 's for a sleepover , and that when the Xbox One comes out , I can permanently keep an Xbox dedicated just for this portable unit , so I figured I 'd give it a shot . It 's easy to return at Amazon , so I was n't too worried about what to do if I did n't really like it.I got it , unboxed it , put the Xbox from my bedroom in it since that was the easiest one to get at , and fired things up.We use a 55 '' 3D LED TV for most of our gaming , but the nice thing with this is that you 're closer , so it looks just as big . There 's no feel of being on a `` small screen '' . The volume is surprising , I had cranked it up when we first started in anticipation of some lousy sound , but had to turn it down once things started going . The bass is lacking , but that 's expected on something like this . The plus side is that , even without the bass , it does n't sound `` tinny '' like most smaller things do.The screen is great . Crisp , clear , brights are bright , darks are dark.The options for the foam base are handy since we could pull another console out to use if we want . And since it 's an HDMI system , you can plug anything into it that uses HDMI , so I could even use this with my Alienware X51 computer if we got to that point , although I 'm not sure it would fit in there for carrying.The downside is the space . I understand that the whole point is to be portable , so they do n't want it to be too large becuase then you may as well be hauling a real monitor and everything inside some large samsonite case . But even just 1.5 inches more on each side would 've made a big difference . As it is , since I '' m not using my Xbox Slim in here , but one of the newest HDMI versions of the larger console , I have this big darn brick and stupidly thick power cable that has to go in here . It 's a pain , because there 's only really one way it will fit without hitting the monitor on top , but still squeeze between the xbox and the edge of the case . And that totally uses up the one side , so the other side has to have the power brick for the monitor . Really about all you can fit in here then besides the barebones requirements for power is one controller . I ended up buying a sling pack that we 'll use for the power bricks and cords , and that 's also then where we can toss the games.The quality all around is good though . I never held he older version , but having seen the handle on that , and the handle on this one , I really prefer the Vanguard 's design . The latches on the side feel solid and I do n't have any worries of them popping loose on their own.I did n't do anything with the extra stickers , but I do love the UNSC graphics they did on this . Since Halo is my son 's favorite game , it just adds to his love of this thing.Tomorrow will be the first time I actually deploy it with him to my mom 's , and he 's more excited about that aspect than he is about the sleepover . And even though he has an xbox and TV in his bedroom he can use whenever he wants , he almost never uses it . So now when he wants to play a game and I want to watch TV , he can still sit out here by me in the great room and play.It 's a little pricey , since you can now get good 19 '' monitors for $ 100 or less . But you 're buying a system that 's portable and protected , not just buying a monitor . Suitcase plus monitor does NOT equal the Vanguard gaming environment . I 'm glad I happened to learn about the product on the gold box deal , and that the price was dropped enough to make it enticing , although had I seen this somewhere else first and tried it out , I would n't have hesitated to buy it at the normal price.Edit 9/9/13Had a problem with the unit not staying off when I 'd power it off - it would turn back on . Sometimes it would take 6 tries to actually power off . I emailed their support about it , they apologized , told me they 'd get me a shipping label to return it , and send me a new one as soon as they saw mine ship . I shipped it out and it showed in the UPS system on August 23rd . They never did send me a new one when they had proof of shipping . They did n't reply to my emails until September 3rd , saying it was the power source . They said they played a solid hour of COD and it worked fine , and they were shipping it out that day . I replied back saying it was n't a problem with it being ON , it was a problem with it staying OFF when powering it off . That was four days ago , still no reply about that , and today now I got a shipping notice from UPS , so it obviously did n't get out last Thursday . I do n't know if they actually resolved the issue or not , and by the time it arrives , it 'll have been three weeks since it was sent out - not quite the `` We 'll ship you a new one when we see this one was sent to us . '' So I 'm going to knock a star off of my original 4 star review for the hassle of having to find a box , ship it out , and then go three weeks without a confirmation that they actually solved the problem . I guess I 'll know in four more days ... Edit 9/16/13They returned it , and the problem persists . So three weeks I waited and nothing was solved . Not at all impressed with the customer service between the false information about sending me a new one as soon as they saw mine shipped , to totally ignoring my emails about the problem while they `` worked '' on it by playing COD on it for an hour.Edit 9/24/13And now they 're completely ignoring my emails about the problem persisting . Apparently from what I 've read in a few other places , this seems to be the `` norm '' for them in many cases . 9 days and no acknowledgement . Avoid these people like the plague since if you have problems , you 're totally hosed and will be out $ 350 ...	-1
Everything I have read online had said on both their twitter and instagram pages that I is compatible with the xbox one . they even posted photos . The moment my xbox one came in the mail , after doing my research ( I already own a g155 ) // I decided to invest the 350 $ into this system . Sadly , my xbox one did not fit , the straps would not hold the system in . I am waiting on Customer support to get back to me either through twitter or phone , if problem resolved I will update my review , otherwise ... MAKE A FAQS page and do n't be so deceptive .	-1
It seems as if Bioshock the original game will play without sound . There are many options to possibly fix this but none have worked for me .	-1
The darkness 2 I got because I wanted to play it in 3d , and i really enjoy it , but of course I hate duke nukem forever , some of the themes are just fine but the gameplay is torture . Borderlands is a clear multiplayer only type of game , thats never really advertised that way .	-1
