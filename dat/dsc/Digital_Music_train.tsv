It 's hard to believe `` Memory of Trees '' came out 11 years ago ; it has held up well over the passage of time.It 's Enya 's last great album before the New Age/pop of `` Amarantine '' and `` Day without rain . '' Back in 1995 , Enya still had her creative spark , her own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album ; it is melancholy , bittersweet , from the opening title song . `` Memory of Trees '' is elegaic & majestic . ; '' Pax Deorum '' sounds like it is from a Requiem Mass , it is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a `` disconcerting '' blend of spirituality & sensuality ; , I do n't find it disconcerting at all . `` Anywhere is '' is a hopeful song , looking to possibilities . `` Hope has a place '' is about love , but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic , platonic , etc.I 've always had a soft spot for this song . `` On my way home '' is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age music , a must for any Enya fan !	1
A clasically-styled and introverted album , Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety . Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely , quiet voice . But within every introvert is an inferno , and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you 've never heard Enya before , you might want to start with one of her more popularized works , like Watermark , just to play it safe . But if you 're already a fan , then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art .	1
I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons . ' 'The Celts , Watermark and Day ... ' were all pleasant and admirable throughout , but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically . But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory ... ' reaches those heights and beyond . It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting . I 'm actually glad that this song did n't get overexposed the way Only Time did . It makes it that much more special to all who own this album .	1
This is the third review of an irish album I write today ( the others were Cranberries ) and now I 'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world . And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way . Okay , I just wanted to say something about Irish music . Now let 's say something about this album . It 's great . it 's beautiful . Very good , easy listened music . If you like Enya or you just want some easy-listened relaxing music . This is the album for you to buy !	1
Enya , despite being a successful recording artist , does n't have the broad appeal as other artists ; one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they 're too `` macho '' for music that she makes . But people with open minds could find there 's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively , upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on . I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums ; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees : Like all of her records ( except the recent Amarantine ) , the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album 's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track . I always like the sparse use of percussion . 9/10Anywhere Is : The lively single ; it 's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus . It 's also a perfect length since it 's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile , this one hooks you in then lets you go , leaving you wanting more . 9/10Pax Deorum : Another album , another ominous Latin-sung piece . The music sounds like something you 'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice , almost monotone performance over the music . Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge . 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh : There 's some songs she does where it 's more about the song itself rather than a poppy , catchy quality a la Only Time and this song 's similar . Another ballad with some of her best singing , it 's a more low-key track but it 's also one of the album highlights . 8.5/10From Where I Am : Another instrumental ; this one 's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it 's not technically complex or fast but it 's pleasant to listen to . 7.5/10China Roses : There 's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them . Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation , the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I 've ever heard , this is definately my favorite song on here , plus her whole career even . 15/10Hope Has a Place : For me , any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song does n't do much for me . Granted , her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice , relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar ( a kind of Athair part 2 if you will ) or it 's just not as memorable . 7/10Tea-House Moon : Very oriental in its instruments , it 's another wordless song although it 's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is , mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it 's a bit more song-oriented . It 's different but strangely likable . 8/10Once You Had Gold : We 're getting into the album 's final stretch and the problem is that with this one , it 's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down . With Enya 's more higher vocals ( for some reason , reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition ) , it 's another beautiful track but it 's also a bit ... same-y ? 8/10La Sonadora : Spanish lyrics for once , it 's another slower paced track complete with `` aahs '' for background vocals and synths but again , the album could 've benefited from a more perkier track . I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost . 7.5/10On My Way Home : A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth , you 'd think it was a bit more upbeat . While it 's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is , it does give the album a bit more memorable closer , especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements . 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best ( probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them ) , I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks , it 's still one of her finest outings .	1
Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world . Maybe I was expecting Shepherd 's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd 's Eclipse . The songs did n't leap out to me ? Well , listening to it for this review , it finally did , and I 've embraced it like I have her other albums . The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks , & quot ; The Memory Of Trees & quot ; is the most potent , sporting the usual instrumentals , pianos , haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals , pounding drums recalling & quot ; The Longships & quot ; from Watermark.The brisk & quot ; Anywhere Is & quot ; , whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park , is backed by strings and backing vocals . There 's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another , where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning . Bit like life , is n't it ? & quot ; Pax Deorum & quot ; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind , which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song , as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn , though not as loud or brash . This part sounds a bit like an incantation . Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano ( and later some other instrument ) ballad & quot ; Athair Ar Neamh & quot ; is a sad but beautiful sung tune , full of yearning . Makes me want to learn Gaelic . My favourite song here , and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful , reflective piano only instrumental & quot ; From Where I Am & quot ; is a variation of & quot ; Miss Clare Remembers & quot ; from Watermark , with some shades of & quot ; Epona & quot ; from the Enya album. & quot ; China Roses & quot ; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it 's an enchanting delight to hear . I see melodic strains of what would later become & quot ; Only Time. & quot ; That wall of sound really enhances her vocals , and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland : & quot ; A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream , my way & quot ; and & quot ; Rain and river , a world of wonder/may be paradise to me & quot ; . Gosh , how I love this woman ! OK , all you romantics . & quot ; Hope Has A Place & quot ; is the song for you . Enya 's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom . And how 's this for some sagely advice : & quot ; Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home , and the heart is free. & quot ; I ca n't decide whether I like this better than & quot ; Athair Ar Neamh. & quot ; The third instrumental , & quot ; Tea-House Moon & quot ; , has some Oriental strains , with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars . As for the title , a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon , set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo ? & quot ; Once You Had Gold & quot ; is a proverbial seasons come , seasons go type , and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong : & quot ; No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you. & quot ; and & quot ; What is the dark , shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day ? & quot ; & quot ; La Sonadora & quot ; is her first Spanish song and it 's more an interlude . The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song 's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller 's thoughts comprise & quot ; On My Way Home & quot ; , where & quot ; I remember all the best days/I 'm on my way home/I can remember every new day & quot ; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums , Enya 's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I 've ever heard . She seems to be a one-woman band here , as it 's & quot ; all instruments and vocals by Enya & quot ; per the credits . There 's more a wall of dreamy sound here -- check out how many times I 've mentioned this . Repeated listenings will tell whether it 'll dislodge Shepherd 's Moon as my favourite Enya album .	1
Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today . I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that do n't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes ( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long ) . The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date . I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album . Well , it is kind of true . The sunniness is evidenced on the title track , Anywhere Is , and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home . Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy , romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red , orange and yellow . Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let 's say Storms In Africa , Exile , or creepy like Evening Falls . This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries . I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well ( I love music that is dark and stormy ) .The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD . Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark , Shephard Moons , and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon . This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track . Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain . It 's a very bright , sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with . This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain . I love the quiet middle part of the song . It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then . After the sunniness we head into darker , mistier territory of Pax Deorum . This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel . In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds . I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic ' song to this day . It 's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that . The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song . Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad , cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic . This song is a very beautiful , theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer . The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down . From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental . China Roses is a gorgeous , breathtaking , ambient song that made me get this album . It 's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion . China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background . China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day . This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees . Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great . This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations . This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons . Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to . It 's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground . This song is one to enjoy when it 's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground . This song is one of my favorites off this CD . Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably should n't play if you have not had much sleep because it 's one song that will sooth your soul . I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles* . This song though is great though . I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening . La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish . This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let 's say Exile , Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album . The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago . We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home . This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one . This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier . This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later ... I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date . Only Watermark surpasses this one and it 's not by too much . I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece . It 's gorgeous and an album for the soul ...	1
This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music , well written and performed with emotion . It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason ... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me . She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic . On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record , with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain . I have every Enya album to date , but this one seems to be particularly special . A must for any music lover !	1
Many times , AND WITH GOOD REASON , the `` new age '' label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction . Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is , in my opinion , her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist , but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers . And if you look at what is being released these days , many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya , but do n't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know . I know this sounds ridiculous , but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music . Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music , it works even better when it 's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table , but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line , but rather reflects a balance of the artist 's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions ( even when I disagree ) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work . Also , thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company , but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD .	1
I just recently purchased her `` Paint The Sky With Stars '' CD and was so impressed that I bought 3 of her previously released CD 's and plan to buy all her music . She is truely talented and her music is very unique with a combination of modern classical and pop with a hint of an Angelic tone . I still recommend you buy this CD . Anybody who has an appreciation for music will certainly enjoy her music .	1
Over the past twenty-odd years , Enya Brennan has become known worldwide for her layered vocals and delicate instrumentation , in many ways defining New Age music . But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music , and this is very evident on `` The Memory of Trees '' .Enya 's first few albums were good , but there was something missing , something that had yet to be developed . I 'm not entirely sure what that intangible `` something '' was , but she certainly found it on this one . The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals ( though no lyrics to speak of ) , and it reminds on of a clear fall day . This sets the pace for the record , which is decidedly autumnal . 'Anywhere Is ' is about the maze that life 's choices put us into , while 'Pax Deorum ' features few lyrics ( all in Latin ) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle . 'Once You had Gold ' is as delicate as a falling leaf , and 'On My Way Home ' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college , traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time ' defined her `` A Day without Rain '' album , it 's 'China Roses ' that defines `` The Memory of Trees '' . Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming . It 's easily the best piece of the record and , even nearly twenty years after the album 's release , it still stands firmly , refusing to sound dated in a genre that , at one point , relied a little too much on synthesizers.It 's been over fifteen years since `` The Memory of Trees '' was released , but it 's a still favorite when it comes to Enya 's music . As another reviewer said , you ca n't go wrong with this artist , but this album is definitely one of her best .	1
[ One CD , with a running time of 44 minutes . ] Ah ... this wonderful CD shows off Enya 's silky smooth voice . The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful . I wo n't try to categorize her music , it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs ( The Memory of Trees is a musical number ) , and two nice color pictures of Enya . ( I love extras ! ) So , if you like Enya 's past hits , then I think that you will like this one as well . Buy it !	1
The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good . It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews ( having recently reviewed `` A Day without Rain '' and previously `` Watermark '' ) . The same words , ethereal , ephemeral , airy , haunting , and spiritual apply to each album . The only risk is that my reviews become boring , because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track `` The Memory of Trees . '' While `` The Memory of Trees '' is nominally an instrumental , there are voices that punctuate portions of the music . This opening feels optimistic , though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by . The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind . Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy `` Anywhere Is . '' The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images . As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp . In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make , and whether they can be unmade , and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love . Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya 's voice . Typically Enya 's voice stands out clearly from the instruments , which in this case are mostly strings and piano . `` Pax Deorum '' is somewhat ominous , and fits with the following song , `` Athair Ar Neamh . '' Both songs are simple songs that relate to God . `` Pax Deorum '' translates roughly as `` The Peace of the Gods , '' or seeking to placate the gods . `` Athair Ar Neamh '' translates approximately as `` Father in Heaven . '' Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song , tying both songs together , and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song . There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous `` Pax Deorum , '' which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial . The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses . `` From Where I Am '' is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into `` China Roses . '' This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song . This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally . Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art . `` Hope Has a Place '' is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand . The concept is simple : there is always hope where there is love . The vocals are beautiful ( again ) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for `` The Lord of the Rings . '' This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows . `` Tea-House Moon '' has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD . The mood is contemplative and traditional , though with a vaguely Asian flavor . This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style , again , and yet fits within the character of the album . `` Once You Had Gold '' seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things , perhaps most particularly life . There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go , and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day . I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life , that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation . The song is sung in a fairy tale style , a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as `` The Dreamer . '' The music tells you all you need to know about the words , which are surrealistic and , of course , dream-like . The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere , a feeling , a place that can only exist in our dreams , though we might wish otherwise . This song nearly achieves allowing us to be a creation of our imagination.At last we must awaken from the fantasy Enya has woven for us . `` On My Way Home '' returns us to this place and time , but with a longing for the place we leave , the poetry that has been woven for us . Yet , we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity , and still , there is the memory , yes indeed , `` The Memory of Trees . ''	1
If for some reason you 're interested in only a selection of the songs herein , the same recordings of `` Anywhere Is '' , `` China Roses '' , `` The Memory of Trees '' , and `` On My Way Home '' have been collected on PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS.Enya composed all the music , sang all the songs , and provided all the accompaniment ; Roma Ryan wrote the lyrics ; Nicky Ryan helped with the arrangements and handled the engineering and mixing . Except where noted otherwise , each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with ; another in this category is Ryan Miller , who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN . `` The Memory of Trees '' ( instrumental and voices , no lyrics ) Waltz tempo , opening with electronic keyboard , joined by piano . Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through . The main theme is about six notes long , continually repeated with variations . One of my two favourites on this CD , ranked only after `` China Roses '' . `` Anywhere Is '' Unusually staccato for Enya , mainly string accompaniment . No percussion , some piano . The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus , when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little . ( `` You go there you 're gone forever / I go there I 'll lose my way / if we stay here we 're not together / Anywhere is '' ) . `` Pax Deorum '' ( sung in Latin ) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual . The accompaniment includes some percussion , in this case base drum , although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard . `` Athair ar Neamh '' is sung in Gaelic , with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya 's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly . During the chorus , a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little . Very clear and bell-like , on the whole . `` From Where I Am '' ( instrumental only ) Specifically piano . As usual with Enya , her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery . `` China Roses '' Waltz tempo again , opening with electronic keyboard , but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano . `` I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire ; Rain and river , a world of wonder / may be paradise to me . '' Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven , the night sky . `` Hope Has a Place '' I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again , but it 's very slow , and the beat is n't quite regular . Enya 's singing comes through very clearly herein ( except for the more complex choruses , as usual ) . The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing . The refrain is `` Hope has a place in a lover 's heart . `` `` Tea House Moon '' ( instrumental ) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one . Does n't seem typical of Enya 's work . `` Once You Had Gold '' , 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue . / Ever and always , / always and ever , '' with the refrain `` Time gave both darkness and dreams to you . '' Waltz tempo again , almost a lullaby in this instance , Enya 's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus . `` La Sonadora '' - Sung in Spanish , very drowsily , waltz tempo again . The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string , with organ joining in after a couple of verses . `` On My Way Home '' - Opens with organ accompaniment , as in the later part of the previous song , but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya 's singing . `` On my way home / I remember / only good days . ''	1
Released five years after 'Shepherd Moons ' , during which 'The Celts ' had been re-released , 'The Memory of Trees ' was much-anticipated by fans of Enya , and turned out to be only slightly less impressive than the previous two albums.The Christmassy lead single , 'Anywhere Is ' , set the tone excellently - an extremely simple and addictive tune , repeated constantly , it was fun , and not at all serious . The rest of the album seemed a reflection of this , and as with 'Watermark ' it was a generally cheery collection . Still , despite an excellent set of opening songs , the album seemed to bog down into too many ballads towards the end ( 'La Sonadora ' , although introducing Spanish to Enya 's vocabulary , went on and on and on ) , despite the presence of the rousing 'On my way home ' as a closing song . The title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche , too.Despite all that , it was business as before - the production seemed more earthy and less ethereal , and 'On my way home ' was the closest thing to a mainstream single Enya has ever done .	1
( ... ) She is one of a kind , and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment . As always , the instrumental opening sets a mood , followed by the lively `` Anywhere Is '' , a song which grew on me each time I listened . Each song is exquisite , but for me , `` China Roses '' is the most delicately crafted song . However , `` Once You Had Gold '' which is n't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints . `` On My Way Home '' is a fitting conclusion to the album . I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya , and if there is a person who does n't like her , then he or she should n't get this CD , but for everybody else , this is one of the essential CD 's for your collection .	1
What an enchanting collection this is . I fell in love with Enya 's music right from her first hit ` Orinocco flow ' and have been a fan ever since.Enya 's haunting and ethereal voice , coupled with rich , magical musical arrangements , layered dreamy sounding backing vocals , and lyrics sung in English , Latin , and Gaelic , set her aside form all other new age artists.Opening track ` Memory of trees ' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voices flitting in and out. ` Anywhere is ' has an upbeat tempo , cutting strings , lush instrumentation , and poetic lyrics. ` Tea-house moon ' is an instrumental with a Chinese sound . Magical keyboards ( I think ) set against a delicate backdrop . Beautiful ! Just as delicate is ` La So & ntilde ; adora ' with very ethereal vocals against a gently brooding soundscape . Then there 's the tender piano instrumental ` From where I am'. ` Pax deorum ' ( sung in latin ) will have you checking to see you 're not in a monastery . Very religious sounding ! The absolute standout has got to be ` Athair ar nearmh ' ( sung in Gaelic ) . This song is stunning ! Angelic vocals , delicate piano , with delicate strings sweeping in and out . Mournful sounding but outstanding ! A magical , delicate , angelic experience !	1
Enya - The Memory of Trees ( 1995 ) In certain circles , such as my profession , massage therapy , Enya is ubiquitous . People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time . E.O . - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant , almost sickly experience . Aside from that , I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity . I just learned that her `` Day Without Rain '' CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.But she 's wildly popular for good reasons . One could say her music is synthesized plastic , but it 's beautiful , soothing plastic . . . what 's not plastic is Enya 's sweet , melodic voice ( at least I HOPE it 's not plastic ! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune ) . Enya 's been accused of being soulless - harsh ! - but sometimes you 'd rather hear something calming , pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper , would n't you ? The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album : '' The Memory of Trees '' - a majestic , cinematic opener . No lyrics , it serves as a wonderful prelude . ***** '' Anywhere Is '' - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable . To me , it 's too cloying , `` sing-songy '' and flat-out dorky . It 's just too `` jaunty '' for my tastes . I 'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one ( and of course , I program only certain songs from this album for massage ) . I was shocked to see it on Enya 's Greatest Hits collection . * '' Pax Deorum '' - Quite different than anything else here , this track has an ominous , pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting . Enya chants most of the words , sung in Gallic , in a low register . I never use it for massage but it 's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it . ***1/2 '' Athair Ar Neamh '' - Another one sung in Gallic , this soft , restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album . *****+ '' From Where I Am '' - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches . A sweet melody . ***** '' China Roses '' - possibly Enya 's best song ever . Sounds like floating through heaven . Magical ! *****+ '' Hope Has a Place '' - a gentle song about love . ****1/2 '' Tea-House Moon '' - a pretty instrumental , vaguely Oriental . **** '' Once You Had Gold '' - another , soft , sweet song with a gorgeous melody . ****1/2 '' La Sonadora '' - is a subtle , slightly somber track sung in Spanish . **** '' On My Way Home '' - begins with some rolling , old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy . A fitting finale . ****	1
Enya has one of the most beautiful voices of this day . Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings . Clear as a bell , her voice is airy and light , as she sings in English , Latin , or Gaelic . There is a lot of power in her voice . The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately , and adds to her sound . She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings . Like all of her previous albums , this one is again excellent.There are a many great songs on this album . `` China Roses '' has that airy sound that Enya is well known for . She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice . Over it , she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone , almost like a crystal bell ringing . The Latin sounding `` Pax Deorum '' has a medieval sound to it . Again , she utilizes her voice singing in the background , to add counterpoint to the lyrics . `` Anywhere Is '' sounds like the perfect single for the album . Much more upbeat than the other songs , it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song . On the opposite end of the spectrum is `` Hope Has a Place '' . Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it , made even more so with the organ playing behind her . It is a very beautiful song.I 'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones , yet be totally new for the listener as well . Her voice is aging well , and she seems to improve with each passing album . I hope to hear much more from her in the future , as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice .	1
Remember when you were but a small child , and when you had trouble falling asleep your parents would come and bring you into a lull with nursery rhymes ? In short , that 's what `` The Memory Of Trees '' is , a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep . Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees , the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs , but it does not . Enya started this cycle when her debut album `` The Celts '' featured celtic chants and jigs , her second album `` Watermark '' had a collection of water themed songs , and her third album `` Shepherd Moons '' had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one . Actually , `` The Memory Of Trees '' does a very nice job of breaking this cycle , because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment , and all of them are highlights of the album . These include `` The Memory Of Trees '' , which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed , `` China Roses '' , a beautifully crafted pastorale and `` La Sonadora '' , a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes . This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks , all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album . I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car , because you will surely fall asleep . True that 's the greatest strength of the album , but also its fatal weakness . If you manage to stay awake through all eleven lullabies , your purchase was very well worth it .	1
Enya is in a class all by herself . She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality . So many others have copied her sound ( ala James Horner in TITANIC ) that it 's easy to see how much of an influence she has been . & quot ; The Memory Of Trees & quot ; is a classic album . From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting & quot ; On My Way Home & quot ; , Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here . Yes , I would consider this pop/new age music . And there 's nothing wrong with that . There are a number of people that do n't like Enya . There are jokes on South Park about her . And that 's good . It shows how much of a musical force she is . & quot ; The Memory Of Trees & quot ; is a good collection of material from a very important artist , who I hope will never give up her love of music .	1
The Memory Of Trees begins with the stunning titletrack , a great mix of voices and instrumental sounds , this is one of Enya 's best songs . Anywhere Is has a great rythm and is catchy . Pax Deorum is a latin song and very haunting . It 's like you 're in a storm finding a place to schelter . The fourth song is Athair Ar Neamh ; it 's sung in Gaelic , I think . I see that it means & quot ; Father In Heaven & quot ; . Thank you other Amazon reviewer ! From Where I Am is an instrumental track and it sort of lulls you to sleep . Then there is China Roses , a very romantic song about a dreamlike world , a sort of dream , I think . Hope Has A Place is another highlight of this record . Just great lyrics , and a soothing atmosphere . Thea House Moon is another instrumental track . It 's not my favourite track , but still good . Track number nine is Once You Had Gold . Listen carefully to the lyrics again , just magic . La Sonadora is a spooky ballad , sung in Spanish ? I do n't know , but another highlight of The Memory Of Trees . And then there is the final track , On My Way Home . On Paint The Sky With Stars.. The Best Of Enya , you can hear the edited version . This one is longer and much more beautiful . A great ending to one of the best cd 's ever made !	1
In 1994 , the R & B ; market was cluttered with girl groups in the likes of SWV , Xscape , TLC , En Vogue , Zhane , and Jade . Despite stiff competition , Changing Faces , a duo of New York songstresses , attained commerical success with their self-titled debut . This was due mainly to the superb lead single `` Stroke U Up '' ( platinum single sales ) and the follow-up `` Foolin ' Around '' , each produced by R. Kelly . In addition , both singers were capable vocalists , as displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set.Not only were the singles well-crafted , but the rest of the album held it own as well . Other highlights include : `` Keep It Right There '' ( remix featured on White 's Man Burden ) , `` Come Closer '' ( smooth production and smoky vocals ) , `` Baby Your Love '' ( midtempo treat/2nd favorite track ) , `` Good Thing '' ( late-night sleeper ) and `` All Is Not Gone '' ( syrupy ballad/favorite track ) .In sum , Changing Faces turned out an excellent record in the midst of the cluttered girl group market . Even though their debut was commercially successful , better records would later turn up for Changing Faces , namely their 3rd set , despite not acheiving the accompanying sales . However , this record is still very good . It has aged well , and continues to get spins from me and radio . A good-buy for the avid R & B ; follower.Grade : B+	1
This , is the type ( and caliber ) of album that is ( sadly ) missing , from todays ( pathetic ) music scene ! ! `` Foolin'Around '' became an INSTANT classic , '' Good Thing '' is a painfully TRUE , song , and `` All is not gone '' is a beautiful , HOPE-instilling track ! ! The entire , album is good , but these three songs , are the CREAM of the crop ! ! I miss , the days , when women , such as these , were APPRECIATED , for creating thought-provoking beautifully sung ballads , INSTEAD of being lauded , for marketing , sex-appeal ! ! Oh , well , I can always pop this `` gem '' into my player , whenever , I 'm craving quality musical offerings ! ! As it is , I 'm going to be playing the surfacing , OFF , of this disc , in the following weeks ! !	1
In 1994 R. Kelly introduced us to Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose , better known as Changing Faces . Their very first single `` Stroke You Up '' had men everywhere saying `` Yes you can . '' Then came `` Foolin ' Around '' , and with songs like that already out , people were wondering when the album was coming out.This album gives you a taste of solid R & B . ; Silky ballads like the two aforementioned tracks are accompanied by songs like `` Come Closer '' and `` Keep It Right There '' as well as the two best tracks , `` Thoughts Of You '' and `` All Is Not Gone '' . Not one song here is fast-forwardable.The only problem I could really see with this album is the lack of varied subject matter . For example , there are FOUR kick-your-man-to-the-curb songs ( `` Foolin ' Around '' , `` Am I Wasting My Time '' , `` Movin ' On '' and `` Good Thing '' ) . Still , this album is a very good listen . Way to go , ladies !	1
THESE WOMEN ARE GOOD THIS ENTIRE CD IS GOOD THEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB FOR A DEBUT ALBUM FROM WHAT I KNOW THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS I AM STILL ENJOYING THIS ALBUM THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM AND THEY ARE MANY GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM MY FAVORITES ARE : KEEP IT RIGHT THERE , FOOLIN AROUND , AND OF COURSE STROKE YOU UP BY R. KELLY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
OMG ! sounds even better that when they first came out with this cd . I love these girls.they have beautiful voices.Sure wish the would have continued their career in singing ordid they and i am not updated enough to know of this.I STILL LOVE THIS CD !	1
THIS RECORD WAS SO SLEPT ON WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIT & quot ; STROKE YOU UP & quot ; FEAT/R.KELLY.THE ONLY REASON I COULD THINK OF IS THE FLOODED R & amp ; B MARKET , BECAUSE FIRST OFF THEY CAN SING , THERE ATTRACTIVE , AND THE MUSICAL CONTENT AND SONG IDEAS R STRONG.THIS CAME OUT IN 94 AND I CAN SAY NOTHING BETTER HAS CAME OUT SINCE NOT EVEN CHANGIN FACES 2ND ALBUM.THATS WHY 6 YEARS LATER THIS STILL GETS MUCH PLAY.THERE ISNT A SONG ON HERE I DONT LIKE EVERYTHING ON HERE IS TIGHT.THE ONLY RECORDS THAT CAN EVEN COMPETE WITH THIS IS MICHEL'E & quot ; MICHEL'E & quot ; , KEITH SWEAT & quot ; MAKE IT LAST FOREVER & quot ; , GUY & quot ; THE FUTURE & quot ; , AND MARY J BLIGE & quot ; WHAT 'S THE 411 ? THIS RECORD SHOULD GET A TEN BUT AMAZON WILL ONLY LET ME GIVE 5.I HAVE REVIEWED A LOT OF RECORDS AND FEW HAVE GOTTEN 5 'S BUT THIS THIS IS A 5.SO IF YOU HAV'NT HEARD THIS GET IT IF YOU HAD IT AND LOST IT FIND IT OR BUY A NEW ONE LIKE I HAVE 3 TIMES ... ..	1
I first bought the CD-Single of `` Stroke You Up '' back in '94 and the tape when it came out and I wore the tape out until it broke on me . The album is the best and one of the best albums among the girl groups of the mid-90 's and were criticized heavily by a lot of people because of one time when they were Video Soul , it sounded like there were lip synching and were labeled as `` studio singers '' . No matter what this group could sing to me and had a string of three very good hits . The first two singles were `` Stroke You Up '' & `` Foolin ' Around '' which were produced by R. Kelly and the third single was my favorite of the album `` Keep It Right There '' which had the urban touch and produced by one of my favorite producers DeVante . Some other highlights on the album was `` Feeling All This Love '' , `` Movin On '' , `` Thoughts of You '' & `` Baby Your Love '' ( Produced by Heavy D ) . Overall this is a great album with a great soultry mix . This group may not have been in the class of EnVogue & Jade as far as vocals but they can still hold their own .	1
Changing Faces ' recording career was off to a good start with this self-titled debut album . The name Changing Faces alluded to changing trends in 1990s R & B , which was moving away from new jack swing and toward a softer type of medium-tempo groove . In fact , pretty much everything on this CD , favors a medium tempo sound -- the New York duo does n't overwhelm the listener with either slow ballads or fast material . Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose , collectively Changing Faces , are strong singers -- and while slow jams like `` Thoughts of You , '' `` Movin ' On , '' and `` Come Closer '' are n't mind-blowing , they 're pleasant enough . Not surprisingly , `` Foolin ' Around '' and `` Stroke You Up '' ( both written and produced by R. Kelly ) became major hits .	1
A lot of people did n't know about this cd when it came out . This was and still is a great buy . the singing is ( PRICELESS ) ... ... .	1
The first album of this girl duo with the R.Kelly hits & quot ; Stroke you up & quot ; andothers . It 's a solid , typical R.Kelly , production with fine voices . Verybeautiful ballad : & quot ; All is not gone	1
This is jus a good r and b album that still sounds good on 9/11/09 . I already heard Foolin Around , Stroke U Up , Keep it Right There , and now I am finally listening to more from Changing Faces . All of the songs are so consistant and flow 2gether in that loving , good vibe way . The sounds of the early 90 's are precious . I luv the song `` Am I Wasting My Time '' . I only wish I could find the remix for `` Feeling All This Luv '' . I bought the cd for that song but it 's jus the album cut . I had it on the cassette single for Foolin Around . Every song on here is gr8 , no skip-overs , get this baby . I got this !	1
The band 's first album remains , in my eyes , the best - the songwriting and production are top-notch , and although the lyrics are typically oblique ( & quot ; You get the diplomatic treatment/You get the force-fed future & quot ; ) , the songs are performed and sung with such skill that you tend not to notice . An excellent combination of various styles - post-punk , new wave , power pop - it says a lot that both classic rock radio and alternative radio lay claim to the Cars . My favorites are & quot ; Bye Bye Love & quot ; , & quot ; Just What I Needed & quot ; and & quot ; All Mixed Up & quot ; , but even songs I did n't particularly like ( & quot ; I 'm in Touch With Your World & quot ; ) have grown on me . An excellent recording for any pop or rock fan .	1
This is one of those very special albums/now CD 's that can be counted on to always generate a happy smile to my face . I saw the Cars ( dig this ... it should be `` the other way around , '' huh ? ) `` open '' for Foreigner in '78 . For reasons that are not relevant here , I have to admit that that concert experience was right up there with seeing Ian Hunter up close or seeing the Stones in '75 . Well , my band already did `` Just What I Needed '' ( which was difficult to perform without that all-important synth line ) . Still . On one of the very greatest nights of my life , my best friend/guitarist and our lady singer decided that they had had ENOUGH of my `` pain , '' my `` angst , '' whatever , due to a divorce earlier that year . I was at work at a most ostentatious clothing store , and I would n't get off till 9:30 , But regardless I received a phone call from Kent , telling me `` he and the lady had broken into my apartment , where did I hide the g**ja , and to find y'self a date there , we 're takin ' you out dancin ' , we 're tired of you whinin ' all the time . '' I did , the beautiful red-headed lady security person agreed , and ... To make a long story short ( er ) , I `` got up '' for a second , and when I returned the band was just finishing Segar 's `` Sunspot Baby . '' The beautiful security lady sat there with a delicious `` come hither '' look about her . We danced , and ( YES ! ) `` Baby '' segued right IN to `` Fire Down Below . '' A more appropriate song was never written . But , as to say , `` This Is YO ' Nite , Chaz Turner ! , '' the band concluded with the Cars ' most ethereal `` Let The Good Times Roll . '' As I wrote in a paper for a `` psych 101 '' class a couple of years later , `` I wo n't embellish the story with pornographic details . '' But be THAT as it may , we all wound up at my apartment about 4:30AM , played a little music , had a drink and a smoke , and sort of ... . '' paired off . '' Yes . And the good times did , indeed , `` roll . `` Two things : A ) Anything you may have heard about redheads is undeniably , 100 % truthful . I mean that in the most positive , loving way ! ; B ) ... and I can CERTAINLY understand , whenever Keef is interviewed about the `` current state of rock and roll , '' he always replies , `` % & $ # the 'rock , ' gim me the ROLL ! '' Yeah , brother !	1
For the most part , The Cars were a singles band , but their debut stands as one of the best ever new wave albums . The hit songs were solid , including the amazing threesome , & quot ; Let the Good Times Roll , & quot ; & quot ; My Best Friend 's Girl & quot ; and & quot ; Just What I Needed & quot ; that kick off the album . But side two is were The Cars demonstrate their artistic complexity , particularly on the lengthy double track & quot ; Moving in Stereo/All Mixed Up. & quot ; & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Bye Bye Love & quot ; make for another couple of great singles as well . This album is so good , it could stand as a greatest hits package all on its own .	1
Many bands have a long time to perfect the songs for their first album resulting in a solid debut . This may be the case for The Cars ( although Candy-O is great too ) . This album contains classic songs like Just What I Needed , You 're All I 've Got Tonight , Bye Bye Love , and Moving In Stereo . It 's a crime that this band never got the credit they deserved . They created catchy , sometimes quirky , rock songs with a good balance between rockin guitar and cool keyboards . Elliot Easton 's guitar playing is superb as he always plays for the song and not just to show-off . The vocal phrasing of Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr ( rest in peace ) is excellent ( even if I did n't always understand the lyrics ) . A classic album that must never be forgotten !	1
I love this band . I love how they infused the synthesizer into much of their music . To me the sound comes across the way I like it , raw . Ocasek and Orr compliment each other well switching lead vocals . My favs are & quot ; just what I needed & quot ; , & quot ; moving in stereo & quot ; If any of you remember the movie & quot ; fast times at Ridgemont high & quot ; There is a killer scene with Phoebe Cates and the Cars & quot ; moving in stereo & quot ; ... I highly recommend this cd .	1
I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago -- The tape pulled out ( remember how 8 tracks did that ? ) so I bought the record album -- after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it -- I went and bought the cassette -- needless to say -- I wore it out too . I now have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out . The format may wear out but great tunes never die -- I must have listened to the Cars debut album over a thousand times -- it 's still great . A classic among classics .	1
Forget greatest hits ! Just listen to this and you 'll be reminded what got you hooked on the Cars in the first place - this Album ! In my opinion , this release is their greatest ! A stunning debut !	1
There are certain recordings that become part of the audio landscape . This was one of them . If ever there was a band that defined Americana in the '80s , it was The Cars . And like so many or our aging and posthemous heroes , they passed into lore.I think the most enduring test of the greatness of this record is to play against what 's spinning these days and it will still sound as fresh as the day as these Boston boys cranked it out ... .do n't ya stop , do n't ya stop !	1
I loved the Cars , soooo oringinal.the more time passes , the better they are.And this is the set of songs that launched the legendary band .	1
What can I say about the Cars first album . The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard . Why ca n't bands make albums this great anymore ? Three big hit singles `` Good Times Roll '' , '' Just What I Needed '' , and `` My Bestfriend 's Girl '' . As well as `` Bye , Bye Love '' , `` Moving in Stereo '' , and `` YOu 're All I 've Got Tonight '' that each get a lot of radio play as well . This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish , no filler here .	1
The music magazine Q recently compiled a list of the 100 best debut albums ever . The Car 's debut was NOT on that list . It was , however , on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list . From my standpoint , they were in good company among artist such as Queen , Dire Straits and Boston . Being a British magazine , Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it was n't that big in the UK ( # 29 ) . My Best Friend 's Girl ( # 3 ) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles ( if not the very first ) released as a picture disc ( shaped like a car ) . Just What I Needed ( # 17 ) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations . My Best Friend 's Girl ( # 27 ) , Just What I Needed ( # 35 ) & Good Times Roll ( # 41 ) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate . During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides . The three songs already being hits on side A , side B became a popular choice for such occasions . The album did n't set the charts on fire , barely sneaking in the top 20 ( # 18 ) . With continuous airplay of many of the album 's tracks sales were consistent , which in the States matters much more than in most other territories . It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade , selling 6 million copies , an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10 . The Cars , both band and album , thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album . At the time of its release , 1978 , its producer , Roy Thomas Baker , was in huge demand , mainly due to his work with Queen . With Queen , the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations ( Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example ) . The production on The Cars is , however , sparse on most of the album ( the intros of My Best Friend 's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples ) . This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense . The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek 's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way ; along with the late Benjamin Orr 's more emotional approach in singing . In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies , e.g . on You 're All I 've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll . Combined , this gave the Cars a punkish feel , what today would be labelled as post-punk rock . This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually , it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today , more than 25 years after its release . Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro . There is , however , one major drawback on buying this CD ( meaning 4 instead of 5 stars ) . The sound quality is below par , which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology . Despite being 10 years old , the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD . The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records . This album really could use some re-mastering ( there is one available , a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc ; there have , however , been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books ) . Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases ( the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday ) , this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release . Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric , are you reading this ? !	1
The Cars made a distinct and lasting impression by creating an incredibly unique sound which was post-disco and pre-hard rockin ' 80 's and defies any traditional music classification . This is quite simply one of the top 15 rock albums of all time-period .	1
All tracks are perfect ! Great music . This is a must album with such iconic hits . Seems like they never get old .	1
The Cars is their self-titled debut and one of the great albums of the new-wave era . Although their album Heartbeat City had more hits and sold more copies , the tracks here are their best work and many of them still get consistent airplay on classic rock radio . The catchy hooks and memorable melodies still sound amazingly fresh over 25 years later , making the Cars one of the few new-wave acts whose work has truly stood the test of time.Like Boston 's self-titled debut album which appeared 2 years earlier , this plays like a greatest hits album . The first three tracks & quot ; Good Times Roll & quot ; , & quot ; My Best Friend 's Girl & quot ; , and & quot ; Just What I Needed & quot ; were all big hits and are now bonafide new-wave classics . Although not a big hit , & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; with its simple , yet memorable riff and David Robinson 's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring tracks . Other excellent tracks include the punk-pop of & quot ; Do n't Cha Stop & quot ; , the hypnotic & quot ; Moving In Stereo & quot ; , the moody & quot ; All Mixed Up & quot ; , and the catchy & quot ; Bye Bye Love. & quot ; The band 's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable here , whether it 's guitarist Elliot Easton 's excellent lead work on & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; , Greg Hawkes ' keyboard flourishes on & quot ; I 'm In Touch With Your World & quot ; , or Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr 's strong vocals throughout the album . An excellent debut . Highly recommended .	1
In my view , this album by itself represents the birth of New Wave ( that is , before it had a name ) . When the Cars released this , their first , there simply was no other sound like it -- and it would take years before other artists even came close to reproducing the cool , beat-laden , tech-heavy resonances of such songs as Good Times Roll , My Best Friend 's Girl , Just What I needed , You 're All I 've Got Tonight , and the terrific combination of Moving in Stereo and All Mixed Up . In short , mock all you want the haircuts and vapid lyrics of the boy bands which came later , but this one is real , hard , and as original as it gets .	1
The Cars was one of the most original bands to come out of the late 70s/early 80s , a band that helped set the yardstick for New Wave . This was their first album , coming out in 1978 , and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut . Just about all of its tracks are great , and not just the hits `` Just What I Needed , '' `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' and `` Good Times Roll . `` If you are a fan of New Wave music , then you will love this album . Heck , even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70s/early 80s , then you will love this album , too . Do yourself a favor , and buy this album !	1
`` Just What I Needed '' was already an oldie by the time I was a high school sophomore , but that did n't stop it from being one of the most relevant songs I could get my hands on . It simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical cravings , serving up a flawless three-and-a-half-minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroics , sharp melodic hooks , hopelessly clever lyrics , and vocals that were both quirky and impassioned . It was the perfect pop song , but with enough spiky alt-new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool . Every time I cue it up , it takes me back to tenth grade , to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend . `` Just What I Needed '' is the sound of pure , hopeless joy , of butterflies in the stomach and lightness in the head , of wry , knowing angst and cheekily self-deprecating humor . It 's the sound of smart people letting their emotions sneak up on them . Beautiful ! But the most mind-boggling thing about `` Just What I Needed '' is that it 's not even my favorite song here ! That honor would probably go to `` Bye Bye Love , '' which is a brittle , cynical masterpiece . It 's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out , and every one of its hooks is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit . In fact , I 'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of Ric Ocasek sneering `` you think you 're so illustrious/ you call yourself intense . '' It 's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music , rivaling even the more acidic moments of This Year 's Model and Highway 61 Revisited.The other seven songs are icing on the cake . I love icing . There are sweet , gooey gobs of it all over this disc , in the form of such irresistible classics as `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' and `` Do n't Cha Stop . '' `` I 'm In Touch With Your World '' is marvelously quirky , and `` Moving In Stereo '' is endearingly creepy . `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight '' is desperate and paranoid and surprisingly fun , `` Good Times Roll '' is a panicked ( anti- ) party anthem , and `` All Mixed Up '' is really atmospheric and kinda sultry . And the chorus is beautiful , sort of . Yeah . This album 'll blow your mind with its inescapable wonderfulness . Treat yourself to it .	1
The Cars hit a formula right from the very start . With Ric Ocasek generally taking the lead vocal , The Cars combined wonderfully wordsmithed lyrics with a solid rock beat to become one of the best New Wave groups . Some people have argued that The Cars , along with Devo and several other groups , created New Wave.This album is a remarkable debut , with three of the songs released as singles and three others released as flipsides for a incredible 6 of 9 songs appearing as singles - something that few other groups have managed to achieve . The songs are : `` Just What I Needed '' / '' I 'm in Touch with Your World '' ( 5/29/78 ) , `` Best Friend 's Girl '' / '' Do n't Cha Stop '' ( 10/10/78 ) , and `` Good Times Roll '' / '' All Mixed Up '' ( 2/27/79 ) .I 've always had a great appreciation for The Cars ' lyrics . They are typically artfully evocative and more intended to evoke emotion than to convey a concept directly . As an example , look at the opening lyrics of `` All Mixed Up '' : she shadows me in the mirrorshe never leaves on the lightand some things that I say to herthey just do n't seem to biteWhen you read The Cars ' ( typically Ric Ocasek 's ) lyrics you feel surrealistic . Once you understand you are to picture images of feelings , or feel the feelings yourself , you gain an understanding of how the singer/songwriter is feeling.The Cars insisted they are music performers and not an `` act '' , preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage . Fortunately for us , the listeners , that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity . This music has a pop feel to it , but with enough of a hard edge that pushes it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock.The musical style is somewhat dated , feeling like the late 70s music that it is , but it has aged to the point where it is now classic rock . This CD is very solid music for anyone a fan of The Cars , of late 70s or 80s music , or anyone looking for something a bit out of the mainstream that has a good solid rock beat .	1
It 's ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap . `` Stacy 's Mom , '' anyone ? Weezer or Hot Hot Heat , perhaps ? The reason for all of this idolatry is , of course , because the Cars ' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever . The record was released in 1978 , and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple , catchy , and infinitely memorable songs , the Cars ' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time . Easily one of the 70s ' best . `` Just What I Needed '' is among my top five favorite pop songs ever .	1
Strong debut for the Boston post-punk/new wave band , fronted by the legendary Ric Ocasek ( though bassist Benjamin Orr could almost be considered a `` co-frontman '' ) . Snide charm and effortless hooks dominated this effort , with several deserved hits along the way ( and at least a couple more that probably could have been smashes as well ) . Heavily influenced and influential , its flavor is dulled a bit by time -- their fusion of punk/new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite as new . `` Just What I Needed '' is , of course , the standout of the bunch , but the underrated minor hit `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight '' is nearly its equal . Meanwhile , the hit track , `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' has n't aged quite as well , but it 's got such a goofily fun hook that it 's nearly irresistible . Surprisingly , one of the weakest tracks , `` I 'm in Touch With Your World , '' is the one that works hardest to stand apart ; unfortunately it falls victim to a weak melody and the clich & eacute ; s of punchy psychedelia.Best cuts : `` Just What I Needed , '' `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight , '' `` Good Times Roll , '' `` Moving in Stereo , '' `` Do n't Cha Stop , '' `` My Best Friend 's Girl , '' `` All Mixed Up ''	1
For many listeners , it might be hard at this point to listen to The Cars ' 1978 debut album with fresh ears . Over half the songs here remain staples of classic rock radio stations , and even if you do n't voluntarily listen to these stations , you 're bound to be familiar with songs like `` Just What I Needed '' , `` Good Times Roll '' , etc . Even so , this is a great album , well-deserved of its classic status.Do n't be fooled by The Cars ' tendency to get pegged as a 'singles band ' . This nine-song debut actually has the feel of a song cycle with its uncannily sequenced lineup of songs . One of the great appeals of Ric Ocasek is the playful , yet classy , and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex , how there 's so much more to it than just 'getting laid ' -- there 's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in songs like `` Just What I Needed '' and `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight '' .The opening `` Good Times Roll '' sets the scene perfectly , with Ric offering us a feel-good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility . `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization ' of Buddy Holly 's patented sound . `` Do n't 'Cha Stop '' , with its `` Pleasant Valley Sunday '' -ish opening riff , is album 's sole uptempo track -- the chorus feels rather tossed off , but it 's still a very fine track , with great layered guitar lines on the verses . The `` I Ca n't Explain '' -esque `` Bye Bye Love '' has a very upbeat-sounding tune , but the ominous lyrics and Ben Orr 's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead-in to the album 's final two tracks ... '' Moving In Stereo '' was cooked up by Ric and Greg Hawkes in Ric 's basement , making it the one track on the album Ric did n't write on his own . And what a classic it is . David Robinson 's drums are tweaked a bit , giving them a noticeably brash quality . Hawkes offers a synth line that 's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic . Perfect vocals from Ben Orr -- could this man ever sing . `` All Mixed Up '' ends the album in cathartic fashion -- great dynamics , sumptuous vocal harmonies , and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly-placed keyboard lick from Hawkes and Ben Orr once again working magic with his powerful , commanding vocals.I also must not fail to mention `` I 'm In Touch With Your World '' , another 'hidden ' gem contained herein . It shows that Ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried . Ric delivers an ultra-edgy lead vocal -- it has a great , bugs-under-your-skin quality to it . And all the percussion , sudden blasts of sound effects , and 'tick-tock ' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped-down track marvelously.Lead guitarist Elliot Easton is n't spotlighted as much as he would be on the subsequent `` Candy-O '' , but you can hear how the man was a big believer in 'serving the songs ' -- check out his well-placed rockabilly licks ( instantly reminiscent of the Beatles ' `` I Will ) on `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' , or his fine , if rather brief , solo on `` Just What I Needed '' .So , you may think you know this album all too well already . But , I suggest perhaps there 's a bit more to this than you realize -- after all , with a group like The Cars , things are often not as they seem .	1
These remarks are aboutASIN B0000262U4'The Cars ' import CD on the Warner Bros UK label.You already know whether you like the Cars ' debut album . But there are many CD pressings out there and many of them sound awful . This one sounds great ; without the heavy-handed compression , EQ , and brickwall limiting of so many 'remastered ' discs , this sounds like the original vinyl . If you want this album on CD , this CDis the one you want .	1
the cars released this great record back in 1978.shortly after it , s release it was all over the airwaves.this album is in my opinion another one of the finest debut albums in rock ever ! ! there are so many great songs on this album it may well be the cars quintessential album . ric ocasek ; rythm guitarist and chief song writer for the cars was in top form on this album.for me the best cuts are [ and there are many ! ] you , re all i , ve got tonight , good times roll , bye , bye , love , moving in stereo , just what i needed , my best friend , s girl , all mixed up and don , t cha stop.i realize i have just named most of the tunes on this album but i think this album is a must for any cars fan new or old ! i also love the cover that chick with the sexy red lips ! ! this album and their second album candy o from 1979 are two of the best albums the cars ever did !	1
This 1978 blend of tuneful pop and power rock has stood the test of time very well . The album contains a magical fusion of the melodicism of pop and the passionate force of rock . The first three tracks : Good Times Roll , My Best Friend 's Girl and Just What I Needed form one of those legendary song cycles , just like the sequence of Dirty-Ass Rock & amp ; Roll , Darling I Need You and Rollaroll on John Cale 's Slow Dazzle album . But every one of the tracks is excellent , made timeless by their killer hooks , tight harmonies and focused energy . To my mind , The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen , Alice Kooper and Roxy Music , whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs , one Mink DeVille , and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie . Of course , Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein , but they came later . All of the songs were written by Ric Ocasek , no mean feat considering their gripping melodic appeal and lasting popularity on the playlists . This album is one of the best examples of late 70s style rock with a punk attitude .	1
Learning to drive was one of the most liberating experiences I have had . It just changed the rules of the game . I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large . I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities ( a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents ' old car that became mine around 1995 or so ) that felt adult-like . I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now , many years later , ca n't imagine what life would be like if I could n't get behind the wheel.I 've always associated driving with liberation and excitement , and to this day it 's my best place to think . I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and ( wait , I 'm reviewing something are n't I ? ) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born , so I certainly did n't `` grow up with it '' through my formative ( read : teenage ) years like some of the other reviewers here . However I 've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic , as if it 's something that I should ( in italics ) have grown up with . Perhaps that 's because , for all of its virtues , a lot of the music that came about in `` my '' era was n't particularly fun and catchy . Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is ( IMHO ) a soup-sandwich unless you 're really angry and/or depressed . The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub ( another band that has created some of my favorite driving music ) , Fountains Of Wayne ( of course ) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars ' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have , full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective ( arched eyebrows at the ready ) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along . I could n't ask for more . However , absent any discoveries yet to be made , I do n't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond . In the meantime , give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised . It 's a nice feeling .	1
I got this album on vinyl when it came out in the 70s . Every song good ... and I think their best album . One of the first New Wave albums but also retro at the same time . Get it , you already know most of the songs .	1
for those of us coming of age in the late 70s and the 80s , this album is one of a handful that capture the time.forget about all the new wave references -- what the hell is new wave anyway ? -- song for song this is a killer album that define a sound but also transcend it to be a great album about love for any decade . the lyrics , the crafty/cool rock , the band persona are all classics .	1
THE BAND : Ric Ocasek ( vocals , rhythm guitar ) , Elliot Easton ( lead guitar ) , Benjamin Orr ( vocals , bass ) , Greg Hawkes ( keyboards , percussion , saxophone ) , David Robinson ( drums & percussion ) .THE DISC : ( 1978 ) 9 tracks clocking in at just over 35 minutes . Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/times , band members and original black & white photos/artwork . Digitally remastered in 1990 . There is a deluxe remastered 2-disc ( disc-2 is all demos ) edition released in 1999 . Label - Elektra.COMMENTS : The Cars were never better than this debut album . Rock and pop with a synth/techno alternative flavor . Classic songs that sounded like nothing else at the time . The Cars were `` New Wave '' before there was New Wave ( which hit in the early 80 's ) . 9 songs - with only one question mark ( filler ? ) in `` I 'm In Touch With Your World '' . The other 8 tracks were gold ( the album reached # 18 on the Billboard Pop charts and has sold over 6 million units ) . Ric Ocasek 's quirky voice teamed with bassist Ben Orr 's smooth voice worked well together . Greg Hawke on keyboards made & pulled this band tighter . The songs that made it to major air-waves were `` Let The Good Times Roll '' , `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' , and `` Just What I Needed '' . But , check out tracks 6-9 ... `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight '' , `` Bye Bye Love '' , `` Moving In Stereo '' and `` All Mixed Up '' run together fluidly - these are awesome album tracks . Sure this band looked like a bunch of geeks , but man when they came together with their instruments , they really made some beautiful music . Only their 2nd album `` Candy-O '' came close , but no album of the Cars was better than this one . This debut is ranked # 282 on Rolling Stone Magazine 's list of 500 all-time greatest albums . R.I.P . Benjamin Orr ( 10/3/00 ) . Classic disc ( 5 stars ) .	1
THE CARS ( 1978 ) is the The Cars ' greatest work ever . Sure , '80 's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY ( which did sell more records upon release ) , but real rock fans rate their debut at the top . Why ? Because , just like most great rock debuts ( such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN ) , it shows The Cars in hungry mode , pulling out all the stops to create a hard , edgy , and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time . This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound ( that only then was beginning to emerge ) in equal amounts , with straightforward , simple lyrics -- and created a sound that was raw yet sleek , edgy but commercially accessible , and totally fresh at that time . Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr 's similarly cool , unaffected lead vocals , Greg Hawkes ' incredibly cool , futuristic keyboards , and Elliot Easton 's slicing , awesome guitar-work , this album was truly unique . It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards . It has since stood the test of time , and that 's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago , I was already quite familiar with & quot ; Just What I Needed. & quot ; Then , I really got hooked on & quot ; Good Times Roll & quot ; and & quot ; Best Friend 's Girl. & quot ; It was n't until 1982 that I really started liking & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Bye Bye Love. & quot ; The following year , I got into & quot ; I 'm In Touch With Your World. & quot ; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of & quot ; Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up. & quot ; Talk about a true classic ; over the years , every now and then , it 's given me something new to love about it ! MOST RECOMMENDED	1
THE CARS ARE AN EXTREMELY TALENTED AOR BAND FRONTED BY RIC OCASEK.THIS BAND IS VERY GOOD JUST LIKE PINK FLOYD , CREAM , THE ROLLING STONES , AC/DC AND QUEEN.THEIR DEBUT IS THEIR BEST.PICK IT UP RIGHT AWAY BUT IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER AND HIS LOUSY RECMMENDATIONS .	1
Watershed Cars album , the only one you need . Youve heard 'em all . Worth it mostly for the usually-not-aired `` Moving In Stereo '' , a moody , cryptic slow rocker , and `` Doncha Stop '' - I ca n't say what it 's about here , but you may be able to get yr `` head '' around it if you listen carefully ...	1
Every track on this album is a classic . Almost all of them are in rotation on classic rock stations . Even so the songs do n't seem worn out or dated . Ric Ocasek had a genuine ear for pop , which he melded with the bands New Wave sensibilities in order to create a classic album .	1
When this album was released , I was the perfect age to receive it . I was a hard core music fan yet bored with hard rock and prog , embarrassed at the disco movement , too naive to appreciate soul and funk , too cool to listen to top 40/bubblegum and too suburban to accept Brittish punk rock . I was hungry for new , cutting edge tunes since Led Zep , Stones , Tull , Kiss and others became soooooooooo stale.Along comes the Cars.Today , the Cars sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978 , this stuff could n't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocals , synthasized sounding drums , compressed guitars , and adventerous keyboards . I know it must sound hard to believe but `` Just What I Needed '' was a complete breath of fresh air . Everybody ( and I mean everybody ... even my guitar teacher , famous shred master Michael Angelo Batio ) was intrigued by this fresh sound and they were , sorry for the pun , thought of as truly a `` new wave '' of musical talent . In my high school , the cool kids abandoned everything and embraced hippness of The Cars.Now , in hindsight , it is easy to see why the Cars made such a quick impact . These were hardly young kids but , rather , they were seasoned veterans , honing their craft , writing finely composed songs and applying high quality musicianship . Guitarist Elliot Easton was as good of a chicken picker on a Telecaster as anybody , Ric Ocasek was a seasoned songwriter , Keyboard player Greg Hawkes was a session player and drummer Dave Robinson came out of the Modern Lovers . These guys must have studied Velvet Underground , Lou Reed , Iggy Pop and Roxy Music since you can hear the influences everywhere.Their debut has many of their best songs . `` the good times roll '' has all of the above quality ingredients , the aforementioned cool , detached singing , motorizing guitars and in your face keyboard theme . `` My best friend 's girl '' changes the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly . `` Moving in Stereo '' is a hypnotic , groove oriented song . `` You 're all I got tonight '' test your speakers by utilizing all the right stereophonic squibs and squalls.Because these guys were so experienced musically , their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured , which may have been ( ironically ) to their disadvantage , since , in the end , they sounded like everybody else . Each album lost more of the `` edge '' that attracted me.I think their debut and `` Candy O '' are their best albums since they were the most adventerous .	1
the Cars were a breath of fresh air in 1978 . Disco and sappy pop was the rule in '78 , but with this release by these Boston modern rockers , it would lead to a 9 year relationship with this band . Led by guitarist , vocalist Ric Ocasek , bassist , vocalist Ben Orr , guitarist Elliot Easton , drummer from the Modern Lovers David Robinson and keyboardist Greg Hawkes . Produced by englishman Roy Thomas Baker , `` The Cars '' # 18 , is just a tremendous release with such classics as , `` Just What I Needed '' # 27 , `` Good Times Roll '' # 41 , `` My Best Friends Girl '' , # 35 , `` I 'm In Touch With Your World '' , `` Do n't Cha Stop '' , `` Your All I 've Got Tonight '' , `` Bye Bye Love '' , the moody `` Moving In Stereo '' and one of the best songs ever in rock history that radio never plays `` All Mixed Up '' . In less than a year they would come out with another great album `` Candy-O '' .	1
& # 34 ; We used to joke that the first album should be called The Cars ' greatest Hits. & # 34 ; said guitariest Elliot Easton . their debut was arty and punchy enough to be part of Boston ' New Wave scene , yet so catchy that nearly every track ( & # 34 ; Good Times Roll , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; My Best Friends Girl & # 34 ; ) landed on the radio .	1
There are precious few flawless albums in rock and roll history . This is one of them . Just as Nirvana 's `` Nevermind '' singlehandedly turned Grunge into a mainstream phenomenon , so it was for New Wave with the Cars ' debut album - And just like Nirvana fostered countless unlistenable imitators , so did the Cars . But I have a choice not to listen to all of the bad New Wave that followed this , and I also have a choice to listen to this impossibly catchy album as long as I have functioning ear drums.For those who are only familiar with the Cars through classic rock radio , this is the Cars CD to get . It 's a rare instance where one of the band 's original albums is the first choice over a greatest hits package .	1
The Car 's debut album in 1978 represents the good ol ' days of American rock . They are categorized as a NEW WAVE artist but to them , they were struggling to create what American rock compared to UK rock should be evolved . With the huge success of Boston , Foreigner , Styx and Kansas they were trying to do something different while retaining mainstream pop vibe . The band challenges Foreigner with hard-edged and upbeat track JUST WHAT I NEEDED . While creating radio friendly first three songs , they were experimenting what music fans at that time might never been experienced . Fourth track I 'M IN TOUCH WITH YOUR WORLD invites listeners to the uncharted territories . Then at fifth track they again put out upbeat track DO N'T CHA STOP , then they turn to progressive hard rock edged YOU ARE ALL I 'VE GOT TONIGHT . Listeners might have enjoyed what they might call mystery drive tour . The last two tracks often aired in pairs are truly what make the band 's debut album a legend.Verdict : Impeccable and Exciting debut album by another new giant.Rating : 93 out of 100Recommended for late 70s pop rock fans .	1
My native Boston based rockers The Cars released their self-titled debut in June of 1978.The Cars was formed by rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek and bass player/singer ( the late ) Benjamin Orr.Prior to the formation of The Cars , Orr and Ocasek were in a popular Boston act called Cap'n Swing , along with lead guitarist and Berkeley School of Music grad Elliot Easton . They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of `` Just What I Needed '' became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station ( WBCN for those who want to know ) . As a result , Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London , England at George Martin 's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman ( another Queen and Journey veteran ) .When this album came out , it was a smash and 30 plus years later , it is still a masterpiece.The album 's first three tracks were all hit singles . `` Good Times Roll '' is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not . Next is `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends . The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles ' `` I Will '' in tone . The song that follows was `` Just What I Needed '' which was America 's intro to the band and was Orr 's vocal debut on a Cars track ( Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly ) . The track is still a staple of rock radio . This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film 's party scene . `` I 'm In Touch With Your World '' and `` Dont'cha Stop '' are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals ( Ric sang most of the first half except as noted ) . Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple `` You 're All I 've Got Tonight '' kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker ( the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest ) . `` Bye Bye Love '' is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album . We segue into the classic `` Moving in Stereo '' which is one of the band 's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High . The closing `` All Mixed Up '' is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended !	1
After years of listenting to metal/rock/pop/ ... rock , I heard this album ... and the world turned on it 's head for a moment ( for me , of course ) ... my first intro to something other than 'Free Burd ' , and although it took some getting used to , this still remains on my list as one of the best new-wave/rock classic albums of all time . The 'best of ' they did covers the hits , but this CD , from start to finish , is a work of new-wave art - rarely matched by their contemporaries ( except maybe the 1st Pretenders album ... ) .They ( The Cars ) brought cynicism to a new level , without being obsessed with anger/etc . This CD has an underlying power to it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened today ( 20 years on ) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity .	1
The Cars ' self-titled debut album , which introduced the band 's unique blend of the Velvet Underground , the Steve Miller Band , and Roxy Music , is their most balanced album as far as vocals are concerned , with lead vocals about equally split between Ben Orr ( R.I.P . ) and Ric Ocasek . Orr 's vocals are more melodic than Ocasek 's , as the latter seems to have some vocal tics that can be annoying at times . This was n't a problem on the first two albums or HEARTBEAT CITY , as these records have enough hooks to compensate for any vocal shortcomings that the bandmembers might have had , but it was a severe issue on PANORAMA . If you 're hoping for a Cars reunion , sadly , it will never happen ; bassist/vocalist Ben Orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000 .	1
If you love this album as much as I still do , pony up the extra couple of bucks and be prepared to be wowed , loud . Go for the double disc deluxe set , which sports a great remaster . `` The Cars '' was a classic debut and one of the first bands with a new wave association to actually make it big . Their blend of irony laden Roxy/Bowie pop and AM radio hooks made `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' and `` Just What I Needed '' sound like Top 40 classics from play one , and the rest of the album skirted experimental stuff like `` Moving In Stereo '' with the classic nervy album rock ready sounds of `` Good Times Roll . '' Roy Thomas Baker 's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus , and made the songs leap from the speakers with a fresh sound.The band 's arsenal was well loaded . Greg Hawkes brought keyboards to the front of the band , as well as his sax work . Elliot Easton made his choppy guitar work as fluid as it was jittery , and Ben Orr and Ric Ocasek switched vocals just enough that , while there was variety , it was seamless . True originals , The Cars were often aped but never replicated ( as opposed to the dozens of Joe Jackson/Elvis Costello copycats ) and it makes this debut sound great almost 25 years after it was released .	1
Not sure why it is not listed as such but wanted to confirm that this $ 6.99 Elektra release is HDCD Remastered and sounds fantastic . Panorama and Candy-O also received the same quality HDCD remaster and sound great as well . Unfortunately the Elektra $ 6.99 Shake It Up and Heartbeat City releases did not receive this remastering and the difference shows , especially on SIU .	1
I do n't know why so many people claim The Cars invented & quot ; new-wave & quot ; . They did have that sort of weird keyboard sound , but their music was straight popular hard rock . They are more in the vein of groups like Loverboy then & quot ; new-wave & quot ; . They had the sound of the early 80 's MTV groups , but in a rock style . & quot ; Just what I needed & quot ; was an instant classic with me and my hard rock fan friends in the summer of '78 . Good stuff .	1
I got into The Cars around the time I was 14 due to smoking mad pot , drinking beer , and hearing the song JUST WHAT I NEEDED all the time on my local classic rock radio station.I remember the exact moment that I actually `` heard '' this song . I had a nice buzz going and I was chasing this hot little ticket around this beach we used to hang out at . I had a baby boom box in my hand and this song was playing . Suddenly I stopped everything because it seemed that I had become surrounded by this incredibly transfixing electronic music . This of course is the synth hook from the song . Oh yeah ! The next day I asked my moms if she had any CARS records , and indeed she did . This one.I never gave New Wave a chance before this record , however there was no doubt a lot of fun music on here with a solid rock edge to it . Very cool . These guys innovated the NEW WAVE sound which of course would mutate substantially in the decade that followed , leading to some good , some bad , and some downright irritating music.The Cars for the most part remained pretty good , although their music gradually lost the rock edge and just went into realms of stray pop up until they fell apart in the mid-late eigthies , but this is their best album for sure , along with the second , CANDY-O.The album is just partying it up until the end , where you get an awesome tripped out bit of electronica MOVING IN STEREO . You may remember this song from the movie FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH when that extremely fresh young thing comes walking out of the swimming pool . Uh huh ... .. LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL for SURE !	1
The Cars formed in Boston circa 1976 and debuted in 1978 with this eponymously titled release . Straddling the line between rock and new wave , the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits . `` Just What I Needed '' peaked at # 27 and has become a rock radio staple . The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene . And it 's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single , `` My Best Friend 's Girl , '' went to # 35 ; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear . Finally , `` Good Times Roll '' just missed the Top 40 , peaking at # 41 . However , not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan , although I caught them in their pop heyday , when `` Drive '' was a major hit . I 've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years , and I 've been blown away by the quality of their music , especially `` The Cars . '' Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever . This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing . `` The Cars '' sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978 . Since then , the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995 . Every time I hear The Killers or other current retro new wave bands , I want to throw on this CD and hear how it was done right the first time around ! Most highly recommended .	1
Ah , the Cars - the greatest band that nobody seems to give a # $ % & about anymore . And their debut album is one of the few albums I know of that are comprised almost entirely of radio hits , yet never ever becomes tiring to listen to . It all starts out with the Boston band 's mission statement , 'Good Times Roll ' , followed by the charming 'My Best Friend 's Girl ' , which contain some of Ric Ocasek 's best lyrics . Ric 's always been terribly underrated as a songwriter ; few writers then or now could be as witty yet moving , dark yet delicate , and loving in his put-downs . 'Just What I Needed ' , the album 's highest charting single , is the debut of the much-missed Benjamin Orr on vocals . This track is truly classic Cars . The next two songs , 'I 'm In Touch With Your World ' and 'Do n't Cha Stop ' I used to dislike , but have grown to love them . The former is so disjointed in structure it reminds me a little of the Cars ' third album Panorama . While the latter song is one in a long line of ultra-fun fast Cars rockers . 'You 're All I 've Got Tonight ' can either be construed as insulting or pleading . Either way , it 's perfect . 'Bye Bye Love ' is my favorite from this album ; one of Ben Orr 's best lead vocals in my opinion . The last two songs , 'Moving In Stereo ' ( featured in a memorable scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High ... yeah , THAT scene ) and 'All Mixed Up ' show the deeper , darker side of the Cars , which I 've always loved the most.The Cars ' debut album remains easily their best-known , and along with Heartbeat City , probaby their best .	1
Brian Wilson was so blown away after hearing Rubber Soul by The Beatles that he felt the need to compete with them , so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few months of 1966 . What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development . Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies , so he was at the height of his powers here . He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside . This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording . To open up the album we have & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice , & quot ; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge . & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful . The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings & quot ; I wan na cry & quot ; over a feast of notes. & quot ; That 's Not Me & quot ; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes . Then comes & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) , & quot ; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to & quot ; listen & quot ; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards . & quot ; I 'm Waiting For The Day & quot ; is faster and neat , but then comes & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awhile & quot ; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins , Hawaiian-styled guitar , and strings . & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; is said to be the least striking on the album , but it 's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written ; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it 's another highlight.Then comes the wonderful & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer , & quot ; and after that is & quot ; Here Today & quot ; which is the most ambitious of all the songs . Although it appears quaint with its production , it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody . Next is & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest . Near the end we get the title track , the second instrumental of the album , which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar . Finally & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work . It 's hard to express the utter perfection and beauty on this record ( even though the bonus track & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; is nothing special ) . You 'd really just have to hear it . Buy it , you fool !	1
For those that say they & quot ; do n't get it & quot ; . You have to understand at that point in time when this album was released no one had ever tried any of the things that The Beach Boys IE : Brian Wilson tried that was/is & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . I hear a lot of babble from those that & quot ; do n't it get & quot ; that it sounds like bland harmonizing vocals , etc etc . The album is a masterpiece simply because of the daring arrangements . The use of sounds that no one at that time had thought of using in the way that they were used . The drum work . You can hear how Ringo Starr was influenced on Sgt Peppers . You can hear how the use of & quot ; samples & quot ; IE : the sound of the train at the end of & quot ; Caroline NO & quot ; was used on Sgt Peppers . Or the beginning of & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; ... go listen to & quot ; Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite & quot ; off Sgt Peppers and you will hear where the influence for the beginning of that song started . These are things that make this album special , they were the 1st band to try things like this using those sounds . The arrangements themselves of the songs are just simply brilliant , they can actually be compared to Classical . The brilliance of & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; go listen to the ballad of & quot ; John & amp ; Yoko & quot ; , or & quot ; Ob Li Di Ob Li Da & quot ; and you can hear an influence of this song in those songs ! The Beach Boys created brilliance . Those who do not get it are not listening or do not understand the history of music . For those who have not heard this album and are wondering if you will enjoy it . All I can tell you is to ask yourself first how much are you into musicology and if you have an open mind .	1
Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on `` more than one level '' . And since the term `` classic album '' is often overdone and often used without care , Brian 's own terms seem to define this album very much . And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level . The works of Marvin Gaye , Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind . This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs . The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement . Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this , which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes . Aside from that Carl , Dennis , Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album . That 's where the name comes from . These were , in fact Brian 's `` pet sounds '' . Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs . Much heard and well known hits such as `` Would'nt It Be Nice '' and `` God Only Knows '' being among them . And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you , than the rest of this album will be right up your alley . Much as The BeatlesSgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be ( but which even John Lennon admitted it actually was n't ) this album is completely musically and thematically unified . This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture . This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who 'd by this point already experienced physical abuse , mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way . Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth , this sets the record straight on that . On `` I Know There 's An Answer '' , '' Caroline No '' , '' Here Today '' and beautifully chorded pieces such as `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' , '' Do n't Talk '' and `` That 's Not Me '' there 's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being `` in my room '' now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically ? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was . Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix , playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody , harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and `` rocking out '' . On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example . It 's not by any means a guitar rock album . Bands such as the High Llama 's would later make music very much based on this sound . But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson 's soul . He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this . That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product was n't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys . But that 's another story .	1
You know , even with classic radio hits like & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; , & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; I just ca n't putThe Beach Boys & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; into my CD player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting ! I 'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like & quot ; Do n't Talk & quot ; , & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awile & quot ; , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; , & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; ... I can go on and on , really ! This has less weak cuts then The Beatles & quot ; Sgt.Pepper & quot ; and thatonly had ONE mildly weak song if that tells you anything.Okay-order this NOW ! It will brighten your day !	1
This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records . Capitol 's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP . The stereo copies were `` duophonic '' , meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality . But then again , you 'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph . Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were `` duophonic '' also . Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B. , GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULD N'T IT BE NICE ? . This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966 . The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates , The Beatles and Peter & Gordon . Also then , Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs . He 'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston . All the other songs are good .	1
Is there anything about & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; that has n't been said already ? It is already well established that to many rock historians that this the greatest album ever made . I am one of the many fans who agree that opinion.This is truly The Beach Boys in their prime . Here 's where you 'll find two of the greatest singles of all time , & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; and & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; ; here 's where you 'll find its somewhat lesser but still masterful uber - twin & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; . Here 's the album that features such great tracks as & quot ; Here Today & quot ; , & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; , & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer & quot ; , and the aching & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; , not to mention the sad charm of Brian 's yearning & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; . For an album of 100 percent pure rock with absolutely no filler , this is the album you want.And there 's a few new bonuses added to this disc . First , there 's an incredibly thick booklet with rare photos and insightful liner notes by the great David Leaf . And there 's a bonus track . & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; is the original version of & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer & quot ; . Then finally , after that , there 's the entire album repeated again in stereo form , bring its total track number to 27 . Not bad for an album that was originally less than an hour long.The bottom line is that this is great album that should be cherished by young and old alike . And to get a more complete feel of Brian Wilson 's genius , after you listen to the entire album , purchase & quot ; The Pet Sounds Boxed Set & quot ; , featuring over 100 tracks from the & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; sessions . The point is just buy it .	1
After reaping huge success , both commercial and critical , with & quot ; The Beach Boys Today & quot ; , leader and producer Brian Wilson set out to make an album even better than that . What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time.1966 's & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time , barely hitting the top 10 ( it peaked at 10 ) and not going gold . So it 's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time . Under Wilson 's guidance , the group became more experimental , moving out of their signature & quot ; surf rock & quot ; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity ( & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; ) , love ( & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) & quot ; , & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; ) , rejection ( & quot ; Here Today & quot ; , & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; ) , even death ( the ethereal & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; , with Carl Wilson 's angel - like vocal and Brian 's stunning production ) . The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; . But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much , it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun . The two instrumentals , & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awhile & quot ; and the title track are great . The former is carried on by the gentle , slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings , while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout . & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer & quot ; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics . The bonus track , another version of the song entitled & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; is just the same song with just the title line changed. & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information . Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction , and the essay is beautifully written . verall , this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time . For me , to be a great album , the album has to really speak to you , and & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; speaks to me because , as I mentioned earlier , it talks about the issues in our lives . If you want an album , look no further than & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; .	1
You do n't need a rocket scientist to inform you that The Beach Boys ' 1966 album `` Pet Sounds '' is one of the Top 10 greatest albums ever made . Not much is left to say that has n't already been said about the album . Song for song , the record is pure perfection . From the youthful abandonment of `` Would n't It Be Nice '' to the dramatism present on `` Sloop John B . '' to the heartugging `` God Only Knows '' ( voted the greatest love song of all time ) to the poignancy of `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' to the chilling `` Caroline No '' , there is not one clunker on the whole cd.This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono . In both forms , the album sounds absolutely fantastic . There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures . Definitey a must have album .	1
`` Pet Sounds '' seems to be compared a lot on this website to `` Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' , which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new ( at that time ) album , but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous . Both are legendary albums in different ways , and `` Pet Sounds '' for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world , even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles ( who came right back and took the title away from them with `` Revolver '' ) .First off , `` Pet Sounds '' is a far , far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love . These songs are n't about fun in the sun , girls , and surfing . Instead , it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy , and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with . Many people know that Brian Wilson , the leader of the band and the creator of this album , had many mental problems , and also had various drug addictions at this time as well , so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about . Also , Brian was an obsessed perfectionist , he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before . He spent hours upon hours in the studio , creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals , using any instrument available ( even soda cans ! ) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before , creating almost a `` dream '' sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing . `` Pet Sounds '' is Brian Wilson 's baby , and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates . However , the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing , and only his band mates could help in that . The songs themself are pretty excellent . `` Would n't it be nice '' , `` Sloop John B . `` , and `` God Only Knows '' are the well known songs , and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles . The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way . The album is about one man 's search for love from boyhood to manhood , and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it . If Wilson 's lyrics do n't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain , then listen again . And again . And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection . While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson , and while the rest of the band mates did n't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in ( more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness , which the band was n't dead set on singing the lyrics to ) , for one moment this album made them kings . Brian was working on his next project , `` Smile '' , when The Beatles released `` Sgt . Peppers . '' After listening to it , Wilson put up his white flag of surrender , the others went back to the simple days of surf rock , and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with `` Pet Sounds . ''	1
Please see producer Mark Linett 's review under the deluxe `` fuzzy '' version of this new CD/DVD . The mono version of the album has been remastered from a superior source to that used in 2000 , and a more complete version of `` Hang On To Your Ego '' has been used .	1
Released in May 1966 , '' Pet Sounds '' was the album that saw The Beach Boys graduate from purveyors of perfectly crafted lightweight pop like `` Sufin USA '' , '' Fun Fun Fun '' et al , into a vehicle for the mature compositional genius of Brian Wilson.Though it was not an huge hit , its became hugely influential on pop and rock musicians , most notably The Beatles , whose `` Sgt . Pepper '' drew inspiration from this album as Paul McCartney would gladly tell you , and many others old and new ( too numerous to mention ) .For me , it was the first time I truly enjoyed the Beach Boys because it was a work that expressed emotions that I could relate to like finding true love , being insecure , not fitting in , and loss of innocence.It also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melodies , harmonies , sounds , and songs ever commited to tape , like `` God Only Knows '' , '' Caroline No '' , '' I 'm Waiting For The Day '' , '' Would n't It Be Nice '' and others as well.It made me look past the corny striped-shirt fun-in-the-sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper , more substatial body of work than I thought.And it has given me great comfort to my heart , soul , and ears since then.That 's probably the reason why this album 's rep as `` The Greatest Album Of The 20th Century '' still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year !	1
Pet Sounds being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were `` Caroline No '' , `` Would n't it be nice '' , `` Sloop John B '' and `` God Only Knows '' . Yes it is a good album , however to compare it with `` Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior . Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this . However , do not get me wrong this is a good album , but not as good as many would have you believe . The booklet is very nice with many photographs , liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf . No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track . 4/5 .	1
I often write about heart and soul when reviewing cds , describing the enormous effort musicians put into their works . Certainly there are many bands and singers who have devoted their lives to music , but never , ever have I heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking Pet Sounds , as far as work ethic , creativity , perseverence , and in the end , pure perfection.Many people liken Pet Sounds to The Beatles Sgt . Pepper album . People often criticize Sgt . Pepper for taking its influence from the primordial Pet Sounds , but the fact that Brian Wilson was first inspired to make Pet Sounds after he heard Rubber Soul is often overlooked . Here 's what he said in the liner notes : & quot ; In December of 1965 , I heard the album Rubber Soul by the Beatles . It was definitely a challenge for me . I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating . I immediately went to work on the songs for Pet Sounds. & quot ; As a huge fan of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys , I find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest bands from across the seas were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar ; one which ended up helping both bands produce some of their greatest music.As far as the individual songs of this album , there are no highs and lows . Pet Sounds stays at a steady constant of brilliance , sounding at an uncalibrated musical high . From the swirling harmonies of the opening Would n't It Be Nice to the wonderful coda of Hang On To Your Ego , this recording is thoroughly enjoyable . My personal favorites are Would n't It Be Nice , God Only Knows and I Just Was n't Made For These Times . To wrap things up with a hackneyed yet appropiate cliche , your music collection is incomplete without Pet Sounds .	1
1966 was an annus mirabilis for rock music . The greatest bands of the British Invasion - The Beatles , The Stones , The Kinks - began to reliably deliver sets of all original material instead of dividing their LPs between covers and originals . ( The Who 's first great album was released in 1967 . ) Moreover , the LP became more important as a complete artistic statement , resulting in great records ( Revolver , Aftermath , Face To Face ) rather than simply great singles . While great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year , 1966 was the year in which rock bands began to challenge themselves , and their audience , with more sophisticated songcraft.The Beach Boys ' 1966 release Pet Sounds was the best example of an American band making this leap . Inspired by the previous year 's Rubber Soul , Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson , along with lyricist Tony Asher , was determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the Fab Four commercially and artistically . Many - including Paul McCartney himself , maybe - would argue that Pet Sounds surpassed Rubber Soul 's achievements , only to be outdone itself a few months later by Revolver . ( I flatter myself to think that people have read my other reviews , but I make it clear time and again that Sgt Pepper was just another Beatles album , so I am going to disregard it here . ) Whatever the case my be , Pet Sounds turned out to be a huge critical smash on both sides of the Atlantic . Strangely , it was less of a commercial hit in America not only than it was in Britain , but than its predecessors in the US had been.I will try , even if I have already partially failed , to avoid rehashing everything that has already been said about Pet Sounds , and attempt to review it strictly on its musical merits and how well it has endured over the past 40 years . By these standards , it is factually a great and truly unique record . One would search in vain for Chuck Berry-style riffs and solos that were a trademark of their previous records . In fact , the closest thing one finds to guitar riffs at all are the plethora of plump , high-pitched bass lines . But not to worry about the trademark vocal harmonies . They are as plentiful and as gorgeous as ever . The singles are clearly the pillars of the album , and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record . But while `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , `` Sloop John B '' , `` God Only Knows '' , and `` Caroline No '' are all great , `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) '' , `` That 's Not Me '' , `` Here Today '' , and `` I Know There 's An Answer '' are also exceptionally vital numbers . The remaining songs are not quite as great , but they are good enough to help earn Pet Sounds the reputation that it has . Even the two instrumentals are quite strong , and serve as highlights for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc , including tympanis , horns , tubas , Christmas-y bells , and of course , the Theremin . The overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical , and finds kindred spirits in late-Sixties LPs such as Love 's Forever Changes and Odessey and Oracle by The Zombies , and in more recent releases like The Flaming Lips ' The Soft Bulletin . Hence , Pet Sounds was not a traditional rock record at all when released in May 1966 . Rather , it was the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop.Influence and endurance are essential to an album 's `` greatness '' . However , it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record 's songs are not really all that good . Ultimately , what good is a great record if it does n't have great songs on it ? Pet Sounds need n't worry about lacking any of the necessary elements . But most importantly , it is the songs themselves that would earn this record the high rating that I have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring . In terms of its standing in the Beach Boys catalog , it is obviously their best record , but it is also something equally important : the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys ' endless summer . Gone are the surfboards , fast cars , and hamburger stands . That is n't to say that they would n't return , but at this time Brian Wilson was dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasures of youth , embodied by Caroline , who said she 'd never change , but did . In doing so , he created a record that is artistically influential , historically enduring , and - with nary a weak track - truly Great .	1
This one is a strong contender for best rock album of all time and should be in everyone 's collection . Period . Now , it has been reissued countless times ( I think I have owned three different versions at least ) . Unfortunately the best version ever released looks like is no longer available : a stunning one CD containing all tracks in both stereo and mono for the price of a regular CD . Now these versions are sold separately . Which one to buy ? Originally , the album was released and mixed in mono . Only recently was the album remixed in stereo . So , if you are interested in the history behind this album , and the whole ` painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa ' issue , get the mono version . With the stereo version , although you get all the inherent improvements of stereo sound , some sounds from the original album are lost in the stereo mix . Nevertheless , bottom line , for my ears the stereo will always sound best , and that is the version I listen to most . The extra track is just ` I know there is an answer ' with different lyrics , nothing revealing .	1
What can you say that has n't been already said or written about this splendid album . When I first heard this album in 1966 , I wondered & quot ; What the heck is this ? & quot ; This was n't about girls , surf and hot rods . After a few listenings I could n't get it out of my head . The whole recording is like a dream . Brian Wilson 's arrangements and use of unique instruments makes for a lasting and memorable piece of work . It is a surprisingly mature work for one of Brian 's age at the time . Every song is a gem ! It 's the only popular album whose beauty has brought me close to tears . If you have n't got this CD in your collection ... ... your collection is not complete . I can see where Brian Wilson 's sensativity could only lead to his world of isolation , withdrawal and dissapointment with a world not as idealistic as he would wish . After reaching such perfection , anything else is anti-climatic .	1
& quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; has become one of my all time favorite records.I ca n't stop playing this newer version.The first 14 songs are recorded in Mono , then repeats in Stereo.When Paul McCartney and George Martin heard & quot ; Pet Sounds , & quot ; they were amazed.This Album was the Blueprint for the Classic , & quot ; Sgt.Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band , & quot ; and The Beatles , & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; was the blueprint for this record.Brian Wilson was Blown away after hearing the album.He stopped touring with The Beach Boys , and just wanted to work in the studio. & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is more of a solo record by Brian , and his partner , Tony Asher.When the single , & quot ; Caroline No , & quot ; came out , The Beach Boys name was n't even on the record.The cut bearly made the top 40.No one knew who Brian Wilson was.This is my Second favorite cut from the album. & quot ; God only Knows , & quot ; with Carl Wilson on lead , is unreal , The vocal arangments are perfection , and its one of the first songs to have God in it.This has got to be one of the greatest records ever made . My other favorite cuts are & quot ; You still Believe in me , & quot ; I 'm Waiting for the day , & quot ; and & quot ; I know there 's an answer.The CD comes with a 31 page booklet that tells you all about the recording of the album.I 've been playing this CD for two weeks , and I ca n't get these songs out of my head at night.The Harmonies , the weird sounds , This record is a Classic .	1
PET SOUNDS ... ..hauntingly beautiful , stunningly majestic , fantastically..oh look wait a minute ! ! lets cut to the chase ! ! REPEAT AFTER ME.I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM , I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM ... .or sadly yes youve guessed it it means booking an appointment in the funny farm.Youve probably got SGT PEPPER right ? well this came before and it was instrumental in THE BEATLES recording said masterpiece.BRIAN WILSON never really came near to this quantum leap project again bits of SURFS UP are ok HOLLAND has a few gems but this is the ONE.So ... ..REPEAT AFTER ME I MUST OWN ... ... ... ... ... ...	1
A worthy purchase.Value for money is what this DVD-A is all about.3 versions of this classic album , Video footage and a booklet with good info on the recording process and personel.One thing that I was surprised was the fact hardly any Beach Boy play a note on these tracks.Nevertheless it 's a masterpiece.Worth getting .	1
There 's a reason this is often called one of the best albums ever - it really IS one of the best albums ever.It 's virtually flawless . The music , lyrics , and fantastic harmonious vocals make this an incredible listening experience.Mostly everyone knows the big hits on here like `` Would n't It Be Nice '' and `` God Only Knows . '' I held off on getting `` Pet Sounds '' for years because I already had those and a few of the other songs on other Beach Boys ' compilations . BIG mistake on my part ! One of the great things about `` Pet Sounds '' is hearing it in it 's entirety . The songs flow together perfectly . Also , there are some great songs on here like `` That 's Not Me '' and `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' that were n't popular radio tunes and do n't turn up on the countless Beach Boys `` best of '' compilations that are out there . The songs are totally worth hearing and there 's no better place to get them than right here ! Believe all the hype you 've heard - `` Pet Sounds '' is a fantastic album . If you love great music ( and who does n't ? ) then you 'll love this album .	1
The Beach Boys ' `` Pet Sounds '' is the best sunshine pop ( let alone 60 's pop ) album EVER recorded . This album is SO original and SO cheerful that you ca n't help but love it . The most well-known songs on here are the hits `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , `` Sloop John B . `` , `` God Only Knows '' and `` Caroline No '' , but the other tracks are just as good and interesting . The Beach Boys are famous for their harmonies and vocals , and this album does not disappoint . The musicianship is definitely 60 's , but the audio quality and the instrumentation is perfect . Another great thing about this album is how quotable and interesting the lyrics are - they 're some of the best ever written ! You 'll absolutely love singing along to songs like `` Would n't It Be Nice '' ! Fans of every genre will love this album ( you 'd be hardpressed not to ) , as this is an instant classic . Buy it now ! Highlights include : the entire album	1
You simply ca n't not have this album . It 's ridiculous to imagine a collection without it . This album suits any mood you could be in ( not just & quot ; hey , let 's go to the beach & quot ; ) . It could also help you shift your moods ( especially up ! ) .Just get it , for pity 's sake .	1
Y'all lost me when you declared Pet Sounds as the best album of all time . That 's simply a ridiculous claim , hell I 'll take Black Sabbath 's Paranoid , or Sticky Fingers by the Stones , or Dark Side of The Moon by the Floyd , or Kid A by Radiohead , or XTC 's Nonesuch , or King Crimson 's Discipline , or the Sex Pistols , or Revolver by the Beatles or Axis : Bold as Love by Hendrix and many others ( and we 're just talking about rock here ) before Pet Sounds any day . Now if you 'd said that Pet Sounds was the most influential album of all time I 'd have given a longer pause to reflect . After all XTC would probably never have done Nonesuch which owes a huge debt to the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys and the Beatles would n't have done Sgt . Peppers in order to compete with Brian Wilson 's masterpiece . Pet Sounds became for a brief time in the mid sixties a kind of pop music benchmark and was the most complex and ambitious pop music album of its day . And that ambition , that desire to make rock 'n roll or pop music grander , more musically serious , is Pet Sounds most profound and lasting legacy . A legacy that influenced the Beatles , Moody Blues , King Crimson on up to Pink Floyd and beyond . One could make a case that Pet Sounds was the first progressive rock album . But it does n't really matter if Pet Sounds is the best or most influential album ever made . What does matter is that Pet Sounds is sublime pop music . The lyrics may be slight , so what , the sound of this album is a gorgeous island of melodic and harmonic bliss . It 's just damn beautiful , at times very touching and should n't be missed . Do yourself a favor and check it out .	1
This is a exciting Beach Boys album and this is hailed a rock masterpiece by all the rock critics but they suck but I will recommend it.This album came out in 1966 and even the Beatles said & quot ; How are ye gon na top this mates & quot ; .I give props to Mr.Cranky for his reviews one man with the balls to say what he thinks and everyone is going nuts about it that would be good.1.Would'nt be nice-This one is a classic 10/102.You still believe in me-This one was pretty good 10/103.Thats Not me-This one was entertaining 9/104.Thats Talk ( Put your head on my shoulder ) -Great 10/105.Im wrating for the Day-This one is pretty good 10/106.Go Away for a while-Beautiful instrumental 10/107.Sloop John B-This one is another classic 10/108.God only Knows-This one was called the best song written 10/109.I Know theres Answer-This is short but sweet 10/1010.Here Today-This one was good . 9/1011.I just was n't made for these times-Good 8/1012.Pet Sounds-Another Instrumental that is great 10/1013.Carolina No-This is the last official song 10/10 Has Dogs14.Hold on to your ego-This is a good song 10/1015-27 Crappy Remastered songs my dad likes I don't.This album was produced by Brian Wilson but this should have included Good Vibrations but still it is very good album.Lyrics 10 Production 10 Music 10 Style 10 Voice 10Overall=50/50 Almost a perfect album still sounds Fresh in 04	1
`` No one is educated musically until they 've heard Pet Sounds ... it is a total , classic record that is unbeatable in many ways . '' - Sir Paul McCartneyand here 's another quote ... '' Without Pet Sounds , Sgt . Pepper would n't have happenned ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds . '' - Sir George Martin , Producer , The BeatlesThere you have it folks . Given these references , there is no reason people should doubt the importance and greatness of this work of art . I know what you 're thinking ... you hear the name 'Beach Boys ' and you think of songs like 'Little Deuce Coup , ' 'Surfin ' USA , ' and 'Kokomo , ' right ? Well those songs are corny , and they represent the nostalgia act that the Beach Boys have turned into over the last 30 years or so . 'Pet Sounds ' is Brian Wilson 's labor of love . It represented the direction he wanted to take the band in , which eventually caused confusion and dissagreement within the group.No matter what kind of music you listen to , whether it be Rock , Rap , Metal , Country , or Classical , it is vital that you own PET SOUNDS . Brian Wilson 's writing skills as well as the vocal harmonies throughout can not be matched . The two most popular songs are probably 'Would n't it Be Nice ' and 'God Only Knows . ' Both of these songs have been used in countless movies including 'Roger and Me ' and 'Boogie Nights . ' These songs represent all that is right with the world , and no matter what kind of mood you are in ... no matter what is going on in your life , I promise you this album will cheer you up . I am forever in debt to my good friend Michael Stack who once told me this record would change my life . It did.On a side note , make sure you pick up the version of this record with 27 tracks , which has the entire album in mono and in stereo . Included in this is the bonus track , 'Hang on To Your Ego ' which is just the track 'I Know There 's an Answer ' with some lyrical changes . Apparently , people say that when you eat LSD , you lose your ego . Pay attention to the words ... '' they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night '' This probably gave migraines to record executives at the time , and the band was forced to re-write the track for radio play ! The Beach Boys were supposed to be a wholesome group - not a bunch of guys doing drugs and hanging out with the likes of Charles Manson !	1
I understand why some people do n't like `` Pet Sounds . '' It 's kind of the `` Citizen Kane '' of albums . People hear the rep -- that this is one of the greatest records ever -- and they put it on expecting the direct propulsive creativity of , say , something like `` Sgt . Pepper '' or `` Good Vibrations . '' And what they get is something milder , something innocent , something strangely muted . Then when it 's over they think , `` THAT 'S one of the greatest albums ever ? ? ? `` To an extent , I was one of those people . I got `` Pet Sounds '' when it first hit CD , when I was just about 20 , and I 'd heard all the hype and I definitely liked it ... but at the time I also felt I wanted something more , something that grabbed me by the collar and shook me.But this is not an album that will shake you , at least not violently . An old girlfriend of mine once came into my house while I was listening to this and actually got angry at it : `` This is lullaby music , this is like Sesame Street . Why are you listening to this ? `` I could n't explain it to her anymore than I could explain it to myself but this is an album that almost has to grow on you . The more you listen , the more you learn , the more you live , the better it gets.There is a clutch of albums that I have a tendency to drag out on dark nights of the soul -- Nick Drake 's `` Five Leaves Left , '' `` Beatles for Sale , '' John Coltrane 's `` Soultrane , '' `` Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington , '' `` Astral Weeks , '' `` Dark Side of the Moon , '' `` Imperial Bedroom , '' `` The Band '' and a few others . But this is the one I put on when I just want to sit alone and stare out the window or drive around dark , snowy neighborhoods at night.Anyway , I would never tell anyone , `` Like this album or you are WRONG ! '' But for people who think it 's a sham , I 'd recommend they listen to some key moments and reflect on what they 're hearing : ** The bells and harmonies of `` You Still Believe In Me , '' and particularly the line , `` I wan na cry , '' in which the word cry is given something like 15 lilting syllables . ** The cellos of `` Do n't Talk '' and `` I 'm Waiting for the Day , '' particularly the strings that kick in at the 2:21 mark ( followed by rumbling kettle drums that would make Phil Spector tremble ) . ** All of `` God Only Knows . `` ** The flickering texture of the bass guitar in `` Here Today . `` ** The closing refrain of `` I Just Was n't Made for These Times . `` ** The weird , kitschy sound of the title track . ** Brian 's truly beautiful lead vocal on `` Caroline , No , '' followed by train sounds and vocals by his dogs , Banana and Louie -- maybe the greatest , saddest , most wistful ending of any album ever made .	1
What do you know , the album officially considered The Greatest Of All Time might just be that . I am innately hostile to canons , their systems of values and generally crippling influence - they close down thought rather than encourage it - but I think it 's fair to say that the influence of the Beach Boys , and 'Pet Sounds ' in particular , has inspired most of the great imaginative pop of the last three decades.Considering its reputation for sonic adventurousness , I was expecting something more lush , more sound-heavy , but 'Pet Sounds ' is actually quite austere , effects never promoted at the expense of the beautiful songs . The most dominant feature is that thrilling soul-shuddering thump-drum echoing in vast Spector-al spaces , making intense and urgent great catchy songs like 'I 'm waiting for the day ' , 'I know there 's an answer ' and 'Here today'.There 's a mirroring of types on the album , where similar songs reflect and transform each other : the serene sleepiness of 'Do n't talk ' refracting the shocked tragedy of 'Caroline no ' ; the frustrated dream of 'Would n't it be nice ' and the frustrating intentions of 'Here today '' s narrator . 'Pet sounds ' is one of the great exposes of the male psyche , with its less endearing , more devious and self-serving impulses - 'I 'm waiting for the day ' and 'Here today ' especially . Best of all is the tragi-bathos of 'Sloop John B ' , a male appropriation of the Shangri-La 's ' traumatic pop , made un-tragic by youthful male ridiculousness , yet still moving with its ( and the album 's ? ) refrain 'I want to go home ' .	1
I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius -- and I do mean genius -- Brian Wilson was , and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B , & quot ; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album . & quot ; I 'm Waiting For The Day , & quot ; & quot ; Here Today , & quot ; & quot ; God Only Knows , & quot ; and & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track , & quot ; Caroline No. & quot ; It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric .	1
I collect Beach Boys & this is just another example of the best album The Beach Boys ever put to wax . After they released the CD the first time it contained the mono/stereo versions ( which I prefer the mono ) with a bonus track . Then a box set devoted to the album . Now they release it like the single CD but , with a DVD to further cement this album as one of the best ever released . I highly recommend this one if your looking to check out what the fuss is all about . Search `` Judemac Forever '' on msn .	1
i kind of have to laugh at the `` best album of all time '' discussion . i have my own albums that i consider the best of all time , and they were all made within the last 15 years . but that 's not the point . the point is , is the music great or not ? and i think it is.granted , this album does have some SONGS that you could reasonably call some of the greatest ever ( would n't it be nice , god only knows , i just was n't made for these times ) . the other songs are n't as strong , but they 're good . i do n't listen to pet sounds much because i 'm just not really into the high-vocal , pop sound going on here . regardless , i find the psychology of the album fascinating . it 's commonly referred to as a `` coming of age '' album , and in every song , you can hear brian wilson 's fragile , sensitive personality trying to come to terms with the grown-up world he 's just now experiencing . the very fact that he was able to get something like this across in pop music is pretty amazing . he longs for a perfect romantic world on `` would n't it be nice , '' simulatenously explores the joy of love and the terror of its absence on `` god only knows , '' and mourns the passing of his love and a more innocent worldview on `` caroline , no . `` one song in particular that i love but gets overlooked is `` that 's not me . '' while the vocals sound upbeat , the lyrics portray an absolutely heartbreaking scenario - brian 's out in the big , wild , lonely world , completely removed from the comfort and love of his home , and knows `` that 's not him . '' the lyrics are understated but so sad.the other songs might not be as intense , but they 're fun to sing and well-made . they cover problems brian has with other people , like uptight people with big egos , a girl he waited around for but does n't love him now , and a great warning to `` the new guy '' about his former lover in `` here today . `` the other beach boys did a great job singing on the album , even though they were despicable hacks who treated brian like [ ... ] and butchered these songs in the 80's.while brian 's new `` smile '' album is good , i do n't think it really measures up to the innocence and charm of `` pet sounds .

Most young today people associate The Beach Boys music with surfing , cars , chicks and fun , fun , fun.Thus when the songs , Would n't It Be Nice , Sloop John B , and God Only Knows are recycled for the umpteenth time on a compilation album , it 's easy to overlook the wonderful production , as well as the depth of its parent album Pet Sounds.Since it set the standard for albums for the last 34 years , most seemed lost on its impact.But when you truly listen and get inside these songs that you really experience the beauty of this album.The aforementioned themes are replaced with songs of introspection and more adult themes.Brian Wilson 's need to compete with The Beatles turned into burning creativity as he recorded Pet Sounds with meticulous attention to detail.Using some of Phil Spector 's Wrecking Crew as well as the famed Wall Of Sound technique , the albums complexity was nothing short of amazing.Songs like That 's Not Me , Here Today and Caroline No display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way.Would n't It Be Nice , God Only Knows , and Waiting for the Day are rays of light that seems on the brink of turning into dashed dreams.The Beach Boys harmonies are flawless though since Brian sings most of the leads , you 'd almost think they 're guest stars on their own album.Even for all its accolades , Pet Sounds was deemed a failure back in '66 ( due to the general publics as well as Capitol Records inability to understand and embrace the record ) But over the years it has left the other Beach Boys albums in the dust , as well as accorded its own boxed set.In '66 it seemed way ahead of its time , nowadays it just exist outside of time .	1

Bought this album on reputation ... many critics would have it as the greatest album of all time . The track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critics . Anyway , I took a punt . The cd I have is listed as released in 2001 , and it has the mono version of the album first , then the stereo mix of the album . There is a bonus track too , which is a reworking of one of the songs on the regular album . On first listen I gave this album 77.5/100 . On second listen and after listening to the mono mix as well , it 's difficult to rate . If it had 3 or 4 songs I liked as much as `` Sloop John B '' , then it could be an easy 5/5 . This album would score in the high 80s to 5/5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable ... no more killer tracks , but no dud tracks either . That 's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5/5 too . With a band like The Beach Boys , maybe there is just an expectation of lots of songs up there with their poppy best . On this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf-pop confections . These songs are n't memorable to me , but I can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if I was to dig this album out again . Of course , `` Sloop John B '' is a great cover by the band , which they turned into a masterpiece . Perhaps it 's wrong to expect the other songs to measure up to this ? In any case , this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it ... and maybe easier to score.Overall , the album has many pleasant tracks , with symphonic elements to them at times . Lyrics have depth which their early surf-pop songs do n't have ... not that this was anything but a positive for those early songs . On second listen the album was just an easy listening pleasure , which I 've tended to reward here in the past with high scores . A difficult album to rate ... it 's listenability demands a high score though . Range : 87.5 to 100/100.The all time classic ( `` / '' ) : Sloop John B - iconic intro . Glassy percussion . A killer pop cover of the Caribbean folk song . Has a tuba , I think and great harmonies with good variety in the voices.The best of the rest ... on second listen ( `` > ( . ) '' ) : You still believe in me - bumped this up from a `` [ . ] '' . Nice lead vocal tone and melody . Cello ? Harpsichord ? Has bicycle horn type sound as well.Caroline no - Same bump up as above , but after my third listen , on the mono mix . Has chunky wooden percussion , which is nice . A pleasant track . Harpsichord , big bass notes and a pretty woodwind type of instrument . The outro features a train and barking dogs.Then ( `` [ . ] '' ) : Would n't it be nice - album opener . Iconic lead guitar melody intro . Brass . Good stereo balance ( albums of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capabilities and did n't often do stereo well by today 's standards ) .I know there 's an answer - catchy piano , tambourine and a tuba type instrument . Double bass plays in a jazzy kind of a way . Symphonic drums . Thoughtful lyrics and a catchy chorus.On second listen ( `` > [ . ] '' ) : Do n't talk ( put your head on my shoulder ) - was hoping that this was a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad . It 's not . Only has one of the Beach Boys singing on this track . Features organ , bass , piano , violins and cymbal percussion.Let 's go away for a while - a pleasant , experimental instrumental . Drums and symphonic drums . Piano , brass , violins , twangy string instrument and xylophone ( ? ) , God only knows - horn , bass , sleigh bells ( ? ) , interesting tone to the percussion , some sort of keyboard effect , violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the Boys.Here today - piano , tuba , tambourine , symphonic elements like brass . Double bass note picking . Catchy verse ( ? ) parts ... I mean like the opening vocal melody.On third listen ! ( `` > [ . ] '' ) : I 'm waiting for the day - interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic elements feature as well . Quiet parts alternate with with percussive passages , which is a little bit catchy.I just was n't made for these times - bass notes , harpsichord ( ? ) , interesting percussion tones at times ... ( bongos ? ) , symphonic drums at times , woodwind ? I think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which was often used in the 1950s ... the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci-fi type noises ... I forget what you call those ! The rest : That 's not me - organ , dual lead guitar , aboriginal percussion sticks sound , bass drum ( ? ) , reflective lyrics . Interesting.Pet sounds - instrumental with symphonic elements . Maracas , brass ... including a tuba , twangy lead guitar , bass , interesting drum tone and a tambourine , I think.Hang on to your ego - A bonus track . Very similar to `` I know there 's an answer '' . Wikipedia 's entry for the album version states that this bonus track was the original version , but there were concerns about supposed drug related themes ... as in the title ! Personally , I ca n't see it ! Recommendations ... easy listening classics : Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac ( 2nd self-titled album ) , RumoursGenesis - From Genesis to RevelationThe Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico , The Velvet Underground .	1
Once ranked the greatest album of all time - I think it 's a solid 9 and love the beach boys sound - but GOAT I would disagree .	1
The Beach Boys said it time and again : That The Beatles were their inspiration to keep writing good songs and produce better music ( if only such competition existed in today 's sick joke of a music market ... ) and Pet Sounds was inspired by , in my opinion , The Boys ' best album , Rubber Soul ( a record that was n't heavy on the studio tricks as its close second , Revolver , was ) .America was , by 1966 , still searching for a homegrown answer to top the boys from Britain , and Pet Sounds was supposed to be it . A group that made its mark on the charts by singing about the beach and how superior one state 's women ( probably , again , from the beach ) were to women from the rest of the country were supposed to be the answer . I do n't think so . ( Yeah , yeah , The Beatles sung about teenybopper love in the beginning of their careers but they progressed quite nicely . ) I listened to Pet Sounds quite a few times with an open mind and the only three songs I wound up liking were the ones I liked before : Would n't It Be Nice , Sloop John B , and God Only Knows ( which Paul McCartney , I believe , called one of the prettiest songs he ever heard ) . It did n't grow on me and I wish I could have liked it more.I do n't take away Brian Wilson 's producing capabilities but The Beatles they were not nor could ever be .	1
This album is well known as Brian Wilson 's masterpiece , but it 's also Carl Wilson 's masterpiece . There are many collections of The Beach Boys ' greatest hits out there , and they 're worth having , but `` Pet Sounds '' is worth having no matter what else you may own . It was made as a single album during the age of hit singles , and it will blow your mind as a single album . Just listen to it straight thru without interruption .	1
Unless you 're an avid reader of Rolling Stone 's retrospective issues , you could easily forget that the Beach Boys were once a great band comparable to the Beatles and that Brian Wilson was considered a musical genius . Certainly the copious notes included in the CD booklet here will vouch for that viewpoint . With Wilson finally completing his legendary `` Smile '' recording after a 37-year break , interest in the band 's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sales , especially for this album , long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career . Inspired by the Beatles ' `` Rubber Soul '' , Wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational songs together . He succeeded.With their soaring , yearning harmonies and sunny California dispositions intact , `` Pet Sounds '' is still great and made all the more resonant by its sophisticated instrumental arrangements and Wilson 's creative musical invention . Songs like `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , `` God Only Knows '' , `` I Just Was n't Made for These Times '' and `` Caroline No '' remain classics that go far beyond the aging Gidget set and showcase their amazing abilities as a vocal group . The title track and the especially esoteric `` Lets Go Away for Awhile '' unearth Wilson 's talent for multi-tracking and embracing different musical styles without sacrificing the sound that was essentially the band 's own . This CD contains a bonus track , `` Hang On To Your Ego '' , which is actually an alternate take of `` I Know There 's an Answer '' , and for die-hard fans , the whole album is repeated in stereo . I still prefer the original mono recordings as they have the pop and crackle that captures a more innocent time in recording , a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the Fab Four in creative output . Whereas the Beatles retired amid inner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy , the Beach Boys languished into a parody of themselves as Wilson was facing demons of his own . But at least there is this one album to treasure .	1
And not just for the more recognized songs like `` would n't it be nice '' and `` god only knows '' . The majority of songs are pretty mellow and understated , but they sure leave an impact . I 'll just say that no album collection is complete without this gem .	1
Everyone else here seems to be doing it , so here I go . First , I think the title of greatest album and greatest rock album are totally different . Pet Sounds does not rock as much as the Beatles albums thrown into this discussion ( Rubber Soul , Revolver , SGT Pepper ) . Of those , I 'd say Revolver rocks the most , easily earning the title of greatest rock album . Then you 've got Pet Sounds and Sgt . Pepper ... ..bringing new sounds and concepts into popular music , wonderfully orchestrated . I consider both of these to be art more than rock , though they do have their moments . I 'd call it a toss up , if it werent for the one track that stands outside of the `` performance '' of SGT Pepper 's LHCB ... ..A Day in the Life . That album closer is enough to push SGT Pepper over the edge as the greatest ( general ) music album ever recorded . As much of a genius as Brian Wilson was , he was no substitute for the combined creative efforts of John , Paul , George , and Ringo .	1
I ca n't really say that I 'm a huge Beach Boys fan . I do n't particularly care for surf music or a lot of the Beach Boys ' music for that matter . Lately I 've been on a music kick on checking out albums that was on VH1 's 100 Greatest Rock and Roll Albums list . First the Beatles , then Madonna , now the Beach Boys.I was stunned by the beauty of what I heard on & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . The Beach Boys goes beyond their traditional surf sound by exploring the sounds of pop and rock . & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is the band 's & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; as noted in the liner notes , maybe not in those exact words but that is what Brian Wilson was aiming for and he got the results what he wanted . The songs are simply amazing . Next to The Beatles ' & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; and & quot ; Revolver & quot ; , I have n't heard music as pure as & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . All the songs took my breath away , especially & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; . & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; also makes for a wonder summertime album to listen to , so carefree and easy going to listen to . A real rock and roll masterpiece .	1
... ... ..is the greatest & # 34 ; RnR & # 34 ; album ever made . A 24 year old genius put together the most symphonic piece of & # 34 ; ear-candy & # 34 ; ; and , the label just dumped & # 34 ; sand & # 34 ; on it and washed it out to sea . This is the most under-appreciated album ( a real tragedy ) . Brian Wilson became rock n ' roll 's first artistic martyr .	1
It 's pretty tough writing a review for an album where it appears that everything that can be said about this album has been said . However , if Brian Wilson had that attitude about songwriting before doing & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; , then we would n't be listening to it , right ? So here 's my two cents : If you have the mono mix of this album , it is worth the extra money to upgrade to this CD . The stereo mix brings out the Boys ' voices to their fullest . It will fill up you car or your home stereo much better than the mono version.Pop ( or rock ) music can be sophisticated , but still be accessible , attract new generations of music fans and reward repeated listenings , like & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . If you were to believe the critics of 2000 , you would think that & quot ; Kid A & quot ; by Radiohead just passed & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; in the music department . Do n't believe it . In another 35 years , & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; will still be revered and loved by new generations , while & quot ; Kid A & quot ; will probably be looked at with disdain , a pompous monstrosity , much like the the works of Emerson , Lake and Palmer are looked at now in '00.Oh yeah , the music on here is great ! Unlike their earlier hits , which are badly overplayed on the homogenized , baby-boomer oldies stations , the songs here never seem to get tiresome . It 's kind of like a hazy summer day at a tropical beach , with dark thunderclouds on the horizon , at least for me . Any fan of rock or pop music should have this CD in their collection , without question . Once you have it , the recent Brother Years compilation ( 1970-86 ) will make a fascinating bookend for & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . It does show that & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; dwarfed nearly everything else the Beach Boys did afterward , even though there were some interesting stops along the decline .	1
This album along with contemporaries `` Forever Changes '' , `` Revolver '' , `` Sgt . Pepper 's ... '' has always held a very special place in my heart . These albums like true classics never get old and even listening to them so many times over so many years these albums always manage to reach me . The sad thing about `` Pet Sounds '' though is that unlike the other albums mentioned above which have been mixed well and have sounded really good post remastering this album has at best an average quality level of mixing which makes it really difficult to get a very good sounding version of `` Pet Sounds '' despite numerous attempts at trying to get this album to achieve its sonic potential . If only George Martin produced/mixed this album ! I 've owned many versions of this and prior to this release the best sounding version I 've heard was an old made in Holland stereo mix version which I have since sold and regretted as I 've yet to find `` Trombone Dixie '' anywhere else on a single cd version of the whole album as a bonus track like that version did.I do n't have an SACD player and so I may update this later once I spin it on my friend 's player soon but even on a standard cd player this version while is very good with respect to previous releases given the original mix is n't the best sounding when compared with restored/remastered releases of it contemporaries mentioned above . The cardboard gatefold packaging is very nice though and would interest collectors of mlps releases although strictly speaking this is not a true replica of the original vinyl sleeve . Also included is a 20 page colour booklet with all the lyrics and a Mark Linett essay.Mofi did the best that they could with the material that they had to work with but this is certainly not a reference-quality audio experience . In short , this release may just be the best version of the album that is currently out there but it is certainly not the best sounding mofi release.Still recommended !	1
Undeniably the Beach Boys masterpiece . This is an album that has transcended the years and will still be played and enjoyed hundreds of years from now . Brian Wilson , inspired by The Beatles & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; album , set to work , along with some help from Tony Asher to create one of the most amazing pop records ever made . The digital remastering is excellent , ... these songs sound wonderful . And the 24 page book is great . Includes notes by Brian Wilson , loads of photos , track-by-track notes , and a 6 page essay by David Leaf on The Beach Boys and the making of this album . My version has 3 bonus tracks & quot ; Unreleased Backgrounds & quot ; , & quot ; Hang on to Your Ego & quot ; and & quot ; Trombone Dixie & quot ; . This album belongs in all good music collections .	1
No question , one of wonders of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo , with an amazing soundstage . Mark Linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi-tracks to this album . I 've heard things I 've never heard in the hundred times I 've listened to the mono Pet Sounds . Putting the mono and stereo versions back to back really shows the aural difference.For all that refuse to accept the stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige , hey , you have the mono version . But you are really depriving yourself.This classic got a whole lot better . For those of you that are Beatles fans as well , we can only dream of the Beatles work getting the same treatment .	1

IF IT DOES N'T MAKE YOU CRY , THEN YER PROBOBLY SOME FACIST CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT TYPE WHO DOES N'T UNDERSTAND GREAT ART ANYWAY AS YOU CLAIM YOU DO ! BUY IT !	1
A great recording takes the thoughts and feelings of the artist and creates with them a work that enables the listener to say `` I 've been there ... I know EXACTLY what they mean '' . For the 40 some minutes `` Pet Sounds '' plays , I *am* Brian Wilson ... .The disc encompasses the full range of human emotion : the wide eyed innocence of `` Would n't it Be Nice ? `` , isolation ( `` I Just Was n't Made for these Times '' ) , gratitude ( `` You Still Believe in Me '' ) , longing ( `` I 'm Waiting for the Day '' ) , infatuation ( `` Do n't Talk ( Put your Head on my Shoulder '' ) , insecurity ( `` That 's Not me '' ) , homesickness ( `` Sloop John B . `` ) , envy ( `` Let 's Go Away for Awhile '' ) , desperation ( `` God Only Knows '' ) , benevolence ( `` I Know There 's an Answer '' ) , pity ( `` Here Today '' ) , disillusionment ( `` Caroline No '' ) and the devil-may-care ebullience of youth ( `` Pet Sounds '' ) .When someone tells me they 've listened to this and did n't like it , I really begin to question their humanity . EVERYONE needs a copy of this in their home .	1
This album was made at the same time as Sgt . Pepper and was a unique because it has mono or stereo versions of the songs on the album with different types of songs . Pet Sounds is like Sgt . Pepper except that the Beatles had more unique albums and on most of the songs , the Beach Boys sound like themselves instead of Beatles albums where the Beatles sound different on different songs . Classic Beach Boys songs on here include `` God Only Knows '' `` Would n't It Be Nice '' `` Sloop John B '' `` Caroline No . '' to name a few . Another bonus track `` Hang on to your Ego '' is great as well . This is a must for any Beach Boys fan .	1
It 's true this is one of the best albums of all time . I 'm not sure if I 'd call it the second best album ever ( Rolling Stone ) , but it is amazing . Even though & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; as a whole is great , it 's the hits that really stand-out , which include & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; , & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; , and & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; . But I also really like & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; and & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; . Other than being a classic among classics , this disc also includes the bonus track & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; , and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27 . For all these reasons I highly recommend getting & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . At least you should see what all the fuss is about .	1
I can remember when my older sister ( a Beach Boys fan ) bought Pet sounds when it first came out in 1966 . I asked her if it was as good as their other ones . She replied that it was too slow and that there were only one or two good songs on it . As a result of her negative assessment , I did not listen to this album for over 20 years ! When I finally heard it , I realized that my sister was hoping for more surfing music . What Brian WIlson gave the world was a great pop album which shows that , as a composer , he was right up there with Bacharach and Lennon/McCartney . This album is understated . There are few bells and whistles . Some of the best ballads have to grow on you . But it is , consistently , of such high quality that it eventually becomes a favorite of most lovers of pop music . Wilson 's production is amazing . His writing just soars . The vocals can make you swoon . It is an album to discover and re-discover again and again . If you are looking for a rocking album , you may be disappointed . If you are interested in finding out that Wilson could write pop music as well as Jimmy Webb , McCartney ( who rates this as his favorite album ) , Burt Bacharach , definitely get this album and listen to it over and over . Amazingly , it is one of the few albums from the sixties that has not dated at all . It sounds as if it could have been released last summer ! Barely noticed at the time it was released , its reputation grows with each passing year as one of the greatest albums of all time . Heartfelt , moving , gorgeous .	1
Has no one else noticed ? What amazes me about this , one of my all time favorite albums of all time.The Beach Boys only sing on it . They play absolutely no instruments on it.Produced by Brain Wilson & Phil Specter . They can make anyone sound this good.At least The Beatles played on Sgt . Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band , did n't they ? And golly gee , Paul McCartney did get so upset the way Phil Specter produced Let It Be .	1
This album is a classic masterpiece ! ! ! One of the best albums of all time ! ! ! Two thumbs up ! ! ! Five Stars ! ! ! A+	1
Brian Wilson envisioned this album as his masterpiece , and he 's right . This album showed a side of the Beach Boys we had not yet experienced . Songs from the heart , the tight harmonies , and a beauty that few knew they were capable ofall graced the mono grooves of the original LP . Brian initially intended this album to be released only in mono , so he could have more control over what the listener heard . There was a `` Duophonic '' fake stereo version , but it sounded just that way . When the original multitrack master tapes were found , the process to create the stereo version was painstaking , but was well worth the effort . Now , those same master tapes allowed for the creation of a new , 4.1 surround version . I say 4.1 because the center channel is not used for the most part . But in the same way the stereo version added new textures to the sound , so does the surround mix . While it may have its critics , the combination of the surround sound and high resolution 24 bit , 96 kHz digital sound makes for a new experience with this fine album . Hats off to the folks at Capitol , and to the engineers who did such a bang-up job of making a great album even better . For those who do n't yet have a DVD-Audio player , the DTS track is highly recommended .	1
The Beach Boys/ Pet Sounds ( The complete Albums in Stereo & Mono ) : This is a beautiful and absolutely classic album . This particular single CD version of it gives us both the Mono and Stereo mixes . Both are great . I originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual albums by the Beach Boys . I wanting instead a good compilation but , having been disappointed with the five-disk history set , I turned to the original albums . I had the old LP of Pet Sounds many years ago and this CD is a revelation of brilliance and clarity . I could not be happier with this CD , and am glad that I was not forced to buy the multi-disk Pet Sounds Sessions in order to own the album . Highly Recommended .	1
PET SOUNDS is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmonies and melodies . Each song is an incredibly well-crafted set piece , individual masterpieces when heard separately . The problem is when they are put together in this package , there is a sameness to the songs . Found in the heart of each song is a gentle , haunting melody without an edge . The songs move seamlessly from one to another and this actually works to their disadvantage ; they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting . Unlike SMILE , where Wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze , PET SOUNDS is a pleasent and sweet series of songs , I enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement .	1
Like many people , I did not discover what by many is considered the greatest rock & amp ; roll album of all-time until the Beach Boys had passed into the 'Nostalgia Oldies ' genre ... what a tremendous loss for me . I had heard for years about what a masterpiece this record was , and to be frank , I only thought that music written by Beethoven and Mozart could earn that status -- boy was I WRONG . Brian Wilson , one of the strangest songwriters of our time , has penned something truly magical . When someone like Paul McCartney says that this is his favorite album of all-time , that certainly says a LOT.As many before have noted , there are many reasons why 'Pet Sounds ' is great , in fact , there are as many different reasons as there are different types of people , but there is one thing that we ALL agree on : This album is truly a phenomenon unto itself . Almost nothing compares to it ( all serious music lovers will understand and agree ) and comparing 'Sgt . Pepper ' ( another great album -- but also the most overrated Beatles ' album ) to 'Pet Sounds ' is kinda like comparing the first World War to the Gulf War ... they were as different as can possibly be.I in particular enjoyed both versions of these songs . Many wonder why they were originally recorded in Mono when Stereo was widely considered the way to go ... Brian Wilson was virtually deaf in one ear , so he could n't even HEAR it stereo , and therefore concentrated on the minor details , the things which really made his production superior to virtually everybody in the recording business . In short , there is almost nothing I could add to what has already been said about this musical masterpiece . Anyone who truly appreciates music and does NOT go into listening to 'Pet Sounds ' expecting to hear a bunch of 'Surf Tunes ' will be surprisingly disappointed -- at FIRST . After a few listens however , the true genius behind this audio treasure will begin to show itself ... and the more you listen , the more you appreciate . In other words , buy , open , listen and enjoy . Repeat .	1
Pet Sounds is one of those albums that you just sit and listen to and say & quot ; My God , these guys were truly amazing & quot ; . Brian Wilson was so far ahead of his time in regards to songwriting . I do n't however recommend this album to everyone . This album is not & quot ; packed & quot ; with hits , but it is far better than most anything you would buy today . If you are looking for a more radio friendly BBalbum , go with the greatest hits Vol . 1 . But if you have a little extra cash , but this and see why so many contemporary artists believe that this is one of the best albums ever made .	1
A caveat - the 5 stars are for the music . 4 stars for pressing ! Re : Pet Sounds and OK Computer Capitol vinyl reissues : These are better than the abysmal ( imo based on disraeli gears and tea for the tillerman ) `` back to black '' reissues.both the capitol reissue of ok computer and of pet sounds that i bought today are dead quiet and neither suffer from obvious digitalis . they do not sound as if they were recorded using the cd as the source , which many people have felt about the b to b pressings.the lead vocal on pet sounds is a tiny bit on the bright side ( though it may simply be more revealing of whats there - and my system is extremely revealing and cuts no slack in this direction ) , but it 's not brittle like tea for the tillerman is in places in the b to b series . comparing this mono pet sounds to the generally well thought of 1999 mono cap reissue i am hearing slightly better defined detail and slightly increased bass . the more distinct detail may proove to be an improvement or a detrement in the long run . i have to get used to it before i 'll be sure which i prefer ; but i sure as heck prefer the silence of this vinyl to every pressing i 've ever owned of pet sounds . its just great to hear no distracting noises during the oh so many sublime moments that Brian Wilson created for us ! this pressing of ok computer is more dynamic than my uk parlaphone which til now has been my preferred pressing . i have never been wowed by any vinyl or cd of ok c. it aint a sonic pleasure like the radio head lps that have come after it . this does not reverse that assessment of its sound quality ( the recording quality of ok c is what it is ) , but this does seem to be an improvement , at least a bit.certainly compared to the huge bummer that the back to black series offers , and especially as many of us have been afraid that it foretold that this was all the big record companies were prepared to offer , this comes as a positive tasting of the capitol reissue waters.so , at first listen i 'd say these will at minimum fill the void for those not having quiet ( or any ) copies of these titles and perhaps bring some small improvements for those lacking pristine wlp 's or first pressings . of course the rest of this series may be all over the place by comparison . this is a very hopeful 1st sampling though .	1
This is Pop Music at its more beautiful . A genial vocal work with the correct melody . If & quot ; Revolver & quot ; ( The Beatles 's masterpiece ) was considered the best album of the XX century , I should say that & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is problably the natural rival for that album.Essential for any CD 's collection . Superb !	1
I 've always been deeply torn over `` Pet Sounds '' . For decades it has been regarded as a foundational album in rock history , and to some degree I agree with this . Brian Wilson , Paul McCartney and John Lennon were the visionary rock and roll artists who decided to write songs about more controversial topics than surfing with girls and driving cars fast , and `` Pet Sounds '' was unquestionably Wilson 's artistic peak . So it would only serve to follow that the album should fall into the position of legend . And it has . Rolling Stone logged it as # 2 , behind only `` Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' , in its 2003 ranking of rock 's all time best albums.So what 's the dilemma ? I 've always been deeply troubled by awarding the term `` legend '' to an album that does n't meet with significant consumer response . I know that can be dangerous , because some albums are so far ahead of their time that commercial success is n't ready for it . Some would argue that this was the fate of `` Pet Sounds '' , but I 'm unconvinced . Two songs , `` Would n't It Be Nice '' and `` Sloop John B '' , hit the top 10 , and `` God Only Knows '' also was a top 40 hit . So the public still was ready for the Beach Boys sound ; they just did n't buy this album in droves.And therein lays my concern . A band that was as well established as the Beach Boys were not able to bring the public along with it as it progressed from hitmakers to serious musicians . And other artists have been clearly able to bring the public with them . The Beatles did it with `` Sergeant Pepper '' . The Rolling Stones did it with `` Let It Bleed '' . Pink Floyd did it with `` Dark Side Of The Moon '' . And in this millennium , Green Day did it with `` American Idiot '' . So most certainly , a shift in lyrical topics can be navigated successfully without a total sacrifice of success . I can accept that album sales were not as brisk for rock acts in the mid-1960 's , but `` Pet Sounds '' charted a lower peak ( # 10 ) than 10 of the 11 Beach Boys albums that came before it . Lyrical shifts are not just topical , but timely - and the audience of the Beach Boys was simply not ready for this album . So the question continues to rage - and I still do n't see this album as a true legend .	1
I remember the first time I ever heard 'Pet Sounds . ' I was sitting at a beach house in Delaware , just relaxing , and I decided to pop in a copy of 'Pet Sounds ' that I just purchased not too long ago ( at the time ) . I shut my eyes , popped the CD in the player , and entered another universe . I was moved to tears ( and it takes a LOT for me to cry ) . This record completely changed my life.It has taken me forever to write a review on Amazon for 'Pet Sounds , ' simply because I could n't quite find the words to describe Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys ' 1966 masterpiece . I still ca n't honestly . But I 'm going to try . But first , in case you do n't already understand the background of this record , allow me to `` clue you in . `` In the early 1960s , The Beach Boys consisted of Mike Love , Brian Wilson , Dennis Wilson , Carl Wilson , and David Marks . This lineup released three records from 1962-1963 , all consisting of `` fun in the sun '' -esque songs , revolving around the surf , sun , cars , and girls . These records symbolized the California surf sound . Marks left the group in 1963 , replaced by original member Al Jardine ( although both were in the group at the same time , it was soon obvious that Jardine was going to dominate the rhythm guitar spot -- Jardine had been in the group during its earliest incarnation but left in late-1961 to pursue dentistry , only to return less than two years later ) . With this lineup change , the group slowly moved towards a more complex sound and added tighter vocal harmonies . In 1964 , Brian Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown , and stopped touring . The group initially replaced Wilson on the road with future country and television star Glen Campbell on the road , but this was no long term solution . The group released one final album with the five-piece , 'The Beach Boys Today ! ' before adding Bruce Johnston to the touring lineup as Brian Wilson 's replacement , and , as it turned out , in the studio as well.In 1965 , the group released 'Summer Days ( And Summer Nights ! ! ) , ' which is perhaps the precursor to what was to come a year later . This record proved to be their best yet , and showed The Beach Boys maturing as vocalists and lyricists . But even in '65 , nobody could have predicted what was to occur a year later.That 's the history lesson.Brian Wilson was the visionary behind this record . And his vision shines through brilliantly here , to say the least . The vocal harmonies on this record are otherworldly . There are simply no words to describe just how brilliant 'Pet Sounds ' is . 'Would n't it Be Nice , ' 'Sloop John B , ' and 'God Only Knows ' are the `` radio hits '' ( notice the quotations -- this really is n't a radio-friendly record by any means ) from this album , but these are only part of the mystique of 'Pet Sounds . 'Listen to the haunting harmonies on 'You Still Believe in Me , ' and the creative use of sounds by Brian . A honking horn ? Brilliant . Mike Love turns out one of his best vocal performances on 'That 's Not Me . ' To those who say that Mike Love ca n't sing , listen to 'That 's Not Me ' again . His vocals here are emotional and almost flawless , and Brian 's vocals in the chorus are also just brilliant . I 've always loved the guitar sound in the chorus here as well.The instrumentals are also great . 'Let 's Go Away for Awhile ' is a dreamy , mysterious piece that features none of The Beach Boys playing on it ( this includes Brian Wilson ) . Wilson arranges it and does it perfectly , but take note that he does not actually participate in the playing . I 've always loved the vibraphones on here . This is a neat instrumental . The title track is also quite imaginative , featuring the banging of Coca-Cola cans for percussion . The guitar sound on here is great , as are all of the multiple percussion tracks . This track is extremely complex , and packs a lot into it for a song under 4 minutes . 'Here Today ' is another fine performance by Love . This is a love song , and it is probably one of the few tracks here ( besides the `` radio hits '' ) that the strictly `` fun-in-the-sun '' Beach Boys fans could relate to . While I 'll always prefer Love 's vocals on 'That 's Not Me , ' he still sings wonderfully here , and should be praised for his vocal delivery.And then there are the tearjerkers . 'Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) ' is , in my opinion , the most beautiful piece of music ever found on any modern record of any genre . Period . Brian Wilson 's vocals here are as close to flawless as one could ever hope to hear . The string arrangements in the middle of the track are perfect , and just suit the track perfectly . Hal Blaine 's ever-so-light tapping on cymbal is just perfect for this track . More so than any other track on the record , this song creates a mood . It 's slow , romantic , and thought-provoking . This may very well be the most perfect track ever put on tape . And I mean that . 'I Just Was n't Made for These Times ' is also mind-bogglingly beautiful . If you are n't moved by Brian 's vocal delivery and the harmonies contained in the middle section , there is something seriously wrong with you ( or you are soulless ) . 'Caroline No ' has always been my personal favorite track on the record . While it is n't the most beautiful song on the record , it certainly could be on any other record . Brian 's vocals are gut-wrenching and just perfect . You can feel almost every emotion he is trying to convey . You feel the heartbreak in his voice , and it almost stings . But it is also quite beautiful , and the arrangement could not be more perfect.The hits on this record are also perfect . 'Sloop John B ' is an old folk song that Bud & Travis had recorded a few years ago , as had The Kingston Trio . Al Jardine had the idea to put a folk song on the record for a balance . Brian , at first reluctant , agreed , and radically altered the track for the record . This song was a radio hit back in 1966 , and while I have read that the track is out of place on the record , I could not disagree more . I think the track is perfect here , as it gives the record a lighter track , despite the song 's message being rather sad . ( This song would have also fit perfectly on 'Summer Days ' in my opinion ) . 'Would n't it Be Nice ' has been played many times , and is still a concert staple for all three current touring lineups of The Beach Boys . Tony Asher 's lyrics here are great , and Wilson 's voice is also in top shape . This song conveys a message of optimism , and is a perfect love song and the ultimate record opener . 'God Only Knows ' was one of Carl Wilson 's first vocal performances , and it also remains one of his best . Wilson would perform this song in concert with The Beach Boys right up until his death in February 1998 . The backing track is perfect , and the harmonies that Brian , Carl , and Bruce Johnston share on the track are just gorgeous.Lastly , 'I Know There 's an Answer ' could be interpreted as Brian 's take on LSD . It 's an interesting track , and it does surprisingly fit on this record . The backing track is extremely complex , featuring a tambourine as its driving rhythm . It 's quite interesting . It 's not a beauty like some of the other tracks here , but it is certainly a very cool track.The bonus tracks are also neat . 'Trombone Dixie ' appears on some additions . Portions of this track ( you can call them `` recycled bits '' ) would later show up on later albums ( as backing tracks ) . 'Hang On to Your Ego ' is simply the original version of 'I Know There 's an Answer ' before Mike Love made Brian Wilson and Tony Asher change the lyrics due to its obvious drug references.The years following 1966 would see some good times ( 'Good Vibrations , ' released at the end of the year would reach # 1 , the last Beach Boys track to do so in America until 1988 ) and bad times ( the shelving of the 'SMiLE ' album until November 2011 , Brian Wilson 's breakdown , the disappearance of The Beach Boys on the American charts ) . But one thing is for sure -- 'Pet Sounds ' is brilliant . I think it is the greatest album ever made , and it is probably also my favorite album ever made . It is beautiful , moving , interesting , complex , intricate , gorgeous , and flawless . It is very well engineered and very well played ( featuring some of the best session musicians in the business , including drummer Hal Blaine , guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Carol Kaye ) . This record is a masterpiece that must be owned by all serious music fans.I do n't care if you like The Beach Boys or not . If you do n't own 'Pet Sounds , ' you do n't have a collection of music that is worthy of mentioning . Plain and simple . Words can not describe just how brilliant this record really is . Millions have tried to sing its praises ( like I am trying to do now ) , but there really are n't words adequate enough to describe just how wonderful this record is . This is more than a record -- it is almost a religious experience in its own right.Five stars is not worthy of a record like this . Infinite stars are needed to even *come close* to describing how brilliant this album is . Buy this album IMMEDIATELY if you do n't own it already . Buy it and prepare to be blown away by the sheer brilliance that is 'Pet Sounds . '	1
This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys ' masterpiece , and who am I to disagree ? You might say that this was the band 's peak , but I would say that they actually peaked with the `` Good Vibrations '' single after this . But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint . This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics , and rightly so . If you ca n't appreciate how great this album is , I feel sorry for you .	1
For years , I often read about what a wonderful album this truly was . I was , like millions of others , well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorites Would n't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. I often planned to purchase this CD , but I never got around to it until a few months ago.After watching VH1 's 100 Greatest Rock-and-Roll Albums of All Time , I witnessed that after the votes of many fans and critics were tallied , Pet Sounds came in at an astounding Number 3 , only behind Nirvana 's Nevermind and The Beatles ' Revolver , and the additional commentaries provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must-have.It is interesting that both The Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds and The Beatles ' Revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966 . These two works alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top-notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical productions.Lately , as a longtime Beatles fan on one hand and as a person who has come to highly admire the genius of Brian Wilson on the other , I have been comparing Pet Sounds with Revolver . Yes , I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance . However , I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more . Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so.Throughout their careers , the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one . In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens . To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain : 1 . How successful and well-received would The Beach Boys ' Smile , the highly anticipated follow-up that never came to exist , have been ? and 2 . What if Brian Wilson had a prolific partner within his group just as McCartney had Lennon ?	1
`` Pet Sounds '' is the Beach Boys masterpiece , some kind of reply to the contemporary folk rock music trend at the time . Beach Boys previous music had been mostly about summer , sun , beach and surf but finally Brian Wilson decided to get serious and write songs about more deep and personal issues . This album is considered among the best of all time and it did influent many others in the future . The sound of this album was very unique when it came out and it 's a beauty to the ear aswell . Folkish sound with the classic Beach Boys sound singing in voices.After the Beatles `` Rubber Soul '' was released Wilson wanted to reply to that and that 's what he did here in his own way ofcourse , the music in the mid 60 's had changed alot from the early part . It 's difficult to not comapre the two albums though , some people even rate this as the greatest of all albums , agead of Rubber Soul and Abbey Road , I do n't . Rubber Soul was the most influentual album for rock music in the 60 's but Abbey Road is my favorite album . I do n't think we should compare the albums with each others actuall . Beatles is Beatles , and Beach Boys is Beach Boys . The Reason I 'll only give 4 stars however is that I feel that there is n't enough variety on this album . Most songs if not all were Wilson pennned and most songs are emotional midtempo or ballads . With Beatles , there were atleast 3 diffrent writers on most albums and the music they made at this time were more contemporary rock infleunted and most songs sounded very diverse aswell and gave them many more hits then `` Pet Sounds '' did , which only had 2 big hits `` Would n't it be Good '' and `` Sloop John B '' . I 'm not trying to take anything away from this album though , it 's a very good album on it 's own right.There are many good songs here . `` Would n't it be Good '' one of a few uptempo songs here and a big hit aswell . `` That 's not me '' and `` Do n't Talk '' are both good balalds . `` I 'm waiting for the Day '' is a midtempo folk rock song . `` Let 's Go Away for a While '' is instrumental . `` Sloop John B '' is a midtempo song and also a major hit . `` God only Knows '' is a great ballad , and `` Here Today '' reminds me abit of `` Good Vibration '' based on the musical backround in the beginning and in the end it actually sound very much like `` Eye of the Tiger '' from Survivor . `` Hang on to Your Ego '' is a uptempo song aswell with great instruments.Overall , a great 60 's album worth your time , with quite a few top hits that influented the contemporary music back then .	1
The best way to listen to Pet Sounds according to Brian Wilson- is with a pair of headphones in the dark ... that way you will hear every detail . It is the details within it it that make it so special . And there is a lot here that will move you even beyond God Only Knows and Would n't It Be Nice- both PERFECT songs . Wilson has created a wall of sound that is light years ahead of Phil Spector- and that is saying an awful lot . Brian 's brilliance continued with Smile- complete or not- reaching absolute POP PERFECTION AGAIN with Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villains . Lightening has struck multiple times in Brian 's studio . Having the tracks in stereo is VERY SPECIAL . We are still waiting for that experience with Good Vibrations and I Get Around ( except for the live version from 1964 ) .I want to point out though that if you think that this is the only absolute materpiece from the Beach Boys though that you have a lot more listening to do . There are tons of them . Friends , 20/20 , Today ! , Smiley Smile ( unfinished or not ) - the list goes on and on . These albums are so good and there are so many little known gems on them that I am starting to really think that the BEach Boys may have been even better than the Beatles . And I am a HUGE Beatles fan . If you want to be blown away get Today ! and listen to all of the ballads ... all sung by Brian . Music does n't get any better than this .	1
People tend to glorify their rock and roll idols . We think that `` genious '' is just as fitting a word for a Tool album as it is for advances in heart surgery . We look more fondly upon Bono and Bruce Springsteen than we do our own fathers . Some pretend that rock can really save the world when deep down , we all know it ca n't . Reason is not always the music lovers ally , myself included.Having said that , I do n't find anything wrong with giving proper credit where it 's due . So I can say , without any reserve , justification , or apology , that this album is perfect . Every note . From the psychedelic piano/rain effects of `` Would n't it Be Nice '' to the sobering , lovelorn `` Caroline No . '' It is amazing what we humans can create . `` I Know There 's an Answer '' seems to ask if there 's something more , while Brian Wilson tries to convince us he `` just was n't made for these times . '' `` Sloop John B '' is one of the greatest singles of all-time . And though I know I 'm not the first to mention `` God Only Knows '' as being the first rock song to mention God in its title , you 'll have a hard time convincing me that I 'm not the most dismayed that we 're approaching a time when mentioning God at all is taboo . This album reminds us of a more simple time . Happiness , joy , and harmony ... These things should have always been a part of rock and roll.Overall : 10 out of 10 .	1
First , & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is not over-hyped . But it is anomalous to those who still see the Beach Boys as a garage surfing band or a barbershop quartet . True , their name locks them into an image ( Are you listening , Kid Rock ? ) , but take the album on it 's merits . Shut off the lights , lay down , and open your soul.Secondly , This album is a quantum leap beyond anything else done at the time . The Beatles were gyrating into a red-hot LDS frenzy , and the Satanic Majesties , the Rolling Stones . . . they still have n't grown up . This albums has a calmer feel . Compare the angry reds and glitz of & quot ; Sgt . Peppers & quot ; or & quot ; Satanic Majesties & quot ; with the calming greens and golds of & quot ; Pet Sounds. & quot ; The Beach Boys were making a farewell album to the sensible 1960 's , before the fire storm came.Thirdly , since this is a different album , listen to it with an open mind . Try to pick out the musical parts and nuances of the pieces . IMAGINE BRIAN WILSON LIVING TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND WRITING CLASSICAL MUSIC . What would it be like ? Would we place him between Mozart and Handel ? Yes , yes , yes ! Additionally , listen to the words . Mike love would be a good wrapper , but he is n't a poet . Asher is . He lives a word , a & quot ; logos & quot ; -- rational speech -- to Wilson 's music . This is a spiritual disc : & quot ; God Only Knows. & quot ; Fourthly , Stereo ! Stereo ! Stereo !	1
Everyone has heard that this album is a classic , and those unfamiliar with it may wonder why it has such appeal . Briefly , its qualities might be summarized as follows : 1 . The inventiveness of its arrangements . There are so many timbres and instruments used , all working together to create moments of beauty . The bass lines in particular are worth noting , as they so often help create sonic tension . All of the musicians used are top notch . 2 . The warmth and depth of the recordings . Every groove sounds like a canyon , though without the excess mushy echo of Phil Spector . 3 . The dazzling vocal harmonies . The Beach Boys were known for them , and here they reach new heights . 4 . The sincere emotional depth of Brian Wilson . You can practically hear him pouring his heart and soul into the project , taking catchy pop tunes and turning them into quasi spiritual moments . 5 . The belief inherent in such an unusual project that pop music can be something more than just dance or party music . Brian Wilson conceived this as something of a & quot ; teenage symphony to God. & quot ; I am glad this recording is available in both its original mono and its stereo form . Regardless of which you prefer , this sounds good ( with headphones , it sparkles as the rich tones wash over you ) , and it is important to hear the mono version for insight into how the record originally appeared . If you like this music , I also heartily recommend a box set called & quot ; Good Vibrarions - Thirty Years of the Beach Boys. & quot ;	1
This album was and is McCartney 's inspiration for the rest of his musical life and that is saying something . Brian pulls out all the stops to make the Teenage angst Masterpiece and the song I just was n't made for these times is the anthem for those of us that ca n't seem to fit in with the cliques . Highly Recommended for music fans , especially musicians . Casual BB fans should not start here , get the greatest hits .	1
... If fans stopped trying to play `` Can You Top This ? '' between The Beatles and The Beach Boys ? Sure , RUBBER SOUL inspired PET SOUNDS which inspired SGT . PEPPER 'S which inspired SMILE which inspired THE WHITE ALBUM , etc. , so forth , so on , and who cares ? The fact is that each of the aforementioned records was a major musical milestone on the road from Rock 'n ' Roll to Rock , from the concept of adolescent rebellion to young adult protest , and from craft to art . When one considers that all this happened in the space of about three years , the spirituality of it is overwhelming . 1967 was the high-water mark of the so-called Counterculture , and these are its anthems.PET SOUNDS is Brian Wilson 's first and most successful attempt to transform simple surf and car tunes into chamber music . Audacious and yet hauntingly familiar , PET SOUNDS works dynamically to present us with a uniquely artistic All-American sound . While not as seamless as SGT . PEPPER 'S , PET SOUNDS avoids the LSD-fueled visionary pretentiousness of that Beatles entry . Whether PET SOUNDS is a `` better '' album than SGT . PEPPER 'S is impossible to say . They are both glorious , different enough each to stand alone , and yet they complement each other , being two views of the same musical landscape.This PET SOUNDS release is rather unique in itself , being two versions ( mono and stereo ) of the same album . There are some interesting variations in music and lyric sprinkled throughout the different versions , and with it 's variegated detail , PET SOUNDS commands your attention . Plus , the hits just keep on coming . Thanks , Boys .	1
One of the truly hyped albums of all time that lives up to the lavish praise heaped upon it . Brian Wilson was a 23-year-old who was struggling to express himself in new aural forms , and made this masterwork . Somewhat surprisingly , it flopped . The liner notes detail the reasons : kitsch cover ( no doubt ) , automatic dislike of anything & quot ; Beach Boys & quot ; by those that would have liked it the most - hippies . It also paints Brian in a glowing light as working alone , without a songwriting partner like the Lennon/McCartney team , or without a guiding producer like George Martin . That he was such a young man working alone , against the advice of his manager , and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius . The songs speak for themselves , and everyone should know them by heart .	1
I must admit , as someone who was not a real fan of The Beach Boys , I always considered themselves to be a `` Fun in the Sun '' type of band . However , as I became intrigued by The Beatles ' `` Sgt . Peppers Lonely Hears Club Band '' album , I soon became equally intrigued by The Beach Boys ' `` Pet Sounds '' . I soon learned that there was a bit of a rivalry that existed between the Beatles and the Beach Boys ' from a creative standpoint . It turns out that when the Beatles released `` Rubber Soul '' , Brian Wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max - and the result would be `` Pet Sounds '' - which in turn inspired the Beatles to do `` Sgt Pepper '' . With `` Pet Sounds '' , I discovered was an album that was n't the typical Beach Boys ' `` Fun in the Sun '' , but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be years ahead of its time . This would be the result of the efforts of Brian Wilson - with some songwriting help from Tony Asher.Wilson incorporates probably one of the widest ranges of instruments that had been heard on any album in the Rock era . This includes Strings , Woodwinds , Brass , and a variety of percussion and interesting sounds ( bicycle bells , dog barking , etc ) . If one is to basically compare `` Sgt Pepper '' against `` Pet Sounds '' , `` Sgt Pepper '' may have stronger and more catchy lyrics , but Wilson 's musical arrangements on `` Pet Sounds '' have the slight edge . For all practical purposes , Wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many parts of this collection . Two instruments that really stand out on this collection are the use of Tympani Drums and Baritone SaxophoneOne thing that makes this collection so unique is you get two flavors of `` Pet Sounds '' . The first 13 tracks are the original tracks as they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono . In 1997 , Brian Wilson would take those original masters from 1966 and create a Stereo version of those tracks - which are also included on this collection . This basically is a win-win for the listener . I found that I would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recordings while I could also appreciate how well these tracks sounded when converted to Stereo . Each version brings a different listening experience . You will hear a little more distortion with the mono version , but that is to be expected . There is also a bonus track that was not included on the 1966 release called - `` Hang On to Your Ego '' .Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks : '' Would n't It Be Nice '' : This is one of the more popular tracks . It has the classic Beach Boys ' harmonies . This song is enhanced by the use of Tympani , Saxophones , and Mandolins '' You Still Believe in Me '' : Slight psychedelic feel . The use of bicycle horns gives this song some charm . The music from the Harpsichord , Clarinet , and Tympani are some of the highlights here . `` That 's Not Me '' : Not a bad song . Mike Love does a good job on vocals here and Glen Campbell contributes 12 string guitar . `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head on My Shoulder ) '' : A gentle song highlighted by gentle vocals by Brian . Even the use of the Tympani is softer here . Nice string arrangements here . `` I 'm Waiting for the Day '' : This sounds like a cross between psychedelic and Hawaiian sounds . The Tympanis and Bongos sound great here , but also Ukulele , Flute , and English Horns sound good as well - all will really give this a terrific sound '' Lets Go Away '' : I never thought of the Beach Boys as an instrumental group , but `` Pet Sounds '' gives us two instrumentals . This one has a nice soft classical music feel to it . `` Sloop John B '' : Here Brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song . There is a bit of Doo-Wop in here . The Baritone Saxophone is used well here . Brian and Mike do a great job sharing lead vocals . `` God Only Knows '' : Paul McCartney still calls this one of the greatest songs he ever heard - and with good reason . This song is perfection . Carl Wilson gets the nod to lead the vocals here and does n't let anyone down . The French Horns , Baritone Sax , Clarinet , and String Ensemble really help as well . This song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the Beach Boys . `` I Know There 's An Answer '' : Mike and Alan Jardine share vocals here . Some more strong lyrics . More of a Doo Wop sound and more terrific Baritone Sax work . `` Here Today '' : Great horn arrangements highlight this song - especially the Baritone Sax '' I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' : Lots of interesting percussion sounds on here . The Tympani and Baritone Sax stand out here again . `` Pet Sounds '' : The title track and another instrumental . Wilson admits to this having a James Bond psychedelic sound . More Baritone Sax and Percussions '' Caroline Ho '' : The train sound and the sounds of Brian 's dogs barking at the end of this song are most remembered . There is some nice Ukulele on this song . Brian does a great job on the lead vocals , but great harmonies by the Beach Boys . `` Hang On To Your Ego '' : This is the bonus track . Baritone Sax is the highlight here again . However , Brian 's vocals might be the strongest of any track on this album.The liner notes are incredible . You get a short `` letter '' from Brian Wilson about his perspectives on `` Pet Sounds '' . David Leaf has a two terrific write-ups - one is more of a biographical point of view of `` Pet Sounds '' while the other talks about the making of the `` Pet Sounds '' album . There are track by track notes that include commentary by Brian . You also get a Sessionography of all of the participating musicians in `` Pet Sounds '' . `` Pet Sounds '' might not be the best selling album in history , but it most certainly merits its place in music history . Highly recommended .	1
With Pet Sounds , the Beach Boys ( or rather , Brian Wilson with the rest of the Beach Boys in tow ) pulled off one hell of a feat : the album is a pop masterpiece , a collection of little ditties that command the emotional impact and inherent grandeur of symphonies . The songs are n't performances so much as they are works of architecture , a series of sound constructions that are executed with an uncanny amount of artistic finesse . The album makes use of densely layered instrumentation , incorporating an endless array of horns , strings , keyboards , guitars , and percussion to create a set of lush , colorful soundscapes . The thing is , the music never sounds pretentious or forced ; In the hands of Wilson and his endless army of session musicians , these gorgeous musings sound like the natural outcome of songs like `` California Girls '' or `` In My Room . '' It 's either genius or something very close to it.And really , there is n't a bad song in the whole bunch : `` Would n't It Be Nice '' is an absolutely glorious album opener , a sun-splashed rush of passion and yearning . Brian 's ( and Mike Love 's ) vocals are stunning in their emotional directness . `` God Only Knows '' is quieter , but no less poignant- its dizzying swirls of percussion and dreamy vocal harmonies are just plain hypnotic . `` Sloop John B '' ( a cover of a classic folk song ) has some great harmonies and an infectious melody . `` Let 's Go Away For Awhile '' and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative works on the album . `` You Still Believe In Me '' is a stately , dreamy piece of chamber pop , while `` I 'm Waiting For The Day '' is a wonderfully optimistic ballad . `` That 's Not Me , '' `` I Know There 's An Answer , '' and `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' are fantastic evocations of youthful alienation and angst , while `` Here Today '' and `` Caroline No '' are equally effective portraits of lost innocence and love gone sour . There 's also `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) , '' one of the most achingly beautiful ballads ever created . The chorus will make your heart melt.So ... yeah . Good stuff . Pick it up .	1
The only way I could write anything about this album that has never been written before is by writing what it means to me personally.I waited until I was approaching middle-age to become a Beach Boys fan . When I was younger I thought Beach Boys music was trite and dated , but when the new remastered `` two-fers '' started being released I started buying them and enjoying them a lot.Not only was the sound quality superb , but the music described the teenage years that I ( and I suppose many others ) wish they had in their past , but not reality . I wish I had a hot rod in high-school , but I did n't . I wish my Summers were so care free and fun filled , but they were n't . Beach Boys music allowed me to escape into a past I never had and wonder what it might have been like . It made me happy and sad at the same time.Then I finally discovered Pet Sounds . I could n't believe it ! The Beach Boys were actually singing about reality , and even my reality.The song `` I Just Was n't Made for These Times '' seemed like it was written just for me . `` They say I 've got brains , but they ai n't doing me no good . '' is the story of my life , or at least it seems that way sometimes.The song `` I know There 's an Answer '' describes so many people I 've encountered in my life . `` Caroline No '' reminded me of a woman I knew in high school who was beautiful and always smiling and happy , but when I met her at a reunion she had become bitter and her beauty seemed to be gone . Could she ever get it back ? `` That 's Not Me '' reminded me of my attempt to succeed in the fast-paced world of consulting when I got out of college . I had a great job compared to many people , and I worked in some great cities that I never would have seen otherwise , but I discovered the hard way that `` That 's Not Me '' .These songs and the others are woven together into a pop music symphony that never gets old , ( though I will say that I listen to it much more often in the Summer than in the Winter ) .	1
`` Pet Sounds '' is one of those albums that occasionally is released that has a Jekyll/Hyde existence . Many people either hated it or did n't understand it , while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution . As always in everything from movies to books , the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album 's initial commercial lack of success.There was nothing like `` Pet Sounds '' when it came out . Furthermore , the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously . A recipe for commercial disaster . Long time fans of `` Barbara Ann '' and `` Surfing U.S.A. '' wondered what these songs were all about . This stuff just was n't The Beach Boys they knew . Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.It was n't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light , and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction . `` Pet Sounds '' was a very long step in that direction.We look back on `` Pet Sounds '' from our next millenium perspective and want to say , `` What 's the big deal ? '' It was a very big deal in 1966 . `` Pet Sounds '' and `` Sgt . Pepper '' sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated . These albums were the sound of rock music growing up . However , `` Pet Sounds '' was too alien for the typical public taste at the time , and it flopped.But , other musicians loved it ; particularly The Beatles . John and Paul recognized the roots of something great , and were strongly influenced by it . Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to `` Pet Sounds '' as being a big influence on their music . `` Pet Sounds '' was music as art . `` Sgt . Pepper , '' while also striving for art , also managed to be commercially successful . However , there are songs from `` Sgt . Pepper '' which followed well the artistic path of `` Pet Sounds '' that had their own detractors . Unfortunately not everyone understands art.Listening today , `` Pet Sounds '' is somewhat dated . However , listen to it over and over , and you realize that the music is well done . From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that `` Pet Sounds '' was ahead of its time . In all the hysteria of The Beatles , `` Pet Sounds '' got lost . `` Pet Sounds '' is great rock because of what it was when it was released , and who it influenced.Beyond the influence , there are some really great songs on this CD . `` Sloop John B . '' is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs . `` Would n't It Be Nice , '' `` That 's Not Me , '' `` I Know There 's an Answer , '' `` God Only Knows , '' `` Caroline No '' ... all very good to great songs . Admittedly somewhat mellow , but beautiful.Should you buy this album ? Well , depends on what you like . `` Pet Sounds '' refuses to fit into a nice niche . It 's not like what The Beach Boys did before it . It is mellow , but it 's not a perfect fit into pop music . If you 've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above , and like them , then you 'll like the rest of the CD . If you have n't heard very much of the CD , then either download samples or borrow a copy . I , on the other hand , may need to purchase another copy , because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy , I play it so much.Note that this album has been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the `` old '' version . You may want to see what features are available and the price of other versions before you buy . Good luck !	1
Surely one of the great albums of all time , Brian Wilson used his troubled genius to unsurpassed effect , pouring heart and soul into this collection of 13 masterpieces . In the Beach Boys he had at his disposal an incredibly skilled vocal group whose voices could blend and mix in the empathetic way that only comes from a family group who have grown up singing , and who were also perfectly capable of recreating the core of the album 's sound in live performance.Brian Wilson had worked hard for the group for several years , composing many of the songs , singing lead , arranging the harmony vocals , playing bass guitar and piano and honing his production skills , which were greatly inspired by the work of Phil Spector . He used the same pool of musicians and occasionally the same studio in Hollywood , and like Spector he was an innovator and pioneer who could brilliantly combine unusual pairs or multiples of instruments to create a unique single sound.It all came together on this album , by which time he had retired from the touring group to concentrate on his composing and record-making . The beautiful melodies and the `` pet sounds '' he created were matched by some exquisite lyrics that were written in collaboration with Tony Asher and other writers . Brian Wilson had been inspired by hearing Rubber Soul and was fuelled by an ambition to match it in which he was wholly successful . In turn , Pet Sounds inspired the Beatles to go on to create Sgt Pepper . It was this spirit of competitive creativity that led to his unfortunate burn out during the creation of Smile , his response to Sgt Pepper.Although not exactly a concept album , everything was recorded specifically for the album apart from the traditional song Sloop John B , which had already been released as a single and was included on the insistence of the record company . It does not sound too out of place . The first single from the album was the heartfelt God Only Knows ( What I 'd Do Without You ) . This got to number 2 in the UK , but suffered in America from lack of radio exposure by nervous radio stations , who began playing the flipside instead . This resulted in Would n't It Be Nice , surely an A-side in its own right anyway , reaching the US Top Ten.The title song Pet Sounds is an instrumental that was originally called Run James Run , inspired by James Bond , and when heard with this in mind takes on a whole new meaning for the listener . The closing track , Caroline No , ends with more pet sounds : Brian 's puppies Banana and Louie barking as the song fades . This had also come out on a single before the release of Pet Sounds , but under the name Brian Wilson , and without the beagle and weimaraner or other sound effects.Of course , the original album already resides on everyone 's CD shelf in mono . Brian Wilson was deaf in one ear and so preferred to work monaurally , again like Phil Spector . He also felt that he could present the sound to the listener in exactly the way he wished , without interference from any stereophonically knob-twiddling listener.However , a stereo edition was produced and engineered by Mark Linett in 1997 for the Pet Sounds box set , created under the close supervision of Brian Wilson himself , and this edition follows the original album with this scrupulously remixed true stereo version . Not only are these versions often slightly longer , the additional clarity afforded by the sound separation adds a whole new dimension to hearing them , and takes away absolutely nothing . Technological improvements since 1997 have meant that the new stereo mix of Would n't It Be Nice on this edition is less different from the original mono mix than on the box set	1
Much has already been written about this masterpiece , one of the greatest LPs in the history of pop/rock . Two things about it , in particular , that I appreciate : one is that it demonstrates what imaginative studio production can be capable of - so many records today , by contrast , are overproduced , or simply badly produced , that they sound immediately stale ; this , by contrast , sounds as fresh as the day it came out . The other thing about Pet Sounds that I love is that it , while not & quot ; soul & quot ; music per se , is a record with much personality and soul , and shows the value of introspection when one is a musical genius like Brian Wilson , the man who is mostly responsible for this .	1
In this modern day and age its easy to pinpoint the relevance of music albums because of their place in history . However , what 's truly difficult is to consider those albums to sound as fresh and innovative as they were at the time of their release . Pet Sounds , however , makes it seem like the easiest task in the world . This is the case because , superficially , Pet Sounds is the first and main point of reference for the wide scope of innovations to come out of 60s ' pop . It seems everything the 60s ' had to offer to pop music were synthesized within the album ; from the innovations of earlier craftsmen like Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach , the growth of the Baroque Pop aesthetic , and the California sunshine scene , all the way to the upcoming of Sgt . Pepper , late 60s ' American psychedelia , and the Chamber/Twee Pop revival in the 1990s ' ( to which this album was heralded as a rosetta stone ) .Sure , to must pundits this is all very possible to point out without even listening to the album . But once you get to listen to it , with the first listen it sounds as nothing The Beach Boys had ever done ( or would do again ) . To be blunt , the album easily trashes out the Boys ' entire previous catalogue , making it seem as if nothing was even listenable before Pet Sounds . This is of course not the case , the point being that the album is at such an elevated high from the ( already good ) albums of the rest of their catalogue.Thats also not to say that this is a different style than their previous albums , its just that every element of the Boys ' music was not perfected up until Pet Sounds . Their classic vocal harmonies are present ; but Wilson multi-layers them into angelical synchronization . The pop hooks are still there ; but Wilson adorns them with subtle juxtapositions of varied orchestrations ( within the same song ) . The teenage melodramatic mood ? Well in Pet Sounds it is transformed into timeless yearns for love , reciprocation , and meaning . See the pattern that emerges ? The one thing thats truly radical from the Boys ' previous inputs , and arguably what gives Pet Sounds its sublimity , is the instrumentation . No longer are the Boys ' reliant on just blues chord progression piano , surf-like guitar hooks and saxophone here and there . This time , Wilson is able to integrate the grandeur of his best songs ( like California Girls and Do n't Worry Baby ) into a full fledged album . And not only that , he uses an full set orchestra to conceive it . This is not just your typical strings and brass however ; Wilson goes all the way with timpani , french horns , vibraphone and harpsichord , among others . He even goes beyond orchestral instruments and brings in ukuleles , hammond organs , hawaiian percussion , accordion , hell you name it ! Its just like one critic pointed out , the singles from Pet Sounds where the only time the Boys ' met commercial success while being endlessly experimental.The songs are as varied as the instrumentation as well . You have the sunshine-like opening of `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , the hauntingly sad `` Do n't Talk '' , the superficial fun of `` Sloop John B . '' and the anthemic `` God Only Knows '' , just to mention a few examples . Hell , there are even a couple of instrumental tracks a-la Martin Denny ! Be certain of one thing , there are NO high points and low points in this album , it all flows majestically like vintage wine from beginning to end.Even though Pet Sounds is a mono recording ( stereo listeners do n't stop reading YET ) , Brian Wilson unmistakably manages the production output into an elaborate , wall-of-sound-alike work . That is to say , it is essentially mono , but the recording process of the orchestrations are in no way lessened . To be honest , I thought at first that it was a stereo recording , because I can notice the difference with some of the Boys ' previous records , in which the instrumentation could sometimes be unbearably washed up . And its also a bona-fide experience to listen to it in mono , as Brian intended it to be . However if you 're really into stereo , there is a stereo version of the album included ( past the bonus track `` Hang On To Your Ego '' ) .To conclude , I believe that if you 're going to buy just one 60s ' pop album in your life then let Pet Sounds be that choice . I mean sure , you could pick up one of their much rivaled Beatles albums , but not even Sgt . Pepper matches the ornamental beauty of Pet Sounds , The Beach Boys one true magnum opus ... although I am yet to listen to The Smile Sessions , so who knows if there 's a contender ...	1
Judging by the number of reviews just on Amazon , this album is still impressing and affecting people after 30+ years , a good sign that Brian Wilson must have tapped into something that people identify with -- according to Brian ( and I 'm paraphrasing , forgive me ) , through the music he wanted people to feel loved . And , there is that here , in the joyous strains of & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; ( with probably one of the most famous opening drumbeats in pop history ) , and & quot ; You Still Believe in Me & quot ; , but there 's also a lot of longing , loneliness , questioning and disappointment between the grooves , all complimented wonderfully by the atmospheric and ethereal arrangements played mainly by Brian and session musicians . This is probably one of the first and finest examples of a true studio creation -- a concept album where all of the tracks seem of a piece . Even the lyrics have grown past the cars , girls and surfing ; intentional or not , & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; has deceptively simple verses that double back on their meaning ( & quot ; I may not always love you/but long as there are stars above you/you never need to doubt it/I 'll make you so sure about it ... & quot ; ) . Maybe it does n't come through just reading it , but that 's about as close to poetry pop music comes in my opinion -- the second verse does the same trick ( even better ) . Two evocative instrumentals here as well . I think it 's futile to compare this with & quot ; Sgt . Pepper , & quot ; though many people do -- let each rest on their own merits ( and remember , & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; came before & quot ; Sgt . Pepper & quot ; -- the Beach Boys ' & quot ; rebuttal & quot ; was going to be & quot ; Smile & quot ; , the project that never made its way to record as a whole ) . A lot of people helpfully say , & quot ; If you like so-and-so , then you 'll like this & quot ; , but I think this is one of the few records that anyone who loves pop music ( or heck , even & quot ; music & quot ; in general ) should have in their collection .	1
Your illustrious Seer is at the beach now . The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating . The white seagulls circle overhead ( watch out ! ) , and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer 's cape . They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures . They lied . And , aside from all that , just when I get the sand castle to a stately form , some freckle-faced , red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down . I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers , however , an ice cream cone made him go away . Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation . Now if only the tides would stop being a threat . Ah well ... ... ... .Anyway , I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of `` Pet Sounds '' by the Beach Boys . Much has been written about this seminal album . And why not ? It consistently ranks in the top 10 pop-rock albums of all time . And rightly so if you ask me.Of course , it was n't greeted ethusiastically when it came out . At least not as much as their prior hits . Brian Wilson took the hit most of all . Probably unjustly . But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time . To most , perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time . But I would have to disagree with that . Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time . He saw that the music was changing . Plus , artistically , you can not stay in the same place . Artistry needs real growth . Meanwhile , the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened.But , lets get into this a little more . The Beach Boys were ( and still are ) the ultimate summer group . Songs about California Girls , fast cars , high school life , requited love , and teen angst , angst , angst . These songs were incredibly successful . But Brian knew that , as he got older , his audience were also doing the same thing . He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication . Looking back to 1966 , this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day . Sure , some may downplay the importance of this recording , however , that can not eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever . It is essential , and one of the very best.But , getting to the main point . Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotions on record . This was a mega step- and quite a risk at the same time . Most of the music is lush , well thought out , and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in his mind . Certainly the songs are confessional , i.e ; `` You Still Believe in Me '' , emotional , i.e , `` That 's Not Me '' , `` I 'm Waiting for the Day '' , and quiet , heartfelt romance , i.e ; `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head on my Shoulder ) '' . One must , of course , listen to all the colours and passages in this music . All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly . Beautiful lilting breaks , shifting meter , an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre . Excellent.And songs ? We are treated to different , but essential , gratuitous hits with `` Would n't It Be Nice '' and `` Sloop John B '' . But more than this , Brian gives us 2 more considerable high standard gems . Yes . We get to `` God Only Knows '' which I nominate as the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music . Grandiose , glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song . Sweet , yearning , beautiful beyond compare . Angelic vocals as well . If anyone doubts Brian Wilson 's genius , have them look to this song . Absolutely the highest gem . Then we get to the wispful `` Caroline No '' . Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship . He looks back to a time when his love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed . `` Where is the girl I used to know '' ? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship , knowing full well that it has changed forever . Listen to the end . A train in the distance , approaching at a rapid pace , getting louder , and then quickly passing by . A dog barks in the distance-urging its return . But it gone and then silence . What an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending . Superb.In a way , the outtake of `` I know There 's an Answer '' entitled `` Hold On to Your Ego '' to me , conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with his new direction . But he knows he 's alone and he knows that he 's `` going to lose the fight '' . Well , he may have lost it to them- however- he won the classic album . And we are all so much better that he did.Now , I must go and make sure that kid is n't planning some new attack on my new home . I do n't want to lose the fight anymore than Brian does.In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection.Goats say `` feed me '' , Seers say `` read me '' . -- yours , Metamorpho	1
I get something different out of this CD every time I hear it -- for me , the mark of an outstanding record.When something new STILL pops out of the speakers after three years of listening ... ..well , I know I 'm hearing one of the all-time greats.I get the most out of PET SOUNDS on headphones . Take a walk on the beach at dusk with this CD at medium volume , so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cries of seagulls . The music fits right in . Brian Wilson absolutely captures the outdoor beauty of Southern California in 13 heavenly songs.I wo n't get into the SGT . PEPPER - PET SOUNDS debate . They 're both masterpieces . Let 's just say both bands pushed each other to new levels of aural beauty -- a & quot ; race & quot ; that ultimately drove Wilson into seclusion . One of pop music 's finest .	1
When I was 21 or 22 , one of my coworkers dropped a copy of Pet Sounds on my desk and said , `` listen to it , it 'll change your life '' . Well , like anyone that age , I assumed he 'd be wrong , but one late night years later , I did listen to it.So anyway , he was right , it changed the way I thought about music , at a minimum . Since then , you might say my obsession with the Beach Boys is complete.The album -- 13 tracks of just incredible , lush , essential music . Much of it is Brian singing lead , and he does so magnificantly , in either a tenor range or falsetto , depending on the piece . Where there 's harmonies , they 're sometimes drier than the previous stuff , sometimes as lush and well arranged , and sometimes there 's none.As far as the songs go , there 's not a bad one -- highlights change for me over time , right now `` You Still Believe in Me '' , `` Do n't Talk '' , and `` God Only Knows '' are my favorites , but this changes over time . They 're all quite brilliant though -- every time I listen to the album , I 'm amazed how good it is , from the fragile lead vocal in `` Caroline , No '' , the brilliant , layered tag on `` God Only Knows '' , the mighty chorus of `` Sloop John B '' , there 's really not enough room in any one review to say what there is to say about this.This is an album about growing up , about seeking adulthood , it leaves behind the childish themes of the older Beach Boys material that has maligned their reputation for a more mature viewpoint . If you have a view of the Beach Boys and have not heard this , like I did before I heard it , you 're missing out if you do n't give this a chance . I come from a jazz/progressive rock/avant-garde background , and while I had my own impressions of the Beach Boys , I learned how wrong I was.Essential , if you do n't own this , you should . This may be the best pop album ever written .	1
Count me in among those who simply never `` got '' this album . Or , at least , never `` got '' it like those Mojo critics who voted it in as the greatest album of all time , or the RS panel which put it at # 2 . It 's good , yes , but a magically mystically transcendent and Shakespearian-worthy reflection of the human condition ? Hmmm ... many of the tracks seem overly-sweetened to these ears , especially `` You Still Believe In Me '' , `` I 'm Waiting For The Day '' , `` Here Today '' ... the chamber orchestration applied to `` God Only Knows '' still works , largely because the melody is so timeless ; along with `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , the title track and `` Caroline No '' it 's the best thing on the disc . Wilson 's lyrics are OK and certainly more sophisticated than anything The Beach Boys and most other pop acts were capable of in the spring of '66 , but even the best here ( `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' , `` Caroline No '' ) are written from an overly-sentimental perspective . Oddly enough , though , I enjoy `` Do n't Talk '' in spite of -- or maybe even because -- it 's a simple romantic ballad ( the repetition of the chorus at the end creeps up on me and sends shivers down the spine ) . `` Pet Sounds '' never *truly* grabbed me until I heard the stereo version prepared for the box set , and which is included here . This version brings out the album 's delicate arrangements much more , and to me is the only `` true '' version ( I expect a lot of disagreement here , of course ) . Anyways , I 've listened to and pondered its worth dozens and dozens of times , hoping that eventually something would magically `` click '' and I 'd be enlightened , which is how a lot of people have described their coming to love the album . With me , though , it has been more of a gradual appreciation -- a lyric here , an instrument there , and especially hearing the stereo version -- than a sudden impulse to erect a Brian Wilson shrine in my bedroom . I 've heard the `` Smile '' material on boots and it is the wacky , wildly experimental stuff there which seems more like what I 'd expected of `` Pet Sounds '' . Still , I would recommend the album to anyone who has n't heard it , for it is still an essential work in the history of rock , albeit slightly saccarine and sentimental in places . For heartfelt lyricism and stunning arrangements without dross like `` Sloop John B '' , I 'd recommend `` Rubber Soul '' , Robert Wyatt 's `` Rock Bottom '' , Joni Mitchell 's `` Blue '' or The Kinks ' `` Village Green Preservation Society '' instead .	1
As a landlocked kid growing up without ready access to beaches or a car , I had a hard time relating to the Beach Boys . Their celebrations of sun , surfing , and hot-rodding were too removed from my own experience . It was n't until I got older that I appreciated them . Songs that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layers of emotions which had previously eluded me.Mind you , that was n't true of every Beach Boys song . But classics like `` Surfer Girl '' and `` Do n't Worry Baby '' were wistful and beautiful evocations of love and longing - both questioning and reassuring.Brian Wilson then outdid himself with his compositions for the landmark 1966 album `` Pet Sounds '' - their apex and finest achievement - and arguably the greatest record ever released by an American band . Paul McCartney has said that if you have n't heard it , your musical education is n't complete . He further said it inspired the Beatles to make `` Sgt . Pepper '' . I do n't really hear `` Pet Sounds '' influence on that record , but I do on `` Abbey Road '' - especially on tracks like `` Because '' and `` Here Comes The Sun King '' .This CD contains the full album in mono and stereo . Wilson 's musical and vocal arrangements still sound stunning to this day . If for any reason you 've resisted buying this , you should n't . At the very minimum , any serious music fan should own `` Pet Sounds '' and a good collection of their hits such as `` Sounds Of Summer '' ( 2003 ) .Wilson 's solo career has also been of interest . `` Brian Wilson '' ( 1988 ) was a good one . So was the belatedly completed `` Smile '' ( 2004 ) , which was originally intended as the follow-up to `` Pet Sounds '' - wherein he proved himself to be a latter-day Gershwin . `` Smile '' collaborator Van Dyke Parks and Wilson had previously released the excellent `` Orange Crate Art '' ( 1995 ) . Recently , Wilson issued `` That Lucky Old Sun '' ( 2008 ) , another innovative song suite in the style of `` Smile '' - and it 's fine . All are highly recommended.Whether you live in California or not , do n't miss out on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson .	1
As a reviewer I try to be rather conservative in my opinions to better aid the people considering buying said product , but I think easily PET SOUNDS is the most deserving five star rating I 've handed out , ever . Exaggerations and hyperbolas are the standard in Amazon reviews , but everything I say about this release is both an accurate description and a heartfelt love.Originally a response to The Beatles ' RUBBER SOUL , not only does PET SOUNDS proves Brian Wilson head and shoulders above even The Beatles ( if only for one album ) , he quite beautifully demonstrates what can be achieved by the human spirit . Musically ceaselessly inventive , with layers and layers of all sorts of instruments and even a dog and a train . However , music itself does not support the hype I 've said about the album.Here 's what does : Brian Wilson 's collaboration with Tony Asher , who wrote most of the lyrics for the album . Asher easily proves himself an incredible lyricist and the best collaborator for Wilson 's vision . What makes PET SOUNDS so great is all the songs add to a cohesion of both emotion , spirituality , and searching for the answer that The Beatles never captured ( and maintained ) throughout an entire album , and only distantly felt ( compared to this ; in their own right , both albums I am about to cite are intense ) in Radiohead 's OK COMPUTER and Pink Floyd 's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.This is the genius of PET SOUNDS . It captures a stage in which we evolve the most : youth . Not only does it capture it , PET SOUNDS recreates this stage and makes it wonderfully relevant to our own lives , no matter how far from youth one is . Brian Wilson and Tony Asher chart a young man 's voyage through his youth . In only 35 minutes , this musical journey becomes both real and tangible , becoming almost like a novel in its characters ' complexity . While it can be argued that this is only a collection of songs , that strips away much of the beauty and incredible vision that it took to make this album.Listening to PET SOUNDS is like watching your life unfold : going through romantic idealisation to crushing heartbreak , searching for God and your relation to Him , and a struggle to establish who you are and what you stand for.While the dominant motif is romance , you can take this as an allegory or analogy for anything a person truly loves and the trials and tribulations one will encounter in a pursuing this love . This facet is also what makes PET SOUNDS so accomplished and beautiful : it captures the pain of love , whatever that love is , whether it be in romance , which PET SOUNDS chose as its dominant landscape , or any other true love which is accessible to humanity.Every teenager should discover the truths on this album , for it will greatly aid him/her in their own love lives . PET SOUNDS , because of the ascetic environment in which it responded too ( music largely simple with all these impossible romantic dreams , ala & quot ; I Want To Hold Your Hand , & quot ; etc ) , much of PET SOUNDS deals with romantic turmoil . The opening track , & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice , & quot ; shows the young man in a very simple , wholly naive belief about love and relations to the opposite sex . Then Wilson and Asher gives us a study of this young man journeying from idealisation to crushing lost . The unnamed & quot ; I & quot ; becomes so real by the end of PET SOUNDS that , listening to the album in its entirety , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; is so painfully intense after watching him struggle through so many things in his own life . Because of the incredible buildup , this is the single most powerful ending to any work of art , let alone music , that I have experienced.When I said & quot ; study & quot ; , one may think of a dry , academic approach that only deadens what you really have an interest in and truly love . Have no fear . When you listen to this , you are constantly connecting to this person ( or persons , even ) that PET SOUNDS deals with ( the unnamed & quot ; I & quot ; ) . Anyone who will truly allow themselves to be open to this will find much of their own probing of life here , and generally one can not help but connect and identify with the young man in his quest for identity and a solution to life 's ever-appearing questions.Before I end this review , to clear up my own viewpoint of Beatles records in relation to this , the three mid-period albums ( RUBBER SOUL , REVOLVER , and SGT . PEPPER ) , are some of the best albums ever made but simply can not answer to PET SOUNDS , The Beach Boys only truly significant album . RUBBER SOUL is brilliant but does not add up to any cohesiave whole as this does . Wilson wanted to outdo The Beatles after hearing RUBBER SOUL , and in my opinion he did . REVOLVER , one of rock 's most celebrated LPs , again lacks the cohesion to that is required to top PET SOUNDS . SGT . PEPPER , which , after Wilson heard it , felt crushed and defeated and left one of rock 's most enduring & quot ; What If ? 's & quot ; by abandoning SMILE , the follow up to PET SOUNDS which was never finished , let alone released . While historically the most important LP we have , SGT . PEPPER is more an exercise in band psychology to truly stretch across and become the achievement PET SOUNDS is . Paul McCartney allowed himself the luxury of pretending to be in Sgt . Pepper 's band , and the only importance the & quot ; concept & quot ; of PEPPER had was freeing McCartney up and getting the band away from their bubble-gum identity . While it has a tremendous closing , there is no magnificent buildup to what is an already powerful conclusion.I consider PET SOUNDS , the one piece of art from music , that should enter the classical canon of twentieth century art . Its importance and relevance to humanity can not be overstated , and is one of art 's best epiphanies and expression of human pain , searching , faith , and endurance.AS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS POSSIBLE ! ! !	1
Most , and most likely all , of the people who do n't like The Beach Boys ' classic , Pet Sounds ( 1966 ) , just do n't like The Beach Boys . If you do n't like the beach , you 're not gon na like surfing.Pet Soundsis actually quite a remarkable piece of of work . Introspective and deeply personal , the songs are about life , love and yearning , not surfing and hot rodding on the strip . The album is a symphony of sophisticated chord changes , wistful melodies , sweet vocal harmonies , and reflective lyrics of love and longing . The true genius of Brian Wilson realized.The classic Beach Boys sound is n't completely lost here , and it 's especially highlighted in the album 's first song , Would n't It Be Nice and in the sailor 's boisterous lament , Sloop John B , but mostly the atmosphere onPet Soundsis n't the usual fun day at the beach . It 's quiet , thoughtful and lonely.Sometimes I feel so very sadAnd I guess I just was n't made for these timesConsidering this was released in 1966 , it 's an amazing accomplishment . Sir Paul McCartney praised the album by saying , `` No one is educated musically until they 've heard Pet Sounds ... It is a total , classic record that is unbeatable in many ways . `` There is another dimension toPet Soundsthat 's evident to people who were around in 1966 and remember listening to the album when it was first released . The loss of innocence . The world was changing fast in the 1960s , and The Beach Boys represented good , clean and carefree fun to a lot of people . The melancholy spirit of many of the songs onPet Soundsseemed to be sadly saying goodbye to the endless summer of innocence in America . And in many ways , it actually did.Could I ever find in you againThings that made me love you so much then ? Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone ? Oh , Caroline no	1
The Beach Boys experimented with this new form of Psychcedelic sound on thier two 1965 lps ( The Beach Boys `` Today '' and `` Summer Days and Summer Nights '' . With these two 1965 lps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created . In December 1965 after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles `` Rubbersoul '' , a statement album from the fab four , implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit , not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler . Brian was amazed at the simularities between the just released `` Rubbersoul '' and The Beach Boys earlier 1965 releases `` Today '' and `` Summer Days and Summer nights '' . Brian would say `` I want to make a record just like that , but I want to make it better ! `` Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles . And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history . In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared to be told to `` go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds '' . Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound . An incredible early psychedelic recording released May 16,1966 which influenced the Beatles 1967 Sgt.Pepper so much that George Martin has stated `` if it were'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt . Pepper would not have been created '' . Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music . Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and anger.1966 was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys . At this time on Aug.5th 1966 the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece `` Revolver '' . Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt.Pepper , of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation . The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october 1966 as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece `` Good Vibrations '' just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt . Pepper recording sessions.The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release . Even with the success of Revolver , the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy , and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed rivals . The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgance , but Pet Sounds really made the psychedelic era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper . As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds , if it were'nt for Brians over indulgance in bad habits , will never know . Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique , Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds.Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released , but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien , as their minds were just blown away by it . I listen to both Sgt . Pepper and Pet Sounds and there is some really eerie simularities , besides the instrumentation between the two , on Pet Sounds after `` Caroline No '' the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes . On Sgt . Pepper you hear barn animals , possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane . Pink Floyd would use animals sounds in their 1970s work , 1970 `` Atom Heart Mother '' including a cow on the cover of the lp . Pink Floyd in 1976 released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show , I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that ? Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for 6-8 months to make Sgt . Pepper . To make Sgt . Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations . Because of this Sgt . Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past , present and future . The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin.John Lennon , Paul McCartney , Sir George Martin vs. Brian Wilson . Brian Wilson was on his own and had no real help , even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative , musical skills . The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road . I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson ( Tony Asher ) as a song writer and music creator . In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era , a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form . I like having both versions of Pet Sounds , Mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono.I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings , but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966 . The 5.1 stereo sound is mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system , you will not beleive Pet Sounds could sound this incredible . Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history . Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era . I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings ever created.This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered . The miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording . Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording.Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s , early 1970s , which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time . If you the reader wish to get more into Pet Sounds you should look into purchasingThe Pet Sounds Sessions . You will with this four cd box set see how genius Brian Wilson constructs his 1966 masterpiece . If Pet sounds Sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..	1
WHY did no one make me listen to this album during my pop music college days ? It is WONDERFUL ! `` Would n't It Be Nice '' is now one of my top five favorite songs , a ranking that is VERY hard to get with me . I love how it manages to be innocent and sexual at the same time . I love the song `` Sloop John B , '' too . This album is beautifully done both musically and lyrically . Definitely one to buy and listen to many , many times .	1
brian wilson did things that john , paul , george or ringo never even thought of . everyone says sgt . pepper shaped the way that pop music is today . to those people , i simply scoff and proclaim them a moron . if you think this album is overrated then you probably think led zeppelin were a good rock band . brian wilson did things on this album that were n't being done at the time . genius . best.album.ever	1
Let me get this out of the way first . I really do like this album . Always have and always will . There are a number of killer songs - the usual suspects ( Would n't it be Nice , Caroline No , God Only Knows ) and the great songs that were n't hits ( That 's Not Me , I Know There 's an Answer , Here Today , I Just Was n't Meant for these Times ) . However , as much as I like these songs , I do have to take issue with the `` legendary status '' of this record . For me there is too much filler ( lush but relatively insipid ballads and unnecessary instrumental interludes ) . I never particularly cared for Sloop John B . As for the `` concept '' aspect of the album , well , I do n't see it . A few animal noises here and there do not a concept make ! Is there a story ( Tommy , Superfly ) or a common theme ? I know that teenage angst permeates the LP . But surely , is n't this the case for a great deal of the music recorded by guys in their teenage years and early 20 's ? And would someone please explain the significance of the title , cover and the pet sounds ? I am a subjective listener of music . When it comes to lyrics I recall and sometimes sing along without delving too much into hidden , or to be honest , surface meaning . I listen to the `` sound '' as a whole rather than analyzing instrumentation , recording techniques and the like . Although I do have a high end stereo system I am equally happy listening to music through decent headphones , in the car or through my new wireless Sony speakers . However , as I considered my comments on this album , in light of the myriad glowing reviews , I did listen more carefully . I have to say that my objective listening did not lead me to a heightened appreciation of the music . On the contrary , I was disappointed to discover that the more carefully I listened the more I became cognizant of flaws in the LP . For the first time I realized just how pretentious , precious and produced ( not over-produced , just slickly so ) it all sounded.I did n't care for the surfin ' music that preceded Pet Sounds . I have played and enjoyed the subsequent Surf 's Up and Holland many times . Pet Sounds ? For me it is an interesting and self-indulgent experiment . Is it revolutionary ? Is it one of the greatest records of all time ? My answer is a pretty firm no on both counts . Although it does represent a giant step forward for the Beach Boys it 's neither a Rubber Soul nor a Sergeant Pepper !	1
Realesed in 1966 Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys is loved by critics and well anyone who likes the Beach Boys . Pet Sounds is one of those albums that are just not able to created ever again . By this time Brian Wilson who had suffered a nervous breakdown while on tour with The Beach Boys now remains in the studio writing and recording new material . Pet Sounds shows the bands growth from there humble beginnings to more complex songs and much more greater album compared too there earlier ones ... Highly influentail album that has even influenced the Sgt . Peppers . Such classics as , `` Sloop John B '' , and `` God Only Knows '' , remain classic songs too this day . Albums like this come around once in a lifetime . Pet Sounds is a pop , rock , and psychedelic album and explored Brian Wilson 's exploration of the drug LSD . So what are you wating for the only Beach Boys album you will ever need buy Pet Sounds todayYou wont be dissapointed	1
Pet Sounds is one of those albums ( like Sgt . Peppers , Born To Run or Exile On Main St. ) that have been reviewed and analyzed to death . But the reason why it has garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking albums in rock history . Brian Wilson had spent the previous few years writing and producing magnificent singles , but had yet made a truly great album . Spurred on by The Beatles ' Rubber Soul and his idol , Phil Spector , Mr. Wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album . He succeeded on every level . Pet Sounds is one of the most literate , intricate and lavishly produced albums ever released . The other band members were limited to just providing vocals on the album as Mr. Wilson employed studio musicians to provide the music . Despite this fact , the band never sounded better as they provide the luscious harmonies that make the songs practically float out of your speakers . The songs were no longer about surfing and cars , but about more mature relationships and growing up . & quot ; Would n't Be Nice & quot ; is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the charts , & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; is an airy number about a woman standing by her man , & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) & quot ; is another gorgeous melody and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; is a traditional song that was the album 's biggest hit peaking at number 2 . & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; is another brilliant introspective number from Brian Wilson and & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; is a beautiful ballad that closes the original album out and was actually released as solo recording by Mr. Wilson . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band has ever recorded and is the essence of the album . Carl Wilson gives his hands down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony . Pet Sounds was not a big hit in the US , peaking at number 10 , as Americans wanted songs about sun and fun in the sun . But in England , the album was a huge success peaking at number 2 and blew the minds of the British musicians . One in particular , Paul McCartney called it the greatest album ever made and it was The Beatles ' inspiration for recording Sgt . Pepper 's . Brian Wilson tried to top Pet Sounds with Smile , but that album was never to be . Pet Sounds stands as The Beach Boys greatest album and one the best of all time .	1
Many will debate whether or not PET SOUNDS is the absolute greatest album of the rock era , but just about everyone agrees that it is certainly at least worthy of consideration . If this album were produced today in 2004 , we would marvel at the sonic quality , the production magic , the textural intricacy , and the instrumental details . That it was done in 1966 is mind-boggling . With PET SOUNDS , Brian Wilson 's name was forever etched in the pantheon of great composers ; and like fine wine , this album just seems to get better with age . The lyrics combine wide-eyed innocence with a knowing pathos that makes each song quite moving . The melodies are achingly gorgeous and the harmonies are positively celestial . Wilson 's choice of instrumentation is as bold as it is broad ; chimes and sleigh bells and woodwinds and brass and strings augment the traditional bass-drum-guitar-keyboard sound , giving PET SOUNDS a lushness that has seldom , if ever , been matched . `` Would n't it be Nice '' is a joyous romp that launches PET SOUNDS on a very high , longing note . Dazzling harmonies highlight the ballad `` You Still Believe in Me '' before the band swings into the highly personal , uptempo `` That 's Not Me . '' Brian Wilson 's romantic `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head on My Shoulder ) '' is amazingly intimate , and then the mood shifts once more for a romp with `` I 'm Waiting for the Day . '' The jazzy instrumental `` Let 's Go Away for Awhile '' leads into one of the Beach Boys ' most beloved story songs , `` Sloop John B , '' a folky , jaunty-sounding song that tells a very sad and disturbing tale . If PET SOUNDS is arguably the best album of the past 50 years , then `` God Only Knows '' is arguably the best song . Take a stunningly beautiful melody , overlay it with instantly relatable and honest lyrics and a bracingly innocent vocal performance filled with longing and the sweet pain that only love can bring ... and then wrap it in some of the lushest arranging and instrumentation ever heard on record ... and you have a song that is an enduring and beloved classic . Confession and hope imbue the next track , `` I Know There 's An Answer '' with a positive , refreshing sense of survival ... made all the more poignant now knowing Brian 's state of mind when he was working on PET SOUNDS and the subsequent SMILE . The tempo picks up again for `` Here Today , '' before cooling back down again for the heartbreaking `` I Just Was n't Made for These Times , '' a song destined to be Brian Wilson 's epitaph . The title track is a cool , exotic instrumental that sounds like a surf tune arranged and orchestrated by Nelson Riddle . With `` Caroline , No '' Brian Wilson takes a very simple line , `` Where did your long hair go ? '' and spins it into a metaphor for lost innocence in life , in relationships , and indeed , for an entire generation . One finds themselves overusing the word `` poignant '' to describe songs on PET SOUNDS but is certainly is an apt word ... especially for `` Caroline , No '' . The bonus track , `` Hang On to Your Ego , '' is an alternate take for `` I Know There 's An Answer , '' and it is enlightening when juxtaposed with the final version . Because of it 's cohesiveness musically and thematically , PET SOUNDS is one of those few CDs that virtually demands to be listened to , uninterrupted , from start to finish every time . Give it a spin and let it grow on you ... I used to love PET SOUNDS , but now , I consider it an absolutely indespensible part of my CD collection . I seldom go anywhere without it .	1
For someone with at least a passing knowledge of most of the big names and albums of the '60s , I ca n't believe I had not heard of this phenomenal record until perhaps a decade ago . ( Then again , it was n't a certified million seller until April 2000 , so I 've read . ) How was it possible ? Add my name to the endless list of people who thought the Beach Boys were a wimpy , horrible band that only American teenagers of the 1960s could like , only to discover that Pet Sounds is superb . Or maybe we love it because it 's not really a Beach Boys album , it 's a Brian Wilson album.Despite my reservations , I finally picked it up a year ago ( about April 2000 , come to think of it ! ) and was floored . It 's a gem from start to finish , pretty much . 'Would n't It Be Nice ' and the gorgeous 'God Only Knows ' are familiar to even non-fans like me , but there are quality songs all over the place , in particular 'I Just Was n't Made For These Times ' . The record would have been improved by omitting 'Sloop John B . ' , as Brian wished , but , as the suits told him , hey , we got ta have a hit song , right ? The song is okay but it just does n't fit here . Now , Good Vibrations ... oh , well.Everything you 've read about Wilson 's production is true . It 's brilliant and sometimes over-the-top . The vocals are stunning . But I do not go along with the universal line that the lyrics here are anything special . There are some good ones , and they 're a helluva lot better than previous BB material , but Dylan had nothing to fear.I ca n't believe that only 24 people have reviewed this disc so far . It 's probably a manifestation of the phenomenon that has surrounded Pet Sounds from the start : it 's better thought of in England ( a Mojo poll recently nominated it the planet 's No.1 album ) than it is in the US . Strange . Maybe Beach Boys fans still do n't like it ?	1
Pet Sounds is an album that is totally beyond comparison . To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement , and also a little misleading . This music is beyond categorization as & quot ; pop & quot ; -- it 's simply brilliant , idiosyncratic MUSIC . That being said , there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record . Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you 'll ever hear . It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds . It is unlike anything that came before or after . Nothing in the Beatles ' over-hyped catalog even comes close -- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin 's production than the & quot ; Fab Four & quot ; . Remember , Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination -- Brian uses the Boys as & quot ; instruments & quot ; -- composed , arranged , produced/assembled , dreamed as a coherent whole.This album should be heard by EVERYONE , whatever you believe your musical to be . It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study , consider and enjoy . Beyond essential.This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix . Obviously , it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated , but I 'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good , offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize . It 's not a substitute for the original , but a great addendum . Honestly , the best version is the DCC & quot ; gold & quot ; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP . But , I own about 7 different copies and versions of this album on various format , and this & quot ; two-fer & quot ; offeres excellent sound an value .	1
Paul McCartney himself credits Brian Wilson 's Pet Sounds as the muze for Sgt . Pepper 's . Listen critically to the tracks and echos of Pepper resonate , from the melodious use of bass guitar to the masterful orchestration of these odes to teenage angst.Is Pet Sounds better than Pepper ? Beside the point . But without Pet Sounds , and the competition Brian Wilson represented to the fab four , you may very well have a different Pepper , or perhaps no Pepper at all.You have n't heard genius until you 've heard Pet Sounds . It is an album for the ages .	1
This time in 2 different mixes . Authentitcity in the mono version , and a stereo version for Hi-Fi freaks . I 'm over the moon about this one	1
Two essential Beach Boys CD 's are out - the & quot ; Sounds Of Summer & quot ; greatest hits package , the best Beach Boys compilation ever , and the majestic & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; , Brian Wilson 's masterpiece . Wilson did n't tour while preparing this opus , and used session players with the exception of the vocals . After all , nobody could harmonize better than his own band.What he delivered was a collection of the most beautiful pop music ever assembled on one album . Studio effects add ambience and a slight touch of the avant garde , but the songs themselves are the true gems. & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; with its impeccable harmonies and melody is one of the greatest songs ever , and Wilson tops that with one of the saddest but gorgeous songs ever with & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times. & quot ; The whole album is so good that it should go on forever . Reaching the ballad & quot ; Caroline , No & quot ; is a musical journey that does not last nearly long enough , thus guaranteeing this album 's playability for a long long time after buying it.If another civilization were to ask me to give them one reason why this planet with all its hatred should n't be charred to a cinder , I 'd play them & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . Maybe they 'd let us off the hook for a while .	1
... pop albums going back or forward in time . Let 's face it , there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock . I was in 8th grade when this album came out , and always liked it alot , and the funny thing is not until maybe 30 years later , did I ever meet anyone who liked it much . But I 've always been a big BBoys fan . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; is among the finest compositions ever , and , along with a handful of Brian 's songs , deserves inclusion in the 20th Century canon , along with Gershwin 's and Kern 's best , etc . I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children 's choir , which sounds better than the BBoys.Beyond this , most the tunes seem to be about late adolescent angst , high production value or not . As one gets into the Middle Years of life , can anyone really praise & quot ; Would n't it be Nice & quot ; , or & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; to the Sky ? They remind me of whining choir boys , stretching to hit a note . Yes , Brian was looking for a new sound at the time , but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work . It 's true they were still very young ( mid- 20 's probably ) when they did PET SOUNDS..The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better , like & quot ; I Know there 's an Answer & quot ; , & quot ; Here Today & quot ; , and & quot ; I 'm Waiting for the Day & quot ; , with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds . Along with their own SURFS UP , this is among the great late 60 's , early 70 's pop/rock albums . Yes , it 's up there with the best of the Beatles , Simon and Garfunkel , and the Byrds . But 's let 's not go overly gaga on it ! Brian another Mozart or Handel ? ? Come on , let 's not overdo a good thing !	1
One thing was always clear when one discussed the most popular artists or bands from the 1960 's , The Beach Boys were near the top of each and every list and at one time in the 1960 's were voted the most popular band . Sultry vocals and harmonies , great songwriting about things that most people , in the U.S. in particular , could understand and relate to , being on the beach , cars and girls . However , Brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him . This began to eat him up inside as the record label and those within his own band , Mike Love in particular , could n't nor would n't allow themselves to understand . I 've heard many reasons for his nervous breakdowns but I believe this to be the catalyst.This was a man who was hearing wonderful musical themes in his head and was not being allowed the time , space and creative freedom to explore and bring these themes into fruition . On top of that , the `` British Invasion '' was in full swing and those artists and bands were bringing a fresh perspective on music , both it 's recording and production , to the world as well as the `` Motown Sound '' topping the charts with one great artist after another . Fate typically does things when least expected and fate saw an exhausted Wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the `` Rubber Soul '' album was being released by the Beatles . It would be the album that helped to validate the direction Wilson was feeling his music and that of The Beach Boys should be going.He found his creative `` second wind '' and with the help of friend and lyricist Tony Asher , he begin to compose , write , produce and record the songs that would become `` Pet Sounds . '' It was truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever . When his fellow band mates returned off of the remainder of the tour Brian had left , he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocals . Once the other members , along with Brian , laid down their gorgeous vocals which , as usual , were one of the many strengths of the album , they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same . This album would inspire a whole host of artists to change their entire perspective on how songs should be both written and recorded.Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought processes . George Martin , their brilliant producer , also was listening to the album and it was now the catalyst for what would become `` Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . '' Funny how fate and destiny work , is n't it ? Bravo to you Mr. Brian Wilson , I recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what was produced . You and Mr. Asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly , validated your true genius.P.S . Here 's what others were saying about the album and Brian Wilson : Eric Clapton stated that `` All of us , Ginger Baker , Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released . It encompasses everything that 's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one . `` Elton John has said of the album , `` For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement . I had never heard such magical sounds , so amazingly recorded . It undoubtedly changed the way that I , and countless others , approached recording . It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty . `` Beatles producer George Martin stated that `` Without Pet Sounds , Sgt . Pepper would n't have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds . `` Paul McCartney has said `` It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water . I love the album so much . I 've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life . I figure no one is educated musically 'til they 've heard that album . I love the orchestra , the arrangements . It may be going overboard to say it 's the classic of the century , but to me , it certainly is a total , classic record that is unbeatable in many ways . I 've often played Pet Sounds and cried . I played it to John [ Lennon ] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence , it was the record of the time . The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines and also , putting melodies in the bass line . That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper , it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines . `` God Only Knows '' is a big favourite of mine , very emotional , always a bit of a choker for me , that one . On `` You Still Believe in Me '' , I love that melody - that kills me . That 's my favourite , I think , it 's so beautiful right at the end comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies , sends shivers up my spine . `` Bob Dylan has said of Brian Wilson 's talents , `` That ear - I mean , Jesus , he 's got to will that to the Smithsonian . `` Roger Waters stated that along with Sgt Pepper , Pet Sounds `` completely changed everything about records for me . `` Elvis Costello stated `` Last summer , I heard `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) '' played on the cello . It sounded beautiful and sad , just as it does on Pet Sounds . `` Pete Townshend stated `` 'God Only Knows ' is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared ; it still sounds perfect '' .Tom Petty stated `` I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds . I do n't think there is anything better than that , necessarily . I do n't think you 'd be out of line comparing him to Beethoven - to any composer . ''	1
What it is there to say about this album . It is without doubt one of the greatest albums of the popular music era . However until recently I did n't know the album that well , and so I 've put it on my Ipod so that I 'd hear it a little more frequently . With the Ipod in shuffle mode occasionally a brilliant track would come on that I did n't know ( did n't even know it was The Beach Boys believe it or not ) , and I 'd rush over to the Ipod to find out what the track was , only to find it was from Pet Sounds.So what makes it so good . Well for me its the combination of the beautiful sounds that Brian Wilson produced for the album , combined with his brilliant songwriting . Perhaps its best summed up by 'God Only Knows ' , which is such an exquistely crafted song , with trademark Beach Boys harmonies and that achingly beautiful melody . However the marvellous 'Here Today ' pushes it close as the best track on the album.It really should n't matter what sort of music you like , this album should be in your collection .	1
There is nothing that I can say about this album that has n't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz , classical , and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try . I was n't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martinand Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more..	1
Pet Sounds appears on many top 50,100,500 lists , for very good reason . It was a masterpiece when released ( OK , I did n't exist when it was released , so I 'm basing this on the knowledge of albums coming out around the same time period ) . It is still a masterpiece today , however not many people know just how much of their music today was either influenced directly by Pet Sounds , or influenced by a band that was influenced by Pet Sounds . In the Rolling Stone top 500 album list , only one album ranks higher , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . In interviews with Paul McCartney , he has stated that this album influenced himself , and through proxy if nothing else , The Beatles themselves . Sgt Pepper was seen as The Beatles response to Pet Sounds and some argue it tops Pet Sounds , others it equals and to others still , does n't live up to Pet Sounds . If you are a fan of The Beatles or any other band that shares their influence , you owe it to yourself to hear this album at least once in your life to understand just what this album has done for the world of music.Multi layering vocals , instruments and sound effects ( bicycle bells ? Really ? And you 'll be surprised that is actually WORKS ) all come together in an amazing sonic experience that just has to be heard to be believed.I understand that The Beach Boys may not be for everyone . You may not be able to appreciate the music , but listen and appreciate how influential the album was . And no , just because it was influential it does n't mean YOU have to enjoy it . I 'm just saying that if you want to understand music you need to listen to this album.So how does this particular set get to be called `` complete ? '' It contains every version of the album recorded . It contains a CD that has the original mono recording , the recording the group focused on when it was originally created along with a fairly newly minted stereo mix . For those that claim that stereo of this album is sacrilege , you must realize that Brian directly oversaw this project and what it brings to the table is what Brian himself approved . The only disappointment with the stereo mix , for me , is the missing sounds and some vocal accompaniment . This is all explained in the booklet with the set , however . Essentially these vocals and sounds do n't exist outside of the final mono mix and as there is no easy way to lift the vocals/sounds from the final mono mix , they had to make due with what they had . The missing pieces are minimal and will , of course , always lend credence to the 'superiority ' of the mono mix , however I feel each mix has its place and gladly listen to either.Then you have the 5.1 mix . This mix is also missing the same sounds/vocal accompaniment of the mono mix for the same reason . The producer has also created another Brian approved mix , so there are essentially 3 valid mixes for this album , all Brian approved . This mix carefully blends the front sound stage with the rear to give the album a surround feel ; you almost feel like you are in the middle of the band . I personally prefer the mono and stereo mix , but 5.1 mix should n't be dismissed as it does have it merit . Who would n't want to be sonically surrounded by this amazing album ? It 's not a mix I find myself wanting to listen to all the time , but it is a great companion to a great album.Included on the DVD portion of the album is the 5.1 mix , which is nice , however the real shining star is the high quality 96kHz/24-bit PCM stereo mix . This brings even more depth and breadth to this album . There is also a bonus track , a 96kHz/24-bit PCM mono mix of Hang on to Your Ego . For the video portion , they take a look at the making of Pet Sounds with interviews with many involved in its creation . You also get personal reflections on the album by many involved in its creation , along with a BBC show excerpt , promo clips and a God Only Knows photo slide show to accompanied by that track.If you are a fan of Pet Sounds , do yourself a favor and purchase the 40th Anniversary CD+DVD set . You get a completely complete collection of each version of the album ( mono , stereo and 5.1 ) and some great video exploration of the album.If you are n't a fan of the album , I still recommend you hear the album at least once , for which I recommend the mono album or the mono/stereo album if you can find it . This album wo n't change your mind if you are n't a Beach Boys fan , but it will give you some insight on a highly influential album.Highly recommended.OF NOTE : there is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs high quality SACD version of this album coming down the line . My only issue with this album is that it ONLY contains the stereo mix ; no mono version will be included . Considering the trouble they had in trying to rebuild the album in stereo to the point of excluding certain sounds and vocal accompaniment , I ca n't see why MFSL would choose to offer just the stereo mix on SACD . Considering this DVD contains the same sonic quality ( 96kHz/24-bit PCM ) I 'm not sure how much of an improvement the SACD will offer . If the MFSL included a 96kHz/24-bit PCM mono version of the album as well , I 'd recommend it in an instant . Guess I 'll hold off my judgment of the MFSL SACD until it is released .	1
In 1966 , when it was released , this album did n't sell as well as previous Beach Boys albums . I do n't know why . I thought it was fantastic . Now it 's regarded as a critical success ! Well , I guess better late than never . The subject matter is mostly boy-girl relationships - `` Sloop John B '' is a notable exception - with a little venturing into the territory of introspection . But the music ! The melodies and instrumentation rival the music of The Beatles ' `` Rubber Soul '' in variety and inventiveness ; and like those songs , these manage to display that genius in the standard ( then ) 3-minute track . `` God Only Knows '' is one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard , and I 'm not saying that because of the religious reference , because I am an agnostic . `` Would n't It Be Nice '' sounds like a more typical Beach Boys record , but the lyrical content was daring enough to get it banned on some radio stations . `` Caroline No '' is gorgeous , the lyrics and the music . This CD gives it all to you in both mono and stereo . Mono may be OK for sentimental reasons , but I recommend the stereo ( Tracks 15-27 ) for sheer pleasure . Too bad that Brian Wilson suffered a mental decline after this album . Who knows what he might have produced ?	1
OK , I have read several reviews here giving this masterpiece a two and three star rating and for the reason being that it `` is not the greatest album ever . '' So , if the album does not qualify as greatest ever it gets a ** ? Wow , that is going to leave a couple million records with * out there . Well , In my humble opinion , this is arguably the greatest album ever . And guess what , this is the only Beach Boys album I own . So do n't go calling me some Beach Boy fanatic . But I can respect genius , especially genius that is as far ahead of it 's time as this album . Every song is brilliant and in just the right place . I would put it in the category of Led Zeppelin IV , Who 's Next , and several other classics . You do n't think it is the best ever ? So be it , but spare me these ** and *** star ratings , that is ridiculous !	1
I guess that by now saying that you love music and not be fond of `` Pet Sounds '' is almost a paradox since Brian Wilson 's skywritten testament embodies everything that 's good about pop music : excellent tunes , lyrics , vocal harmonies and even some flourishes to add a wonderful , dreamy and lush feel to it all . `` You still believe in me '' , '' God only knows '' and `` I know there 's an answer '' are certainly among my favorite songs and added proof that good music towers through the decades without losing a trace of its greatness- '' Forever Changes '' , '' Odessey and Oracle '' and `` Pet Sounds '' will always be great , come what may .	1
This really is one of the great albums ever , and the remastered sound is very good . The only big difference between this MP3 version and the two-disc set of the same recordings is that the set gives you a DVD with a `` making-of '' documentary and both the original mono mixes and new stereo mixes , plus a bonus track . This MP3 set has only the remastered stereo mixes . `` Pet Sounds '' was a groundbreaking record , and had a huge impact on other musicians . It is definitely the high-water mark for the Beach Boys . This is not anything like their early Jan & Dean-inspired surf music . It invented a whole new vocabulary of sounds and forms for pop music.More than ever before , the Beach Boys ' leader , Brian Wilson , decided he was going to go in a new direction and write a cohesive album , over the protests of many others in the band . He was definitely right . The Beach Boys never reached this level of creativity again , but `` Pet Sounds '' was enough to put them in the pantheon of the greats , even if this quality of artistic achievement was not sustained over time.Wilson says he was inspired to make the record by the Beatles ' `` Rubber Soul '' album . The Beatles in turn credited `` Pet Sounds '' as the inspiration for `` Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' . Paul McCartney still says he is crazy about the album , John Lennon even acknowledged it , and George Martin said Sgt Pepper 's would never have been made without `` Pet Sounds '' . Eric Clapton says it 's one of the greatest pop albums of all time and Elton John talks about how it changed the way he and everyone else approached recording . I say this just to underline that it 's hard to underestimate the impact this record had on the development of popular music as we know it.There are plenty of `` greatest hits '' here . The album starts out with the classic `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , one of the most optimistic and upbeat romantic pop hits ever -- and which also includes incredible layers of sound that deserve a good listening to with headphones . `` God Only Knows '' was the B-side to that single , but became a major hit on its own . `` Caroline , No '' , `` Sloop John B '' , `` Let 's Go Away for a While '' and `` Here Today '' were also singles and are probably known at some level by most listeners.But do n't just get it for the hits . A lot of the other songs are slower and more complex , but are really marvels of both pop composition and sound engineering , especially when you think about the 1960s technology they were working with . There are layers upon layers of crystal-clear sounds to enjoy and get lost in.This album is every bit as impressive a recording as something like Pink Floyd 's `` Dark Side of the Moon '' -- it just seems `` lighter '' because , well , it is . It 's an optimistic , feel-good record even when its gets sad and melancholy , which it does pretty often . I still ca n't figure out quite how Brian Wilson pulled that off.If you do n't know Pet Sounds , this deal ca n't be beat , especially at the $ 1.99 `` Deal of the Day '' price on May 1 , 2009 . Once the price goes up again , also consider one of the CDs or CD sets available out there . You wo n't regret it !	1
What can I say ? A pop masterpiece , especially if you sequence & # 34 ; Would n't it Be Nice & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Do n't Talk & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Let 's Go Away for a While & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; God Only Knows & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; I Just Was n't Made for These Times & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Pet Sounds & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; Caroline , No & # 34 ; . I would compare & # 34 ; Caroline , No & # 34 ; in particular to Bacharach 's and David 's and Warwick 's & # 34 ; Anyone Who Had a Heart & # 34 ; : as good as the genre gets .	1
The merits of this album need not be discussed here . Pet Sounds has been widely regarded as a pop classic for over forty years and its popularity shows no sign of letting up . What does need addressing , however , is the sound Capitol has achieved in rendering this recording in Mono on CD.The remastering game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results . Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics . Lucky for us , that 's hardly the case with this reissue of the Beach Boys ' finest hour.Pet Sounds in Mono is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns . The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly . The harmonies coalesce in a way you simply do n't hear on a stereo mix . And the immediacy is impressive .	1
By far the best Beach Boys album ( and the best Brian Wilson album , along with the recently unearthed treasure `` Smile '' ) . The harmonies and lyrics in the songs are perfect , and remain timeless no matter how many times you listen to it or how many years have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelves . It was n't a big hit in the States , mostly due to the fact nobody was ready for it . It 's such a well-organized and cohesive work , much unlike what people were used to the Beach Boys putting out at the time . They decided to be something more than just a surf band , or a catchy and trendy pop band , something which nobody gave them credit for . Compare `` God Only Knows '' to `` 409 '' or `` Surfin ' Safari '' , and you shall understand what I mean . The melodies are perfect , and blend greatly with the vocals . This is a rare album without a single track to be skipped . If you have n't caught on yet , freaking buy this !	1
This is a masterpiece . I wo n't get into the Sgt . Peppers or Rubber Soul vs. Pet Sounds . I let this classic stand on its own . Brian Wilson stretched his wings on this one and the band followed . It is , at times , a little uneven , but the music stands up . & quot ; Would n't it be Nice & quot ; and & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; are the deserved hits , but do n't push aside the other not-so-popular titles like & quot ; I Just Was n't Made for These Times , & quot ; & quot ; I Know There 's an Answer & quot ; and probably the most underrated Beach Boys song of all time , & quot ; Caroline No. & quot ; A truly introspective album . It 's deserving of the classic label . Truly a fantastic album . The Beach Boys showed they could do more than just surf and drag .	1
Do I recommend it ? Of course ! I just want to say that being used to the mono mix for so long I wanted to hear it in stereo . But honestly the stereo mix does n't do anything for me . Naturally this is an important piece of any music collection .	1
This is possibly one of my favourite albums - period . The melodies beautiful , the harmony , arrangements.etc were well beyond their time . For a record released in 1966 , it sounds amazing on CD . A far superior album to either Sgt . Pepper 's and a bit better than Rubber Soul , there are only a couple of songs I do n't really like . A tiny gripe I have with the album the melodies on songs such as Do you still believe me are a bit repetitive . Although nonetheless very good . Btw the song 'God Only Knows ' is often cited as the album 's best but personally I would rank it about 3rd or 4th on the album .	1
Does everyone already know that the title track , Pet Sounds , was an instrumental piece written specifically for a James Bond movie and then rejected by the film 's producers ? For anyone who thinks they know or love this album , the Pet Sounds Box Set is a must . People will never fully realize the Perfected Magnificence of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys until they analyze these Pet Sounds compositions and arrangements broken down - 'instrumental only ' and 'vocals only ' - through a pair of really high-quality headphones .	1
PLEASE NOTE-THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEW AUDIO FIDELITY GOLD VERSION OF `` PET SOUNDS '' FOR SOME REASON AMAZON IS GROUPING REVIEWS OF THIS ALBUM UNDER ONE HEADING.One of Brian Wilson 's masterpieces `` Pet Sounds '' was his response to the increasingly sopisticated albums by The Beatles . Working with the best session musicians in the business ( something Wilson would do while The rest of The Beach Boys were touring ) , Wilson composed and produced `` Pet Sounds '' and then invited the band to come in and do the vocals , contribute lyrics as needed , etc.This new Audio Fidelity remaster is the second time that Steve Hoffman has done this popular title . Evidently the original mastertapes are in fragile shape so Hoffman used a first generation copy that was unequalized ( the same one he used on the DCC release ) to remaster this again . I never had the DCC but I did have the Capital mono master and this edition blows away that version which used noise reduction . The album sounds warm and inviting with nice detail and is n't compressed or too loud . The disc is also HDCD encoded for those with high definition CD players . After the debacle with the reissue of `` Heartbeat City '' , it appears that Audio Fidelity got this one right.The booklet includes Brian Wilson 's note on his intent with `` Pet Sounds '' as well as photos but it does n't include the extensive booklet that came with the previous Capital editions of the album which is a bit disappointing . I should note though that all the musicians that played on this classic release are credited in the booklet . Other than that this is a terrific reissue and is available for a limited time with each edition numbered on the cardboard sleeve that houses the jewel box.Brian Wilson 's classic song cycle has never sounded better to me . Highly recommended .	1
I like the Beach Boys , but I have to admit that I prefer their earlier California style hits ( e.g. , Fun , Fun , Fun ) and I 'm not a big fan of 60s music . Nevertheless , `` Pet Sounds '' is undeniably a beautiful CD that still sounds great today . `` Sloop John B '' and `` Would n't It Be Nice '' were top 10 hits in the US and `` God Only Knows '' and `` Caroline , No '' cracked the top 40 , but all the songds sound great . Brian Wilson 's voice has never sounded more beautiful and the harmonies are near-perfect . As a bonus , `` Hang on to Your Ego '' is included ( it was recorded at the same time , but not released ) . It 's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fans via a remake by Frank Black . The liner notes are also terrific and include comments from Brian Wilson as well as a song by song description . Great CD !	1
Just lay back and listen . Brian Wilson never misses a note . His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop . His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass ( the slow middle eight section on & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; ) on this album . These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain . Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves , this is a true pop magnum opus . The best tracks are the gorgeous & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder & quot ; ) , the title cut , and the tear inducing & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; . Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity , Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that have n't aged a day since 1966 . The more you listen to & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; , the more it 's beauty envelopes you .	1
The last person who reviewed Pet Sounds entitled his review `` Masterpiece ? '' and gave it 1 star . He 's entitled to his opinion , though I 'm not one to agree with it . Even Mike Love had his skepticism when he 1st heard the instrumental tracks to Pet Sounds.Brian Wilson had retired from touring in 1965 , due to emotional problems and pressure to write and compose more for the Beach Boys . Though many missed his presence onstage , this allowed him to really get out the sounds inside his brain . He was especially impressed with the craftmanship of the Beatles ' Rubber Soul , which came out around Christmas of that year . Long story short , while Brian 's brothers Carl and Dennis , Mike Love , Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston were busy touring the world from 1965-66 , Brian composed and performed on the instrumental tracks , reducing the band to backup singers . `` Would n't It Be Nice '' opens the album with promise and optimism , and a jaunty koto solo , sounding much like a young man bent on making his romantic dreams come true ( Dennis can be heard singing backup with `` cupped hands '' over his mouth ) . `` You Still Believe In Me '' came from an earlier song `` In My Childhood '' and featured the sounds of a bicycle bell and a car horn from the song `` Childhood . '' Mike sings lead on `` That 's Not Me . '' `` Do n't Talk '' is both haunting and romantic with its strings and the bass which sounds like a beating heart . `` I 'm Waiting For the Day '' has lyrics about a man hopeful to help a woman forget about the last jerk who broke her heart . This piece is heavy on the drums ( particularly in the intro and at the false ending ) and woodwinds ( oboe accompanying the verses and flutes soloing at the last verse ) . `` Let 's Go Away For a Little While '' sounds like it could be during a romance scene in any 1960 's movie , with vibes , strings , a sax and a slide guitar . `` Sloop John B '' is a traditional folk song ( it was Al 's idea that they record this in 1965 ) . Carl sings lead on the ethereal `` God Only Knows , '' which Brian got the idea from praying . Cynical Mike retorted `` Well , I pray to God it sells ! '' Orchestration includes strings , french horns , accordian and harpsichord ( one take includes a sax solo ) . `` I Know There 's An Answer '' was originally `` Hold Onto Your Ego '' ( Mike 's condition for singing on it was that the lyrics were more optimistic sounding ) . Mike sings lead on `` Here Today '' ( one of the more commercial pieces ) . `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' is Brian being brutally honest about the struggle inside himself ( if you 've ever thought to yourself `` Nobody understands me , '' you 're sure to relate ) . This features an eerie theramin solo amidst the heartbreaking melody . The instrumental title track `` Pet Sounds '' cheers things up a bit . Finally , there 's one of the saddest breakup songs ever `` Caroline , No . '' Brian laments the warmth and sweetness in Caroline have disappeared forever . At the end , you hear the sound of a train and Brian 's dogs barking.Pet Sounds may not have sold well when 1st released but has earned crtical acclaim and the right to be known as a masterpiece .	1
I have heard many things said about & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; and none are shorter than the truth . No album has ever caught such raw emotion as this and none will . But to acclaim it as the greatest of all time leaves me wondering were you 're coming from . Let 's start by analyzing the two things that make up great music , lyrics and instrumentation.Lyrically , & quot ; Pet sounds & quot ; is still a beach blonde hair doo type album , with & quot ; Would n't it be nice & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; restating the surfin years of Brian Wilson . Without these songs , this album would have easily been lyrically superior , but every chain has its weaker link and these songs seem made for the charts.After listening to this album 2 or 3 times straight , I feel inferior . The mood this album sets is up there with the mood I felt when I listened to & quot ; Nebraska & quot ; for the first time . The music is what makes this album so great , the lyrics are excellent in most songs , do n't get me wrong , but there are some spots that could have been removed.To compare & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; to & quot ; Sgt . Pepper 's & quot ; is just rediculous . Although many will argue that Sgt . Pepper 's was made as a rebutle to Pet Sounds , we still have to look at the facts . Sgt . Peppers creates a mood with lyrics and instrumentation that had never been done . It had been done in Pet Sounds , but never to an extent to lend itself to the music as much as Sgt . Pepper 's . It took me three or four listens to Pet Sounds before I declared it musically innovative , while it only took me the first track of Sgt . Pepper 's to declare it musically superior to anything I 've heard up until then ( with the exception of Revolver , and Blonde on Blonde ( which is different musical innovation altogether ) ) .We must first remember too that & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; itself was a rebutle to & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; which proves that The Beatles were no followers . They created their own music , and others took a seat behind them to pick up some pointers.But it 's not the lyrics that lend itself to the greatness of this album . It 's pure and simply THE MOOD . When I got done listening to this album , I felt like crying . I felt as though someone with so much emotional problems and societal anguish had sat down right beside me and poured his guts out.Musically , this album is astonishing . But a lot of the songs seem revamped , almost re-used . Maybe that 's just the mood , which can often times leave you thinking that you 've just listened to one song for 40 minutes . Which is not a bad thing , often times , it 's the best compliment an album can get . I think this album was also the first to end on the most important note , the one note that leaves the listener satisfied and dismayed at the same time . This powerful ending may have been stolen for Sgt . Pepper 's but then again you ca n't make a musical advancement if you do n't learn from the artists of today , and what Pet Sounds did was definanlty a musical advancement.This album is Brian Wilson , nothing more , nothing less . Everything here is his most inner feelings . What more can you ask from an album than truthfulness.In conclusion , I would recomend Pet Sounds to every serious music fan , and even those that are just trying to break into popular music . But do n't run around comparing it to Sgt . Pepper 's because the two have different motives . For one thing , Sgt Peppers has the emotion of 4 people , while Pet Sounds has one . But the emotion of Pet Sounds still manages to top that of Sgt . which is an incredible feet . I feel as though I 've contradicted myself . So just grab your box of kleenex and pop this album into the CD or Record player , you will not be disapointed.thank youDave	1
I do n't care if this entire world that 's mostly full of people who either hate the Beach Boys or only think of them as a surf/car band think or will think that Pet Sounds is overrated/dull/corny/whatever . I 'm not as bitter about emoting one 's self as they seem to be . I do n't care about whether it stacks up with Sgt Pepper ( I always thought that album was a step down in song quality from the perfect Revolver , but that 's just me ) . One influenced the other , and that 's it . I do n't even care how many times it tops the lists as best album of all time . I do n't think that sort of thing is possible , and it only leads to backlash , like on here . I just know that Pet Sounds changed my life , that at the end of the day , when I play it , i feel love and mercy and acceptance . It 's my favorite album out of my hundreds of CDs . If music 's my religion , then Pet Sounds is my bible . Thanks , Brian Wilson.And , to paraphrase my favorite song of all time : & quot ; i wish that every listen was neverending , oh would n't it be nice ? & quot ;	1
Back in 1962 , Stan Getz ( tenor sax ) and Charlie Byrd ( acoustic guitar ) collaborated to produce 'Jazz Samba ' - an album which combines the sounds of West Coast cool jazz with the swaying rhythms of the Bossa Nova . I do n't listen to much jazz , so I 'm hardly qualified to review the album from this perspective ; nonetheless , 'Jazz Samba ' has a lot of appeal for me , as someone with more mainstream tastes in popular music.Whilst the playing of Stan Getz is far from aggressive , it is the dominant feature of the album . He has a fluent and unforced style of playing - one which gives the impression that he is breathing into the saxophone rather than blowing into it . By contrast , the delicate playing of Charlie Byrd is far more subdued . Even if there are times when his playing seems to be relegated to that of accompaniment only ( at least , that 's how it struck me ) , he also presents the listener with a number of exquisite short solos . The supporting musicians ( on acoustic bass , 2nd . guitar and drums ) provide the rhythmic impetus for the album , and their playing is also a delight.I like the whole album but , because I tend to prefer music with a somewhat slower tempo , 'Desafinado ' , 'Samba Triste ' , 'Samba de Uma Nota So ' and 'Bahia ' are the songs that I enjoy most . There is a bonus track ( compared to the original vinyl release ) but , as far as I can tell , this is nothing more than a 2 minute radio edit of 'Desafinado ' . My version of the album was advertised as 're-issued and re-mastered ' , but the word 're-mastered ' appears nowhere in the liner notes/production credits . My copy is a 'Verve Master Edition ' with liner notes boasting 'High-resolution , 20-bit digital transfer ' - this sounds pretty impressive , and I must say that , subjectively , I thought the sound quality was exceptionally good . 'Jazz Samba ' features a lot of fine playing from all of the musicians , and I think the sound quality is outstanding . The music creates a spacious atmosphere , and it also has a high 'chill factor ' . I think 'Jazz Samba ' is an essential purchase for anyone who likes the sensuous and infectious rhythms of modern Latin American music .	1
Not as good as the Getz/Gilberto album ( how many albums are ? ) recorded two years later , but it is a very enjoyable effort by saxman Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd . Unlike the Getz/Gilberto record , this one has no vocals . It 's a short and sweet instrumental effort without a note wasted or misplaced . Desafinado ( `` Out of Tune '' ) and Samba de Uma Nota So ( `` One Note Samba '' ) are the standouts . The album is expensive considering the 35 minute playing time , but you will listen to it many times , trust me .	1
the perfect introduction to U.S.-filtered bossa nova . I say 'U.S . ' because the sound Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz bring to these classics are considerably smoother and broader than originals which can be often raspy or intensely private , but always richly nuanced . Getz 's playing is masterfully self-effacing , never virtuosic for its own sake : you might forget he 's even there as he conducts intimate conversations with Byrd 's often Reinhardt-like guitar , or the quietly insistent rhythms , and yet he is the soul of this beach music that sounds so sad.The best tracks are the old Jobim favourites 'Desafinado ' and 'One note samba ' , in which the familiar melodies are taken through the most intricate , yet never alienating , variations , always obeying that hypnotic bossa nova beat . 'E Luxo Se ' is a wide-eyed beauty , beaming the kind of melody that makes you instantly happy no matter how miserable you felt before you heard it . The same could be said for the whole of this marvellous album , perhaps best listened to at night when you 're feeling weary , ready to dream ...	1
This is probably the best - if not - the most important and significant Jazz album that I have and will probably ever own , hands down . It was the first CD I ever owned and still in my top 10 list of *all* time . Getz is one of the key contributors to introducing the American public to the nuances , soul , and sensuality of Brazilian-influenced jazz back in the early 60s . & quot ; Desifinado & quot ; is a punchy , playful tune that takes the listener upon a delight samba dance . & quot ; Samba Triste & quot ; is sad , and soulful so much so that you can hear the tenor sax lightly crying in Getz 's hands . In all tracks , Getz and Byrd take the listener to a point of jazz-induced highs , lows , and in-betweens only to gently pull you back and forth a few more times before slowly ending each dance so you feel complete . If you have never tasted the richness of South American influenced Jazz this is probably the best place to start . Dinner is served and with Getz/Byrd as your chefs be prepared to experience a sensuous and filling 5 course meal . Bottoms up ! Moving in Stereo - d.i.roberts	1
I first heard this album in the mid-1980s when I was running a used record store in Florida . I did n't know samba from Sambo , and had only a vague idea of who Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd were at the time , but after playing the LP a few times I was hooked . This music was unlike anything else I was listening to at the time ( classic rock , alternative rock , vintage soul , etc . ) but it really struck a chord . Irresistable and magical tunes , the kind that truly evoked a unique mood and atmosphere . I played the record to death and have done likewise with my old CD copy . This music just never gets `` old '' or boring . A classic in the truest sense of the word . You do n't have to be a jazz fan to enjoy this , just let the music play and let it soak into your consciousness . Laid back and lovely .	1
I think it is important to remember that this site is an international one , with reviewers and browsers from all over the globe - so I can easily see Brazilians shaking their collective cabesas over the comment that this was the first Bossa Nova record . It was definately one of the first to introduce samba and bossa rhythms to the U.S . Both Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley were using bossa standards in their repetoire at the time also ( much to the chagrin of some of their fans ) . As to the comment that & quot ; Jazz Samba & quot ; is a better and more fluid recording than & quot ; Getz/Gilberto & quot ; , I can not agree . Byrd is a great player , and even a great player in the Brazilian mode , but he is no Joao Gilberto . & quot ; Jazz Samba & quot ; is 'fluid ' in my opinion also , but because the dynamics are never bumped up a notch . & quot ; Getz/Gilberto & quot ; has more subtlety , better playing by all the musicians involved ( Jobim 's piano work on 'Corcorvado ' alone is more subtle and his chordal sparcity on & quot ; Doralice & quot ; more dynamic than any moment on & quot ; Jazz Samba & quot ; ) , and one incredible singer to boot ( and I do n't mean Astrud ) . Getz plays far better and way more 'in the pocket ' with Joao and a real Brazilian rhythm section . Do n't get me wrong , I love this recording . & quot ; O Pato & quot ; is a masterpiece for its time and the recording stands up well today in general , but when the first & quot ; bossa nova & quot ; recording was made has been discussed at length - some even say Laurindo Almeida may have made it a decade before , but the general consensus is that Jobim , Gilberto , Lyra , Castro-Neves , et al . were doing it in the later half of the 1950s . That does not diminish the greatness of this recording then , and it sounds great today as well .	1
This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago . In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music , but not here . Stan Getz 's feathery , soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying , dancing Brazilian rhythms . Charlie Byrd 's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less . The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.This recording is n't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential . If you like Getz 's playing , be sure to get some of his other , non-bossa-nova recordings as well . ( One more caveat : those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental . )	1
How do you critique the album that started an era ? Forty years later , Jazz Samba is still one of the most relaxing , rhythmically pleasing albums made . All instrumental , with the tenor sax of Stan Getz ( the guy John Coltrane professed to admire ! ) and inspired guitar of Charlie Byrd . The entire album was recorded in one session in the performance hall of a Washington , D.C. , church , and it puts legions of studio albums to shame.While Desafinado and Bahia are the best known tracks , the album is a seamless experience and it is difficult to single out certain songs as superior . If Getz is one of the masters of the tenor saxophone , it is also hard to separate his proficiency from the effort as a whole -- it truly comes across as a tight ensemble effort . ( For a contrast , Duke Ellington 's masterful and equally essential Money Jungle released the same year finds the trio of Ellington , Mingus and Max Roach locked in a musical duel on a couple of tracks. ) Favorites ? I enjoy Samba de Uma Nota So , but every time I reach for Jazz Samba I alway listen to the entire album . At least once . This and Getz/Gilberto belong in every jazz collection .	1
Jazz is all about being evocative- the greatest examples of the genre have always been the ones that take the listener to another place , that have expressed emotions and ideas with uncanny accuracy . In essence , the best jazz recordings feel like they 're coming from somewhere inside you , born out of your dreams and private thoughts and inner longings . Which , I guess , is why I 'm so fond of Jazz Samba . The album 's warm , lyrical tone instantly paints a portrait of some sun-splashed and utterly peaeful Brazilian beach , a hidden little paradise by a crystal ocean . But there 's more to it than that . Jazz Samba 's lush textures and instantly hypnotic imagery are downright theraputic . When you 're stressed out , angry , or depressed , this is the ideal record to put on ; the hypnotic , shuffling bass line that opens `` Desafinado '' casts a spell that is n't lifted until Getz 's gorgeous , velvety solo at the end of `` Bahia . '' The music radiates so much warmth and joy in the meantime , wiping away just about every single one of your worries and fears . It really is a neat trick . Of course , like any great piece of music , Jazz Samba is much more than music . Getz and Byrd make for a formidable team , bridging the gap between jazz 's emotive cool and bossa nova 's swinging sensuality with irresisitable finesse . The music is simultaneously dreamy and upbeat , hypnotic and energetic , beautiful and propulsive . Basically , it 's a great album , and one that belongs in every jazz collection .	1
Bossa nova music was created largely by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joo Gilberto in the late 1950s and early 1960s . When Charlie Byrd and his trio heard it , they wanted to make a bossa nova album of their own . The result is this wonderful CD.The CD track set opens with an extended version of `` Desafinado . '' The guitar gets plenty of air time in bossa nova music ; and Charlie Byrd 's guitar solo stuns me with its beauty and sensitivity . `` Desafinado '' plays with a few key changes to enhance the quality of the number ; and the percussion works very well , too . `` Samba Dees Days '' picks up the tempo considerably ; and this ought to brighten any party you play this at ! Stan Getz plays tenor sax to perfection ; and Buddy Deppenschmidt along with Bill Reichenbach play the drums very , very well . `` Samba Triste '' is the only truly mournful sounding samba on this album ; the minor keys work very well as Stan 's melancholy solo enhances the forlorn flavor to `` Samba Triste . `` `` Samba De Uma Nota S & oacute ; ( One Note Samba ) '' exudes elegance and style ; when you listen to this track the fusion of jazz and samba is very evident . `` E Luxo S & oacute ; '' reverts to a faster tempo that really makes you want to get up and dance wherever you are ; and `` Bahia ( Ba & iacute ; a ) '' concludes the album with a silky elegance that is singularly beautiful.There is one extra number . The bonus track is the 45 rpm issue of `` Desafinado . '' Naturally , the shorter version of this number does n't provide us with the luxurious meanderings of the full length track . Nevertheless , it interests the listener to hear what the band chose to include -- and exclude -- when , under time constraints , they had to deliver the number fast yet with all the brightness of the full rendition . You wo n't be disappointed.The liner notes include the original liner notes by Dom Cerulli ; and there are great black and white photos of the band members playing . John Litweiler contributes an informative essay about the creation of the album as well . The quality of the sound is excellent.I highly recommend this CD for any fan of bossa nova music ; and people who enjoy jazz with a samba twist will cherish this one for ages to come .	1
I was fourteen when this album was released and I was instantly smitten . Over the years my musical tastes have evolved , but this album is a constant because it always sounds fresh to my ears.Do a quick run through the sound samples and you will be transported to another place and time . The music is relaxed , but with a definite Brazilian flavor . Incredibly there are no Brazilian musicians on this album . The driving force is Charlie Byrd and his guitar ... and his love of the music itself . In fact , Samba Dees Days is his composition . The other tracks are from Brazilian composers , but none were involved in this album other than the fact that their work was performed.The reason why I call this album ground zero is it introduced bossa to US audiences and quickly spread to the rest of the world . Remember , this is was before the web and it still spread and took hold . More incredible is the genre was relatively new . I had assumed that it was a traditional form of Brazilian music , but in fact it was born in the 1950s , so the fact that a group of American musicians globalized it via this album is incredible as well.There is a back story to this album that I will not go into here because I want to focus on the album itself . I will say that until drummers Buddy Deppenschmidt and Bill Reinchenbach were pulled into the project it almost stalled . In fact , a check of Verve 's session records show that Byrd and Getz and unnamed others attempted six sambas generically named Samba 1 through 6 ) in two sessions in October 1961 , and none of the tracks were issued.Although the 1961 sessions did not bear fruit , they must have learned some lessons because on February 13 , 1962 they returned to the studio ( a building adjacent to the All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington , DC ) and laid down this album . This session has Byrd and Getz backed by Charlie 's brother Gene on guitar and bass and Keter Betts on bass , with Buddy Deppenschmidt on drums and Bill Reinchenbach handling other percussion . As the sound samples and history show , they nailed it.To my ears this fifty-two year old album is timeless . Getz went to to collaborations with some of the creators and top Brazilian musicians in the genre , culminating inGetz/Gilberto , which may have eclipsed this one commercially . However , this remains ground zero for bossa nova 's world spread and is important musically and historically .	1
This is an amazing jazz album . You got Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz together , making the first bossa nova jazz record in the U.S . It got a Grammy , it made thousands of listeners transport themselves to a calm South American beach . To top it off , the lead drummer , Buddy Deppenschmidt , is my own drum teacher . How boss is that ? Awesome jazz with a twist . All instrumental . My greatest discovery out of Brazil since Sepultura.Pop it in and chill ...	1
This fabulous record shows off the great artistry of a master musician on saxophone . Getz seems to have such a natural feel to this type of music . The guitar of Charlie Byrd is also superb and blends into the music in a wonderful manner . The other amazing aspect of this record is that I never tire of listening to it .	1
It seems sometimes this album ( at least by the public ) is overshadowed by the mega-popular and best sellingGetz/Gilberto , but that is somewhat harsh , as this album is ever bit as worthy . In fact the two should easily be bought together , as both are essential Bossa Nova albums and the only two albums you need that belong to the genre ( as far as I 'm concerned ) . It 's a bit more accessible and more upbeat , with more subtle swinging rhythms and quicker than it 's companion . Those who bought the aforementioned mega album and were let down a bit by the downtempo will be happy that this album contains what they wanted.That 's not to say this album suffers from lack of gorgeousness . Right from the start , an essential love song , Desafindo , opens up the album , and the singing lines are replaced by gorgeous saxaphone playing . And while Gilberto was a vital part of that record , Charlie Bird 's guitar playing blows Gilberto away . He actually plays some solos , and boy are they pretty mean ! Very intricate and melodic , and he 's just as good as providing a gorgeous rhythm as he is when he adds spice and flair to the songs . The aforementioned beats are played great with the backing band , and Stan Getz 's saxaphone is in fine form , as usual . And unlike it 's companion , there are no vocals.Back to the songs . Each of these songs will satisfy the hunger for bossa nova rhythms . ( but it 's not the same rhythm for the whole length , of course ! ) , and it 's as melancholy either . The only track to be featured on later albums , Desafindo , is agruably better than the hit version , as the instrumental section is a lot different , as well as the intro . It definitely wo n't replace the vocalist track , but the vocalist track will never be like this one . The whole album is not very long , especially if you cut out the second cut of Desafino ( why would you though ) , but the time suits it just fine . It 's over quick , but it does n't have any filler , thank god.Bossa Nova , to the unitiated , may be hard to find , considering most `` well known '' bossa nova is the garbage you can find on one of those lame albums you can find at any gift shop in Palm Desert , California . This trascends all of the elevator muzak garbage you can find at the aforementioned gift shops . If you say you like Bossa Nova , and all you own are one of those lame noveltly albums ( the kind in those gift shops that are part of those listening things with the cheap speakers that also sell native american music ) or a couple of _______ albums by Thievery Corporation , I advise you pick this andGetz/Gilbertoand experience the real thing.8.0/10	1
`` Great companion to `` Getz/Gilberto '' . Pure Samba without singers.Charlie Byrd went to Brazil and heard the then unknown Antonio Carlos Jobim . He played Jobim records for Stan Getz , they got Keter Betts and two drummers went to All Soul 's Unitarian Church in DC , and created the first Bossa Nova , Samba record in the US - a monster hit with `` Desafinado '' . It changed America , and Jazz forever . For a decade every Jazz player tried to imitate it . The best selling Jazz CD of the decade , that 's how good it is . A number one Hit of the Billboard Jazz , Pop and Rock charts at the same time . No other Jazz album , not other album of any type , not even `` Kind of Blue '' , even `` Getz /Gilberto '' , has ever achieved that.Listen to subtle polyrhythym drumming from Deppenschmidt & Riechenbach which add an authentic Carnivale touch . There is more traditional Samba polyrhythm on this CD than any of the subsequent Getz Bossa Nova CD 's and most BN cd 's by subsequent artists who tried to capitalize om the BN craze . Hear this on `` E Luxo So '' .Stan floats and soars in `` Desafinado '' ( Portuguese for `` offkey '' ) , `` E Luxo So '' and `` Bahia '' . Most authentic Brazilian Getz Samba recording.Hear Stan make each note 3-Dimensional blue fog note count . `` Beautiful ! , Lyrical ! ! Soaring ! ! ! One of the ten best Jazz recordings ever made . `` from my 1998 review2006 updateYes it 's true , as wonderful a sax man as Getz was , and I think he was the best , he was cheap . He got all the credit and most of the money for this album and he and Byrd fought over the rights to it for a decade in the courts.Nevertheless its ' wonderful . - maybe that 's why they foughtThis CD is a perennial favorite that never grows old.Jobim had admired Getz Cool , melancholy Sound for a decade and had actually modeled his new toned down , slowed down Samba sound , called `` Bossa Nova '' , on the Getz sound before they even met ! For people who like Bossa Nova but do n't like Astrud Gilberto 's singing on `` Getz/Gilberto '' , this is the ideal album.see my list of Best Cool albums and Best Getz.Highest recommendation ! I hope that when I eventually die , ( no time soon ) at my funeral someone will play the soaring , always happy `` E Luxo So '' to send me on my way !	1
With Bossa Nova already achieving worldwide popularity by the 1960 's , the Latin jazzsubgenre from Brazil then took another international step when Stan Getz and CharlieByrd made there U.S. State Department to South America in 1961 when they set outto discover the Bossa Nova . After the return , the Bossa Nova had reached the UnitedStates , as it resulted into the making of Jazz Samba , the highly praised landmark duetalbum that topped the jazz and pop charts as introduce the subgenre to the Americanpublic when it first came out in 1962 . Featuring a set of timeless compositions pennedby Antonio Carlos Jobim and Ary Barraso , the first rate track set features a solid recordof songs that begins with the chart-topping smash hit Desfinado , which procede withBarraso 's Bahia , Jobim 's Samba De Uma Nota So ( One Note Samba ) , O Pato ( The Duck ) , Samba Triste and E Luxo So . Showcased with harmonic structures and it 's beautifully-crafted tone , Jazz Samba is a landmark masterpiece that will provide you with a superbsimultaneously warm full tone and a cool control of dynamics . Thanks to the chemistryof Getz , Byrd , Jobim and Barraso , their truly melodic inventiveness , romanticism , andeven the undercurrent of melancholy inherent in the music makes a revelatory classicthat will certainly remain as timeless as ever .	1
Jazz samba the collaborative album of Stan getz and Charlie Byrd is one of the most beautiful and relaxing albums I own . From the opening track Destafino on throught to the final track Baia listening to JS is like being on the beach and watching the sun set . The Byrd getz combination is flawless the two artists compliment each other extremely well making this album a effortless listen , again and again . If you are new to samba music this is where to begin .	1
& quot ; Jazz Samba & quot ; is such a great album that only one other bossa nova album exceeds its quality- & quot ; Getz/Gilberto & quot ; . Getz and Byrd , jazz musicians , not only introduce Brazilian bossa nova to a larger audience , but do so in a way that is timeless.Many of the compositions here have become classics of our culture , & quot ; Desifinda & quot ; , & quot ; Samba de Uma Nota S & oacute ; & quot ; and & quot ; O Pato & quot ; . Do n't worry if you do n't recognize the titles , once you hear them you recognize the music.If you have & quot ; Getz/Gilberto & quot ; than & quot ; Jazz Samba & quot ; wo n't disappoint . This is great music that belongs in everyone 's collection .	1
It 's my first CD bought from Amazon and it 's one of the best albums of Patti . Different styles but a unique big voice ! Hear her Aretha 's voice in the track 5 , for example ! Track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album `` Havana Candy '' . Track 2 shows us her `` Ability To Swing '' . Tracks 3-4-10 are beautiful ballads . Track 6 is the reggae one . Tracks 7-8 have a sweet sound . Track 9 is my favourite of the album , in a gospel style .	1
This cd is not new but the world needs to know how good this cd is ... iam a preacher in the wilderness.If this cd is in your collection , dust it of and give it a listen again.This is by far one of Patti Austin finest work and needs the attention it deserves .	1
This cd of the talented singer and favorite artist of GRP productions , Patti Austin , is charming . Great arrangements , great sound and excellent performances and a range of experienced artists accompany these 10 songs full of musical vitality . Very beautiful theme ' Stars in Your Eyes ' which accompanies the legendary pianist Bob James . Enjoy it .	1
A blessed union of amazing vocals and outstanding studio musicians make Patti Austin 's THAT SECRET PLACE a dazzling achievement.Whether it 's jazz or pop , R & B ; or gospel , reggae or funk , Austin impeccably delivers a true command of whatever style she tackles . In this 1994 release , each track allows Patti to effortlessly glide through each song with her penetrating performances.She cooks on tunes like ABILITY TO SWING , a scat-infused invitation to dance , her cover of Aretha 's classic ROCK STEADY and the euphoric drive of REACH . Have fun with her reggae-flavored CAPTIVATED . Then let your heart melt with SOMEBODY MAKE ME LAUGH , BROKEN DREAMS or the gorgeous STARS IN YOUR EYES . The album is flawlessly produced by jazz icons Lee Ritenour and Dave Grusin.Patti has certainly deserved wider success in her career , but for those who have wisely followed her know what a treasure she is !	1
In the world of motion pictures , the character performer tends to have a longer career than the so-called `` leading man/woman '' because the former can become whatever the script requires , providing necessary support . In the music world , there are some artists that never become the star that they should but that does not diminish their talent . They simply become a delicacy to be savored by a select few.Patti Austin is one of those delicacies . She has had a long career as solo performer and guest artist , never quite gaining the status that she so richly deserves.1994 's `` That Secret Place '' is the perfect introduction for the uninitiated to the beautiful jewel that is Patti Austin . Backed on several cuts by the likes of Lee Ritenour ( guitar ) , Bob James ( piano ) , Paulinho da Costa ( percussion ) , Greg Philliganes ( piano/synthesizer ) , with string and horn arrangements by Jerry Hey , Austin travels a musical road consisting of jazz , pop , R & B , and shades of a little gospel influence . `` Ability to Swing '' is a masterly executed mixture , allowing the singer to show her shills as a vocalist and scat singer . The band also gets to `` cut loose '' in its accompaniment and solo interludes . `` Broken Dreams , written by El Debarge ( who also does guest vocalist duties ) , his brother Darell and Tony A. Redio , is about the breakup of a relationship and the possibility of a reconciliation . Both Debarge and Austin play off each other quite well , somewhat reminiscent of Austin 's work with James Ingram.Austin successfully covers the `` Queen of Soul 's '' territory on the funky remake of Aretha 's classic `` Rock Steady '' . `` Captivated '' , with its reggae influence allows Austin to show a side not often found on her usual recordings . `` Reach '' makes the listener want to `` jump the pews '' while the tune that follows it , `` Stars in Your Eyes '' , is a quiet yet powerful love ballad.The best of all is `` Hurry Home '' , an obvious plead for the hasty return of a long absent lover . This tune shares many qualities with the Oleta Adams ' hit `` Get Here '' .Patti Austin has done more in this one album than most of today 's chart-toppers can do in several.She is what good music is all about and maybe one day she 'll get her much-deserved `` props '' .	1
I think this is by far the best CD I have ever purchased . The singing is superb , the music above excellent . If you are new to bluegrass and Alison Krauss this is a good introduction to both !	1
I remember distinctly when I first heard one of the cuts on the lp version of Too Late to Cry on a radio show called Grass Roots or something like that out of Kalamazoo , MI . I stopped whatever I was doing to listen closely to & quot ; Do n't Follow Me & quot ; , and then the first chance I got to get up to Lansing 's Elderly Instruments ( the best darn music & amp ; instrument store in Michigan ) I bought it.I think this recording is just about as perfect as anything since Abbey Road . Each song is a little gem . I really prefer Alison 's voice as it sounds in these earlier recordings : stronger , more nasal . She purposely changed it to the softer , more pop-friendly version around the time of the & quot ; Every Time You Say Goodbye & quot ; , I believe . But her singing is not the only treat ; she had won many awards for her fiddle playing by this time , and it shines ; and she is backed up by only the best musicians in bluegrass -- -Jerry Douglas & amp ; Sam Bush , for example.Peppy , strong , and true to bluegrass roots .	1
What a breath of fresh air in the Country music field . Such an excellent CD . Shania and Faith should listen to this , see what a real singer is like ( at 15 no less ) and then quit the business .	1
In 1987 Alison was only 15 , and some of the songs on this CD are kind of & quot ; honky-tonky & quot ; . In & quot ; Song For Life & quot ; the lyric begins & quot ; I do n't drink as much as I used to ... . & quot ; and it 's a little incongruous putting the words together with the 15 year-old voice . Her vocal tone was a little twangy and nasal-sounding , almost strident as she belted out some of these tunes , and I wonder if she was influenced maybe a little by some of the Nashville Big-Hair bunch like Reba.Still ... . if she had not appeared until today and suddenly this recording appeared , it would be at least as head-turning today as it was 15 years ago . No other vocalist in the genre approaches this kind of material with this kind of instrumentation with THAT kind of voice . Alison surrounded herself by superstars like Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas , so the supporting cast was top-notch.In her first recording she was both astonishingly new and talented , but also showed great promise of things to come . In the recordings that followed she has unfailingly measured up to that promise . Even in her first record she began showing her taste for sorrowful mournful tunes of doomed love , even on uptempto tunes like & quot ; Do n't Follow Me & quot ; and the title & quot ; Too Late to Cry & quot ; . She also began demonstrating her talent for beautiful slow ballads like & quot ; Gentle River & quot ; .Required stuff for those who want the complete Alison Krauss collection , but I knock it down to 4 stars because the maturity of her voice and mastery of material would show up in full on later recordings .	1
Allison Krauss has an amazing voice . Her band is good too . Easy listening and easy to hum or sing along .	1
Alison was just fifteen when she made her recording debut with this album but , even at that age , she was ready for it . She is both only a talented musician and a wonderful singer with a great voice , which has echoes of Dolly , Reba and Emmylou while not being too much like any of them . Her music has changed significantly through the years so fans of her more recent albums may not like her early work . My eclectic taste in music allows me to enjoy all her music though I generally prefer the early stuff.The songs are mostly obscure , the most widely known being Song for life , which is a classic from the pen of Rodney Crowell . Alison plays the fiddle on all tracks where one is used , but there are two instrumentals , both covers ( Tony Trischka 's Forgotten pictures and the traditional Dusty Miller ) that demonstrate Alison 's skills as a fiddler very clearly . The remaining songs are only originals , mostly from the pen of John Pennell.This may not be the best album that Alison ever recorded - though some think it is and I can understand why - but it is certainly among the best . It 's not difficult to figure out why Alison has been so successful . If you are unfamiliar with Alison 's early music , you should first try Now that I 've found you - A collection . If you enjoy that , particularly the track Sleep on ( taken from this album ) , give this a listen .	1
This is true Alison . This is true bluegrass . This is a wonderful CD !	1
I was lucky enough to see this young lady ( and young she was ! ) on tour twice when this album had just come out , at the Kalamazoo State Theater along with Hot Rize ! , another good old fashioned bluegrass treat . These were the days when Krauss was more famous as a fiddle wunderkind than a pop sensation , and when her voice sounded like a young Brenda Lee or Jimmy Martin 's kid sister , rather than the limp but no doubt moneymaking dishrag it does today ( Krauss 's best contribution these days is her production work with new groups like Nickel Creek . ) These songs ... .none of which were written by Krauss herself , by the way ... are fine examples of what in the eighties was termed `` newgrass '' , a bluer than bluegrass , saucy treatment of American string band tradition . The best example might be Union Station 's version of ( wait for it ) the Allman Brothers ' `` Midnight Rider '' , which as an Allmans fan I like better than the original . Many of the other songs are written by John Pennell , founder of the band , still a member , and one who can be credited with discovering Krauss ' talent as early as five years before this disc was recorded.The personnel of Union Station has morphed throughout the years , and a few of the songs are led vocally by musicians who are no longer in the band . But most are Krauss ' babies , and she shows them off like a proud country mama . If you have never had a chance to hear Alison Krauss during her early years on the road , do check this , her solo album , or both , out . Your heart will leap to the whirlwind melodies , and you will thank yourself , believe me .	1
This is the real thing folks - real singers and real musicians making real music . Blow off Shania and Faith and BUY THIS AND EVERY OTHER Alison Krauss + Union Station CD AVAILABLE ! ! !	1
Still only 17 in 1989 when this , her second album , was released , Alison Krauss made a mark that has kept her atop the heap in Bluegrass ever since . More of a & quot ; band & quot ; album than her debut , this one also features guitar phenom Jeff White on lead vocals on a few tunes and the instrumentals are among the best Alison has ever recorded , mainly due to Mr. White 's hot flat-picking . Old Beaumont Rag got a good workout here ! The album features both traditional material like & quot ; Wild Bill Jones & quot ; ( sung by Jeff White - now performed exquisitely by Dan Tyminski in Alison 's Band ) , and innovative arrangements of material from other genre 's . The Allman Brother 's & quot ; Midnight Flyer & quot ; gets turned from rhythmic yearning ballad into a banjo-driven barn burner , with vocals that soar and harmonies that are absolutely hair-raising.Alyson 's voice is noticeably smoother than in the debut album and I would guess it was about HERE that critics began saying that she had the voice of an angel.I do n't personally know what an angel sounds like , but it would be a HIGH compliment to say one sounded like Alison Krauss on & quot ; Two Highways & quot ; .	1
Alison Krauss has one of the most beautiful voice . Her band is really good too . Easy listening . Easy to hum or sing along .	1
This was Alison 's second album but the first on which her band gets title billing . The musicians were Alison Krauss ( fiddle ) , Mike Harman ( banjo ) , Jeff White ( guitar ) , John Pennell ( bass ) , Jerry Douglas ( dobro ) and Brent Truitt ( mandolin ) . Jerry and Brent were not members of Union station but were brought in as guests on the recordings . Alison was just 17 when these tracks were recorded but she was already the supreme performer . Jeff White sings lead on Wild Bill Jones , As lovely as you , Lord do n't forsake me and Midnight rider , with Alison and Mike providing harmony vocals . Beaumont rag and Windy city rag are instrumentals . On all other tracks , Alison sings lead vocal , with Jeff and Mike providing harmony vocals.The last two tracks will be the most familiar . Teardrops will kiss the morning dew was originally recorded by the Osborne brothers , an excellent bluegrass outfit , and was also covered by Billie Jo Spears . Both those versions are somewhat obscure , but Alison 's own version was selected for inclusion on Now that I 've found you A collection , the hugely successful compilation of Alison 's music . If you are thinking of buying this album , you surely own that compilation already - and if not , you should buy that first . The final track is a cover of Gregg Allman 's classic Midnight rider , here adapted to bluegrass - brilliantly.You are not likely to know many ( if any ) of the first ten tracks but they are definitely worth a listen . They are a varied mix of ballads and up-tempo but the overall feel of the album is upbeat . Possibly the best is Heaven 's bright shore though it is difficult to pick out highlights on an album of such quality.If you already have Now that I 've found you A collection and you want to explore Alison 's early music further , this is for you .	1
GREAT , I repeat GREAT CD , well worth the money . It 's one of her best !	1
Listening to this album , it 's very difficult to realise that she is only 18 . She plays the fiddle with a skill way beyond her years , and her delicate soprano voice sings of lost love and heartbreak with such emotion and beauty that touches the heart of anyone who has experienced love gone wrong . This album was just a hint of what was to come , and I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert a few years back , in Toronto . This is Bluegrass at its best . Buy it , you 'll love it .	1
If you just stumbled across this album and gave it a listen , you might be forgiven for thinking that it 's a greatest hits CD . At this point , AK already had a couple of albums under her belt , and it shows . The music is straight bluegrass and country , you wo n't find any of the later pop infusions ( which is fine music itself ! ) , and the song selection is first rate . The instrumentalists are in fine form , and her voice still has most of that thin , reedy quality that you associate with bluegrass . But if you listen , it 's just beginning to warm up some and lose that young-girl quality ... So if you 're already an AKUS fan , you can scoop this one up and enjoy every lick ! And if not , this is as good a place as any to test the waters .	1
My father-in-law listened to this CD while he was dying . `` Steel Rails '' will always be my favorite . As with the other AK+US CDs : This is the real thing folks - real singers and real musicians making real music . Blow off Shania and Faith and BUY THIS AND EVERY OTHER Alison Krauss + Union Station CD AVAILABLE ! ! ! ...	1
On her 3rd CD Alison Krauss does not break stride . & quot ; I 've Got That Old Feeling & quot ; is chock-a-block FULL of the beautiful ballads that have made her famous with her angelically emotive voice , but it is also perhaps the best showcase for her ability to perform more up-tempo pieces , such as & quot ; Dark Skies & quot ; and & quot ; Will You Be Leaving ? & quot ; The supporting cast here performs perfectly.How many albums do you have that have perhaps a few good songs on it , but just as many songs that are just filler - instantly forgettable and barely listenable ? This is a CD with NO filler . Every cut is a & quot ; keeper & quot ; and I could just listen to the whole thing back to back over and over again.Alison Krauss is a national treasure , and this recording is one reason why .	1
Allison Krauss has a really amazing voice and sound . Good band . Easy listening , easy humming and easy to sing along .	1
Alison Krauss has done much to popularise bluegrass in recent years . Her early recordings were pure bluegrass - this ( from 1990 ) might just be the best album of that phase of her career , although they are all brilliant and it 's hard to choose a particular favorite . Her more recent albums have included other influences but I enjoy those too , in a different way.There are no really famous songs on this album , but the quality of all the songs is high . Sidney Cox ( of the Cox family , a noted bluegrass group with which Alison recorded a gospel album ) wrote four songs including the title track ( a bright , upbeat song ) and Tonight I 'll be lonely too ( an outstanding ballad ) . Other favorites of mine include Steel rails ( a brilliant train song ) , Endless highway , Will you be leaving and One good reason , but there are so many great songs here and it may be that your favorite is one I have n't mentioned . The overall feel of the album is bright and upbeat.If you are unfamiliar with Alison 's early music , I recommend that you buy Now that I 've found you - A collection , which I 've already reviewed . That includes one track from each of her early albums , plus tracks not available on any of her other albums so far . If you have that collection and you are looking for more of Alison 's early music , you will enjoy this .	1
I wanted to get an album with those Union Station guys not singing and with fewer ballads So I had to go back 15 years but found her voice and poignant expressiveness just as satisfying and moving as in her more mature years .	1
I listen to a wide variety of music , and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today 's music . The pop acts of today ca n't compare . & quot ; I 've Got That Old Feeling & quot ; has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song , & quot ; It 's Over & quot ; , and & quot ; Wish I Still Had You & quot ; . Not only can Krauss sing , she plays the violin to perfection . If you have n't listened to Alison Krauss yet , you are in for a treat !	1
I 've had this CD a long time and it 's still very enjoyable especially when you 're in the right mood . My favorite songs are mostly the kind of wistful ballads where Alison 's voice works great . My favorite songs here are `` I 've Got That Old Feeling '' , `` I Wish I Still Had You '' , `` Winter of a Broken Heart '' , `` It 's Over '' , `` Steel Rails '' , `` That Makes One of Us '' . Well that 's half the album right there , and the other songs are good too . The production is n't as clear as more recent stuff , but the musicians are top notch . In the end some albums stick with you more than others , and this one stands out as a keeper .	1
I must admit this CD was in my shopping cart for quite a while given its genre . I finally make the plunge when I needed it for free shipping and the first time I played it , I could n't believe the beautiful purity and fullness of her voice.The music is very interesting also since it is obviuosly country , but these are real talented musicians and the arrangements are incredibly performed and make a country band really kick- [ ... ] in a cross over jazzy sense in a couple of tunes where you 'd never guess this is a band that plays bluegrass.It 's worth every one of those stars and one more if they had it.By the way , I found out that the ladies like this CD very much .	1
I ca n't describe how wonderful this recording is , but I 'll try . Whether you like bluegrass or not , if you appreciate good singing , good playing , and wonderful melodies , this CD is for you . Many people have talked about how relaxing , soothing and peaceful ( not to mention fun ! ) this collection is . It 's that and more . These are songs that you will find yourself singing , humming , and thinking about after just a few listens . Alison does a wide range of covers , including the title track from the Foundations , a song by Bad Company ( & quot ; Oh Atlanta & quot ; ) , and a wonderful version of the Beatles ' & quot ; I Will. & quot ; Now about Alison Krauss ... You can read here and in many other places about the enormous talent Alison has been blessed with . That is obvious in the initial hearing of the CD . I appreciate the talent , but even more I appreciate the love that she has for music . I 've seen and heard many performers in several different genres of music , but it is becoming a true rarity to encounter artists who really , truly love what they do . You can tell that Alison Krauss ( and Union Station ) has a geniune joy in doing what she does . It comes across in the music . That joy of singing , performing , communicating with an audience is sadly lacking with most artists today . Too many artists ( some who once had this joy and lost it somewhere along the way ) are in music for all the wrong reasons ... money , fame , you name it . Krauss will have none of it . She still records for Rounder Records , a relatively small label , even though she 's had offers from the big labels . She refuses to perform in big arena concerts because she would lose the close connection she has with her audience . I admire her for her decisions and for her love of her craft . Take one listen to this CD and I think you 'll agree .	1
What a beautiful album ! When Allison Krauss sings with Union Station , her already wonderful sounds are magnified and transform to simply angelic . We especially enjoy `` Tonight I 'll Be Lonely Too '' , `` Sleep On '' , and my favorite `` When You Say Nothing At All . '' Highly recommended for old-time country sounds ! Baby , Now That I 've Found You	1
Since her Rounder debut in 1987 , Alison Krauss has been praised by critics and country music fans alike . Revitalizing traditional styles of country music including bluegrass , the singer and fiddler is the focus of much public attention . Her unique , yet firmly-rooted approach to country music has won her several Grammys . Her 1995 release , NOW THAT I 'VE FOUND YOU , showcases her ability to shine in a variety of settings . The title track and & quot ; Broadway & quot ; find Krauss in a more pop country environment ; however even her pop music is unique in its smart harmonic structure , and her ability to avoid pat or stock poetic devices . On & quot ; Tonight I 'll Be Lonely Too , & quot ; Krauss and Union Station ( her almost constant musical companions ) switch to a decidedly bluegrass feel , and on & quot ; When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart , & quot ; she plunges into a Southern gospel style with help from the Cox Family . Alison Krauss has the remarkable ability to make these diverse musical directions seem logical and congruent .	1
This was the very first cd that we bought when we first got a cd player back in 1995 . I loved it then and love it today . It remains a firm favourite . As well as some of her best songs culled from previous albums , this album includes 3 previously unreleased songs . A great mix of country and bluegrass , this is the best from Alison Krauss , along with Union Station , and the Cox Family , from 1987 to 1994 . The booklet includes some cute photos of Alison and her brother as children , but unfortunately , no lyrics . But it does have a 2 page newspaper article from 1994 which is interesting . If you only get one Alison Krauss album , then this is the one you need . Highly recommended .	1
Alison Krauss is definately a classy lady . I think this compilation is a well rounded effort which shows the multidimensional artist that is Alison Krauss . Whether she 's on a tribute album , with Union Station , solo , producing , there always seems to be magic in the studio . NOW THAT I FOUND YOU : A COLLECTION gives listeners 3 new songs , 4 songs from tribute albums , and the rest from her past albums . First new song is & quot ; Now That I Found You & quot ; , featuring as usual stunning vocals and beautiful instrumentation . We also have & quot ; Oh , Atlanta & quot ; and & quot ; Broadway & quot ; which are also new , and great songs . Probably one of her best known tribute songs was for the Keith Whitley tribute album , her and Union Station 's cover of & quot ; When You Say Nothing At All & quot ; . Keith would be proud . Elsewhere on this cd we have & quot ; I Do n't Believe You 've Met My Baby & quot ; , & quot ; Tonight I 'll Be Lonely Too & quot ; , & quot ; Every Time You Say Goodbye & quot ; , & quot ; Sleep On & quot ; , & quot ; I Will & quot ; , and many more . Overall this compilation should satisfy the biggest fans , and the ones who are just introducing themselves to Alison 's music .	1
I bought the tape of Now That I Found You after seeing Alison Krauss and her Union Station bandmates in concert in Branson , Missouri , a number of years ago . Alison 's hits & quot ; Baby , Now That I Found You & quot ; , a '60s pop song , and & quot ; When You Say Nothing At All & quot ; , the classic Keith Whitley song , are on here . I also liked Alison 's remake of the old Beatles song & quot ; I Will & quot ; , featuring some fine work by Tony Furtado on banjo . Not only does Alison do a beautiful job of singing and fiddling , but her Union Station bandmates , who accompany her on most of the songs on this record , are talented musicians as well . Up until '95 , when Now That I Found You was released , Alison was recognized mainly when she sang background vocals on other artists ' records , and her music , though it is stellar , did n't get noticed very much except by bluegrass and folk music fans . This album , which went platinum , was Alison 's breakthrough because it got a lot more people interested in her music . If you have n't heard Alison Krauss 's music before , I recommend that you check out Now That I Found You . It 's a great introduction .	1

It took a few albums for the rest of the world to discover what the Bluegrass community already knew about the phenomenal Alison Krauss - her voice is a once-in-a-lifetime gift.She had recorded about 4 albums when independent label Rounder and Alison came up with the idea of a & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; collection for an artist in a genre that pretty much never HAS a & quot ; hit & quot ; . Now That I 've Found You opens with three new tracks - each one of them became a hit - then is filled in with another nine tracks from the previous albums , plus a few gems she recorded as a guest vocalist on other 's CDs , such as & quot ; I Will & quot ; from Tony Furtado 's & quot ; Within Reach & quot ; and & quot ; I Do n't Believe You 've Met My Baby & quot ; on Jerry Douglas ' & quot ; Slide Rule & quot ; ( a wonderful old Louvin Brother 's song that received another wonderful treatment in the recent Louvin Brother 's tribute album - check THAT one out too ! ) Suddenly the young woman had a platinum album , selling millions and zillions of copies in a Genre that no one outside of Bluegrass listened to.What was going ON ? Bluegrass had a FEW hits in the Rock and Roll era : Flatt and Scruggs & quot ; Foggy Mountain Breakdown & quot ; - the music used as the musical theme to & quot ; Bonnie and Clyde & quot ; .Flatt and Scruggs & quot ; The Ballad of Jed Clampett & quot ; - the theme to & quot ; Beverly Hillbillies & quot ; & quot ; Dueling Banjos & quot ; - from the soundtrack to & quot ; Deliverance & quot ; & quot ; Rocky Top & quot ; - by the Osborne Brothers & quot ; Fox on the Run & quot ; - by the Country GentlemenBut it was pretty much unheard of for a Bluegrass recording or artist to get much notice outside of the Bluegrass die-hards , unless there was a movie or television tie-in.Then along came Alison Krauss , with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the Bluegrass community while she was still a teenager.This CD really IS just a & quot ; sampler & quot ; of Alison Krauss ' voice - but it 's a good starter disc for someone who wants to hear the kind of voice that only comes along once a generation ... .	1
Allison Krauss is truly talented and easy to hear . Very easy listening . Most Allison Krauss songs are so easy on the ears .	1
Alison Krauss 's voice is beautiful , haunting , and full of passion and emotion . Alison and Union Station are set apart from other musicians . Their virtuosity and ability to convey their emotions through their instruments is one of their trademarks . This release is no different and will not disappoint fans of Alison and Union Station ! . Although this release was intended to bring Alison 's beautiful voice into the forefront . Up until this point , Alison was known as a fantastic fiddle player , but her voice was overlooked due to the fact that she sang background vocals with the early version of Union Station . This release introduced Alison to the world and people began to take notice of her angelic voice ! . There are some familiar tunes like Broadway , Baby , Now That I 've Found You , Oh Atlanta and Every Time You Say Goodbye . Alison does all those songs well , but it 's the lesser known tracks that stand out . I Will an old Beatles song , and Sleep On from Alison 's debut Too Late To Cry stand out as one of the gems on this disc . In The Palm Of Your Hand is beautiful as is When You Say Nothing At All one of my favorites and I Do n't Believe You 've Met My Baby . All the songs are winners ! this disc has something for everyone from the country infused Sleep On to the more religious fare When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart and Palm Of Your Hand . Alison does justice to all of these songs and the covers are outstanding . If you enjoy this collection , you may also enjoy Alison 's previous works . This is a must have for any Alison Krauss fan ! .	1
What makes this so special is the purity of Alison 's voice and the quality of the music , some of which features Alison as instrumentalist as well as vocalist . Even though most of the songs are covers , they sound fresh and exciting.The tracks are taken from various sources , including one from each of her own albums , but also including three previously unreleased tracks , plus other tracks that had not appeared on her albums . Even if you 've got all Alison 's other albums , you 'll need this.The set begins with a cover of the sixties pop hit , Baby now that I 've found you . You may remember the original - a somewhat sad lyric but a very upbeat tune , which was a UK number one hit for the Foundations . Alison slows the song right down , in keeping with the lyrics.The final track is a cover of When you say nothing at all , recorded for Keith Whitley 's tribute album . This is a song that has spawned a number of covers , including Irish versions by Boyzone ( who had a big British hit with it ) and Frances Black . Even Frances can not improve on Alison 's version.Between those two tracks are many other brilliant songs , including I will ( from the Beatles ' white album ) , Teardrops will kiss the morning dew ( even better than the Billie Jo Spears version , which I think was the original ) and the Lovin Brothers ' I do n't believe you 've met my baby , later covered by Dolly on her Little sparrow album.The O brother soundtrack , the various O sister compilations inspired by it and Dolly Parton 's recent albums have all helped to increase the popularity of bluegrass , but this compilation pre-dates all of them and it was hugely successful . In any case , Alison herself appears on most of those other albums . So this is an important album in any collection of bluegrass music .	1
This was my first introduction to Bluegrass music but I suspect this is a sophisticated style of the genre , not the raw high wailing sound that I subsequently discovered . In fact , much of it could easily fit into categories like & quot ; adult contemporary & quot ; or & quot ; easy listening & quot ; -- the track & quot ; Broadway & quot ; for example , is a pure pop song . I love the Dolly Parton like & quot ; Teardrops Will Kiss The Morning Dew , & quot ; and the gospely & quot ; In The Palm Of Your Hand. & quot ; But my top favourite is the wonderful , dreamy story of & quot ; I Do n't Believe You 've Met My Baby , & quot ; with its unexpected twist in the tale and its lilting , hypnotic rhythm . This is one of those rare albums with no real dud tracks .	1
Even back in 1995 , Alison Krauss 's star was shining brightly and this Rounder anthology showcases her talents as vocalist , fiddler , interpreter and band leader . The collection opens with three then previously unreleased tracks , including the gorgeous `` Baby , Now That I 've Found You . '' [ Her voice simply melts in you ears ! ] The other two new tracks include `` Oh , Atlanta '' ( not to be confused with the Little Feat song of the same name ) and the ballad `` Broadway '' written by Sidney and Suzanne Cox.Six of the remaining songs come from albums done with Union Station , the Cox Family and her 1987 solo album . However , what makes this collection especially enjoyable is that it also includes `` When You Say Nothing at All , '' AKUS 's contribution to KEITH WHITLEY : A TRIBUTE ALBUM , along with `` I Do n't Believe You 've Met My Baby '' from Jerry Douglas 's abum SLIDE RULE and a moving rendition of the Beatles ' I Will '' from Tony Furtado 's album WITHIN REACH.You wo n't find a better introduction to this amazingly gifted artist . VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
Alison Krauss , along with her band Union Station , is probably the best-known bluegrass artist currently recording . `` Now That I Found You : A Collection '' is a compilation of Alison 's early work along with some new music . Even though she was only 23 when she released this CD in 1995 , Alison had been recording since she was 16 . Her pure voice shines through , and the songs are consistently excellent ; however , three of them are real standouts . `` Baby , Now That I 've Found You '' is my favorite selection and simply one of the catchiest songs I 've ever heard . Whenever I hear it , the tune gets imbedded into my mind and plays on a continuous loop for days . The song was originally a # 11 pop hit in 1968 for the Foundations , who are perhaps better known for `` Build Me Up Buttercup . '' It was only a minor country hit for Alison ( # 49 in 1995 ) , although it netted her a Grammy for Best Country & Western Vocal Performance - Female . `` When You Say Nothing At All '' is Alison 's biggest country hit , having peaked at # 3 in 1995 . What makes its success all the more amazing is that it was a # 1 hit just seven years earlier for Keith Whitley . It 's clearly become one of Alison 's signature songs . The final standout for me is `` I Will '' written by those great bluegrass artists - Lennon and McCartney ! Only a tremendous talent like Alison could make a Beatles song into a bluegrass masterpiece.This CD was an unexpected hit - selling more than 2 million copies . It also helped Alison win 3 major Country Music Association Awards in 1995 - Horizon ( best new artist ) , Female Vocalist , and Single of the Year for `` When You Say Nothing At All . '' I 'm by no means an expert on bluegrass , and I admit that most of the bluegrass CDs I own feature Alison Krauss . However , I certainly recognize quality music when I hear it , and `` Now That I Found You : A Collection '' is outstanding contemporary bluegrass . Most highly recommended .	1
I 'm not sure how this woman would be classified ... I guess it 's generally country music , with a hint of bluegrass . But in certain songs , I also detected some gospel influence . Note that I have NEVER been a country music lover . My taste in music is very wide - West African , Brazilian , Greek , electronica , soul/funk , classic rock . I saw Alison performing on public TV a few weeks ago , and was just blown away - so much so that I went out to buy the CD.Almost every track is wonderful in its own right . Alison 's voice is so beautiful , but I think it 's the combination of all the talents on this CD that makes it so wonderful . The song-writing is excellent , and the banjo pickin ' is also.I 'm so glad to have discovered her , and to now have this CD in my collection .	1
This is the first CD I purchased by Alison Krauss and it is perfect . There 's alot of fun on this album and alot of sad songs as well but it is very worth the purchase ! If you enjoy good 90 's bluegrass , this is the album for you . Alison 's voice will particularly grab you . It did me .	1
This was the first album I ever heard of thiers and when I heard it I imediately fell in love . I really recommend this alot ! ! !	1
Sometimes an abundance of talent can be a curse - take Alison Kraus , for example . On one hand , she has bluegrass afficianados ( like me ) begging her not to give in to the lure of almost certain pop/country superstardom , while the rest of the world is screaming , & quot ; Get rid of those hayseeds ! & quot ; I 've already tipped my hand , so I will tell you that the bluegrass component of this album is about the best that can be heard in the genre 's more contemporary incarnation . And while Alison is clearly the star , the boys in the band more than hold their own , both vocally and instumentally . Dan Tyminski is a terrific singer and guitarist - his voice blends superbly with Alison 's on & quot ; Blue Trail of Sorrow & quot ; and particularly & quot ; The Road is a Lover , & quot ; which also features some great train-like bowing from Alison . Banjoist Ron Block takes Scrugg-style picking to a higher level - his driving solo on the title track blows me away every time I hear it . And Adam Steffey 's mandolin playing ranks among the best.What more can be said about Alison 's voice ? It 's clear , emotive , and haunting . My only complaint about Alison these days is that she is growing less and less inclined to cut loose on the fiddle . I 've read her statements of getting away from & quot ; flashy playing for its own sake , & quot ; but she 's far too talented on that instrument to let it collect too much dust.For those whom skip over the non-Alison tracks , or complain that the guys sing to much - Alison is following in the best tradition of the original bluegrass bossman himself , Mr.Bill Monroe , who handed over the reigns repeatedly to such ( later ) stars as Lester Flatt , Jimmy Martin , and Peter Rowan . Alison Kraus and Union Station is a BAND - and a damned fine one at that . I just hope that she does n't follow the path of the late Keith Whitley , Marty Stuart , Dolly Parton , and Ricky Skaggs ( although we got him back ) , forsaking bluegrass completely .	1
Beautiful texture to this 2LP package . Nice acoustic sound without that yucky digital coldness . Well worth the $ $ $ . Now let 's get the other AKUS records done too .	1
One of Alison and Union Station 's best . The songs are all great , and Alison shares lead vocals with Adam , Dan and Ron , which gives the album variety . There is also an instrumental , the traditional & quot ; Little Liza Jane & quot ; which moves along at break-neck speed . Bluegrass at its finest ! This album though has a variety of songs besides bluegrass , including country , pop and inspirational . The 20 page booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos of Alison and the band . Highly recommended .	1
When I was a child , opens up a lot of doors ... this is the lyric to & quot ; NO PLACE TO HIDE & quot ; , features Adam Steffey ( Union Station ) lead vocal and on the mandolin , is a key part of the success of Alison Krauss & amp ; Union Station ... along with Dan Tyminski ( vocal/guitar ) , Ron Block ( vocal/banjo/guitar ) , Barry Bales ( vocal/acoustic bass/upright bass ) ... this group of young talented musicians has taken the COUNTRY BY STORM ... many people have taken another look at MOUNTAIN MUSIC also known as BLUEGRASS ... the gathering of new and old fans is staggering ... almost phenomenal to say the least ... much of this is due to their participation in the overnight hit of & quot ; O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU & quot ; , as we watched the COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS , it ran away with BEST ALBUM and Dan Tyminski walked away with his prize.Alison Krauss shares her love and talent with every member of Union Station , you can hear it on every track ... just listen to & quot ; FIND MY WAY BACK TO MY HEART & quot ; , touching , really gets to you ... another is & quot ; I CAN LET GO NOW & quot ; , lyrics that go deep into your soul ... & quot ; I 'LL REMEMBER YOU , LOVE , IN MY PRAYERS & quot ; , an old-time tune and Tyminski and fellow players give out with everything that 's in em ' ... and how about & quot ; PAIN OF A TROUBLED LIFE & quot ; , composed and performed by Ron Block , sit back and listen , take heed friends , cause you do n't want to old before your time ... my highlight pick is & quot ; BLUE TRAIL OF SORROW & quot ; , this is what 's its all about , toe-tapping music from EARLY AMERICANA , got ta love it ! Total Time : 48:11 on 14 Tracks ~ Rounder Records 11661-0365-2 ~ ( 1997 )	1
Alison Krauss and her Union Station bandmates do a fine job on So Long , So Wrong . Alison 's singing and fiddle playing dominate , especially on the ballads & quot ; Looking In The Eyes Of Love & quot ; , & quot ; I Can Let Go Now & quot ; , & quot ; Deeper Than Crying & quot ; , & quot ; It Does n't Matter & quot ; , & quot ; Happiness & quot ; and & quot ; There Is A Reason & quot ; . However , Union Station 's guitarist , Dan Tyminski , who sings lead on & quot ; No Place To Hide & quot ; , & quot ; The Road Is A Lover & quot ; , and & quot ; Blue Trail Of Sorrow & quot ; , also is a strong singer . Furthermore , Adam Steffey ( mandolin ) , Ron Block ( banjo and guitar ) , and Barry Bales ( acoustic bass ) , the remaining Union Station members , really shine on this one . The instrumental & quot ; Little Liza Jane & quot ; , on which all the band members get into the act , is a driving bluegrass tune . There 's no percussion anywhere on the record , but thanks to Barry 's thumping bass lines , the songs have a rhythmic , flowing feel to them , which more than makes up for the lack of a drumbeat . There are n't any musical gimmicks here , but there is a great bluegrass and folk sound . So Long , So Wrong is a fine collection of songs from a truly talented group of singers and musicians .	1
This is the real thing folks - real singers and real musicians making real music . Blow off Shania and Faith and BUY THIS AND EVERY OTHER Alison Krauss + Union Station CD AVAILABLE ! ! ! ...	1
Ever since Elvis began his famed recording career with a Rockabilly cover of Bluegrass Bossman Bill Monroe 's signature & quot ; Blue Moon of Kentucky & quot ; Bluegrass has been regarded by *some* as the poor barefoot hayseed step-child of Country Music . Acoustic Guitars and Banjos and Fiddles were overwhelmed and swallowed up by Electric Guitars and Peddle Steel Guitars . A successful Bluegrass album sold maybe 30,000 . The & quot ; dirty little secret & quot ; in Nashville was that the Bluegrass musicians were the ones who could really PLAY , so talented bluegrassers who wanted to make a decent living became Nashville studio musicians . Bluegrass fans , who are often as fanatical about the music as a religious zealot is about their religion , considered such musicians to have & quot ; sold out & quot ; , and so it was that artists like Ricky Skaggs , Bill Keith , Marty Stuart and Vince Gill were considered . Once big fish in the small Bluegrass pond , they were thought by Bluegrass Purists to have compromised their artistic integrity to become Country successes . ( Was it ironic that Ricky Skagg 's first Country Hit was a & quot ; countrified & quot ; version of Lester Flatt 's & quot ; Do n't Get Above Your Raisin ' ? & quot ; ) The purpose of this review is n't to give even a thumbnail history lesson of the evolution of Bluegrass and a comparison to more popular and & quot ; mainstream & quot ; forms of music , but it is important in having a complete appreciation of this album to recognize the historical rarity of a & quot ; popular & quot ; or & quot ; breakout & quot ; Bluegrass artist or band or recording . In the past half-century before Alison Krauss the number of Bluegrass recordings which received any degree of popular airplay could be easily counted on one hand : Flatt and Scruggs & quot ; Foggy Mountain Breakdown & quot ; - the music used as the musical theme to & quot ; Bonnie and Clyde & quot ; .Flatt and Scruggs & quot ; The Ballad of Jed Clampett & quot ; - the theme to & quot ; Beverly Hillbillies & quot ; & quot ; Dueling Banjos & quot ; - from the soundtrack to & quot ; Deliverance & quot ; & quot ; Rocky Top & quot ; - by the Osborne Brothers & quot ; Fox on the Run & quot ; - by the Country GentlemenThen along came Alison Krauss , with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the Bluegrass community while she was still a teenager.She recorded several albums which were among the most well-received in the Bluegrass community leading up to 1995 when her label , Rounder , persuaded her to put together a few new recordings with mostly previous releases , some as & quot ; guest star & quot ; on other CDs to come up with the compilation & quot ; Now That I 've Found You & quot ; ( It may have been called & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; for an artist that had HAD a & quot ; hit & quot ; ) .That CD stunned everyone , sold 6 million copies and suddenly Alison Krauss was the hottest female voice in Nashville - winning a handful of CMA awards.Under the expectations of THAT success Ms. Krauss and her band , Union Station , went to the studio to record the follow-up album.Many on either side of the & quot ; Bluegrass Purist & quot ; fence were expecting the next CD to be the & quot ; Sell-Out & quot ; CD - full of steel guitars and guest duets with Barbra Streisand.What came instead was THIS CD , & quot ; So Long So Wrong & quot ; , an album that celebrates the Bluegrass heritage that these musicians hail from in addition to showcasing the extraordinary contemporary talents of Alison and Union Station.Newcomers to Bluegrass expecting a recording with nothing but Alison 's voice were likely put out a little that some GUY was singing the lead vocal on several of these cuts . Alison knew that Dan Tyminsky was an extraordinary vocalist YEARS before Dan was chosen to do the singing voiceover for George Clooney in & quot ; O Brother Where Art Thou ? & quot ; The CD is one of the prominent ones that Alison jokes about in which her lead vocals are predominantly on beautiful but sorrowful ballads like & quot ; Deeper Than Crying & quot ; and & quot ; Find My Way Back to my Heart. & quot ; These tracks are beautiful and they 're NOT & quot ; straight bluegrass & quot ; for you purists - Ron Block trades in his trusty 5-string for some tasty acoustic guitar work and these are closer to folk or even just & quot ; unplugged pop & quot ; than to bluegrass . The Dan Tyminski tracks are rollicking rip-roaring bluegrass monsters like & quot ; I 'll Remember You , Love in my Prayers & quot ; and & quot ; The Road is a Lover & quot ; .This CD is one of the very best by Alison Krauss and Union Station , and that is saying something . If you 're a fan of Alison , or maybe you just heard something about & quot ; those musicians on the O Brother soundtrack & quot ; this is a recording you just have to add to your collection .	1
I 've long been a fan of Alison Krauss and her band , Union Station . Their brand of contemporary bluegrass is unique and captivating . This album is their best work to date . Superb quality throughout , including the instrumentals . The title track is irresistable , and & quot ; There is a Reason & quot ; is rapturous . Impeccable musicianship and superb recording , along with Krauss 's unique vocal style and virtuoso fiddle playing combine to make this CD a must-have for fans of bluegrass . In a word , masterful .	1
Allison Krauss is truly talented . Such a beautiful voice . This disc has the best songs of all her discs . Easy listening .	1
Generally speaking , you could say that there two sides to Alison Krauss and Union Station . The softer melodic side is usually with Alison vocally in front , and the faster bluegrass/country side which often has one of the band members on lead vocals.Though I usually prefer the Alison songs , this two-sides concept gives a fine variation and the fast bluegrass tracks demonstrate what great musicians the Union Station are.Among Alison 's songs , which are all great , for me the beautiful pop ballad `` Happiness '' stand out , which also has great harmony vocals by banjoplayer Ron Block.With at least a handful other great pop/country ballads written by various songwriters like Michael McDonald and Mark Simos this is one of my favourite albums by the group .	1
My wife just bought this CD for me from a thrift store for $ 2.00 & I love it . I own 2 SACDs of Allison Krauss & always wanted more but was too busy keeping up with other musical artists . I love Blue Grass because of its Celtic roots & American folk history . It 's pre-country without steel guitars & songs about truck driving & broken hearts . It 's songs about real life ; religious & secular . I read many reviews about this CD & most got it right . I like to hear Allison Krauss sing because the male soloists throw me off with the more `` twangy '' aspects of Blue Grass . I believe the male singers sound best backing up Allison Krauss . There is more to this CD then Blue Grass , lots of beautiful folk ballads . Yes , the fast songs reveal Blue Grass at its best & the slow ballads are a great antithesis . A rating of 4 for the male soloists , I may need a few spins of the CD to re-gear my mind for a rating of a 5 . Good sound production with Allison Krauss in the left channel . Some write that they think the instruments over power the singers but I hear everything . Maybe it 's their stereo set up .	1
If your a fan of this title you better pick up the DVD audio version fast , if you can play DVD audio , before it 's gone . Sounds fantastic , sadly stereo only ( reason for 4 stars ) but still highly recommended . Going going gone ... ..	1
I heard Love at the Five and Dime on the radio ( WWUH ) one rainy morning in 1986 on my way to work in Hartford . Nanci 's fresh and honest sound was literally music to ears accustomed to machine-like synth-based 80 's rock . I immediately went over to Integrity 'n Music in Wethersfield and picked up a copy ( in vinyl of course ) . That cut plus Last of the True Believers and More than a Whisper proved riveting and honest.A few weeks later , in full fanship , I caught Nanci alone with her guitar ( and the resident reptiles ) at Roaring Brook Nature Center singing many of these same songs . Later , her divorce and political stridency soured her music and furrowed her brow . Her subsequent work was packed with beauty but she never again scaled these peaks of pure simplicity and romance .	1
This is some of her very early work , great music . I love this woman 's work . Any of her albums are well worth buying .	1
Never did I ever think I 'd be listening to a female vocalists that has the sound in her voice I 'd been looking for the past 2 decades ... 20 years too earlythis sounds like today but it was yesterday.One of her best worksevery song is a jewelafter buying it once - I 'd buy it againA definite must have !	1
The thing that stands out the most to me about this masterpiece , is how the synthesizers and guitars are given equal importance and blend perfectly together . The only other 80 's new wave band that I can think of that pulled this off is Duran Duran ( Rio ) . So if you love the sound of guitars and synthesizers together , this album is for you . A pleasure all the way through ! !	1
Over the years , i 've heard so much about different versions of this album , and that the 5:06 version with the space intro on the original US CD pressing is NOT the original album version . Well , do n't expect to find that other version here , because the new reissue uses the 5:06 version . But you can find the other version on the CD Then 80s Totally Oldies volume 5 . But back to this CD , the first noticeable difference from my original US pressing is that the song order is changed slightly -- maybe comparable to one of the european releases of the album . Personally , I felt having the space intro version of I Ran first was a very effective way to begin the album . But no biggie -- that 's what programing CD players is for . The real treasures here are the bonus tracks , including the awesomely AFOS tracks Tokyo and Pick Me Up . Plus you get Tanglimara , which was already a bonus track on the reissue of the album Listen , so not sure why they had to include it again on another reissue . Truth be told , the CD only runs about 55 minutes , so they really could have included the original version of I Ran without the space intro and with the cold end as a bonus track , which would have been the only way to really make this reissue even better .	1
future generations probably will not get it . but this album was a revolution , goofy hair and all . AFOS was making the music of the future in the 80s , and there is n't a bad song on this disk.Space Age Love Song is a perfect song . Absolutely perfect .	1
This is a great album . Trust me . And what no one seems to remember is that these guys are Grammy Winners - yes , GRAMMY WINNERS - for Best Instrumental of the Year for the fantastic D.N.A . from this , their debut album . This is a classic example of a band whose image was so strong ( who can forget THAT HAIR ! ! ) that it often overshadowed their talent ( another fine example is Culture Club ) . Unfortunately , it was all downhill from here , as their popularity ( not to mention their creativity and their stability ) quickly waned . Very upbeat , energetic dance pop-rock , with just enough synths and effects to make it stand out in the crowd . My advice : skip the many `` best of '' compilations and go straight to this one . And when you get ridiculed for playing it , just like you did in high school ( you know who you are ... ) do the Flock proud and wear that freak badge with honor .	1

I did n't know that this album was remastered until recently and it sold out , so I had to order from amazon uk . This is one of my favorite new wave albums . It 's one of those records I never really get tired of . There is only one weak song imo , You Can Run , but even that one is n't so bad . The album has a nice mix of guitar and synthesizer . The classic I Ran is here along with other favorites like Space Age Love Song , Messages , DNA , and Telecommunication . I 've always liked Standing in the Doorway a lot , too . The remastered sound is very good . Just listen to the drums kick in on DNA . The original version of the CD I have is only 10 tracks and is in a different sequence . Here we get Tokyo added on , which is good because it was previously hard to find . I 'm guessing this may have been the way the UK version was made.They should 've included the shorter version of I Ran as a bonus , but , I 've always thought the longer one was better anyway . The bonus tracks are good , especially Windows which is the best of them . The booklet has been expanded which is really nice . It includes lyrics to most of the songs and some interesting liner notes by a long-time fan . Another great release by this company , which also did the great Kim Wilde remasters.The other 2 AFOS albums with the original line-up are also available remastered . Their other albums after those are really more for hardcore fans . If you love new wave , get this one . It 's a must have if you love rock and synth music .	1
The debut album `` A Flock of Seagulls '' is a riveting work by a band who truly strove to craft a music for the ages . Mike Score , along with his brother Ali , Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley had made an album of substance , style , and wit , truly the bane of anything MTV wanted to promote , which is why their fortunes quickly waned in the US . The CD reissue is identical to the vinyl with just one small complaint : Why did Jive Records have to take the intro off of the Live B-side version of `` I Ran '' ( found on the 45 of `` ( It 's Not Me ) Talking '' ) and tack it onto the studio version of the song ? BLASPHEMOUS ! ! ! I had the good fortune of seeing the band at Radio City in NY in August of 1983 , and they did , indeed , rock the house ! !	1
Lately I 'd been thinking about performers who had one album in their career that was so good it eclipsed everything else they did , rendering even greatest hits albums irrelevant . The first band I think of in that regard is A Flock of Seagulls . This first album is better than many of their peers ' greatest hits collections . For that matter I 'd put in on the shortlist of best debuts ever.In this era of cherry picking just the memorable mp3s from an album , this is one of those albums that should just be downloaded as a whole . Oh , I could do without the two instrumentals that close the album ; it does n't matter to me that `` DNA '' won a grammy . But just about every other song here would rate at least an 8 on a scale of 10 . Particular highlights are `` Messages '' , which for my taste was one of the defining songs of 1982 and the best thing A Flock of Seagulls ever recorded , `` Standing in the Doorway '' , and `` Modern Love Is Automatic '' .Over the years A Flock of Seagulls has endured a lot of ridicule for being supremely 80s in their fashion sense , but such envy is just an attempt to distract the listener from the fact that those criticizing the band never came close to putting out an album this good .	1
A fantastic debut and rather sadly the best the group ever came to release . Songs on the album do n't have a glitch throughout . In comparison , this studio effort outperforms most every Greatest Hit CD the typical techno-pop band has available on the market today . The cuts I Ran ( their breakthrough Top10 hit ) , Space Age Love Song , You Can Run , Messages , Telecommunication , Modern Love Is Automatic and D.N.A . are among the songs I likely have best appreciated over their career . What was especially great about the group I felt and still do is that it did n't rely entirely on synthesized effect ( s ) . The band members knew the difference between their singing/songwriting and whatever the talent synthesizers then had to offer.During the early 80 's , listeners fortunate enough to experience their sound witnessed something no technically advanced counterpart or rivals have since come to surpass . If you did n't get the chance like I myself got back then to be introduced to this band 's music or if your ears were simply not much smaller than your feet , buying this now CD I 'm convinced would be a decision you would n't regret and an addition invaluable to your set as times passed on . God bless all free nations who have allowed/inspired such this human musical creativity to evolve ...	1
When `` I Ran '' hit the radio charts , I knew music was changing for the eighties . I had to run out and buy this album right away . It 's not so much the hit record of `` I Ran '' that makes this album great , it 's all that electronic experimentation ( also psychedelic ) that makes this album so cherishable . Each track had an interesting opening that did n't just start a song , but it created an otherworldly effect that made you forget that this is just another pop album . The secondary hit from this album , is the second song `` Space Age Love Song '' , which I think should have probably been released as a single first , because it sounded very similar to `` I Ran '' but still lacked that hook that separated it from the other new New Wave techno stars of the eighties . If `` I Ran '' was the second released single , then maybe A Flock of Seagulls would be embraced more . Give people a small taste first , and then deliver the best piece of the pie.My favorite track after `` I Ran '' , is the last track called `` Man Made . '' It has that seventies techno progressive ambient feel to it . After this album , their next album called `` Listen '' had a great track called `` Wishing ( I Had a Photograph of You ) '' which was great , but their `` best of '' album that got released a couple years later gave us a better nine minute version where their instrumentation talents were once again allowed to be expressed aggressively . On `` Listen '' there are a few dark instrumental tracks that would make you feel like this could not possibly be A Flock of Seagulls . I have them both . A Flock of Seagulls is a very underrated eighties group . And I ca n't believe that this CD is already out of print . It 's worth looking for.Basically , just like Gary Numan , Depeche Mode , The Buggles , Yello , even the later Rush albums , and many other artists sounded like they all had one major influence to what became New Wave in the eighties . I think their greatest influence , was Kraftwerk .	1
... and we just got MTV in my home , I think it was May . I was immediately transfixed by the new music video channel . Prior to my budding interest in New Wave music , which started a couple years before , I spent the 1970 's listening to Kiss . And considering the lyrical content of just about every Kiss song , I can see why it appealed to me as a pre-teen . It 's beyond juvenile . But now it was time to grow up and listen to songs about spaceships and aliens , with bands looking the part . Enter A Flock Of Seagulls . From the first time I saw the video for 'I Ran ' , I was hooked . The song was ( and still is ) awesome , the band looked odd and cool , and I had to have the LP . So as I often did at that age , I cleaned the house to earn the $ 6.99 to buy the album from my local record store . Thankfully , they had one misplaced copy , and I got it ! It turned out to be a great year for music , and I 'm not just talking singles . The bulk of most New Wave LP 's released in the early 80 's were often very good , and this album was a prime example . I remember the first time I heard the instantly memorable and catchy 'Telecommunication ' , I had to play it again . The sound that stood out most to me on the album was Paul Reynolds ' very distinctive guitar . His classic guitar riffs rule energetic timepieces like 'You Can Run ' and 'Modern Love is Automatic ' . I could n't get enough of this band at the time , and even remember the world premiere of their new video , 'Space Age Love Song ' . The band were hot at the time , but it was a shame to have them viewed as a joke in the musically miserable 90 's . Thankfully , appreciation for the band as true individuals has remained , and even increased over time . I 've never been ashamed to admit to being a fan , even when people were drowning themselves in dreck like Nirvana and Pearl Jam back in those grey days.This latest CD edition is remastered entirely from original studio master tapes , and sounds dramatically improved over previous CD releases . You also get essential bonus tracks . 'Windows ' may be my personal favorite AFOS song . Its got a strangely catchy melancholy to it . 'Pick Me Up ' makes its first CD appearance on this edition , and is just as catchy as some of the better album tracks.A Flock of Seagulls would go on to release two more very strong albums , Listen ( 1983 ) and The Story of a Young Heart ( 1984 ) before falling apart . When Paul Reynolds was out of the band , it was over . I loved seeing them back together years ago in the VH1 episode of Bands Reunited , and it looked as if everyone truly enjoyed themselves . Unfortunately , by the time the tour made it to my area , advertised as the original band , it was back to being Mike Score and his alternate band . It would have been a Dream Come True ( pun intended , regarding their lackluster 1986 album ) to have seen my first MTV love in their original incarnation . Say what you want about the hairdo , AFOS released some amazing music during their heyday . Go on , admit it all you metal and grunge fans , you always had a secret soft spot for A Flock of Seagulls .	1
Call the lyrics dumb all you want , they are more interesting than 1,000 bands trying to search their lost soul . News Flash : There is no such thing as a soul . Keep looking for love and UFO 's and let us know your fascination with modern life . I love the guitar sound and the hooks make your albums the best . This and # 2 are the classics . What happened to make you so dull after that . `` Remember David '' was one of your best songs and `` Suicide Day '' was good , but the rest of the third album , even the tile track was boring . Two classics ai n't bad . Get this one right away .	1
KRS seemed more focused than ever here . During the making of this album , Scott La Rock , DJ and Producer of BDP was shot and killed . During the making of `` My Philosophy '' in fact ... which in my opinion is when Kris started showing his true colors . It was positive and negative , educational and entertaining..which had become the mantra of KRS ever since . On this album he tells you that Illegal Business controls America . He tells you how sometimes love is gon na get you . On this album you learn what the `` word '' `` Unrational '' means .	1
I ca n't believe I slept on this record up until a week ago . The only other BDP record I had before this one was 1987 's `` Criminal Minded , '' which is one of the most brilliant , and groundbreaking albums ever made . But I 'm beginning to think that KRS-One 's sophomore effort `` By All Means Necessary '' is just as influential . The murder of DJ Scott La Rock had a profound effect on KRS-One , which is very apparent in his engrossing lyrical flow . This record feels more personal , and much more concise . And in the eyes of many critics , including myself , this is KRS-One 's finest moment.Until now , I never knew that I 've heard KRS-One 's vocals sampled on so many other hip-hop albums I own . Not only samples , but covered choruses , signature time flows , and of course , the beats . Every emcee has been vastly influenced by KRS-One ; underground and mainstream . Check out the first song , `` My Philosophy '' . If you 're an avid hip-hop listener , you 've probably heard these lines sampled many times , `` Right up to your face and diss you '' or `` It 's not about a salary , it 's all about reality '' . Check out that cut-up Deep Purple riff ( `` Smoke On The Water '' ) on `` Ya Slippin '' , along with the familiar sample `` Bring it back that old New York rap '' . I was also shocked by the chorus on `` Stop The Violence '' - `` 1,2,3 , The crew is called BDP , and if you want to go to the tip-top , stop the violence in hip-hop , wyahhhh '' , or the how about the cover of that chorus by Mos Def & Talib Kweli ( Black Star ) - `` 1,2,3 , Mos Def & Talib Kweli , we came to rock it on to the tip-top , best alliance in hip-hop , wyahhhh '' . The `` Teacher '' is also in full effect on songs like `` Illegal Business '' . The often sampled `` I 'm Still No . 1 '' is also one of my favorites ( It 's hard to deny that he 's the best ) . I also enjoyed `` Jimmy '' quite a bit , where we here a reference to one of my personal favorite Jungle Brothers tunes , `` Jimbrowski '' .All in all , I 'm ashamed that I referred to myself as a hip-hop fan before I got a hold of this record . It 's so good it 's sick . You can bet that I 'll be checking out his solo career after after hearing this example of hip-hop perfection .	1
This track alone is worth 5 stars . The rest of the album is ok . But believe me when you LISTEN to the track , and how it applies to todays `` illusion '' of hip-hop its amazing how this 20yr old track is still kicking knowledge before you were in diapers . A must have for all hip-hop enthusiast .	1
this one is dope and that cover is dope too , lol ! overall a good krs album , good for those times when you want that old school vibe in your headphones	1
There is n't much to say about a certified classic . Boogie Down Productions was always on the pulse of conscious rap . That 's why By All Means Necessary stood out as one of the most dynamic albums in rap music at the time . Other groups like Public Enemy and X-Clan were more unabashed in their delivery . KRS-One had a vision of entertaining as well as educating their listening audience.Throw on a song like `` Jimmy '' where the beat and the mood are both playful , but KRS-One does n't joke around when he 's telling everybody to strap up and protect themselves when jumping in the bed . As a 12-year-old boy listening to this record for the first time , I knew there was more to the material being discussed on this song and would eventually learn what he was truly talking about in later years . Other songs like `` Still Number 1 '' and `` My Philosophy '' are the other standouts on this album . But the fact is that the style and sound of BDP made them stand out from the rest . The rock 'n roll edge of `` Ya Slippin '' was a risky move at that time considering most rappers rapped over old r & b ; samples or drum beats only . The Caribbean groove of `` Stop The Violence '' and the uptempo groove of `` T-Cha , T-Cha '' are other examples of going against the grain.Criminal Minded is always the first album people blurt out as their favorite BDP album . But once his brother Scott LaRock was murdered , By All Means Necessary unearthed the conscious mind of KRS-One . If you consider yourself a true Hip-Hop fan , then you already know all of this to be true . But if you 've missed a few albums during your lifetime , you should definitely complete your hip-hop collection with this album ... By All Means Necessary !	1
KRSONE ( BDP ) DOES IT AGAIN.DID N'T THINK HE COULD COME BETTER THAN CRIMINAL MINDED , BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID.TRACK 1 THROUGH TRACK 10 , ALL CLASSICS.SHOWS VERSITILE STYLES ON A HIGHER LEVEL.THE TEACHER TEACH , BUT IS DEEPER THAN THE AVERAGE PROFESSOR . CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST ALBUM , LYRICS ARE BANGING , BEATS ARE BANGING.IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS ALBUM , YOU ARE MISSING WHAT SO MANY RAPPERS ARE TRING TO ACCOMPLISE , BUT THEY FAIL.CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT LYRICAL FLEXIBLILTY IS ALL ABOUT.NO ONE DOES IT BETTER . KRSONE IS THE GREATEST .	1
Good album from one of the more prominent old school rappers , who is still around .	1
By All Means Necessary '' Fresh ! For 1988 , you suckers ! '' was the signature line from `` My Philosophy '' , the first single off Boogie Down Productions ' masterpiece second LP , By All Means Necessary . In the interim between their debut on 1987 's Criminal Minded and the summer release of By All Means , founding member DJ Scott La Rock was tragically murdered . Frontman KRS-One soldiered on , bringing junior member D-Nice and KRS 's brother Kenny Parker into the mix as turntable operators.Produced by the artist and engineered by Ivan `` Doc '' Rodriguez , KRS-One maintains the momentum of Criminal Minded with streetwise battle raps , but he incorporates more narratives about ghetto lifestyles and the dangers of street violence . The lyrics to `` I 'm Still # 1 '' are loosely based on a rhyme contest between KRS and rap legend Melle Mel at NYC 's Latin Quarters . `` Illegal Business '' dismisses the easy targets of the `` War on Drugs '' policy , making the point that the illegal drug trade is not divorced from the American economy . `` Jimmy '' makes a case for safe sex , and could be considered a sequel to `` Super-hoe '' . The reggae shuffle of `` Stop the Violence '' of course features the unforgettable hook , `` 1 , 2 , 3 , the crew is called BDP , and if you want to go to the tip-top , stop the violence in hip-hop , why-oh ! `` The most surprisingly enjoyable song is `` Ya Slippin ' '' : `` So assume you 're doomed when you step in the room ; I 'll be the witch and you 'll be the broom.. '' taunts KRS , as he rhymes over Deep Purple 's `` Smoke on the Water '' guitar riff combined with his own , slowed-down `` Poetry '' rhythm track . `` Necessary '' is a sonically-sparse nod to spoken word poetry at the end of the LP , a first for rap albums . This album could be re-released with remixes ( such as an alternate take of `` I 'm Still # 1 '' ) , and perhaps even a drum- & -bass remix of `` Necessary '' that surfaced in the late 90 's .	1
This is a classic cd , period . KRS-1 is a living legend , and this is him at his prime . Songs like `` My Philosophy , '' `` Illegal Business , '' `` Stop the Violence , '' and `` Still # 1 '' are some of the most quoted/sampled in the last 20 years of hip hop . If you think you do n't know anything by KRS-1 , one listen of this cd would prove you wrong The list of rappers who have sampled or quoted songs on this cd is inexhaustible . This was big when it came out in 88 , and it sounds just as fresh today . This is a gem among diamonds , a true hip hop classic . Even in Scott La Rock 's absence , the production is stellar . The lyrics are top-notch . As close to a perfect hip-hop record as possible .	1
When you mention hip hop to somebody , the name KRS-1 should come up . When you mention the most impressive LP 's , By all means Necessary should be mentioned immediately . Everything you want from a dope MC : Philosophy , Storytellin , Battle raps , you name it its found here . Cop it now !	1
Many have heard of the passing of DJ Scott La Rock but somehow , his sidekick KRS-One manage to still hold it down and still bring out another classic album under the name of BDP . Following Criminal Minded with 10 tracks of highly concentrated molecules in the form of By All Means Necessary , KRS still kept his rhymes as fresh as they could get . From My Philosophy to Necessary , the record introduced KRS-One as the peaceful Teacher and foreshadowing his gift for contradiction . The album cover may be very familiar to the famous shoot of Malcolm-X with a gun in his hand but songs like Illegal Business , Jimmy and Stop the Violence dropped science on drugs , sex and violence . With such a powerful voice and untouchable lyrics , KRS-One made us all believe his boasts that BDP would be here forever.Best moments= My Philosophy , Ya Slippin ' and Jimmy	1
It would be easy to assume , as many people probably did , that after the death of long time partner Scott LaRock KRS-One would fall off . However he gave all those critics a fat smack in the face with the release of By All Means Necessary . Although it 's not QUITE as great as Criminal Minded ( few are ) , it is definetly a worthy album and is an example of some of the best rap to come out of the Bronx . `` My Philosophy '' , the semi-sequel to the first track on Criminal Minded `` Poetry '' ( a great track ) surpasses its predecessor which is not an easy feat , and is arguably the best hip hop song of all time . Add 9 other great tracks and I 'd say you have an essential album .	1
this was when you had to be saying something in Rap to get true Respect.ANd KRS-One is one of the Greatest Teachers The World Of Rap has ever known.you got more Black History from his Records than from most classrooms put together.His Lyrical Flow & amp ; words hit home.The Malcolm X.Take was something Refreshing & amp ; much Needed.he did n't pull no punches here.I Miss those days .	1
By All Means Necessary showcases KRS-ONE at his best . He is definitely one of the greatest MC 's of all-time , and the material here should tell you why . & quot ; My Philosophy & quot ; is one of my favorite hip-hop songs of all-time . KRS talks about the state of hip-hop , the past of BDP , and their future . On tracks like & quot ; Illegal Business & quot ; , & quot ; Stop The Violence & quot ; , and the spoken word track & quot ; Necessary & quot ; , KRS speaks about political issues while he displays his MCing skills on the classic & quot ; I 'm Still # 1 & quot ; . And Kris takes the Jungle Brother 's & quot ; Jimbrowski & quot ; one step further on & quot ; Jimmy & quot ; . From start to finish , By All Means Necessary is a great album . If you are a hip-hop fan , you must own this .	1
This album is why I still listen to KRS-1 today ! If I saw this CD in the stores , I would get it . Lots of intelligent and conscious lyrics and he does n't hold back . I like & quot ; Stop the Violence & quot ; and its rumbling sound . I still like & quot ; My Philosophy & quot ; , & quot ; I 'm Still # 1 & quot ; , & quot ; Jimmy & quot ; and many others . But I like on & quot ; Illegal Business & quot ; where they sample some music that I remembered hearing on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids , Bill Cosby 's show . He mentions his friend Scott La Rock many times over the album . This is his best effort to me . While I like his later ones , this is the best !	1
This is classic 80 's hip hop at this time Krs was God this album came out when I was 15 and is probably even more relavent today because Hip Hop has died a thousand deaths already ... .For real hip hop pick this up ... .	1
There is no doubt in any TRUE hip hop fan 's mind that KRS-1 may be the best MC of all time , and this album just backs that theory up . Originally recorded after the death of his Boogie Down Productions partner Scott LaRock , KRS decided to pay tribute to his lost friend By All Means Necessarry , hence the name of the Album . This is a true Hip Hop classic and one of the most influential albums of all time . A MUST HAVE for ANY Hip hop or music fan.1.My Philosophy-10/10-Awesome , a Hip Hop Classic.2.Ya Slippin'-10/10-My favorite track on the album , Unbelivable , hip hop at it 's finest.3.Stop The Violence-10/10-Probably the most influential BDP song out there , great beats and infamous hook . Classic.4.Illegal Business-10/10-One of the most funky and catchy hooks from KRS , plus some pretty amazing lyrics and funny Fat Albert samples.5.Nervous-9/10-Just a bunch of talking over a beat . But the beat is tight as hell so it carries the whole damn song.6.I 'm Still Number One-10/10-Nice flow by KRS on this one , and a pretty tight snare beat too . Plus many see this track as the one that proves he is the number one.7.Part Time Suckers-10/10-Tight track with some pretty tight snares . Just plain good.8.Jimmy-10/10-Awesome song wif a catchy as mess hook , and some pretty cool and creative lyrics about safe sex.9.T'Cha T'Cha-10/10-Nice flow from Krs and a pretty tight hook.10.Necessary-10/10-Even though its a talking track it 's still a really good and true look at hip hop music.Overall this Cd is awesome . Get this cd by all means necessary , no pun intended .	1
FRESH ! FOR 1988 , you SUCKERS ! ! ! How many people can forget that line ? If you do n't know it , you do n't have the album ! So what are you waiting for ? Buy it ! Best Tracks : & quot ; My Philosophy & quot ; , & quot ; I 'm Still # 1 & quot ; , & quot ; Illegal Business & quot ; ; and the most HARD ROCKING track is : & quot ; YA SLIPPIN & quot ; , which hijacks Deep Purple 's & quot ; Smoke on the Water & quot ; guitar riff and turns it into a hardcore hip-hop battle rampage.Krs does a nod to spoken word poetry at the end , a first for rap albums ... & quot ; See how it sounds , a little un-rational , a lot of MC 's like to use the word 'dramatical ' & quot ; . CLASSIC MATERIAL , AN YA KNOW IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Another Banger from one of the greatest years in hiphop `` 1988 '' . Kris drops science like no other on this one . This still bangs today almost 20 years later . I ca n't wait till Kris says `` Fresh for 2008 ! '' You SUCKAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Krs-One is another one of those MCs , on a SHORT list of them , whose second album COMPLETELY took the first . By All Means Necessary was EXCELLENT , as he , just like Public Enemy did in 88 , brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop . This album represents Krs in his true form , and it shows on EVERY song . Here 's the review : Album Highlights : EVERY song is worth a listen.Production : Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Mattere : Thumbs up . Other than Public Enemy , who else was coming this political in 88 ? Originality : Thumbs up.The Last Word : This was a great moment for hip hop music . Krs-One came back in 88 for this second album and he did n't disappoint . If hip hop was still like this today , it would be so much better . One can only hope . Overall , I strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop , if you 're into politically charged hip hop .	1
I 've been wanting this album and I finally got it ! I understand that too short says inappropriate lyrics in this record , but this is for entertainment for grown ups , not appropriate for kids though . When I first heard the single Freaky Tales in appearance in the movie The Wood , I was hit when I heard that song . It appears when the blood gang are crushing and smoking . I wanted to know who was the artist to the song and I finally found out and I wanted to get this album and I finally got ! Warning : Not Appropriate For Kids !	1

This is $ hort 's first album . This is where he defines himself as the pimp , player , mack daddy of Oak-town , CA . It 's because of $ hort Dog 's early work that the Yay is on the hip hop map and this is the album that started it all.The production on this album is hella tight . The beats are bumpin ' and the bass is just boomin ' . Even on my stock stereo , the whole car be rattlin ' . The lyrics are classic $ hort . Who can forget FREAKY TALES . This is just 8 minutes of pure pimpin ' . In addition , MACK ATTACK , YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN , and LITTLE GIRLS are just tha shiznit . This is arguably $ hort 's best album.This is a definite must have for any hip hop collection . Old school Yay Area sound all the way ... YOU KNOW !	1
Too Short 's career has been spit upon by supposedly ` real hip hop fans ' . Those fans are stupid people because they do n't realize Short 's influence on the rap game and hip hop music in general . He basically started this pimp/ player rhymes and flows . He 's hated on for his flow , lyrical content , woman bashing etc . etc . His beats are slow ride out beats made for a car . Too Short is an underated storyteller as well . Sex stories have never sounded better than a Too Short rhyme.Although he released a series of tapes out the trunk , this is his first ` official ' album . 1988 ... Freaky Tales . The beat was so playalistic ... and the rhymes were on pizoint . This song was the joint when it came out forget what you heard . This song really got me into hip hop music . It is indescribably tight . 10 minutes of PURE TRILLNESS . Bliss . Other songs that were tight were Mack Attack , Dope Fiend Beat , Little Girls . Although the album is only 8 songs , the average length of each song is 5-6 minutes ... leaving plenty to digest.Although the album rarely gets any more spins from me ( because of his newer albums having better beats and rhymes and his constant innovation * check the Yo Neck Yo Back remix for sonic brilliance if ya do n't know ! * ) this is still an essential album for any serious hip hop cd collector . A Must Have .	1
This is where it all started . Every gangsta rapper knows where credit is do.With out this album there would be no 40 , snoop or dog pound . There 's just a few songs on this album but there very long , most avg over 5 min . This is short 's first album and he will always be highly touted for born to mack . The slow lazy high pitch flow that he gives on this album can never be duplicated . All the music was produced by short . The beats are extremly heavy based and simple with a good melody . The hit song on this album is freaky tales , which is almost 10min long ! Short comes into his own as a mack daddy and paves the way for all future gangster rappers in the 90 's and up . This album was made 1984 and still sounds great even today ( not sounding out of date ) P.S.Checkout dope fiend beat that 's my favorite .	1
The Oakland Mack is back again with another 4.5 star album . This is the 15th album of $ hort 's I have , and all his albums from 1988-1995 are 5 star classics or 4.5 star great albums . His 1996 album is my least favorite and worht 3 , then he came back in 1999 and 2000 with 4.5 star ralbums , and every one since 2001 is probably 3.5 stars . But back to this one , this is classic Old school $ hort Dog . 7 long dirty x-rated songs over deep bass funky sounding beats with no guests . Of the 7 songs 1 is ok , 1 is a classic , 2 are almost classics , ad the other 3 are good . Production is great as well , like on all his older albums , has the great funk sound to it not the sown south crunk style he works with now . A must have album from a true pioneer in the rap game. # 1 - 8 # 2 - 8.5 ( good beat ) # 3 - 8.5 # 4 - 7 # 5 - 9.5 ( tight beat with 9+ minutes of his Freaky Tales ) # 6 - 9.5 ( another tight beat and dirty song ) # 7 - 10 ( CLASSIC about little girls over a great beat ) Todd Shaw -- b . 4/29/66 -- b .

Classic album , many classic albums dropped around this time , Straight Outta Compton , No One Can Do It Better , Boomin Words From Hell , Great Adventures Of Slick Rick , Paid In Full , etc . Too $ hort is very underrated rapper , and this is one of his finest works . His beats are just incredible . In songs such as Mack Attack , there are some nice instrumental parts to the song , which shows off how good the beat is . His storytelling is incredible , one of the greatest storytelling MC 's ever . Bottom line is , get this album if u havent already , its a timeless classic , all tracks are the best but my favorite is Mack Attack .	1
Many of y'all might think that `` Born To Mack '' which was released in the late 80 's is hella old , and Too $ hort 's start at this rap sh* # . Well , you could n't be more wrong . Too Short started rapping and releasing records EVEN EARLIER ( ! ) - in the earlier 80 's ! ! He 's over 20 years in the game ! Anyway , in the mid/late 80 's , since he was big in Oakland and the whole Bay Area , Jive Records signed Too $ hort to a big contract , which made Too Short HUGE , and also added quite a few millions to his bank account throughout the years . `` Born To Mack '' was Too $ hort 's first album on Jive , it was released nationwide , and quickly became gold . Too $ hort presented to the rap world something that they had n't seen before - the pimp game . Too $ hort was the first one to rap about pimpin ' , mackin ' , the first one to come out with nasty-a # # rhymes about those ho*s , one of the first playas . All those sucker wanna-be a** pimps ( like 50 Cent , Snoop Dogg , etc . ) act like they are some big-time pimps , but Too $ hort was ( and still is ) the real thing . Coming from Oakland ( home of `` The Mack '' ) , Short Dog is first a pimp , then a rapper . In many ways , this music was innovative musically - some of the beats ( like on Dopefiend beat ) sounded VERY futuristic at that time , and defined the Bay Area sound , so popular today . Too $ hort is hella young on this album , and you can see . Yet , his flow is on point ( like it always is ) , his lyrics captivating and his storytelling skills undeniable . Add to this formula charisma , a huge ego and a great sense of humor , and you get the total package . You know the classic off this album ( Mack Attack , Freak tales and Dopefiend beat ) but the rest of it is extra dope too . This album symbolizes the beginning of an era . Too $ hort is the one who started this pimp/playa sh** , and he is together with NWA and Ice T one of the first rappers to put the West Coast on the map . A true pioneer in this rap game . This album is a must-have to any rap fan 's collection , it 's the beginning . Listen to this album and see where it all started .	1
I remember having to go to flea market to get this tap ( straight underground records ) But it was worth it .	1
Got my order in today and I feel great ! Brand new and in 1 week the album came in . Added to my cd collection and I 'm like addicted and obsessed with collecting classic real rap cds ! Ima continue collecting old school rap cds !	1
After emerging from the underground scene of the Bay Area , Too Short comes back with his mainstream sophomore effort Life Is ... Too Short . Unfortunately this contains only the clean songs not the original release . This version also contains a few songs from the debut album Born To Mack . The title track leads this album off with positivity and a message . He incorporates funk guitar licks over deep bass kicks and keys to match production efforts . `` Rhymes '' and `` Mack Attack '' uptempo tracks showcasing Sir Too Short 's flows as he spits constant without any hooks or choruses . To clear rumours , `` I Ai n't Trippin ' '' clears the air as Short give a brief history of his quest to stardom . `` ... now that I established one fact / I came here to rap ... '' a punchline found on `` Nobody Does It Better '' as he claims his position as a pioneer . `` Oakland '' is a mainstream , R & B groove that 's more like an instrumental interlude . No he does not rap or flow on this song , but he does calmly takes us on a ride in a Cadillac Barritz on Trues and Vogue with the top down feeling the breeze . Representing East Oakland like no other , `` City Of Dope ( Edited Version ) '' is the darker side of the city streets . Most would ignore Too Short because of his favoriate word , but these tracks shows his versitility and has a statement . Produced , written , performed and mixed by the artist with little help personalised this LP as you can feel the sense of pride taken for his releases and this one is no let down . Too Short still `` do n't stop that rap '' !	1
Too $ hort 's `` Life Is ... Too $ hort '' was such an influential album when it came out in the 80 's . Too $ hort was n't a great rapper in terms of delivery , but the beats , the grooves and his lyrics were all amazing and new . He essentially created the `` slow rap '' genre . This is definitely an extremely groovy album that makes for good background music as well . You could practically play this for anyone and they 'd probably like it a lot . The beats may not be as heavy hitting as some other rappers , but they 're still really good ( simple but effective ) . Too $ hort has a very simple delivery which gives him an odd charm - he makes it seem like anybody can rap . The other great thing about him is his lyrics which are always fun to listen to but are n't necessarily about much . He somehow manages to catch your attention really well . Overall this is just a really original and different rap album - it 's historical influence definitely adds to its rating . I do n't think mainstream rap fans will like it , but those with an open-mind will like it a lot ! Highly recommended ! Highlights include : the entire album !	1

After he finally got a major label deal after rappin on the underground for years , Too $ hort brings a tight follow up to `` Born To Mack '' ( the only $ hort album I do n't have that he released from 1988 on ) . Like all his earlier album the beats are tight and funky and the album is very tight ( which he has n't put out a 4 star album sice 2000 ) . Like all his earlier albums , the song count is short ( only 9 ) but the majority are 5 minutes plus over some funky beats ( that $ hort provided on all songs with help from al Eaton on 2 or 3 ) . It has 1 classic , 1 I skip , 3 ar eok and the rest are good or real good songs . Guests are on 1 song and do the hook on 1 so like most of his pre retirement albums , you get a lot of $ hort Dog . a must have album. # 1 - 9 ( tight beat ) # 2 - 8 # 3 - 7.5 ( beat is tight but I ai n't really feelin ' his rap style on this one ) # 4 - 7.5 # 5 - 5 # 6 - 7.5 ( f/ Danger Zone & Rappin ' 4-Tay -- tight beat ) # 7 - 8.5 ( good beat ) # 8 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) # 9 - 10 ( CLASSIC over a great beat ) Todd Shaw -- b . 4/29/66 -- b .

This is $ hort Dog 's best album , without doubt . All his albums are classic , but this one sits on the top . This is old skool rap at its best , with the beats and his lyrics at top notch . My favorite songs are CussWords , I Ai n't Trippin ' , Pimp The Ho , and Do n't Fight The Feelin ' . CussWords goes for almost 8 minutes and not at one point in the song do u get sick of it ! Amazing lyrics and the beat is just off the chain . I Ai n't Trippin ' has one of my favorite beats , just classic . This album is just completely dope , and proves he is the REAL PIMP ! Not these wanna-be fakers such as 50 CENT . 50 cent aint no pimp , but its obvious his idol was $ hort Dog . Get this album if u havent already , and if u into modern commercial crap , then u should pick this up too , and see who the real pimp is .	1
This is Too $ hort 's second album on Jive Records . It was released in 1988 and it was right away a huge success - in fact it was the first Bay Area rap album to sell a million copies ( it sold more than a million , like many of Too Short 's later albums ) . It is a real rap classic with Too $ hort once again spitting nothing but mack game all over the album . Ask any true West Coast rap fan about songs like `` I Ai n't Trippin ' '' , the classic cut `` Do n't Fight the Feeling '' , the hard hitting `` Cusswords '' or the pimp anthem `` Pimp tha Hoe '' and you 'll see what I mean . The album is timeless . Never mind it 's from about 13 years ago - it 's tight every time I listen to it . Good music never really gets old . The album was way ahead of it 's time . In the late 80 's no other rapper was talkin ' about pimpin ' ( unlike these days , where any sucka wanna-be playa claims he 's a pimp ) , and musically the album impresses too . It 's a must-have , period .	1
This Is A GREAT Album . It Is A CLASSIC , AND Has Some Of Too $ hort 's Best Songs Of All Time . The Beats are perfect , so are the lyrics . GREAT ALBUM .	1
They are still playing this and they probably will be 10 years down the line . After people listen to all the X 's , the kid 's , the busta 's and all those thousands of CDs from the South , they usually come back to Too $ hort , 'cause he was the first and is the best of them all ... I mean , playa for playa . For mine , & quot ; Do n't Fight The Feelin ' & quot ; beats anything that 's coming outta Puffy 's present day camp .	1
Musically Billy Ocean had a career spanning back to the mid 70 's that covered a very captivating and diverse creative ground . With his good looks , obviously well tailored appearance and strong , distinctive singing and songwriting the man was poised to be a huge presence on the pop charts . But up until this time only the albumNights ( Feel Like Getting Down ) , his debit album for Epic Records really made a huge impact at least on the dance side . When it came to this , his debut on Jive records things started to turn around for him at this particular respect . Considering his sound was always in the pop arena but never exactly what you 'd call out and out commercial , it was a bit surprising that this big splashy hit parade intended to be highly commercial still has such musical value . `` Caribbean Queen '' was Ocean 's breakthrough number , a slinky grooving dance/funk classic that is among my favorite such tracks of the year . `` Mystery Lady '' , '' Syncopation '' and `` Lucky Man '' are deep , slow grooving and slick funky numbers with some bubbly bass/guitar licks and keep that flavor going strong . The two ballads here , the Beatles `` The Long And Winding Road '' and the title song are both very passionate really and I especially like the way Oceans turns the harmonies of the vocals around on the Beatle cover . `` Loverboy '' is really a unique cut , a mixture of 80 's hard guitar rock and synth bass type funk that surprised me in terms of the songs that become hits . `` Dancefloor '' and `` If I Should Lose You '' seem to be dated to some people musically but they provide a wonderful example of the boogie funk sound still going strong at the time.On this album Billy Ocean managed to get that big hit album that tended to be needed for mass popularity in the 80 's without compromising the integrity of his sound very much . The music is primarility based in uptempo material , which is rather unconventional for the time . To make it even better that uptempo music is funk at it 's roots . And the bass , guitar and rhythm are as emphasized as the singer on that end of it . The electronics used are done so sparingly and go along well the songs . It does n't sound anything like Billy Oceans previous two albums for Epic . But despite how often some of these hits are played , it did n't really sell out his soul . A good example of an artist being themselves as they achieve well deserved popular acclaim .	1
Here is the beginning of Billy Ocean 's consecutive hit-making . Four hits from this album include the title track , LOVERBOY , CARIBBEAN QUEEN ( NO MORE LOVE ON THE RUN ) and MYSTERY LADY . Another memorable song is a cover of the Beatles ' recording THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD . Before Ocean , Peter Frampton covered the hit for the 1978 movie soundtrack SGT . PEPPER 'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND . The other songs are great .	1
Billy Ocean fused R & amp ; B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album . & quot ; Carribean Queen & quot ; and & quot ; Loverboy & quot ; are both must-have 80 's hits , and this album is the best place to hear them , because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD ! But then again , every song on this album is great , and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles ' & quot ; Long and Winding Road & quot ; should win over people who do n't normally appreciate 80 's music . But if you are a fan of the 80 's , you definitely need this album , and if you are n't , get it anyway !	1
Truth be known , I 'd probably keep this over his `` Hits '' disc . I say that because three of his absolute best songs are here in their original form , and some of his other hits border on cheese . Plus there 's other good stuff here too . `` Caribbean Queen ( no more love on the run ) '' was a huge hit , as was the ballad `` Suddenly '' , and I think my favorite is easily `` Loverboy '' . Plus this has the minor hit `` Mystery Lady '' , and a decent cover of `` The Long And Winding Road '' . That 's over half the album , and the remaining four songs I 'd call good filler . Any fan of 80 's pop/soul should consider this a must own .	1
Billy Ocean delivered here and showed the world that he was out there and already performing , the stars aligned for this offering and what a powerhouse ... my album for my time in Africa in the 80s .	1
After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire , Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar . The uptempo dance numbers & # 34 ; Caribbean Queen ( No More Love On The Run ) & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Lover Boy & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Mystery Lady & # 34 ; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country .	1
After peaking at number 22 in 1976 with his first hit `` Love Really Hurts Without You '' , Billy Ocean spent the better part of next eight years in near obscurity until he burst back on the scene with the number one hit `` Caribbean Queen ( No More Love On The Run ) '' . It is an all-time great 80 's hit with a slinky dance groove . It was followed up by `` Loverboy '' which was written by rock producer Mutt Lange and topped out at number two . It has a slick rock guitar crunch over a danceable beat . The title track is a 180 from the first two tracks as it is a straight , syrupy ballad that soared up to number four on the charts . The album peaked at number 9 and marked the start of Mr . Ocean 's brief run as the one of the biggest singers in the world .	1
Like 1984 's SUDDENLY and 1986 's LOVE ZONE , this album , released in February 1988 , spawned four hits . They are the title track , the love ballads THE COLOR OF LOVE and HERE 'S TO YOU , and the powerful-sounding GET OUTTA MY DREAMS GET INTO MY CAR . The other songs are good . I like STAND AND DELIVER also . I never saw the 1988 film starring Lou Diamond Phillips so I do n't know if that song appeared in the film . The other songs are great . Billy Ocean put out a dozen hits in the five-year period in which this album and the two predecessors were released . After this album , Ocean would start slowing down recording . Two more hits followed this album , LICENSE TO CHILL and I SLEEP BETTER ( IN SOMEONE ELSE 'S BED ) which appeared new on the GREATEST HITS album , released in 1989 .	1
One of Billy Ocean 's best releases , this album features a nice mix of funky upbeat cuts ( & quot ; Stand And Deliver & quot ; , & quot ; Gun For Hire & quot ; ) and romantic & quot ; Quiet Storm & quot ; ballads ( & quot ; The Colour Of Love & quot ; , & quot ; Here 's To You & quot ; ) . The highlight of the album is the FULL-LENGTH version of the huge hit & quot ; Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car & quot ; ( the version on his Greatest Hits CD was a shorter radio edit ) . This album is filled with fun pop music , but there are enough sophisticated touches to keep it interesting ( such as a trumpet solo on the uptempo song & quot ; Pleasure & quot ; ) . For fans of elegant 80s music , this will be a nice addition to your collection .	1
This Billy Ocean album is still one of my favorites ! For him to follow the very successful Love Zone album with this platinum album is an understatement . The big hits were Get Out of My Dreams , The Colour of Love , and Tear Down These Walls , but they 're no contest to my favorites here . They are the grooving Gun For Hire and the rumbling Pleasure . Some other songs I like are Soon as You 're Ready , Calypso Girl , and Because of You . But Gun is still strong today with that superb horn section , the danceable rhythms and other aspects . I played that song over and over on the tape in 1988 ! One of 1988 's best albums to be released in at a time when 1987 songs and albums were number one hits in May , June and the summer of '88 .	1
Jamaica native Billy Ocean had a Top 20 hit in 1976 , LOVE REALLY HURTS WITHOUT YOU . That should have appeared on this compilation with a few original tracks . The original tracks are LICENSE TO CHILL and I SLEEP BETTER ( IN SOMEONE ELSE 'S BED ) . The latter track features Will Smith , originally known as The Fresh Prince , who co-wrote the track . Hits from 1984 's SUDDENLY are the title track , CARIBBEAN QUEEN ( NO MORE LOVE ON THE RUN ) , LOVERBOY and MYSTERY LADY . From 1986 's LOVE ZONE are the title track and THERE WILL BE SAD SONGS ( TO MAKE YOU CRY ) . From 1988 's TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS are the title track , THE COLOR OF LOVE , HERE 'S TO YOU and GET OUT OF MY DREAMS GET INTO MY CAR . LOVE IS FOREVER from LOVE ZONE should be on this collection . Also there 's WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH ( THE TOUGH GET GOING ) from the 1985 film THE JEWEL OF THE NILE . In the video , the film 's stars Michael Douglas , Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito ( they starred in the 1984 predecessor ROMANCING THE STONE ) , appear as background vocalists for Ocean performing the song on stage . The actors were probably just lip-synching . Some of these songs were written by Robert John `` Mutt '' Lange , who produced music for The Cars and his country superstar wife Shania Twain .	1
This is one of the best RandB singers with a soft touch I really did like his music he had so many good songs I really did like Billy I still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he says I would truly recommend anoyone who likes Rand B music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good songs from Billy . It contains : Love Zone , Loverboy , When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Gets Going , Caribbean Queen , Suddenly , Sad Songs , and many other good songs so therefore this is a very nice album I really do enjoy this album ! ! ! !	1
Billy Ocean . Good old Billy Ocean ! Yepp , this is how real pop music is supposed to sound like.It seems all his golden oldies have been included on this greatest hits album : `` When the going gets tough '' , `` Loverboy '' , `` Get out of my dreams '' and `` Carribean Queen '' . And yes , `` License to chill '' is there , too . Plus some ballads , but I find them boring.It 's a pity that this is a CD rather than a DVD , since the videoclips of this singer are extremely entertaining . I mean , one of them features Danny De Vito . Another shows Jabba the Hutt ( ! ) . Or was that Danny in disguise ? Billy Ocean has always been a visual experience , not just your average pop singer . But sure , the music without the clips works just as well.Well , what more can I say ?	1
The mid-80 's was Billy Ocean 's heyday , in particular , the period spanning the emergence of his first hit , `` Caribbean Queen , '' the singles from his 1986 Love Zone album , and the first single from Tear Down These Walls , `` Get Outta My Dreams . '' This collection of hits by Billy Ocean , nee Leslie Sebastian Charles , shows how he specialized in heart-melting ballads on one extreme and high-energy synth-pop anthems on the other.Suddenly , his 1984 album , is represented by four songs . One is the catchy US # 1 `` Caribbean Queen ( No More Love On The Run ) '' , part of which borrows the syncopated rhythm from Michael Jackson 's `` Billie Jean . '' The sound effects includes eerie laughter similar to Vincent Price in `` Thriller '' and some suggestive sounds , not surprising in this song about a Caribbean seductress with painted-on jeans . The highlight is V. Jeffrey Smith 's brief sax solo . The title track is a schmaltzy ballad on how suddenly one wakes up and finds oneself in love . `` Loverboy '' , co-written by producer Keith Diamond and Mutt Lange , has a wandering pulsing synth beat throughout and a kind of hard-driving chorus , while `` Mystery Lady '' is a mid-paced dance number . `` When The Going Gets Tough ( The Tough Get Going ) '' from Jewel of the Nile , topped the UK charts , and nearly did so in the US , and is a feel-good dance anthem with funky synths . The male backups have a masculine growl on the chorus , while the female singers soften things up some of the refrains . This hit was co-written by and executive produced by Mutt Lange . This was also included in Love Zone , whose title track is a leisurely mid-paced ballad punctuated by lush synths and a funky bass.However , the best song from that album and my personal Ocean song ever is the tear-jerker # 1 `` There 'll Be Sad Songs ( To Make You Cry ) . '' The strings , quiet Clive Davis-like synths , and Ocean 's falsetto all combine to make this a winner . In saying how love songs touch the very heart of someone , Ocean reprises what Elton John sang two years earlier , that `` sad songs say so much . `` Ocean 's last big hit was `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' , another catchy dance anthem and another soundtrack song , from the Corey Feldman vehicle ( no pun intended ) Licence To Drive . Some eye-rolling suggestive car-talk involves , `` touch my bumper '' and `` let me take your wheel '' but this was big enough to reach # 1 . Also from Tear Down These Walls is `` The Colour of Love , '' another attempt at a hit ballad , which does n't have the same effect as `` Suddenly '' or `` There 'll Be Sad Songs . `` Of the two new songs , `` Licence To Chill '' fits more in the dance pop category , and is a close cousin to `` Get Out Of My Dreams . '' Mutt Lange 's production touches are evident here , particularly in the anthemic refrain : `` Yeah Billy , yo Billy , way to go Billy . '' Ditto for the funky masculine bed-hopping of `` I Sleep So Much Better In Someone Else 's Bed . '' I ca n't hardly imagine someone like Ocean singing something so sexist , but that aspect of the song is given by the Fresh Prince portraying the smooth-talking cad and Mimi the put upon woman in a typical lover 's quarrel.As this compilation is released by Jive Records , his late 70 's hits , such as `` Love Really Hurts Without You '' and `` Red Light Spells Danger , '' released on GTO Records , are n't included-that is on the Ultimate Collection , released last year . Still , a tighter and more cohesive package showing Ocean during his peak years .	1
If you grew up in the 80's-early 90 's you know who Billy Ocean is . This CD takes me back in time , i can reminisce and dance to my favorite , get out of my dream and get into my car .	1
The best thing about getting old classics , is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen . I may be 23 but I 'm very old-school and when growing up all I 'd listen to is Lionel Richie , Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , etc . But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean . Takes me back to my happier years and having fun . There are a few tracks that I do n't remember but they are still good , takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era .	1
This artist was never given the notariety he deserved in the eighties , and the only time you hear his stuff these days is on & quot ; Retro Night & quot ; on the radio , which is a shame . Billy Ocean has a smooth voice on ballads , and then he can pump it up to get you moving on dance tunes like Loverboy and Get Outta My Dreams . This cd compiles the best of his hits and you 'll enjoy reliving the musical past in that wonderful decade -- the EIGHTIES !	1
Born in Fyzbad , Trinidad in 1950 , Billy Ocean grew up in England , where he began his career in London dance clubs . After a few lean years he began to make a name for himself a song writer , and when he recorded the self-authored `` Carribbean Queen '' in 1984 he suddenly emerged as one of the most popular tropical-inflected performers of the decade.Ocean 's best known work of the 1980s is collected in this greatest hit anthology of twelve recordings , which opens with `` When The Going Gets Tough , '' a piece recorded for the film JEWEL OF THE NILE , and then winds it way through alternating dance floor favorites and lush love songs to conclude with `` Tear Down These Walls . '' In both terms of performance and songwriting skills , each selection shows the artist near the top of his form.Some twenty years after the peak of his popularity , Ocean 's best known pop hits are considerably less dated than one might expect -- largely because he did not rely exclusively on the heavily synthesized sound so typical of most 1980s performers . The best of his work , really , is in such ballads as `` There 'll Be Sad Songs , '' `` Suddenly , '' and `` Love Zone , '' but several of his higher energy dancefloor cuts also survive extremely well , most notably the sharply cadenced `` Loverboy . '' It 's a nice package , all of it easy on the ears , all of it playing out with good sound quality.If Ocean 's music has survived reasonably well , Ocean himself has not . Ocean was a very consistent performer and writer -- perhaps a shade too consistent for his own good , for after several years there was a general sense that his music was repetitive in both style and content . When combined with changing tastes and a few brushes with the law , it was enough to precipitate a sudden slide from the glory days of fame to an almost complete obscurity ; although he continues to write , record , and perform in Europe , he is now largely forgotten by the huge international audience he once commanded . Generally recommended , but primarily to those recall him from his 1980s heyday.GFT , Amazon Reviewer	1
Billy Ocean was one the most pleasant and emblematic figures of the pop movement between the early seventies . His repertoire was composed by easy to listen ballads and swinging pieces that were influence by the rhythm & soul . He is visibly influenced by Marvin Gaye , Lou Rawls and a little bit of Barry White . He was owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moments gave us along his career.This compilation confirms why he was the figure he was . Do n't miss this important album , part of the musical history .	1
So one day im over at Enrique 's , a haunt me billy used to be regulars at way back when , and billy comes up to me and says & quot ; I 've got this killer new song in my head , but i 'm not sure if its gon na sell. & quot ; so I ask him why not . & quot ; well you see its more of a nonlinear dramatic lydia lunch type of tune rather than my usual schtick. & quot ; Well right then I asked him to lay it on me , and knowing big Billy I moved back a little because that cat spits like a mofo when he sings . so afterwards I told him & quot ; look man its a great tune but change the words & quot ; get out of my subconscience and into my libido to get out of my dreams and int my car. & quot ; well I think everyone knows what happened from there . I just have to say kiler song BO , and i 'll keep the stool warm for you , oh and I 'll also save you a seat .	1
Trinidad born British singer Billy Ocean ( Leslie Sebastian Charles ) rose to fame in the 80 's where he had hit after hit on both sides of the atlantic with either happy pop songs or tearjerking ballads . Billy Ocean more then anyone is a perfect symbol of the 80 's with his music that is typical for that era and even if it 's a bit dated by now he still recorded some of the most memorable songs of the 80 's . However , it all started in 1976 when he recorded his first album , an eponymous album that spawned the hit single `` Love Really Hurts Without You '' that peaked at # 2 in the UK and # 22 in the US . Few people would know that 8 years later he would be at # 1 in both countries with his `` Caribbean Queen '' and also become one of the most successful caribbean singers of all time . Let 's take a look at the songs.It should 've started with `` Love Really Hurts Without You '' his first hit which is quite typical for the late 70 's . A happy uptempo Pop-R & B ; song with piano and disco vibes and Ocean 's usual deep but happy voice . i do n't know why it is n't on this version , cause I have the same at home with it included.Next song is `` When The Going Gets Tough , The Tough Gets Going '' which was the soundtrack to Michael Douglas/Danny De Vito 's film `` The Jewel of the Nile '' and on the video we had the two of them dancing to it . It 's another happy uptempo and one of my all time favorite songs that always make me smile . It peaked at # 1 in the UK and # 2 in the US . `` Licence To Chill '' is very simular to `` When The Going '' actually with a happy beat and backround singers + a closure with saxophone and it became his last hit in 1989 , proving to be a typical 80 's artist . `` Caribbean Queen '' from 1984 , was Ocean 's Biggest hit , a song dedicated to all the beautiful women from Jamaica , Cuba , Bahamas , Haiti , Dominican Repubic , Puerto Rico and Trinidad & Tobago . The song is a midtempo that actually uses the saxophone aswell . The song was also called European or African queen based on where it was released , but I prefered the Caribbean . `` There 'll Be Sad Songs ( To Make You Cry ) was another massive hit peaking at # 1 in the US . This however , was one of his slowest most romantic songs . 80 's classic for sure . `` Loverboy '' is a pop/rock song in fast pace from Ocean 's succesfulSuddenlyalbum . Simply put , another strong and memorable Ocean trademark . `` Suddenly '' is a ballad and another big hit from 1984 but apart from most other of his songs this one ai n't too remarkable or typical for him , it 's just a decent ballad . `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' sound a little like `` When The Going '' and it was also soundtrack to a popular film , The Roger Rabbitt film that is . It became one of his biggest and last hits in 1988 . `` Love Zone '' a power-ballad with some good percussion and another memorable hook . It became a top 10 in 1986 . `` Here 's To You '' was never a single and is a quite forgettable ballad . I think it was first released for this complilation . Maybe they needed more songs ? . `` I Sleep Much Better ( In Someone Else 's Bed ) a trademark midtempo with some backround singers and happy vibe . Released in 1990 it failed to chart . `` The Colour Of Love '' another late ballad hit , eventhough it 's very sweet song it did n't become as big as the singles he released in the mid 80 's . `` Tear Down These Walls '' , is a decent uptempo but sounds alot like previous songs aswell . It was released very late and never became a hit . `` Mystery Lady '' the last single from the `` Suddenly '' album is good aswell , a midtempo that may not be as famous as the others but is a nice addition to this complilation.Overall , although this compilation is old it is the best one with most of his hits included . I 'm bewildered though that `` Love Really Hurts Without You '' is n't included since it was his first song and also the ballad `` Love is Forever '' that was a minor hit eventhough it was n't too hot . Other then that , everything else is found here . I would have liked to see the songs in chronological order aswell , here there is no order at all . However , the compilation is strong and if you 're curious to find out more about Billy Ocean here 's a perfect way to start rather then to buy his albums . A good purchase ! .	1
THIS CD WAS AMAZING ! I LOVED IT . IT WAS SO GOOD TO HEAR SOME OF MY FAVORITE BILLY OCEAN SONGS..LIKE SUDDENLY ... CARIBBEAN QUEEN , LOVE ZONE , & THEY 'LL BE SAD SONGS..AMONG OTHERS ! THIS TOOK ME ON A NICE STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE ! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF BILLY OCEAN GET THIS CD ASAP !	1
From the middle 1970s through the next decade , Billy Ocean was a regular vistor to the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his special brand of soulful pop . The melodic appeal of songs like Get Outta My Dreams , Caribbean Queen and Loverboy is still there and tracks like When The Going Gets Tough , Colour Of Love and There 'll Be Sad Songs sound even better these days when the charts are filled with bland pop and boring rap . There 's just one unforgivable omission here , the great song Red Light Spells Danger that was a huge hit for Ocean in the mid seventies . No collection could be considered complete without that masterpiece .	1
Mr. Leslie Sebastian Charles , from Trinidad in the Southeast Caribbean , released an impressive amount of cool Rock-R & amp ; B material in the '80 's , which is , unfortuneatly , the limit of his musical ability . This compilation was put together in 1989 , and Mr . Ocean 's '93 effort , & quot ; Time To Move On & quot ; , even though I have n't seen of heard it anywhere , features him without his long-time mustache , which I thought had made him quite popular with the ladies in the '80 's , and dreadlocks . I even remember reading somewhere that Billy was at one time suspected of drug possession or dealing , but of course one knows that you ca n't believe everything that 's in print or what 's on the screen . Anyway , on to the tracks included on this CD . The number-one hit & quot ; When The Going Get 's Tough , The Tough Get Going & quot ; is first . My other favorites are & quot ; Licence To Chill & quot ; , & quot ; Caribbean Queen ( No More Love On The Run & quot ; , & quot ; Loverboy & quot ; ( a top-ten hit in '85 ) , my new favorite by him & quot ; Get Out Of My Dreams , Get Into My Car & quot ; , and finally the funky rap-beat-filled & quot ; I Sleep Much Better ( In Someone Else 's Bed ) & quot ; . Oohh , very provocative indeed . So , I think this album is pretty good , strictly from a person 's viewpoint which still has a place in their music collection for solo , group , or compilations from the '80 's , like I do . It 's not too bad , really !	1
This is a collection of Billy Ocean 's biggest hits from the peak of his career . He had an impressive string of hits , and covers a good deal of ground , from fast rockers , to slow ballads to mid-tempo love songs . The songs at the end of the collection start to lose steam , and represent the end of Billy Ocean 's super stardom , but for the first 3/4 of the collection it 's a wonderful blast from the past .	1
Billy Ocean . If you call him the poor man 's Michael Jackson , you should be smacked upside your head ! Despite & quot ; Caribbean Queen & quot ; having a keyboard part that sounds a little like & quot ; Billy Jean & quot ; , Billy manages to diversify to cutesy dance pop , funky R & amp ; B to smothering slow jams . Take the get-up anthems & quot ; When The Going Gets Tough & quot ; and & quot ; Get Out of My Dreams & quot ; , both fast paced grooving pop tunes . With peppy sing along tunes like those , it s nearly a crime that he was n't crowned the King of the era . Then there are adult contemporary gems , which are sang sweetly and lightly like & quot ; Suddenly & quot ; and & quot ; There ll Be Sad Songs & quot ; . Billy 's funkiest track that hints of the islands is & quot ; Love Zone & quot ; . & quot ; Loverboy & quot ; is a stomping rock beat dancer . & quot ; Tear Down These Walls & quot ; is a good combo of a pop song in a slower more romantic way . & quot ; Mystery Lady & quot ; is a romantic tribute . Also , Billy gives us guests like the Fresh Prince ( now known as Will Smith ) and Robert Lange ( who produced heavy metal monsters AC/DC and Def Leppard before this and country queen wife Shania Twain after ) . Then of course , there is & quot ; Caribbean Queen & quot ; , the blessing and the curse.It 's kind of sad that the despite being known before the breakout hit & quot ; Caribbean Queen & quot ; , a funky fusion of dance pop and R & amp ; B suavness , that none of those tracks are included on here . Billy Ocean 's & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; starts off with that unforgettable eighties jam ( career wise , not by tracklisting ) and touches on all 3 of his Jive albums , but nothing before or after that . Look at the date on this disc . 1989 . Is that an omen ? Unfortunately , all of Billy 's other stuff appear to be out of print or only available as costly imports . When you listen to this disc , you will fell something , whether it is joy or sorrow . I almost second-guessed the man and thought the only songs I liked would the upbeat well-known radio staples . I didn t even remember the adult contemporary staple ballads . This album is essential 1980s ! I guess some people have a time period in which they do their most successful work ( not a real revelation by any means ) . But Billy Ocean was n't just a part of the music scene during his run . Billy owned it ! Here s To You , Mr . Ocean .	1
I enjoyed this collection . Some songs I think were missing but I was a Greatest Hits CD that spans his career . I discovered an article online or newspaper that he 's alive and well writing songs and recording tracks for a new album . He looks good for his age . He has long white dread locks now . Time has moved forward but his voice and his drive is still intact .	1
By All Means Necessary gave us a taste of what was to come on this..it 's like he lead us with baby steps to this . This album is a beast . It starts with a nice introduction by Kwame Ture ( aka Stokely Carmichael ) , spoken in his characteristic soft and eloquent style and that leads right into the first track which starts out `` WAKE UP ! TAKE THE PILLOW FROM YOUR HEAD , AND PUT A BOOK IN IT ! '' That in itself should prove that this would be a different kind of album . This album pushed you to think , at the same time KRS was experimenting greatly with various lyrics flows at this time . The result is an absolute masterpiece o from a hip hop standpoint . I do n't think this one got much radio play..but it was n't created for that purpose.If I could..I 'd buy everybody a copy of this . Seriously . We need to hear more music like this these days .	1
This came out in the midst of a lot of negativity in hip hop which has since overtaken the genre . KRS-One did a good job here in denouncing racism both inside and outside of the black community , dealing with issues of identity ( the homeless and ya strugglin-note the subtle swipe at Michael Jackson in the latter ) and an all-star jam with the BDP crew ( D-nice , Miss Melody , Sister Harmony , etc ) . Some excerpts from Stokely Carmichael ( yes , THAT Stoke-shortly before his death ) are quite enlightening.Sadly , Kris Parker 's hold on the youth did not last much longer as gangster ( c ) rap went on to destroy the music , but that 's another story . Get this and see how rap COULD have been .	1
BDP was History FOr ME & amp ; Many Others.Black History at it 's Finest.The Great Mind Of KRS-One Spoke of Things that A School Book Could n't or Would n't Mention.The Music is as Strong as The Message.Along With Rakim , Public Enemy , Gil Scott-Heron etc.. School is in Session.Before Rap Got Watered Down this was The Real Deal.The way The Words were Meant to Be said.Track 9 & amp ; 13 do n't Front .	1
With this 1990 release , Boogie Down Productions was steamrolling their way to legendary status . This was back when BDP dropped fresh material every year from '87 ( Criminal Minded ) until '92 ( Sex & Violence ) , so that 's not necessarily as easy as it may sound . With classic tracks like `` Love 's Gon na Get 'Cha '' , `` Ya Strugglin ' `` , `` House Ni***s '' , `` 100 Guns '' ( Ja Rule bit this joint ) , `` Beef '' , and `` Blackman In Effect '' , you know that the album is , at the very least , doper than most other 1990 hip hop releases . But there are solid tracks laced throughout the album and there are no fillers . Personally , I ca n't imagine why anyone would give this album less than 5 stars , but that 's just me . This album is just as fresh now as it was 17 ( oh my god , 17 years ? ! ! ! ) years ago.As far as flaws , I ca n't think of any . Sure , KRS gets political , so obviously it 's going to rub some people the wrong way ( like most political stances do ) , but I loved it and saw nothing wrong with it . The beats are strictly b-boy styled boom bap vibes and nothing less . If you ai n't feelin ' that , then you may be browsing the wrong genre for your music.Edutainment is just that -- educational entertainment . There is n't a beat that KRS One ca n't get busy on and he entertains the masses with knowledge instead of dreams of material prosperity . Hip hop heads all around the world ( myself included ) recognize him as one of the illest to ever stand in front of a microphone . The production is on point , so what more could you ask for ? I recommend grabbing this album if you cross paths with it.Standout Tracks : The Homeless , Ya Strugglin ' feat . Kwame Toure , Beef ( My Favorite ) , Ya Know The Rules , Love 's Gon na Get 'Cha ( Material Love ) , House Ni***s , Blackman In Effect , Original Lyrics feat . Special K , and 100 Guns	1
Standout cuts : & quot ; Love 's Gon na Getcha & quot ; - recently covered by none other than Snoop Doggy Dogg.Beef- Kris checked the beef industry long before Oprah.Ya Struggling- disdainful R & amp ; B artists are skewered in this playful assault.Breath Control II- a mellow reggae message moment.Get this album , folks ! It 's still hot ! !	1
With stripped down production , brilliant lyrics and the fiercest delivery of his career , KRS-One and company deliver the best LP in thier entire musical cannon . While many disliked and/or misunderstood this album when it first appeared , the last decade and a half have opened minds and ears to it 's sheer daring and revolutionary impact . The music , as always is sliced down to the barest essentials , a simple 808 drum machine here , some reggae flavoring there ( the hypnotic `` Breath Control II '' ) African Drums ( `` The Homeless '' ) and even wah-wah guitar over funky drums ( `` Original Lyrics '' , my personal fave ) and the production is n't too crowded allowing Parker 's biting , incisive lyrics and terrific vocals plenty of breathing room and the attention they deserve . While things do get a bit preachy , the sheer enjoyment of these performances will leaven out the heavy-handed tone of the words . A rap LP was never more aptly titled . School is in session .	1
Readers of this space may be aware that over the past year or so I have gone to great lengths to highlight some of the blues greats that I was doggedly devoted to as a kid ( and still am ) and helped form in me , and others from my generation , the Generation of '68 as well , an important musical component as we fought our political battles for a more just society . The names of Lead Belly , Josh White , Son House , Muddy Waters and the like easily come to mind.And then in a whisper in the back of the brain comes- do n't forget Buddy Guy . Well , of course . The Chicago blues branch of the blues tree would not be complete without recognizing what every serious blues artist of the time recognized- here was a master . This CD only goes to prove the point . Electric guitar , acoustic guitar , solo , with Junior Wells , without Junior , as a backup to others Guy did it all . Even with all-star help of Jeff Beck and the like here this is strictly Buddy 's gig . That 's why there was that little whisper.So what is good here ? Well , how about the title track `` Damn Right , I 've Got The Blues '' , `` Black Night '' and the jump tune '' Where Is The Next One Coming From ? '' . But , for my money Buddy 's rendition of `` Mustang Sally '' is worth the price of admission . Ca n't you just see Sally riding now ? Listen and see if you agree .	1
Fans of Blues music know that there are some living legends which we are all lucky to listen to and if we are really lucky we get to see them live at their best . Buddy Guy ranks high among the living legends of the Blues . He has influenced and been appreciated by some of the truly great musicians of both rock and blues . Jimi Hendrix , Stevie Ray Vaughan , Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton were ( and are among ) his greatest fans . They like so many others appreciate his virtuosity and his skill at improvisation.In interviews regarding Damn Right I 've Got the Blues , Guy says that Silvertone allowed him to do on record what he had been longing to do for years . Damn Right nicely show cases Guy 's skills and genius at the guitar . He does covers of songs by Willie Dixon , Eddie Boyd , Louis Jordan and John Hiatt , as well as a number of originals including the original . With help from Jeff Beck , Buddy sizzles on Mustang Sally . Black Night is done in the heartfelt and soulful manner that only Buddy can do . The instrumental Remembering Stevie is a wonderful tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan.This is a wonderful CD . It was done in a way that Buddy Guy had long wanted to do . Moreover it brings the blues to a greater audience and there is truly nothing wrong with that . If we are to keep the blues alive , we need CD 's such as this . Go for it Buddy .	1
DAMN RIGHT THIS IS A GREAT CD.BUDDY PROVES THAT HE CAN ROCK AS WELL AS PLAY GREAT BLUES.I LOVE THE SONG MUSTANG SALLY.AND HIS ALMOST 7 MINUTE TRIBUTE TO STEVIE RAY VAUGHN REMEMBERIN STEVIE IS JUST GREAT.I THINK THAT THIS CD HAS SOMETHING FOR BLUES AND ROCK FANS ALIKE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND IT .	1
Excellent production and mixing , crisp , clear sound , and a strong track list makes this one of Buddy Guy 's strongest records , his second-best best latter-day album right behind 1994 's pure blues CD `` Slippin ' In '' .The track list spans classic electric blues , Memphis soul , and , well , John Hiatt . Guy 's cover of Hiatt 's `` Where Is The Next One Coming From '' is pretty good , but does n't really add anything new to the song , and we do n't really need another version of `` Early In The Morning '' , especially not this rather bland one.But there are highlights a-plenty nevertheless : Guy 's eight-minute rendition of Eddie Boyd 's classic `` Five Long Years '' is a delicious , smouldering slow blues , and he lays down a great `` Mustang Sally '' and a fine rendition of Big Jay McNeely 's mournful `` There Is Something On Your Mind '' .Buddy Guy 's expressive tenor voice suits the slow , tortured blues songs on this set very well , but he performs equally well on the powerful , swaggering title track and the mid-tempo `` Too Broke To Spend The Night '' , two of his best self-penned songs for a long , long time . `` Too Broke '' in particular is strongly reminiscent of Guy 's sizzling 60s recordings for Chess , and this spirited reading of Willie Dixon 's `` Let Me Love You Baby '' is among the highlights as well.There is an expanded edition out there which adds two bonus tracks , and while none of those are absolutely essential , they 're not bottom-of-the-barrel scrapings either , so if you do n't already have the original album , by all means , get the one with the bonus cuts on it . No need to buy it again if you do , though . `` Damn Right '' is a really fine album , deservingly winning Guy an Emmy in 1991 . The sometimes erratic veteran plays some tremendous electric guitar , and the self-penned material shows that Buddy Guy 's muse is not spent after all .	1
One of my friend suggest this cd to me , if you like blues , you 'll like it ! Well , he was damn right ! This cd is just perfect . All songs are really great and if you like blues , this one is for you .	1
This is the one that put Buddy back on the blues map . With the help of several well-known friends , including Mark Knopfler , Jeff Beck , Eric Clapton ( who once called him the greatest live blues guitarist ) , and the great Memphis Horns , Buddy burns on the more uptempo tunes like the soulful groove of & quot ; Where Is the Next One Coming From & quot ; & amp ; a definitive version of the classic & quot ; Mustang Sally & quot ; . Buddy 's gritty , passionate vocals are intense without being totally over-the top , & amp ; the background vocals are perfect . The slower tunes are not the old , tired , by-the-book standard slow blues , but are leisurely , rolling blues , focused as much on piano & amp ; horns as on Buddy 's guitar . He closes things out with & quot ; Rememberin ' Stevie & quot ; , paying tribute to his own biggest fan .	1
When Buddy Guy played the Hard Rock Caf & eacute ; in Bangkok in 1992 , he was asked which present day ` Blues ' guitarists he liked . Buddy just laughed and said that he was the only real blues guitarist left , as everybody else was just in it for the money . He told the story of when he had followed Muddy Waters up to Chicago from Mississippi in the 50 's . Muddy Waters was broke and Buddy wanted to be just like him , in fact on his first meeting with his idol , he claimed that Muddy had saved his life , as if he had n't shared his dried salami & amp ; cheese with him the young Buddy Guy would have starved to death . For these of you wanting to hear some genuine ` Blues ' music , recorded in a modern studio with all the sound quality that this gives , this is the album for you . It was , unanimously , voted Blues album of the year by the Grammies in 1992 . This album just reeks of class . Buddy used his basic road band of long time bassist Greg Rzab on bass , Mick Weaver on keyboards and Richie Hayward on drums ( temporarily borrowed from Little Feat ) . The group went to Battery studios with producer John Porter , who does a superb job keeping the sound clear and precise . Several musicians stopped round during this period to pay their respects and add a lick here and a solo there . These people included the guitarists , Jeff Beck , Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler , plus the Memphis Horns . Strangely , one of the weaker moments on the album is `` Early In The Morning '' which has the Memphis Horns , Clapton & amp ; Beck on it . It leaves the feeling that perhaps it was left on the album just to add to the star rating , not for it 's actual quality . The other low point on the album is a run through of Sir Mack Rice 's `` Mustang Sally '' , a fine song but Buddy does little to distinguish his version from the 500 other cover versions . The rest of the album though is pure golden Blues . The two long , slow Blues workouts are outstanding and allow Buddy to do what he does best , play his guitar . You get eight and a half minutes of the Eddie Boyd Classic `` Five Long Years '' and seven & amp ; a half minutes of `` Black Night '' by Jesse Robinson . John Porter 's production leaves both of these songs stripped to the bone , and let the emotions drip from the guitar & amp ; vocals . Spiritually these songs leave you exhausted , but nothing can prepare you for the albums final cut which is Buddy Guy 's tribute to his friend , Stevie Ray Vaughn . `` Remembering Stevie '' is an outstanding instrumental Blues song that literally sends shivers up and down your spine . Close your eyes and you can see Buddy playing with his eyes shut and the band giving sympathetic support , with Stevie looking down from high above . On this album , Buddy Guy makes mere pale imitators of all those that try to follow him . If you want the Blues , go for the real thing , go for Buddy . Mott the Dog .	1
I recently read a review on the 2005 & # 34 ; Expanded Edition & # 34 ; of this great classic blues album . And could not believe that they would edit out the great guitar work Jeff Beck did on & # 34 ; Mustang Sally & # 34 ; so I bought it and compared the two . And sure enough it 's gone along with some other less significant guest work on other cuts . So if you want to hear how this album was intended to be heard , the one that won blues album of the year , get the original 1991 version FANTASTIC ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Buddy Guy is one of the top blues guitar man.The others are Jimi Hendrix , Gary Moore , SRV ... In my opinion , this cd is his best work.You must put this at cdplayer , and hear as loud as you can , so you 'll be in tune with one of the most energetic , consistent , emotional blues sets ever recorded . Buddy 's vocal tunes are sensually incendiary , with the combination of right music choices , resulting this great album , with explosive interpretation of Mustang Sally , and passionate in all other tracks . I really recomend this 'Dam'n right ... ' , one of my best favorites in my collection	1
There are two giants that keep on promoting the lifestyle of the blues . The first is B.B . King . The other ? Buddy Guy . Here is a man that knows the meaning of the blues . At times he was too poor to afford guitar strings , and used wire instead . How he has any pads left on his fingertips to play , I 'll never know . But , he does play here , and it is very good.There is no doubt that this is an excellent album with the first notes of the title track . Guy makes his guitar cry throughout his solos , and his voice is full of soul and pain . It does n't slow down after that . He then turns around and does the John Hiatt cover of `` Where Is the Next One Coming From '' with Mark Knopfler and the Memphis Horns backing him up . Again , an A effort from the blues master . Jeff Beck appears on `` Mustang Sally '' , and then teams up with Eric Clapton to provide additional licks on Louis Jordan 's `` Early In the Morning '' . This whole album is nothing but high-powered blues . The album culminates with the powerful `` Rememberin ' Stevie '' , a tribute to the late great guitar master , and Guy 's dear friend . The tune is hauntingly beautiful and Guy bears his soul for all to hear.This album is what the blues are about , solid guitar playing , strong vocals , and feeling . If you 're a big blues guitar fan , this is a must have for your collection . You ca n't go wrong with it .	1
My first Buddy Guy album . I think it is pretty good . I like the title track . I find the blues classic & quot ; 5 long years & quot ; interesting -- quite different from the BB King and Eric Clapton versions . I usually do n't like the Fender tone -- it is can be a little too thin or piercing for my tastes , but Buddy has a tone that is warm by Fender standards . I read somewhere that he uses a Fender Stratocaster and Fender Bassman amplifier , perhaps he plays with his fingers rather than a pick - well , whatever it was sounds & quot ; right & quot ; . Buddy is a blues icon .	1
This lasts about 54 minutes . 4 tracks feature horns . There are three original Guy tracks . All are great . One- title track , 2- a slow moody instrumental dedicated to Stevie Ray Vaughan , 3-one of Guy 's best songs and captures some ferocious guitar playing for 5 minutes and is called Too Broke Too Spend the Night . If you wanted to , you could fit all of these songs into contemporary blues music for either lyrics or music , but only six of the ten tracks fit in a traditional sense . There 's 3 slow blues , including the instrumental track called Rememberin ' Stevie , the classic Black Night { done by Willie Nelson and Dr. John later } and also Five Long Years another classic covered in Eric Clapton 's all blues album From the Cradle . I do n't want insult the great musicians on this album , but you could say the only truly remarkable thing about it is Buddy himself . At his top level of playing on this record he is definetely one of the best guitar players in blues . Ups : Alot of powerful vocals . The keyboards are used perfectly , not over or underdone . Let me love you baby is a song that was written by Willie Dixon and one of the last songs Steve Vaughan covered on record and one of Buddy 's best recordings . There may be possible downs here for you , though it is all great music . In my opinion the extra guitar players were almost completely unhelpful , and were uneeded at any rate . Of course Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton did n't take anything away but your ears would have to put mine to shame to be able to distinguish them . Jeff Beck was clear but he did n't do anything Guy could n't do . Bottom line is that these great guitarists were just for promotion and they probably knew it . As for John Porter and Neil Hubbard who are probably in Guy 's live band or studio musicians- One or both played on all tracks including the ones with the other guitarists . They were probably only there for the occasional rythm or tiny sound effect or mimicry and really were n't much help even if they did more . They maybe even taking away from Buddy at times . I ca n't even understand Guy using them . There were back up vocalists in 3 songs which is an uncommon thing in straight blues . Lastly -highly produced and slightly cluttered with people who may not have belonged . The production may bother some blues fans but did however cause some great sound through the record and did n't take away from the character which Guy and the blues is known for . If you are looking for Guy at a more raw hard blues stage then get Stone Crazy which is a standard- Buddy on lead guitar and his brother Phil doing back-up work-then Bass and drums . It 's simple and also one of the classic harcore blues albums .	1
If you have n't learned already , you 'll learn now that Too Short is one of my favorite rappers . Almost everything hes dropped up until 1995 has either been classic or near classic material . Here is his number seven album `` Shorty The Pimp '' , more of the Oakland sounding funk that he is known to put out with the help of his right hand producer Ant Banks , who produced the majority of this album ... so you know it 's going to be good.Some tracks that immediately stood out to me were `` Hoes '' and `` No Love From Oakland '' two perfect sounding songs . The latter song , Short Dog spits two extremely long verses over a weird Banks beat . `` Step Daddy '' is a funny song about Short playing the role hooking up with a woman with kids . To me that is the best song on the album . `` Hoochie '' is another great song produced by D'Wayne Wiggins . The lead singles from this album were `` In The Trunk '' where Short spits one long verse , and `` I Want To Be Free ( That 's The Truth ) '' where he rhymes about how bad cops in Oakland are . For all you newcommers to Short , you 'll be suprised that he actually rhymed about something else more than sex . Near the end , Ant Banks , Pooh-Man , and Mhisani ( Goldy ) comes in for `` Something To Ride To '' where after they rhyme , the beat just plays for an additional six or seven minutes.Shorty The Pimp is an excellent album , especially if you 're a fan of Too Short . Some of the tracks sound dated , but never loose their replay value . Fans of Bay Area rap will like this one . This is a perfect album to get hyped up for whats one of my personal favorite albumsGet in Where You Fit In . Peace.Lyrics : AProduction : A-Guest Appearances : AMusical Vibes : ATop 5 Tracks:1 . Step Daddy2 . No Love From Oakland3 . Something To Ride To ( featuring Pooh-Man , Ant Banks , and Goldy ) 4 . Hoes5 . I Want To Be Free ( And Thats The Truth )	1
This is , by far , Too Short 's best album . The whole thing is full of his unique , laid back flow and Yay Area beats . IN THE TRUNK and I AI N'T NOTHIN ' BUT A DOG are the best songs , epitomizing Short 's lifestyle . IN THE TRUNK has the funkiest beat , and the bass ... you get submerged in it . The production on the whole album is tight and Short Dog lays it all out for the world to see : the Oaktown lifestyle . He 's an Oakland Vet and wants everybody to know it . This is a no compromise album and one of the best in my collection .	1
Too Short outdid himself on Shorty the Pimp , which is arguably his best effort behind Get In Where You Fit In . Its what you would expect from Short , boasting of having women and making/having a lot of money . But he does take a serious approach on here with `` I Want To Be Free '' and `` So You Want To Be a Gangster '' . The best track IMO is the surprising `` No Love From Oakland '' . Throughout , Shorty the Pimp is infused with plenty of P-Funk samples , but then again what can you expect from classic Too Short .	1
This is the oldest $ hort album I have , and probably one of his top albums ( I 'd give one 5 stars , four 4.5 stars , two 3.5 stars , and two 4 stars ) . Only 10 songs on here but straight funk on the beats , as every beat on every song and interlude on here is TIGHT ! Ant Banks produces 5 of the songs , $ hort Dog does 4 and D'Wayne Wiggins does 1 . Of the 10 songs , 1 is a classic , 1 is almost a classic , 1 is ok and the rest are good , no bad ones . Guests are on only 1 song so you get a great deal of the Oaktown Pimp on here . As usual do n't listen to this if you are n't a fan of some dirty vulgar lyrics , that made us all love $ hort to begin with . A must have for fans of true funk. # 2 - 8.5 # 3 - 9 ( dirty song ) # 4 - 8.5 ( another dirty one ) # 5 - 9 ( about Oakland ) # 6 - 8 ( about crooked cops ) # 7 - 8.5 ( about hoochies/groupies ) # 8 - 10 ( CLASSIC dirty song with great upbeat production ) # 9 - 8 # 10 - 9.5 ( about being a Gangster ) # 11 - 7 ( f/ Ant Banks , Pooh Man & Goldy ) Todd Shaw -- b . 4/29/66 -- b .

I 'm giving this album 5 stars to show that I have more regard and compassion for Too Short than he seems to have for my gender .	1
I have been listening to rap for a long time and no one can compete with Too $ hort . His Oaktown style is like no other . When I listen to this record I am brought back to a certain time period inn a place the only Too $ hort can emulate . Too $ hort brings classic raps of pimpin , slangin dope , and riding old school rides down the street . It is the representation of an era that canont be reprodiced , the early 90 's . `` No Love From Oakland '' stands out showing the real Oaktown funky Ant Banks beats . `` Something to Ride To '' features the Dangerous Crew and is one of my favorite tracks , with 11+ minutes of staight Oakland Ant Banks funkn beat , it just lets me smoke and ride on the city steets all day . COP IT IF U A PLAYER .	1
Boogie Down Productions take aim at the media and the mind state that hinders Black Americans on the controversial LP Sex And Violence . Krs-One practices edutainment as he makes attempts at both educating and entertaining with the same breath . This album starts off with `` The Original Way '' featuring Freddie Foxxx as a performance opener with a simple break beat and a bass . Krs takes aim at sucker emcees with `` Duck Down '' with a more up-tempo track . `` Ruff Ruff '' featuring Freddie Foxxx is 70 feel track with the guitar lick loop . The story tale of `` 13 And Good '' with an underlying funk track helps this to be one of the album 's standout . Teaching the truth about all aspects of life including religion , `` Poisonous Products '' has an alternative to what has been taught . `` Say Gal '' is a reggae melody as Krs attacks the quote rape victims of stars and celebrities with questions like `` ... why you go to the hotel.. ? '' He also takes a swing at the medians such as radio and television on the title track as he flows a hip-hop / reggae style . It is difficult to mix both education and entertainment , but Boogie Down Productions ' attempt was a good one worth lending an ear to .	1
It just never ceases to amaze me how KRS-One stayed on top of his game in the late 80 's and early 90 's . With BDP 's final album Sex And Violence , Kris was going through a lot of problems with his personal life , which included a divorce from his wife , Ms. Melody ( many know her from the `` Self Destruction '' single ) , and apparently was reducing the people in his BDP circle ( according to the linear notes ) . Not to mention what he did at the P.M . Dawn concert . So there was some stuff going on while recording this album.When I first heard this album , I was damn near blown away . Everything here is on point . Every song here is amazing in its own way , as it has it 's own message . `` Drug Dealer '' is a song about doing something positive instead of selling drugs . On `` Questions and Answers '' , Kris goes at those fradulant magazines and does his own self interview ( Do n't diss The Source though . Their chief editor give him 4 1/2 mics for this LP . ) Even `` 13 And Good '' is a interesting story about hooking up with an underage girl , with an unusual ending to the plot.When he is not kicking messages , Kris ' mic skills are still on point . On the amazing `` Like A Throttle '' , he goes with a vingence over a dope beat . The next `` Build And Destroy '' he gets a lot off his mind , going towards if rappers who are true to the Islam nation are legitimate in their rhymes . The final track `` The Real Holy Place '' , Kris questions Christianity and the credibility of the Holy Bible . Even Freddie Foxxx shows off on `` The Origonal Way '' , and drops a long facinating verse on `` Ruff Ruff '' .With producers like himself , Kenny Parker , Prince Paul , D-Square , and Paul Joey , along with Willie D and Sidney Mills , help create this great album . It 's very unfortunate that this was BDP 's least selling album . I guess everyone 's ear was heading out to the west coast , because they were dropping classic albums aroung this time . Sex and Violence should be enjoyed by all fans of east coast or early 90 's rap . In the words of Kris himself , this album is `` Fresh for 1992 , you suckas ! ! '' Peace.Lyrics : A+Production : AGuest Appearances : A+Musical Vibes : ATop 5 Tracks:1 . Like A Throttle2 . 13 and Good3 . Drug Dealer4 . Sex and Violence5 .

This album has always been under appreciated but he goes quite hardcore on this album.He also has some beats by Prince Paul.some pretty dope beats and of course his knowledge still reigns supreme on this album.Freddie Foxxx is even on this album.I would recommend this album , battle rhymes and some fun raps and some hard raps on here.Lyrics 10/10 Production 9/10 X Factor 9/10 Classic 8/10 Replay 9Total-8.5 out of 10 Fingers	1
This is probably my favorite BDP album . It has great lyrics , great beats , and is really a personal album . KRS-One talks about issues dealing with sex , drugs , and violence . I ca n't believe that this got bad reviews when it first came out . Favorites include Duck Down , Like a Throttle , Build and Destroy , Poisonous Products , Questions and Answers , and Sex and Violence . Get this and all of BDP 's albums to support the real hip hop .	1
KRS 1 has always been light years ahead of the rap game , and the Sex and Violence CD is just one more item of proof for that statement . Rappers like Emenem and Rakim have recieved an abundance of well deserved credit for their lyrical witticism . KRS-1 , however , takes lyrical wit to another level by using his tounge twisting talent to speak on more complicating issues such as the ethnic history of drug dealers , the hipocrisy of 5 % NOI rappers , The IRS as the true pimps of the world and more.The tragedy of this CD and KRS has nothing to do with KRS 's tendency to `` preach '' but rather with the immaturity and low level gratuities of a rap industry that has gone mainstream . In fact , THIS is exactly what this CD is all about . It may very well be that KRS will sadly go under recognized by an industry that he helped revolutionized . But I believe that will only be temporary . If hip-hop ever grows up and evolves beyond thugs , drugs and adolescent narcisstic content , then it may very well reflect on artists like KRS 1 and give him the props he deserved since his introduction to the rap game .	1
Sex & Violence -- Released in the winter of 1992 , this fifth studio album from Boogie Down Productions found its frontman , KRS-One in a state of transition . In his personal life , he was recently divorced from wife and fellow rapper Ms. Melodie , and had been recently sued by a former manager ; the ` BDP crew ' was whittled down to DJ Kenny Parker and sideman Will ` Willy D ' Broady ( in the liner notes a bitter KRS takes the time to point out that others `` are not down , so stop frontin ' '' ) . West coast-based rap acts were coming into their own as a collective , from Ice Cube to Cypress Hill . The Geto Boys gave a southern face to gangster rap and east coast-based rap had a handful of new faces like Black Sheep and Naughty by Nature . What 's more , a trend of infighting began with some of BDP 's fellow politically-minded peers like X-Clan and Poor Righteous Teachers , who took to criticizing KRS on records or interviews . KRS-One 's response to all of this was not as the pacifist he had gained a rep for being , but to come out with guns blazing , Criminal Minded style . The stark cover art by Robert Williams lets listeners know this will not be the average hip-hop statement . This was perhaps KRS-One 's angriest album since his first , taking swipes at various perceived enemies , both internal and external to hip-hop culture.Throughout the LP there are superb production values by the artists ( DJ Kenny Parker & KRS-One ) , and guest collaborators Prince Paul ( `` Who are the Pimps ? `` , title track ) and Pal Joey ( `` Duck Down '' ) . `` Questions and Answers '' takes on hip-hop journalism with a skeptical eye ; `` Build and Destroy '' questions whether Islam-influenced rappers are just bandwagon-hopping ; `` Say Gal '' bashes backstage groupie behavior . `` Drug Dealer '' admonishes street-level drug merchants to at least try to go legit ; appealing to civic-mindedness in drug lords may seem uncouth , but in KRS ' worldview , `` organize and legitimize your business ; remember , everybody else did this . '' The album 's other subversive track is `` 13 & Good '' , a tale of a disco club hookup gone terribly wrong : Guy meets girl at nightclub , they go home to be intimate , girl admits to being 13 , gets mad , calls her cop father who 's apparently on the ` down-low ' ... This predates R. Kelly 's `` Trapped in the Closet '' songs by over 10 years , by the way . The album hearkens back to By All Means Necessary with a spoken-word closer , `` The Real Holy Place '' , where KRS waxes philosophic about contemporary religious trends.The anger reflected on this album spilled over into real life , as KRS & crew would bum-rush alternative-rap act PM Dawn at a performance and physically remove them from the stage . Album sales were overshadowed by rap 's newer superstars ( and likely the Soundscan system which was n't kind to anyone who did n't post big numbers in their first week ) . As a result , this is arguably the most slept-on release from BDP . A deluxe re-release should include the excellent remix to `` We in There '' and any other bonus material .	1
I really feel like this was the best BDP album . KRS-1 is always amazing yes ... but this is just mind blowing ! It deserves 10 stars . Start your hip hop collection with this .	1
so far , my fave tracks:1 ) Duck Down ( sick , wicked drum beat . ) 2 ) Like a throttle ( club banger . how could you not dance to this one ? ) 3 ) We In There- good loop.4 ) Build And Destroy- This song gives a black eye to The Poor Righteous Teachers AND X-Clan . ( `` Too many teachers in the class spoil the school.After awhile you got blabberin ' F***in fools . `` ) ( `` What are you doing for yourself , Black Man , tryin ' hard to be the original man ? who ? the first man with the first tan on the first land with the first clan ? WHO GIVES A D*** ? ! `` ) Sucker , Wack Or Booty M.C . 's Need NOT apply . Krs-One made that abundantly clear on this album . ( `` I do n't battle to win or lose i battle to ruin your whole career . `` ) old-school hip-hop with a message as well ... what more can my ears ask for ? : D	1
I 've attempted to write this review before but it would not post due to it 's length , so I 'll attempt to be brief , ( notice I said attempt ) . Why would I run out of space writting about a seldom heralded little known BDP album ? Well , first being that I consider this album to be perfect . And I mean perfect in every sense of the word . Sex and Violence is my all time favorite album and I ai n't scared to admit it ... But first , let 's set the historical context . The Blastmaster was at a very strange time in his life when he made this album . He had just divorced his wife Ms. Melodee . He had split up from the majority of the BDP crew ( hence the harsh liner notes for anyone but Kenny Parker and Ill Will to `` Stop Frontin ' '' ) . He 'd been subliminally dissed by X-Clan , ( RIP Professor X ) , Wise Intelligent from Poor Righteous Teachers , and Prince Be of P.M . Dawn . Maybe even a little subliminally by Ice Cube and NWA , ( although that one 's got ta be read into really deeply ) . Hell , even D-Nice was talking bad about Kris in the Source . The Heal project had failed . BDP 's live album and corresponding video did not move the units that he or his label had desired . Even worse , East Coast Hip Hop seemed to be on a decline , ( this album was released prior to Illmatic ) . What to do ? Well , for starters , Krs showed up impromptu at a P.M . Dawn concert and unceremoniously through Prince Be off the stage , ( `` Damn , Kris IS kinda big '' ) , and then proceeded to rock the house to the tune of `` I 'm Still Number One '' . Proof positive KRS was not havin it in '92.Unfortunately , all of these incidents led to a very confused fan base . Seems everyone had gotten used to KRS ' Stop the Violence and Edutainment messages and forgotten Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary . They also forgot that KRS is still a human being and not some sort of deity . Ultimately , his fan base left him as it has done and will probably continue to do for years to come . The fact that KRS is an artist and will express himself with how he is feeling at the time needs to be recognized . I 'm sure ALL Hip Hop fans have felt alienated by KRS albums or ideas at some point ( myself included ) .Sex and Violence is the culmination of all of KRS frustration . The Blastmaster of old reared his ugly head and spit hard and fast . KRS bludgeons the competition with tracks like ... well , everything except `` The Real Holy Place '' which is a sort of spoken word piece about God being within us all and `` Drug Dealer '' . On the later , KRS brilliantly advises drug dealers of the world to unite and use their money to improve the community . Of course , all anyone heard was that the dealers should `` Organize ( their ) business and open up a school . This was again interpreted by any of his fickle fan base left that KRS wanted to make Drug Dealer High School , ( c'mon now , Open your mind and put a book in it ! ! ! ) .Other than those two songs , from the intro where KRS plays the role of a DJ dying from lack of vinyl , ( a BIG issue back in 92 , believe me ) to the final grand indictment of the IRS on `` Who Are the Pimps ? '' KRS seems to have no end of material for fueling his fire . For the sudden prevalence and dominance of Gangsta Rap , ( and most specifically NWA 's Efil4zaggiN album ) , the fire of the singles `` Duck Down '' and `` We In There '' came out punching with lines like `` I spit on your # 1 hit '' and `` in jail in a pair of panties you 'll look just stunning '' . For X-Clan and PRT there 's `` Build and Destroy '' where KRS scientifically breaks both crews and his philosphy down with classic lines like `` Too many teachers in the class spoil the school/after awhile you 've got blabbering f*ckin fools '' ( ouch ! ! ! ) . For society at large there 's the second single `` 13 and Good '' , `` Say Gal '' and `` Poisonous Products '' . Here Krs edutains the masses about our musical and societal problems with infidelity , morality , vanity ... Basically holding up a mirror for us to look at and ask `` What the f*ck is wrong with you ? `` To explain all this `` madness '' , KRS supplies `` Question and Answer '' . Here KRS breaks down the point of the whole album . In a format similar to `` Imma Break It Down '' by Eazy-E , KRS interviews himself about various times in his career , his overall message , his own sincerity , and what he 's doing to help . Sadly , this track was never a single so no one ever heard KRS explanation and most of the singles fell on what were becoming deaf ears.Next come the biggest surprises of all . The first is the crazy allout breath control fest of `` Like a Throttle '' . This is the ABSOLUTE BEST exercise in breath distribution ever . I 've memorized every line in this album and am amazed to this day how KRS rips this sh*t ! ! ! ! The second big surprise comes in the form of a newly invigorated Freddie Foxxx . While Foxxx had appeared earlier on Kool G Rap 's Wanted Dead or Alive track `` Money In The Bank '' , it is on tracks `` The Original Way '' and `` Ruff Ruff '' where Freddie starts repping the sound that made him the commodity he became a short while later . His LOOOOOOOOOOONG verse on Ruff Ruff is one of his best ever and , if you ever meet me or KRS or Freddie and are so inclined to hear , has a great story behind it.Finally , the results . After all that , the album did n't sell . In fact , it remains the worst selling BDP album of their carreer . The first album to receive a `` Mic '' in the source , ( they were records before this album was reviewed ) , received a 4 1/2 rating . The label released 3 singles ( all of which have near classic , must have extra tracks ) . They did three videos . Everything was in place except for the alienated fan base . Maybe they 'd all jumped on the West Coast band wagon of Gangsterism and Mysogyny . More likely , they just were n't ready for the new Boom Bap . I figure when the revolution that Nas , Wu-Tang , Boot Camp Clik , and DITC was brought to the table , KRS had to feel like he was slapped . The Teacha and more importantly innovator was ahead of his time again . Pick it up so you can make it your time now . ( Guess that was n't very brief , huh ? )	1
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game . His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now . Standout Tracks : DUCK DOWN , RUFF RUFF ( dope match up with Freddie Foxx ) , 13 AND GOOD ( the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches ) , POISONOUS PRODUCTS , QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS , LIKE A THROTTLE , WE IN HERE , THE REAL HOLY PLACE ( the deepest track on here ) , WHO ARE THE PIMPS ? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also . Filler : NONE ! Bottom Line : BDP 's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day . Besides the slammin production , Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album . Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album .	1
SEX AND VIOLENCE , Although commerically his worst selling album of all the BDP albums , lyrically and production wise , is his best as he ridded the rap world of X-Clan , Poor Righteous Teachers and the soft as mallow pie PM Dawn on the singles `` We In There '' and `` Build and Destroy '' . The 12 '' single remix of the `` We In There '' single includes a track on the other side called `` Feel The Vibe , Feel the Beat '' where he basically massacres that track and ended PM Dawn 's and his former homey D-Nice 's career.This had to be the first KRS-ONE lp that I could actually listen to the tracks more than I could just the lyrics . KRS-ONE was going through a lot personally before this album , the divorce from his wife Ms Melodie , the beef with former homie D-Nice , and the fact that east coast rap at that time in 1992 had taken a back seat to West Coast Rap being dominated by NWA , ICECUBE , Ice-T , Too Short , Snoop , D.O.C. , Geto Boys , Compton 's Most Wanted , DJ Quik . West Coast rap had become the rage and the afro-centric , edutainment rap that the KRS 's , the Rakims , the Public Enemy 's , the Queen Latifah 's , Jungle Brothers and Tribes of the East had continue to build on top of the foundation already laid down , had started to crumble . East Coast rap was being largely ignored by Yo MTV Raps , The Video Jukebox at the time , the two largest video players of rap videos . Unfortunately , this album like a poster said earlier came two years before Illmatic started the resurgence of East Coast rap again but lyrically was one of the better albums hands downs that was released that year . Though , this album will never get the mainstream props that Criminial Minded , By All Means Necessary , Edutainment , Return of the Boom Bap and his self titled , KRS-ONE albums receieved but real hip hop heads know that no MC would have dared come at KRS on any level after this.If this album was released today , everyone would think it was so new and fresh and diverse . A shame since this album came out in 1992 . What does that say about our current hip hop now ?	1
This album is the straight-up hardcore from beginning to end . People slept on this album when it came out , but they need to wake up and pick this up , on the serious tip.The most fiery cuts : Duck Down , Drug Dealer , Sex & amp ; Violence , Build & amp ; Destroy.Most subversive track : & quot ; 13 & amp ; Good & quot ; , a tale of statuatory rape with a twist ending ... .Superb production values by KRS-1 , Prince Paul , Pal Joey , and others ... This is the LAST album by KRS-1 recorded under the group moniker BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS . Check for his subsequent solo releases : RETURN OF THE BOOM BAP , KRS-ONE ( self-titled ) , and I GOT NEXT ... FRESH FOR 1992 , AND YA KNOW IT ! ! !	1
These boys been doing they thing for what , 15 years now . I didnt know about this album until recently . I was very familiar with Ridin Dirty tho . I thought that that was there first album . Hearing this album that came out 3 years earlier impressed me even more . They laid down the groundwork for Southern hip hop that was based on Blues , Soul , and G Funk . This was back in the early 90 's when Southern hip hop and West Coast were basically talking to each other both being heavily influenced off each other . These guys along with 8 ball & MJG , Triple Six , Outkast , Goodie Mobb , and the Geto Boys are the only groups that can be called Dirty South Legends .	1
Back in 1992 before we had the internet where an up and coming artist who had a demo/mixtape had the ability to upload and hopefully the right ears would hear it , people would sell out of the trunk of their car and send it to local radio stations , etc , manually . Well that is what The Underground Kings did with their EP The Southern Way ( on Big Tyme Records ) . Someone up at Jive Records got a hold of the tape , told them to re-record the songs and add a few more new tracks to it , and you have Too Hard To Swallow . This is what most people are familiar with when they hear this album.There are many similarities in the songs if you heard The Southern Way , Too Hard To Swallow . The first song `` Something Good '' starts off the album well . Many people do n't know that the song on Too Hard to Swallow is edited , while the explicit version is on The Southern Way . The song here vibes well which I like . Next is the late Pimp C solo track `` Use Me Up '' , where he samples Bill Withers cleverly . Also this song is edited , as the explicit version appears on The Southern Way . Next is `` Pocket Full Of Stones '' which is different than the one that is on theMenace II Society : The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack , as this version uses an awkward sample from an LL Cool J song . I like the version on the soundtrack better . `` Short Texas '' featuring Blue Light also appeared on The Southern Way , but its no different than on this album . The track has a nice vintage 90 's feel to it . `` Cocaine In The Back Of The Ride '' also appeared on The Southern Way . The version here is a little modified production wise and sounds way better than the earlier version ( I hate to say this but Bun B was off beat on The Southern Way version but sounds perfect here ) . `` Too Hard To Swallow '' is a newly recorded track for this album and sounds nice and has a laid back vibe to it . `` Cramping My Style '' features a female rapper named Infinity and the beat samples The Isley Brothers `` Between The Sheets '' . The track is okay but nothing too special while Infinity and Bun B go back and forth about relationships . The next two songs `` I Feel Like ... '' and `` I 'm So Bad '' are both Pimp C solos . To be honest , they are okay , but they showed him as a growing artist . The next two songs `` Trill A** N**** '' and `` 976-Bun B '' are Bun B solos that appeared on The Southern Way . Here they are modified and have better production while Bun kicks nice verses on both songs . The last song `` Something Good '' is a remix of the first song of the album . The only differences are the beat is changed again and Bun B changes his last verse.Overall Too Hard To Swallow is a pretty nice major label debut for the great UGK . You can tell that both Bun and Pimp were growing artists who were taking chances with the music they were making , and as you can see it all worked out . This is an album I recommend to all if you do not have it . I highly recommend you look for The Southern Way EP on the internet and you can see the comparisons between the songs on that and this album . Maybe Jive/RCA/Sony Records can reissue a Legacy edition of this album and include The Southern Way EP tracks , as well as the outtakes from Banned ( tracks that Jive Records told them to remove when making this album ) into one album . Just short of a classic in my book , but one of the best for the early 90's.Lyrics : A-Production : B+Guest Appearances : BMusical Vibes : B+Top 5 Songs:1 . Something Good ( Extended Mix ) 2 .

UGK & # 65533 ; s first album is an undisputed Dirty South classic . This duo , hailing from Texas , was one of the first dirty south groups that were not bass music to put it down ( along with Geto Boys & Eightball & MJG ) . UGK & # 65533 ; s debut album is beyond great . The samples used in the songs are not disgraceful and UGK are notorious for sampling on their earlier albums . The rapping , compared to their skills now , is a little lacking but they were in their developmental stages during this album . Still , they drop memorable lines and classic verses all throughout this album . The best songs include but are not limited to & # 65533 ; Something Good & # 65533 ; , & # 65533 ; Use Me Up & # 65533 ; , and & # 65533 ; Cramping My Style & # 65533 ; . This album is a must have for all fans of UGK and of Dirty South music . 5 Star classic .	1
Definitely the best rap group in the south ( yes I think they 're better then the Geto Boyz & Eightball and MJG ) . Only 11 songs , but most of the songs are long . It 's from 1992 and I still rock it in 2005 . Guests are on a few songs and each member has a solo or 2 . Most of the lyrics are either dirty or about cocaine . It has 2 classics , 2 I skip and 2 are ok. Production is good on most songs and handled by Bernie Bismarck , Pimp C & Bun B on all the tracks . A Must have southern rap album that paved the way for many to come from Texas. # 1 - 8 # 2 - 9 ( Pimp C f/ D.J .

Way before Ludacris , David Banner , Lil Flip , No Limit Records , Cash Money , & all that other so called Southern Rap was the underground kingz ... and to this day they 're still the kingz of the Underground and the South . Way ahead of their time and can never be outdone . This record along with `` Super Tight '' & `` Ridin ' Dirty '' are must haves ... ..you 've been missin ' out if ya ai n't heard ! Smoke Fat , Listen Loud , Peace	1
this is da cd that put me on 2 UGK way back n da dayz . i mean way back when da song & quot ; Tell me something good & quot ; was laced with da ISLEY BROTHERS & quot ; Summer Breeze & quot ; sample loop ( not available on this cd , it was a local tape release only ) . this cd contains what i believe 2 b the greatest dopeman song ever created 2 this day & quot ; POCKET FULL OF STONES & quot ; . i know u probably heard it on da & quot ; Menace 2 Society & quot ; soundtrack but this cd contains the pure and uncut version . and da song & quot ; COCAINE N DA BACK OF THE RIDE & quot ; is da first song i ever heard someone give a shout out 2 & quot ; LOUISIANA & quot ; , much luv 4 dat . although & quot ; Tell Me Somethin Good & quot ; appears twice on the cd , Pimp C remix is definitely somethin u can smoke treez 2. i can not give enuff props 2 UGK 4 what they 've done 4 da dirty south , and everybody from da & quot ; South & quot ; should have this sh ! t n they house/car . b 4 Master P , b 4 Scarface , there was U G mf K .	1
UGK has been doin ' their thing since the late 80 's , and since then UGKworked hard representing the South Texas rap scene . In the mid-late 90 's , they finally gained some mainstream attention with 1996 's Ridin ' Dirty , a classic showcase of their skills . 1992 's Too Hard To Swallow is one hard bangin ' album . Most production goes to the late , great Pimp C with Bun B and Bismark adding some here and there , creating a deep , syrupy , southern fried soundtrack to spit over . `` Pocket Full of Stones '' is an early crunk classic with a deep rollin ' funky beat and thick bass . Many may remember it from the 1993 soundtrack Menace II Society . `` Pocket ... '' was also remixed with a sweet beat and censored lyrics in 1993 ( Included on 2002 's Side Hustles comp . ) and there was a dope part 2 on 1994 's classic Super Tight ... Many of the other songs here also deal with slanging and using drugs like `` Cocaine in the Back of the Ride , '' and `` Feel Like I 'm the one Who 's Doin ' Dope , '' and those jams have a hard core , dramatic soundscape for the rough lyrics . Those styles of beats would become standards in the early crunk movement that would soon ensue . The title track takes a more mellow approach but still with hard lyrics . The beat is similar more to twangy pre-early-G-Funk . `` Use Me Up '' is mid-tempo funk with lyrics dealing with being used ( or in Pimp C 's words `` pimped '' ) by women . There are dirty songs like the horny `` 976-Bub B . '' One misstep which could be easily skipped over is `` Cramping My Style '' with an overused and derivative Isley Brothers `` Between The Sheets '' ( 1983 ) sample , and as for the guest Infinity , I am not crazy about her verse . I would have to say that `` Pocket Full Of Stones '' and `` It 's Too Hard To Swallow '' are my favorite 2 here . Fans of true gangsta style rap and hard core lyrics will definitely love this joint that came out in an era well before gangsta rap was watered down with RnB diva hooks and club beats . It took quite a while before UGK ever got mainstream attention , which they clearly deserved much earlier .	1
This is the first main stream cd that they dropped and today it 's still one of the hardest . When I first heard 976 Bun B in 93 I was like this ca n't be real . I had never heard anyone flow like this cat before and his style has only gotten stronger . Bun B and Pimp C are the duo way before Outkast and all the other greats to follow . The thing is they just kept getting better with time . If you have n't heard this you are missing out . And the next up Ridin Dirty is a must have as well . I wish I could get the tape samle to this cd that they released . Tell Me Something Good had different words to it than what 's on the cd and 976 Bun B had a different beat . Both were a lot harder I tell you . I wish I could find out who stole it .	1
I have every Ugk except this one , but this one sounds the best yo i even got to pick it up . UGK always seems to amaze me ! Keep it real Bun-B and Pimp-C , and i look for your next albun in the 2000 !	1

What can I say about this album that hasn ` t been already said . This was a gift from old Spigatee One . This is just great west coast classic gangsta goodness .	1
This album was Spice 's second major label release and it is a good one . Not his best work , but then it 's hard if ( according to me ) all of his albums are worthy of 4 stars ( at the least ) and most are 5 star classics . Production is good and handled by Ant Banks , EA Ski , Prodeje of South Central Cartel , Too $ hort , DJ Xtra LArge , and Johnny Z . Guests are few ( on 3 of the 14 songs ) . It has 1 classic , 2 near classics , 9 good songs , and 1 that 's ok and 1 that I skip . This was recorded when he was only about 22 , but he holds it down for the East Bay .

A must own ! ! ! For any fan of that early 90 's west coast rap this ones for you . Spice takes you through with Rhythmic wordplay and street knowledge . A+	1
This album was haaard . The production is classic . Every song from the start to finish has tight rhymes . Spices flow was much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too . I ca n't sat how much I like this CD . I like what ant banks did with the 'george duke ' sample on 'clip & tha trigga ' too , since I used to like the original . This is essential if you want good westcoast rap . Also checkout South central cartels 'N ' gatz we truss ' if you like this . Peace !	1
one of his earlier albums old school gangsta music . A must have for any 90 's gangsta rap child . East Bay !	1
I had never heard of Spice 1 until a couple of months ago when i was reading a listmania list on amazon.com and spice 1 's 187 he wrote was on it . Then all of a sudden i started seeing this album on more and more listmania lists so i decided to check it out . I was expecting a mediocre album , but this was definetly worth the [ money ] i spent on it . Spice 1 has a hardcore delivery and hardcore lyrics . He also shows he can get deeper then just killing , which is a skill that i have only seen in a couple of other gangsta rap artists , such as the greatest rapper of all time , Scarface . The only thing that holds this album back a little is the production . I really wanted to hear Spice 1 flow over a hardcore beat but only a couple times did it happen . Other then that , this is a great cd . It also sounds pretty cool when he stutters in his verses like on the first song when one of the entire verses is him stuttering his words . The best tracks are `` 187 he wrote '' , `` Clip & Trigga '' , and `` Trigga Happy '' .	1
If I could rate this album 100 stars I would . There is no words to express the fact that this CD is slamming . Very hot , Very hot !	1
By time 1993 rolled around , cats were getting a lot more lyrical in the hip-hop lexicon . It was virtually a game of `` can you top this '' as several well-oiled rhyming machines left mediocre & stagnant rappers in a cloud of dust . KRS-One has always stayed ahead of the trends , and `` Return of the Boom Bap '' is no different . In my opinion , he is arguably rhyming tighter than he ever has before . His content & strong message tracks weave excellently in and out of some of his finest lyricism to date.The production is uniformly excellent , and hits hard with a minimal and spare set of beats , which is 100 % boom bap . The legendary Dj Premier , who is also on top of his game , produces most of the tracks here , with KRS-One producing 4 tracks himself . Kid Capri also produces 2 tracks , and Showbiz kills it on another . All in all , these elements add up to an unstoppable force . Every track here is bananas ... `` Outta Here '' , `` Black Cop '' , `` I Ca n't Wake Up '' , `` Sound Of Da Police '' , `` Higher Level '' , `` '' P '' Is Still Free '' ... every tracks bangs with a rugged & raw fury . This is hand down essential KRS-One material . Recognize the master .	1
The beats are crazy . Concepts and rhymes are incredible . These guys should do more albums together . The title track had me jumping all throughout my 10th grade . B-boying at its best . Krs 's best album by far , its the complete package .	1
Leave it to KRS-One to teach what hip hop is supposed to sound like . After dropping the Boogie Down Productions name , Kris comes correct on his 1993 album , Return Of The Boom Bap . The production on here is pretty much on point , courtesy of DJ Premier , Kid Capri , Norty Cotto , and Showbiz . All those dope producers , expect that signature east coast sound to represent.A good number of tracks here are excellent . Tracks such as `` Outta Here '' , `` Slap Them Up '' , and `` Sound Of The Police '' ( if you can , get the 12 '' that has the B-side `` Hip Hop Vs. Rap '' ) are easy standout . `` Mad Crew '' is an easy headbanger , along with `` P Is Still Free '' . Another favorite of mine is `` Brow Skin Woman '' .Kris missteps here on early points on this album like the boring sounding `` Mortal Thought '' and the odd concept of himself being a blunt being passed around to various rappers on `` I Ca n't Wake Up '' . A few others float around , but that does n't stop that from being a good album . Given that this is one that defiantly needs to be in your music collection , as this one would be in rotation for sometime .

KRS-One 's first `` solo '' album is 1993 's `` Return of the Boom Bap . '' After the original six Boogie Down Productions albums , KRS dropped the BDP moniker and dropped this gem . Kris enlisted the production of legend DJ Premier , who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius as a member of Gang Starr . The beats , however , while excellent , are quite simple , allowing KRS-One and his awesome character to take center stage . He drops some of the political and social stances of the last two BDP albums , EdutainmentandSex and Violence , in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach . That 's not to say that the verses are n't relevant . His classic tales of police brutality , urban injustice , and hip hop loyalty are all here . He just delivers them in a way that puts the music and the performance to the forefront . This is a totally classic album . Every song is totally memorable , because KRS puts such a great performance on every track . Whether he 's screaming , singing , or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer , he entertains first and foremost . No track is even average or any worse than the others , this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album . I could n't find you any flaws , it 's arguably hip hop 's greatest MC teamed with arguably hip hop 's greatest producer . A must have for the rap fan.The album begins with an awesome intro , `` KRS-One Attacks , '' where Premo laces a totally dope beat and covers it with some old BDP samples , to make a perfect start . `` Outta Here '' uses simple drum-and-bass to allow KRS to address the current state of hip hop , chronicling his life as a rapper and talking about the tendency of rappers to `` fall off . '' Perhaps his best known song , `` Black Cop '' follows . Here , he is an entertainer first and an MC second , yelling and screaming , completely going wild on the mic . Anyone who has n't sang along to the yelps of `` Black coooop ... black COP black COP black COP '' should n't consider themself a hip hop fan . `` Mortal Thought '' is relevant , with a great chorus . I love the conceptually genius `` I Ca n't Wake Up , '' where KRS raps from the perspective of a blunt . He namedrops most of the big names of '93 rap , as the MCs pass the blunt from rapper to rapper . Again , he yells and sings a great chorus , this song 's another classic . The nice `` Slap Them Up '' precedes the infamous `` Sound of da Police . '' The look at police brutalities is simply rap at its finest . My favorite part is where he draws a connection between the similar-sounding words `` overseer '' and `` officer '' in the second verse , as they both oppressed the urban black community . The chorus is just classic , nobody else could ever pull this off like KRS-One . `` Mad Crew '' has a heavily sampled beat , and `` Uh Oh '' uses a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine . `` Brown Skin Woman '' delivers musically and lyrically , and the following title track is just awesome . `` 'P ' Is Still Free '' is once again classic material , I remember first hearing this song on theMenace II Society : The Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcompilation . The album ends perfectly with `` Stop Frontin ' '' and `` Higher Level , '' a provocative challenge to American religion with a heavy horn-laden beat.I feel like this album gets overlooked in comparison to the BDP albums , but I think this is as entertaining and enjoyable as anything KRS-One has ever done . A classic album in every sense of the word , perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre , 1993 . If you have n't already , do yourself a favor and pick it up .	1
This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out . Sorry to say there are probably other good ones , but this is the best put together one . The beats , the rhymes , and the material go together very nicely . My favorites are Outta Here , Mortal Thought , I Ca n't Wake Up , Sound of Da Police , Uh Oh , Return of the Boom Bap , and Stop Frontin ' . But the other songs are good too . I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general .	1
return of the boom bap is a great classic . it 's way up there with 93 til infinity by souls of mischief , a future without a past by leaders of the new school , one for all , ed o.g and da bulldogs first album and gang starr step in the arena . it 's crafted beats on krs-one album is by the talented dj premier . it 's lyrics is so great too . check out sound of the police and mad crew . this is a gifted classic . with it 's old school , loud bass original lyrics . definately a must have for any true hip hop head .	1
I was a basshead and this album was played quit a bit in the car , especially the song in the middle of the album with a bass line that goes and goes just loved it . Also liked the idea of being passed around as a blunt . Overall , the album has some offbeats , steady beats , and slamming beats .	1
Return of the Boom Bap '' Return of the boom-bap means just that , it means return of the real hard beats and real rap . '' Released in the fall of 1993 , KRS-One 's first official solo album is arguably his best . In the early 90 's , a new generation of west coast-based MCs became the superstars of rap ; while in the east , acts like Naughty by Nature and Das EFX were stealing the thunder of their 1980 's predecessors . Produced largely by Gang Starr 's DJ Premier , Return of the Boom Bap rejuvenates standard-bearer KRS-One 's stance as the Teacher of Rap while giving him a more competitive stoop to stand on.The LP 's first single , `` Outta Here '' warns currently hot rappers that their material trappings may not last : `` Credit cards and bank account ? Outta here ; no doubt , BDP is old-school but we ai n't goin ' out.. '' On the surreal `` I Ca n't Wake Up '' , KRS sees himself turned into a cigar , while humorously name-checking various early 90 's rap stars . `` The P is Still Free '' updates a song from Criminal Minded about the lost souls of crack addiction . The Kid Capri-produced `` Brown Skin Woman '' critiques the sexism in rap , and the LP 's biggest hit , `` Sound of Da Police '' ( produced by Showbiz ) highlights the dangers of police brutality in a post-Rodney King landscape : `` The overseer had the right to get ill ; and if you fought back the overseer had the right to kill ; the officer has the right to arrest ; and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest.. '' The most blazing track would have to be the album 's closer , `` Higher Level '' : with a blistering funk sample from the Blacula soundtrack , KRS rants and raves about politics & religion in the glorious fashion that only he can : `` I stand with God whether I 'm paid or whether I 'm crying broke ; I like to ask these politicians , ` would Jesus vote ? ' '' At the time of its release , the album ( and most others ) was overshadowed by Snoop Doggy Dogg 's Doggystyle . In comparison , Doggystyle may have slicker production values , but Boom Bap 's jazz-based rhythm tracks seem less dated , and with far less gangster excess . This deserves the deluxe re-release treatment , with any bonus material available .	1
KRS-1 's best release after the BDP LP 's . His subject matter is truly remarkable . His visuals hypnotize you and take you to where the story is at the moment . Extremely DOPE around the board ! 10 stars ! ! !	1
This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs 's style was best suited to Primos production . Once he lost Primo ( with the exception of a few albums ) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly . krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it . This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper .	1
God damn , I have n't heard an album with so much effort and time put into it . Other classics were dropped before and after this but this is just a timeless classic , I ca n't stress just how much this album reigns SUPREMACY . KRS-One dropped 2 hot albums with BDP ( Criminal Minded and By Any Means Necessary ) which were just off the hook but this is different . His voice has matured a lot more than what it was in his earlier days and his lyrics are thoughtful and excellent . Check out Sound Of Da Police to experiment his might and talent . F*ck tha Police by N.W.A . is by far the best diss song towards the police but this follows it right behind it . I really like his 'Overseer/Officer ' rhyme and the way he raps in his Jamaican way as he did back in Criminal Minded . Other cuts enjoyed include Outta Here , where he talks about his life in the game , I Ca n't Wake Up , a pleasant track produced by Premier , Uh Oh , using beatboxing as his instruments , Brown Skinned Woman , where he puts it down for the black/brown nation and `` P '' is Still Free , a song dedicated to the girls.I like KRS-One for several reason but the strongest being that he 's one of the few rappers to understand REAL HIP-HOP . Take a look at the title , Return of the Boom Bap . It means just that : it 's the return of REAL RAP . He 's kept it true since '87 and still he 's doing it . This is probably the best '93 rap album , waay better than Snoop Dogg 's Doggystyle . It 's definately one of my favorite top 50 rap albums of all time . Check this out , coz KRS-One is out to ATTACK ! Best moments= Outta Here , I Ca n't Wake Up , Sound of Da Police and Brown Skinned Woman	1
Once again , Krs-One brings it to you straight no chaser ... with help from DJ Premier and others you ca n't go wrong with this one.my fave tracks:1 ) Outta Here2 ) Sound Of Tha Police4 ) Higher Level..i LOVE the lyrics.if you 're a early 90 's hip-hop fan or just starting your collection , i recommend this one .	1
What else can be said about this album that has n't been said already ? This is basically a collaboration between two legends of the genre ( KRS One and DJ Premier ) while both were at the top of their games . It gets no better than that . Period . I feel kind of special because this is the kind of stuff I was growing up on . I think it was 9th or 10th grade for me when this came out and I ran out and got this after hearing `` Outta Here '' for the first time . `` Sound Of The Police '' , `` Outta Here '' , `` Return Of The Boom Bap , `` Mortal Thought '' , `` Black Cop '' , `` Brown Skin Woman '' , `` Uh Oh '' , `` Higher Level '' ... .I mean , the list of classics on this disc goes on and on . The sound can best be described as bass heavy boom bap ( hence the title of the album ) . Kinda makes me miss the early/mid 90 's sound ... *sigh*As far as flaws , I can only think of one ... '' I Ca n't Wake Up . '' That song was a bit of a misstep . Otherwise , the rest is straight fire . Anyone giving this less than 4 stars does n't know what a timeless piece this album truly is.Return Of The Boom Bap is classic . Point blank . Period . If you have n't heard this album yet , then quit cheating yourself and check it out . It may have come out in '93 , but it sounds just as fresh 13 years later . I highly recommend making this one a collection piece.Standout Tracks : 'P ' Is Still Free , Slap Them Up , Black Cop , Mad Crew , Outta Here , Brown Skin Woman , Sound Of The Police , Stop Frontin ' , Mortal Thought , Uh Oh , Higher Level ( My Favorite ) , and Return Of The Boom Bap	1

I have been a krs-one fan for a LONG time , and would have to say this is his best album . Sound Of Da Police is completely off the hook , the lyrics are some of the best you 'll come across . Krs is one of the greatest rappers ever , and this album is a timeless underground classic . This is REAL hip-hop , dont support what we hear on the radio these days , its all crap , listen to legends like krs-one and rakim . Other good tracks are KRS-One Attacks and Return Of Da Boombap.Beats - 10/10Lyrics - 10/10Production - 10/10Originality - 10/10Final Note - 5 Mic Classic , one that all true rap/hip-hop fans have . Classic album , one of the best of our time .	1
The most INCREDIBLE album of 1993 . FAR superior to Snoop Doggy Dogg 's debut album , which overshadowed this , plus seemingly everything else at the time . Do yourself a favor and PICK THIS UP ! DJ Premier and Kid Capri 's production skills are not to be fronted on ! Most blazing track : Higher Level- With a blistering sample from the BLACULA soundtrack ( ? ) , Kris rants and raves in the glorious fashion that only he can.Other outstanding cuts : KRS-One Attacks , Outta Here , Sound of Da Police , P is Still Free.This is the first official SOLO album from KRS-ONE of Boogie Down Productions . Check out all his other albums , including the latest , I GOT NEXT ...	1
The first album from KRS-One { Knowledge Rein Supreme ... } that i loved on the first listen.KRS One Attacks , Blacc cop , Sound of da police , Mad Crew , '' P ' Is Still Free , Stop Frontin ' ! ! ! is insane , Higher Level ! ! ! { Not for the dumb , deaf , & blind } , & Outta Here .	1
Criminal minded , by any means , return of the boom bap , krs one ( self titled ) are the best albums he ever did and made him the legend he is . On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors , battle rap etc . This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence , edutainment , and ghetto music , those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and do n't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before . You can play the whole thing through , although in my opinion the only track I would skip is `` uh oh '' because it 's a beatbox beat which get 's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it 's history .	1
True hip hop at its purest form was being born wit krs 's return of the boom rap ... Diz should already be in true heads collection no weak joints . A classic from a genious . Best tracks ? `` mad crew '' , `` sound of the police '' , and , `` stop frontin '' a true classic .	1
Some people seem to think that & quot ; I Got Next & quot ; is KRS ' best album , but to my ears it pretty damn overrated . This album demonstrates KRS as the great , clever lyricist he is , and he is accompanied by nice production from one of hip-hop 's finest , DJ Premier . He truly is the greatest emcee ever to touch a microphone . He is the only emcee who 's as great today as he was ten years back .	1
Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93 , and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap . This album , like every other Krs-One album , represents him in his truest form , always talking about something positive , claiming to be & quot ; the teacher & quot ; of hip hop , and saying things to leave you thinking . Here 's the review : Album Highlights : Krs-One Attacks , Outta Here , Black Cop , Mortal Thought , I Ca n't Wake Up , Sound Of Da Police , Mad Crew , and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production : Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter : Thumbs up.Originality : Thumbs up.The Last Word : While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary , this is still Krs at his best . Today , he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive . Overall , I recommend you pick up this album .	1
Sh** ! ! ! This album is off the hook ! `` Outta Here '' has one of the best beats ive ever heard ! ! Thats on a real HIPHOP tip right there ! KRS-One 's voice is better than ever and his lyrics are ON POINT EVERY TRACK ! KRS-One has kept it real out of most emcees out of all these years . You got to give him his repsect . This guy is a TRUE emcee and if you dont like him , then go listen to your wack azz 50 Cent album . The production on this album is pretty much what gives it its name . Grimey old school soundin hiphop beats . If you want TRUE hiphop , better get this now ! Real stuff . All the songs are on point.My Top 5 Songs1.Outta Here ( NICE ! ) 2.Mortal Thought3.I Cant Wake Up4.Return Of The Boom Bap5.Stop Frontin	1
you can trust me . i 've heard all their music . Pimp C ( RIP ) and Bun B . Who are you if you have n't heard of these mc 's and this album ?	1
The title was taken from the bumping track `` Front , Back , & Side To Side '' . I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day . Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK , except for a few songs here and there . Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job , because I told them that I 'm from the A , their recent albumUnderground Kingzwas the only album I owned . So I ended up buying this the very next day.Super Tight is a very southern style album . Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94 , than they do today . A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then . `` It 's Supposed To Bubble '' is one of them . Bun B drops a solo track `` Feds In Town '' which sounds real good . `` Pocket Full Of Stones 2 '' and `` Protect & Serve '' are other good songs . `` Stoned Junkee '' is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2 . The final track `` Three Sixteens '' featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.Super Tight is an excellent album . Some of the production sounds dated ( although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production ) , but it still bumps here today . It 's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar , especially when other albums from the south such asSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzikandThe Diarydropped the same year . But if you 're a fan of 90 's southern rap ( mainly groups like E.S.G. , UGK , or anyone from Rap-A-Lot ) , do n't hesitate to get this album . I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ( '00-'04 ) , and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas . Peace !

The whole CD is exactly what it says in the title Super Tight ... 4 real this UGK at its best .	1
UGK , on their second album , finds the unstoppable riding groove that they are most known for today . Bun B 's rugged flow and menacing lyrics nicely offset Pimp C 's playalistic style . The beats are strictly playa beats that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to . Never corny and always on point . Pimp C is definitely an underated producer . Every song bumps but the classics are ` Return ' , It 's Supposed To Bubble , I Left It Wet For You , Feds In Town , and Front Back Side to Side . This album , being nearly ten years old , does not have a dated sound and would n't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent songs . It would fit right in . And that my friends is a sign of timeless classic music . UGK - Supertight - 5 stars .	1
The boyz from Port Arthur return after 2 years for their 2nd group album , and their 2nd best album . Only 11 songs but no weak point , 1 classic , 2 almost classics , 2 are ok , and the rest are good or great songs . Guests are on 3 of the 11 songs . As usual for a UGK album , the production is great and handled mostly by Pimp C ( 9 songs ) and DJ DMD does the other 2 . They show why they 're the best group to come out of the south on this one and especially with their `` Ridin Dirty '' album . A must have , great album ! ! # 1 - 10 ( CLASSIC hardcore song w/ great beat -- just over 2 minutes ) # 2 - 8.5 # 3 - 9 ( relaxing beat -- about Dom P ) # 4 - 9.5 ( great beat ) # 5 - 8 ( about the FEDS in town ) # 6 - 7 ( part 2 of `` Pocket Full Of Stones '' ) # 7 - 7 # 8 - 9 # 9 - 8 ( f/ 3-2 -- about drugs & junkies -- nice relaxing beat ) # 10 - 8 ( f/ 3-2 -- -- about pu $ $ y ) # 11 - 9.5 ( f/ DJ DMD -- great beat ) BUN B -- Bernard Freeman -- b . 1973 -- Port Arthur , TXPIMP C -- Chad Butler -- b . 12/73 - d. 12/4/07 -- Port Arthur , TXUnderGround Kingz ! ! ! check all my reviews	1
This is some str8 killa from the Kingz ... Bun B and Pimp C Def . Show some real talent & ability on this record ... .easily up there w/ '' Ridin ' Dirty '' & `` Too Hard to Swallow '' . These guys have some of the tightest beats and rhymes out there ... 10 years+ later , it 's still better than most s*** out there . My Fav tracks are `` I left it Wet for ya '' , `` Underground '' , `` Feds in Town '' , `` It 's Supposed to Bubble '' , ... .they 're all tight..Super tight ... check this one out ! !	1
... pimp c must have a helluva record collection to get at all of the samples the way he does . they got the lyrical skills alright , but young chad 's production gets slept on ! the neptunes , swizz beatz and others cant touch him . him , organized noize , gangstarr 's premier and suave house 's old production team are perhaps the only ones i can compare him to , skillz wise . this is a classic right here .	1
Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire . This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel . The beats are melodic G-Funk , with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs . Lyrically and vocally , UGK kills in all departments . They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows . The track `` Feds in Town '' is a gangster classic with a phat , funky beat and tight scratches . `` Super Tight ... '' is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue . The mid 90 's was one of the best periods in rap history , and this album is testament to it . Do n't sleep on this classic .	1
Every Thing about this album is Super Tight ! UGK is the real playas from Down South ! I look for there next album ! UGK is taking it to the next millinuem	1
See , this is why I love West Coast music . Too $ hort 's eighth album `` Get In Where You Fit In '' is so funky , words can not explain how much I fell in love with this album . I got into Short Dog back in 2000 , with `` You Nasty '' , and felt that I should check out his earlier work . This was the very first album I picked up , in his albums before his retirement.First , Too Short 's rhyme skills are great throughout this album . Just about every song he really kick some dope rhymes . Whether if it 's about his pimp game ( `` BJ Betty '' ... would be used in a recent DTP song ) , life in the ghetto streets in Oakland ( `` Money In The Ghetto '' ) , or just in the day in the life of ol ' Short Dog ( `` Just Another Day '' ) .Production is PERFECT , curteosy of The Dangerous Crew , Ant Banks , and QDIII ( who produced Ice Cube 's `` Lethal Injection '' album ) . QD III produces only one track , `` Just Another Day '' and that track clocks in about 7 minutes of funk . Some other funky produced tracks throughout this album is `` The Dangerous Crew '' , `` Money In The Ghetto '' . ALL of these tracks are well produced . I 've been listening to rap music for a LONG time , and I 'd say , when it comes to production in albums , this would be ranked in my top 5 . It 's THAT good . ( I ca n't stress that enough ) Guest appearances also bring their A game . `` The Dangerous Crew '' would feature Bay Area arists Spice 1 ( I might want to look into this guy too ) , Ant Banks , Mhisani , and Pee Wee . Ant Banks also appears on `` All My ******* Are Gone '' ( he says the tighest line towards the end of the song ) .Flaws are very little , if you can find any . If you 're one of those people who gets offended by derogitory comments toward women , you might not want to come near this or any other Too Short album . Other than that , this album is perfect . I purchased this album about 5 months ago , and it easily became in my top favorites . This is also my first Too Short album pre-retirement , and I 'd say I made a very good choice here . If you 're reading the reviews here , you need to click the `` Add To Cart '' button right now . At the price it 's listed right now ( $ 9.99 damn near a steal if you ask me ) , there should be no excuse of why you 're not going to pick up this album . It 's albums like this that make me wish I lived in Oakland.Lyrics : A+Production : A++Guest Appearances : A+Musical Vibes : A+Overall : A+Favorite Tracks : All thirteen tracks are my favorites .	1
Too Short is respected as a legend for being one of the West Coast 's first MCs and gets unconditional love from the Bay . His eighth album is 1993 's `` Get In Where You Fit In , '' a fine showcase of one of rap 's most unique characters . Back in '93 , classic hip hop LPs were dropping by the week , and Too Short 's Dangerous Crew created a presence with their funk-based Oakland sound . Ant Banks deserves a co-credit for this LP , for mastering the pure , ungangstafied funk that was the Dangerous Crew 's trademark . True to his formula , the songs have no hooks or recognizable structure , so sometimes they drag on , especially since all but two tracks approach six minutes or more . But the bass-heavy , twangy funk is endlessly enjoyable , with live instrumental breaks , clever samples , and thumping percussion . Banks ' funk is n't soulful or smooth like Long Beach 's g-funk ; it 's heavy , deep , live , and tight . Musically this is one of Banks ' best works , comparable to his solo efforts.It 's business as usual for Shorty on the mic . The topics at hand are pimping , his sexcapades , and prowess with the ladies . Short 's pimp persona is by this point familiar , but still fun as he tells long winding stories over Ant Banks ' tracks . He is one-dimensional , but at this point in his career , the Dangerous Crew was in full effect , and frequent guests include Ant Banks , Goldy , Rappin ' Ron , and Ant Diddley Dog . `` I 'm a Player '' is the opening highlight , a pumping statement from both Short and Banks . `` Just Another Day , '' produced excellently by QDIII , chronicles a day that includes hustling in Oakland , a post-game party at Gary Payton 's house , and a concert in New Orleans . `` Got ta Get Some Lovin ' '' recounts a `` dry spell '' over a spage-age banger , and Banks cleverly flips well-known samples for `` Money in the Ghetto '' and `` BJ Betty . '' Banks and Short trade off verses over `` All My Bs are Gone '' 's twangy lick , and the whole Dangerous Crew shows up for `` The Dangerous Crew '' and the title track , the latter a 9-minute diss at former member Pooh-Man ( check outAi n't No Lovefor the comeback ) . Short proves time and time again that he can flow for days , and he is frequently a force on the mic as his stories defy any convention . Short and Banks are a great match and their music is completely unique and creative . `` Get In Where You Fit In '' is n't a lyrical masterpiece by any means , but what Short lacks in lyricism he makes up for in style and Ant Banks ' beats . It 's hard to compare an album like this to the classics of '93 , because it relies on a different formula of music and style . In any event , it is a good listen that I recommend . Over Too Short 's long and winding career , his music has become reheated and derivative , but I think his best days were with Banks and the Dangerous Crew , so this is an album I 'd check out if you 're new to Too Short . He 's a better character than rapper , but he 's one of rap 's most prolific and influential MCs and it 's hard to argue with this funk . Good music for the ride , party , or just relaxing .	1
DEFINETLY TOO $ HORT 'S BEST ALBUM-THIS SH** IZ FUNKY LAID BACK ALL THE WAY THRU W/THAT DANGEROUS CREW MACKIN GAME-FEAT.ANT BANKS , SPICE-1 , GOLDY , RAPPIN RON & MORE-MAKE SURE 2 COPP THIS CLASICC	1
`` Get In Where You Fit In '' is not only my favorite album by Too Short , but definitely one of my all time favorite hip hop records . The first six tracks of the album starts the lp off with a bang , while it kinda slows down later on . `` I 'm a Player '' and `` Just Another Day '' are what made me want to buy this years ago . I 'm not into the new stuff Short 's doing these days , but i always listen to the Golden Age Short ( 88-94 or 95 ) . Short Dog 's best , bar none .	1
WOW ! ! The Oaktown pimp really went overboard with album 8 . Just 15 months since his last album , he comes with his best and funkiest album of all 15 ! ! ! With 13 songs of straight funk , it has 3 classics , 2 almost classics and the rest are real good or great songs . Guests are n't all over , just on most the last half of the album , and it is mostly his Dangerous Crew clique . The production is GREAT , in the words of DJ Quik it 's `` Way 2 Fonky '' . Every song has an unreal beat and the dangerous crew posse is to thank ( as well as 1 great track by QDII ) . Ant Banks does 5 songs and the Dangerous Crew does 7 ( no wonder this may be the best produced album I ever heard and I have over 675 rap albums ! Ant Banks , Dangerous Crew and QDII -- No words here just listen and you 'll understand ) A must have album for all. # 1 - 8.5 ( short amount of rapping and alot of talkin but tight -- nice beat as well ) # 2 - 9 ( about him being player -- good beat ) # 3 - 11 ( CLASSIC ! ! ! -- GREAT BEAT and 7+ minutes of funk ) # 4 - 9 ( dirty songa bout having no ho 's -- tight beat ) # 5 - 8 ( about money in da hood ) # 6 - 10 ( CLASSIC and his dirtiest song ever -- nice raggae beat ) # 7 - 8.5 ( f/ Ant Banks -- tight beat -- about how al his biaaatches are gone ) # 8 - 9.5 ( f/ Spice 1 , Goldy , Ant Banks , Pee Wee - the Dangerous Crew ! ! -- great beat ) # 9 - 8.5 ( f/ Rappin Ron { R.I.P . } & Ant Diddley Dog -- dissin Pooh Man ) # 10 - 10 ( CLASSIC w/ GREAT BEAT ) # 11 - 9.5 ( f/ Father Dom & Ant BAnks -- tight beat ) # 12 - 9 ( f/ Leslie Calaway -- nice beat ) # 13 - 8 ( FM BLue f/ Too $ hort ) Todd Shaw -- b . 4/29/66 -- b .

What I like about $ hort Dog is that throughout all of his material and extensive career in rap he remains REAL . Keepin it real now-a-days is a cliche , but $ hort always remained true to the music he makes . Buying every Too $ hort LP would be a library in its own . ( Although , I do recommend doing so . ) If you have n't picked up anything from him yet , you have to buy this record . Hands down my favorite release from him .	1
Too short had flow like no other rapper in the game.Hits like I 'm a Player , Payboy Short and Get in Where You Fit In . I give it 5 out of 5 .	1
15 years after this album came out and I am still enjoying this release . The first time I heard the lyrics of I 'm a player , I was in high school and it took me 2 days to learn the lyrics . That 's how much I was listening to this album . The beats are dope and too short 's lazy flow is right on point . This album is a classic . It is probably my favorite too short album next to Life is ... ..too short and cocktails . Definitely a must for your collection .	1
Too $ hort is the biggest pimp ever and always will be . Even though he does n't rap about much else , for some reason it never gets old listening to Short dog . Possibly because Ant Banks provides some of the funkiest beats , or maybe it 's Too $ hort 's delivery and voice , but I will never get tired of listening to Too $ hort . This album is his best , edging out Life is Too Short and Cocktails . It has the best production and Too $ hort and company drop hot lyrics over the beats . Bay Area rap does n't get much better .	1
This is Too Short 's greatest album ! Man , its banging from start to finish . A couple of the songs are too long , but that 's the only fault . Just Another Day and Got ta Get Some Lovin ' are too of the funkiest beats ever ! Keep on pimpin ' , Short !	1
Man again and again Too $ hort never fails to deliver . At this time , which was about 93 , Too $ hort was runnin the Oakland rap game . Funky ass hell . Strait OAKtown style . Like the rest of his REAL funk , this is where its att . Tracks are all i like tha intro and the outro .	1
Too Short definitely has had a great mainstay in hip hop today , and has had one as early as 1993 , his 8th album , Get In Where You Fit In . Too Short continues his formula of vocal pimpin on wax , and the sales do not lie , he has sold millions of records with his simple but engaging flows . His flows complement the syrupy G-Funk beats courtesy of Ant Banks ( one of my fav 's ) , QDIII ( another great ) , The Dangerous Crew . My favorite Short song of all time is here on `` Just Another Day . '' QDIII laces a smooth twangy funk beat with a great whiny synth in the hooks on this 7 1/2 minute classic . Short does a great job telling his life on tour all across the hoods of the U.S. A similar song is DJ Quik 's `` Jus Lyke Compton '' from his 1992 classic Way 2 Fonky , where he tells the tales of touring all thru the U.S. hoods . I love `` Way Too Real '' where Short gets it raw and trill over an immaculate Ant Banks lowrider ready beat . `` Got ta Get Some Lovin ' '' is where Short is horny and is sick of not having a woman to fool with over a slick syrupy beat ; it 's hella funny ! ! `` BJ Betty '' is raunchy : I believe it is a remake of an 80 's song he made , but do n't quote me on that ! `` All My B -- -- s Are Gone '' is self-explanatory with a twangy Ant Banks beat where you 'll ride slow loud and bangin ' to on the avenue ! Pimp rap is not new in 1993 and especially to Short Dog , but his charisma and the G-Funk beats definitely make the album a definitely classic ! ! Banks and Short ddefinitely have great chemistry and I am glad to say they done made a lotta songs together !	1
Theoretically R.Kelly 's debut album , as a solo artist anyway is very crucial for the development of music in the 90 's . It was transitional music easing out of the hip-hop based new jack swing style of the beginning of the decade towards what would eventually be known as `` neo soul '' , a largely retro funk based sound usually informed by hip-hop rather than being dependant on it . Creatively R.Kelly embodies many of the qualities of the R & B/soul/funk greats that came before him . He 's a songwriter/vocalist with a strong flair for song construction and strong , gospel informed singing and ( most importantly perhaps ) a multi instrumentalist with the ability to create sturdy grooves and , for example the good sense to bring in jazz guitarist Bobby Broom to play on `` Your Body 's Callin ' '' . Lyrically this album blends the sacred and the secular in the classic soul tradition . It was a quality he 'd maintain throughout his career . `` Bump N Grind '' was of course the big hit and the album followed that excellent groove , for the most part in the same manner . `` For You '' , '' It Seems Like Your Ready '' and the extended jam `` Sex Me '' all follow that same basic mid-tempo neo-funk groove to a tee . This album also includes a touching story song type tribute to his mother in `` Sadie '' , full of gospel organ and all kinds of soulful breaks and release . The same goes musically for the closing title song , the main difference is that one as with the rest of the album is based in heavy duty bedroom music , visually explicit without the use of explicit language . The interesting part is , as pointed out in many reviews the album is actually one of the few of it 's type I 've heard where the album loses some energy when the tempo picks up . With the exception of the strong `` Summer Bunnies '' the majority of the uptempo cuts such as `` Homie Lover Friend '' , '' Freak Dat Body '' , '' Back To The Hood Of Things '' and `` I Like The Crotch On You '' feature raps by DeAndre Boykins and Carey Kelly that are very repetitive and very uninteresting . Since this album was at it 's time looking to innovate to a degree the inclusion of rapping on these songs kind of seemed like a step back and , in the future Kelly would come to do much much better at utilizing hip-hop in his music . For the longest time I thought of R.Kelly as a bit of a one trick pony who was likely not very capable of delivering anything close to a consistant album . After all that tended to be a problem for a lot of music of this particular era . For those I will have to say this album will certainly prove those naysayers wrong , including myself .	1
THIS IS ONE OF R.KELLY 'S BEST ALBUMS I ENJOY THIS ALBUM IT CONTAINS SOME NICE SONGS : BODY 'S CALLIN , HOMIE , LOVER , FRIEND , SEX ME , BUMP N ' GRIND , THIS IS A NICE MIX I ENJOY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE AN R.KELLY FAN I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS ALBUM IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY R.KELLY FAN ! ! ! !	1
I first discovered R. Kelly and his talent back in 1995 ; two years after 12 Play was released . I listened to 12 Play dozens of times and I just became overwhelmed by his skills and his `` raunchy '' lryics . Released in 1993 , 12 Play was where R. Kelly became a true R & B superstar . It was a concept album that showcased his talents and versatility perfectly . The opening track , `` Your Body 's Callin ' '' is a classic . It 's a smooth and sexy ballad with airy instrumentation and the amazing vocals . `` Bump And Grind '' is another song that will go down as his most popular tune . The song has memorable bouncy beats and throbbing lyrics , that make this an instant classic . `` Homie , Lover , Friend '' , `` Freak Dat Body '' , and `` Back To The Hood Of Things '' ; all show off his rapping skills with the G-Funk inspired beats and the awesome hooks . `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' is a slow jam with R. setting the bar high on his romantic persona . `` I Like The Crotch On You '' is another one of Kelly 's X-rated themed songs with the G-Funk inspired rhythms , but after half of the song ends , he tones it down by singing with other male vocalists about the `` cons '' who hates his music . He also plays the piano on there . `` Summer Bunnies '' is an upbeat song about the ladies . `` For You '' is a personal favorite of mine . It 's a nice ballad with smoothed-out vocals , romantic spanish guitars , and the lushy strings . `` Sadie '' has R. doing a cover song of The Spinners ' classic . He wonderfully dedicates the song to his mother . `` Sex Me '' is an 11-minute epic that has R. singing the most notorious lyrics of his career . It 's a well-crafted ballad with the airy synthesizers , bumpy drumming , and spacey vocals . The title track , `` 12 Play '' is what I consider to be the climax of the whole album . It 's a lovely , slow jam with memorable hooks . Overall , all I can say about 12 Play is that it 's Kelly 's most raunchest and unified album , in every sense . His 2000 album , TP-2.Com , the sequel to this album , 12 Play , might 've been more sexually explicit and thugged-out , but 12 Play just took him to a whole new level : bringing him to a mainstream audience and redefining his image . I really think it 's a 1990 's R & B classic and one of R. Kelly 's best recordings . A	1
Do n't be too mad at me , but I really just discovered 12 Play about a few weeks ago . I 've really been 'into ' music the past few years . I feel its important to go back and listen to the 'real ' music . This cd has always been in my house , but never listened to it . I mean who does n't kno Bump and Grind , Your Body 's Callin , It Seems Like you ready . But to me those are n't the only good ones on the cd . I love the uptempo jams like HOMIE LOVER FRIEND , FREAK DAT BODY , my fave uptempo being SUMMER BUNNIES ! It just screams old summer jam ! But besides the obvious the good songs all the releases SEX ME AND 12 PLAY are just so damn good . There has never been an r & b cd since this and it 's a tough act to follow .	1
As the album title , 12 Play , insist on sexual connotations , it is a lot more than just that . 12 Play is R. Kelly 's first solo album , second overall . He makes a dedication to his mother on the sensational remake `` Sadie '' . `` For You '' is a simple R & B love song of being a shoulder for someone . Robert also takes us to the earlier years of his life on `` Back To The Hood Of Things '' featuring additional flows of DeAndre Boykins & Carey Kelly . You can also hear him flow distinctly on `` Homie Lover Friend '' . The weather never felt as hot as stated on `` Summer Bunnies '' out taking in some sunrays . Then as night falls upon the summer , he has something for the ladies to dance to as R. Kelly shows them how he 'll `` Freak Dat Body '' . As for the slow jams that invite the mood , all there 's to say is good night !	1
Do you mind if I give you some of my ... ... ..12 play ? What else can I say about the king ? This album is a true RnB classic . I listen to this album and I hear the passion in his voice , the seduction in the production and ... ... ..the bad rapping ! But when its the 'R ' you can forgive him for a few blunders ( i.e . `` I like the crotch on you '' and `` Back to the hood of things '' ugh ! ) Nevertheless , this album is pure brilliance . Love him or like him he just may be the greatest RnB artist of all time !	1
Sup my people from the Chi . This CD is over 10 years old and still plays in my cd player often . He has the best talent out of any R & B artist . He has inspired many others but has extrememly sexual lyrics . This is a must have if you 're collecting R.Kelly CD 's	1
This is probably R kellys best work to date . I still love the songs from this album .	1
I remember being twelve years old when the 12 Play album came out . At the time there really was no other male R & B singer doing it like Mr. Kelly expect for my boy Ralph Tresvant . As I 've said in other reviews , R.Kelly 's ballads are what make the CD work . Of course everyone knows the singles Your Body 's Callin , It Seems Like You 're Ready , Bump & Grind , Sex Me Parts 1 & 2 but there was also the self titled track , the heart-felt cover of Sadie and the sentimental For You . The up-tempo stuff is really weak but the ballads are on-point .	1
Well , I did not order this one from Amazon . Actually , I picked this up way before I was even shopping on Amazon . But Amazon is still the bomb ! Anyway , I picked this cd up when it first came out in the 90 's and it is STILL on rotation in my cd changer . The ladies love it and so do I . Now , I realize that R. Kelly is in a little trouble but hey , no one is perfect and we 've all done things we are not proud of so , I 'll continue to support his music . I 'm not sure what he does in his personal life but I 'll say this ; what he does inside the studio allows me to do what I got ta do inside the crib . YMMV ! Neosoul06 ... .	1
R. Kelly - 12 Play ( Jive , 1993 ) Many people claim that they grew up listening to R. Kelly , but when asked what songs are favorites , if you say , `` Thoinga Thoing '' or `` Fiesta '' , then you 're just a YOUNG'UN ! Because ten years ago before all that `` Pied Piper '' hogwash , R. Kelly , bald head and all , had ladies ( and fellas ) swooning with this , his second album . The classics are all on here like `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' , `` Sex Me Pts . I & II '' , and `` Bump n ' Grind '' . The raps that he do on here are also an improvement off of his first album . One big classic . Check it out . -EJR	1
R. Kelly has always been a great producer and songwriter and at least a plausible if not extraordinary singer . Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years , he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album , which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy . Contains the # 1 hit `` Bump 'N Grind '' and the urban radio favorites `` Your Body 's Callin ' '' and `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' . There is also a brilliant remix of `` Bump 'N Grind '' on the single for that song , entitled the `` Definition Of A Hotti Remix '' . This was played a lot on my local radio station , and for those of you who have n't heard it , I strongly recommend . It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion .	1
there 's a couple of tracks that i skip over , but for the most part this was a great debut . another classic to anyone 's cd collection .	1
I really liked this cd . & quot ; Bump n Grind & quot ; and & quot ; Sex Me & quot ; are gon na be on people 's minds for a long time . The only time R. starts slipping is when he tries to rap . Sorry R. but you ai n't got it ! ! ! The one about his mother ( & quot ; Sadie & quot ; ) was so sweet and sentimental . A good album all-around .	1
The man is Prince Teddy Pendergrass in one . The difinitive R & amp ; B album of the '90 's is still a banger to this day .	1
This was the first album without those clowns , oops ! I mean other men , Public Announcement . As you can see as clear as the sun shines , this man has talent . But do n't take my word for it : take a listen . `` Your Body 's Callin ' '' was a banger , no doubt . But the remix was hotter than fire ! `` Bump and Grind '' was a good one too , but the remix was OFF THE CHAIN ! With lyrics like , `` I got what you want , you got what I need/HomeyLoverFriends is all I wan na be . It 's the pretty brown brown , driving me wild ... Oooh child , things are gon na get a little freakier ... '' Plus the dance `` the Butterfly was out then , too . `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' ... . '' Freak Dat Body '' was forgettable as so was `` I Like the Crotch on You . '' `` Summer Bunnies '' was ho-hum . `` For You '' was another sleeper . `` Back to the Hood Of Things '' is where RKelly decided to become a temporary thug , of which he discovers the only thing he is really exceptional at is being a FREAK ! `` Sadie '' is a nice cover , which I presume is/was dedicated to his mother . `` Sex Me : Pts 1 & 2 '' , the best songs on the album , period ... . Lyrics were sexually-laced , not for the faint of heart . Kelly lets you know what 's on his mind and what he plans to do about it . Go get this album and reminisce !	1
A mix of both slow and mid-tempo ( though mostly slow ) songs of faith , love , and desire. & quot ; Homie , Lover , Friend & quot ; expresses every person 's desire to have someone that they can have fun with as a & quot ; homie , & quot ; make love to as a & quot ; lover , & quot ; and trust as a & quot ; friend. & quot ; Classic songs include & quot ; Bump N Grind & quot ; , & quot ; Sex Me & quot ; , and & quot ; your Body 's Callin'. & quot ; Listen to this on the beach while you 're relaxing or when you turn out the lights with that special someone .	1
I have got to say that this album has brought me back during my high school days . I grew up listening to him and other artist such as Keith Sweat . I remember attending to his concert in Radio City Music Hall performing with Salt-N-Pepper right after prom night.Kelly does almost everything by himself . The production , songwriting , and mix 's , etc ... . and he 's brilliant as a multi-instrumentalist.Every fan of R & B ; and soul will love this smooth laid-back music . I mean who can forget classics like `` Your Body 's Callin ' '' and `` Bump N ' Grind '' . Songs that just make your head bounce . Do n't forget The Best R & B-Song ; of 1993 `` Sex Me '' , for its seductive , made-for-lovers-in-bed sound . Other very good low-tempo songs are `` It Seems like You 're Ready '' , `` For You '' `` 12 PLAY '' and `` Sadie '' . It was with the album `` 12 PLAY '' that he acknowledged his real music and showed the world his enormous talent.Overall `` 12 Play '' is a very good album and although released in 1993 , it can stand up to anything on the R & B ; market now . This is a very sexy album great for all kinds of lovers . I definitely recommend this to all Kelly fans .	1
Just a classic CD on this one . Wow , from start to finish , this album is just loaded with tracks from & quot ; Your Body 's Callin ' & quot ; to & quot ; 12-Play & quot ; . My favorite track is & quot ; Seems Like Your Ready & quot ; , a slept on classic song . To me this is where R. Kelly starts production spree of songs from Hi-Five 's & quot ; Quality Time & quot ; on . Of course , the two stand out songs with the remixes for & quot ; Bump & amp ; Grind & quot ; & amp ; Your Body 's Callin ' & quot ; . So please get this one because it is a definite ca n't miss .	1
12 Play is the debut album from R. Kelly . This album is great if you love R & B ; and sexual themes . `` Your Body 's Callin '' , `` Bump N ' Grind '' , `` Homie Lover Friend '' , `` Summer Bunnies '' , `` 12 Play '' and `` Sadie '' are my favorite songs . The rest of the album is good too.R . Kelly has a very strong voice and he produces , writes and arranges all of his music which makes him a very versatile artist.If your just getting into R. Kelly , I recommend these : Chocolate FactoryTP-2.comR.The R In R & B ; Collection , Vol . 1R . KellyHappy People/U Saved Meand Robert 's new album , TP-3 Reloaded is real good . Songs on that album that I recommend listening to are : `` Playa 's Only '' , all of the `` Trapped In The Closet '' chapters , `` Remote Control '' , `` Sex Weed '' and `` Sex In The Kitchen '' .	1
Who does n't have this cd ? This is like a required element of any r & amp ; b lover 's collection . Of course R. Kelly is well known for his & quot ; bump-n-grind & quot ; kind of love songs ... and this is the one that actually has it ! ! Anyone who wants to set the sexy scene with the right kind of music , here 's what you must have !	1
12 play was R. Kelly 's first real solo album unless we count `` Born into the '90s '' with Public Announcement that pretty much was R. Kelly 's affair all the way , but on 12 play it get 's more evident that R. Kelly is the man behind the music and he sings what he wants to , the new jack swing is mostly gone and the main theme is smooth midtempo 's with a theme about sex . infact it 's one of the most sexual albums since Prince . Quite a few songs still feauture a guest rapper but it does n't take away anything from him on the musical side , here he proves that he 's a musical genius and that he 's here to stay . Say what you want about him , but The production here is a class of it 's own.12 play starts with `` Your Body 's Calling '' a slick pleading mid tempo about you know what , This was one of the biggest hits of the album . `` Bump and Grind '' goes ones step further and it 's even better . It got effective beats and R. Kelly singing `` I Do n't See Nothing Wrong/ with a Little Bump N Grund '' . `` Homie Lover Friend '' is a midtempo that features a rapper , the song sound taken from the early 90 's and resembles alot of songs from `` Born into the 90 's '' . `` It Seems Like You 're Ready '' is another excellent number . It 's one of those seductive on the limit songs that could have been penned by Mr Marvin Gaye back in the day , R. Kelly deliver his most sensitive lyrics here , great making love song for sure . `` Freak Dat Booty '' also feautures a rapper and the song is more of a uptempo party track , not that good actually consudering that during the last few years we 've heard a million of simular songs , but I suppose that back in 1993 it was diffrent ? . `` I Like that Crotch On You '' is simular , a mid-tempo with a rapper . Could have been on the previous album also . `` Summer Bunnies '' also feauture a rapper but this song is more of a uptempo and the rap is more prpriate here . It 's one of the highlights here , reminds me a little of the latter `` Only the Loot Can Make Me Happy '' but this one is entirely dedicated to girls . `` For You '' is a very slow romantic song , not to be mistaken for `` Strip for You '' . `` Back to the Hood of Things '' with Snoop and Dr. Dre does n't sound like anything from this album , and in this case it feels out of space here , better for a latter album perhaps . `` Sadie '' is a slow urban number that adds weight to the album . `` Sex Me '' is right on the spot and does n't hide anything . It 's delivered in 2 versions , together they are 10 minutes and resembles good old Prince music . `` 12 Inch Play '' continues where Sex Me left off , odd that the title track is the last song ? either way it 's a slow seductive song that closes a great album well.Overall , R. Kelly finally released a real solo album and he did it with great results . The album was a major hit and launched several hit singles as well . The theme is simple , S-E-X , but sex sells and it 's produced with first class . This album is much better then TP2 and TP3 and it was the album that made R. Kelly a superstar . Say what you want about him and his scandals , but when it comes to music , he 's a genius and he proves it here .	1
If you are a fan of R & B ; music there is no way you can give this album less than 5 stars . It 's a classic . The crazy thing is it 's not even R. Kelly 's best album . That honour belongs to his self titled 1995 release.12 Play boasts the smash hits Your Body 's Callin and Bump N Grind . But it also includes other quality tracks like Summer Bunnies , Sex Me and It Seems Like Your Ready . There is also a great tribute song called Sadie which is a nice change up from the sexually charged theme of the album.This album really launched the career of R. Kelly and put him on the map as one of the powerhouse r & b ; acts of the 1990 's and early 2000 's . High recommend .	1
this is a cd that no matter who im with pull this one out and everyone knows the songs and loves this cd . you can never go wrong with 12 play . every R & B fan needs this cd to complete thier collection it is a must have . there are a few songs i dont like , but all the hits on this cd more than make up for them , and he still gets 5 stars because in my opinion some of the best songs of our time are on this cd . another one of those road trip cds to play with old friends . everyone i know loves this cd .	1
I started to like him when I listen to his CD , R. After that I bought all of his old CDs . When I bought this one , I knew it was going to be nasty , but that 's how it was . This CD sounds great and if you are a BIG fan like me , then you should buy it , DO N'T BURN IT BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT ! ! ! ! !	1
R. Kelly really stepped things up with this his debut solo effort without the support of Public Announcement . The previous LP had showcased moments like `` She 's Got That Vibe '' but had a lot of room for improvement and self expression.The focus here is almost totally on the 90s party/romance `` R & B ; '' sound ( He pauses only to honour his mother ) and is full of classics in this respective genre . `` Bump N ' Grind '' was the big hit and a definite anthemic highlight as he lays down his manifesto . Other well known material includes `` Your Body 's Calling Me '' and `` It Seems Like Your Ready '' , both are beautifully structured and performed . Tracks five to nine bring a more uptempo feel with a slight new jack twist carrying on from 1992 's `` Born Into The 90s '' . The album reaches it 's climax on the final two numbers : the bedroom suite of the near twelve-minute opus `` Sex Me Part 1 & 2 '' and `` 12 Play '' . It 's all really well done , you can tell he had really studied the epic nature of Marvin Gaye 's 70s work.Which leads into the one minor complaint , he did n't seem to have found his own distinctive sound at this stage . His vocal echoes Aaron Hall while the production at times Teddy Riley . That said this problem is n't as acute as on the last LP and the material is great on it 's own merits . Even though he would go on to find his own voice and style on his next album ( 1995 's self-titled effort ) , do n't sleep on `` 12 Play '' , it 's full of gems ...	1
What can I say ? R Kelly is just ... AN AMAZING TALENT ! ! ! ! ! His voice , his creativity is simply amazing . This man is a God blessed vocalist and I pray he continues to shine and bring forth music . LOVE IT !	1
this one still sounds the best to me of all his other release.your bodys callin , bump & amp ; grind,12 play.he is a very talented writer & amp ; producer .	1
This is the best r kelly cd ever in my opinion , its hard to pin point R kelly because he really has written , produced and remixed some of the best song out ... ..He is the closest musical genius right under Prince .	1
All right . I may be the only person in America who has n't seen the tape and therefore I still declare the man innocent until proven guilty . As to the songs pertaining to one adult to another then this is a good CD . If the songs are pertaining to one adult to a child then this is a sick CD .	1
If you love R & amp ; B , then this is your first must-have disc . 12Play is the CD that put R. Kelly on the map , and rightfully so . This is a classic R & amp ; B disc , and could 've been with only five songs on it . Your Body 's Callin , Bump N Grind , It Seems Like You 're Ready , Sex Me ( I & amp ; II ) , and 12Play simply define this disc . It Seems Like You 're Ready was an instant R & amp ; B classic and is still being played on the radio today . Everyone has to love Sex Me just for it 's production if nothing else . I wo n't tell too much . I 'll let the customer experience it for themselves . Those who have the album know what I mean , and those who do n't should be on their way to the record store right now . Definitely buy 12Play !	1
Born Into The 90s by Public Announcement introduced R Kelly to the world . R Kelly later felt he needed to branch out and do his own solo thing . Smart move because he has been on the rise afterwards . Say what you will about R Kelly but he contributed immensely to R & B ; and we have to give credit where it is due . A lot of these groups now are inspired by him ( as much as some of them wont admit it ) .Your Body 's Callin and Bump 'N Grind ( yeah I said it , the hell with corny a** VH1 and Blender ragazine ) , Its Seems Like Your Ready , For You , Sex Me ( parts 1 & 2 ) and the title track are what R Kelly excels at : the slow jams . He does fairly well on fast grooves like Summer Bunnies and Homie Lover Friend . Sadie is the best farewell song to a mother that I 've ever heard ( his mother had passed on ) . As much as I like this album I cant give it five stars . I Like The Crotch On You is laughably cheesy . Freak Dat Body has a slammin beat and nothing else and Back To The Hood Of Things should have never been attempted as R Kelly busts cornball verses like / '' For real yo , you making me nervous/ and Im about to knock you in your teefes/ ( ! ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ) .Regardless of these missteps 12 Play is still a great album by a guy who didnt start making questionable releases until the 2000 . R Kelly is one of the artists that defined 90s R & B ; so you would do well to have this album.Standouts : YOUR BODY 'S CALLIN , BUMP 'N GRIND , IT SEEMS LIKE YOU 'RE READY , SUMMER BUNNIES , FOR YOU , SADIE , SEX ME ( part 1 & 2 ) AND 12 PLAY .	1
12 Play ruled the airwaves in 93 . R Kelly killed all of his Aaron Hall impersonations from `` Born Into The 90 's '' and dropped this classic baby making sex fest on wax.Top Joints : Sex Me ( Both ) 12 PlayIt Seams Like You 're ReadyBump and GrindYour Body 's Callin	1
STOP HATING ON R . KELLY ! ! ! He achieved a lot during his prime for you so-called R. Kelly fans to back stab him like that just for that sex scandal that probably was n't true . Stop hating , stop lying , and shut yor f'n mouths for good .	1
My favorite R. Kelly CD to date -- a note : trapped on track 8 , is an overlooked , but great song called & quot ; For You & quot ; that I 'm sure you will play over & amp ; over -- trust me .	1
You can pretty much tell R. Kelly did this entire record . From the sizzling `` Throw Your Hands Up '' to the infectious remix of `` Back & Forth '' , this record will down as one of R. Kelly 's best producing projects . And that has always been its drawback : the production and arrangement outshining Aaliyah 's flourishing talent as a vocalist . However , that did n't halt Aaliyah 's popularity , as displayed by three HUGE hits ( `` Back & Forth '' , `` Age Ai n't Nothin ' But A Number '' , At Your Best '' ) , with `` Back & Forth '' topping the charts . Not bad for a 15-year old first-timer.The singles are the highlights , but the album tracks are just as good , if not better , than the singles . My favorites include : `` Street Thing '' ( one of the few times Aaliyah takes control of a record in convincing manner ) , `` Young Nation '' ( a lush groove wrapped around Aaliyah 's tender voice ) , and `` Old School '' ( a slick groove featuring R. Kelly rapping ) .What 's most amazing about this record is that Aaliyah was only 15 at the time of its release . It clearly showed that she was going to be a major star , regardless if she had the best behind ( and in front of ) the boards . The two worked hand-n-hand to produce not only a hit record , but a timeless classic in the hip-hop/soul genre . In addition , this record ushered in a slew of other great '94 albums ( Changing Faces , TLC , Boyz II Men , Blackgirl , Immature ) to really kick off the hip-hop/soul genre . Highly recommended for hip-hop heads and R & B ; music junkies .	1
Musical prejudice comes in many different forms . In my own case it came in the form of seeing albums such as this and simply assuming it was just one of the many `` new jill '' female artists that seemed to be saturating the musical world in the early/mid 1990 's . Maybe to a certain degree that was true for Aaliyah in the beginning . On the other hand she was much more than that from the get go . For starters she courted controversy as being the teenage wife to the by this time very adult R.Kelly . So the obvious was on the minds of a lot of people : that her record contract came along with the engagement ring . Only R himself would know the truth about that today . At the same time , he certainly had an eye for a talent in growth and nearly ready to bloom.This album was very much a musical byproduct of R.Kelly's12-Playera . He was still musically running a bit with the crowd and had n't established his own voice . So it 's no surprise that some of these songs such as `` Back And Forth '' , '' Down With The Clique '' , '' Young Nation '' and `` Old School '' are very much artifacts of the new jack/hip-hop soul era , especially in rhythmic terms . On the rhythmically layored slower jam of the title song , representing how the `` new jack ballad '' genre stuck pretty close to a mid/late 80 's sound and `` At Your Best '' , a more live sounding ballad you hear a beauty and charm in Aaliyah 's verstile pipes that would very much come to define who she 'd be in the future . Kelly had the good sense to present her singing acapella on some of the interludes to showcase her talents.So is this an ideal debut for Aaliyah ? No . The album title may have emphasized that age ai n't nothing but a number . But her age was in fact at the very key of this album . While she does have a percocious manner about her , Aaliyah is still at this point coming at her songs from the point of view of a high school age person looking to be grown up . In her case on more of an urban street level . Her attitude is not particularly angsty though and that 's very appealing . She tends to be enthusiastic and explorative . On a darker note she also came off as endlessly resiliant , with a perception life would be longer than it would be . And in her case , it was inhumanly short I 'll tell you . But the small amount of music she released in her short time in life , starting with this told a story of creative growth and earnestness .	1
This cd is one of those throwbacks to the 90 's that has really held true . Yes it sounds like what it is , a dated R & B/rap album created by a very talented young woman ( R.I.P . Aaliyah ) . But it sounds so much better than similar albums of its type and era , which makes me wonder what more would have come from this woman ! Some tracks are cringe-worthy but they will ALL make you nod your head once again .	1
I got this CD for my birthday , which is 4 days before Aaliyah 's . I first saw and heard Aaliyah in her video Back & Forth , and I loved her automatically . As a 7 year old , I thought of her as a role model . I always thought she was so beautiful and talented . So , it 's no wonder I 'm still mourning this loss way into 2002 . It 's like I lost a friend . Anyway , this CD is very 90 's sounding , which is what I miss in music today . My favorite song on the album is At Your Best ( You Are Love ) , because it 's a very touching ballad with wonderful background music ( check out the remix of this song , too ) . I love Back & Forth ( both of 'em ) , Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number , Down With the Clique , Old School , I 'm Down , and all the other songs I did n't mention . Buy this CD , cuz it 's a definite collector 's item for all Aaliyah fans.R.I.P . Aaliyah January 16 , 1979-August 25 , 2001	1
This album came out when I was 14 , I 'm 21 now , and I still listen to it a lot . In fact it 's my favorite Aaliyah album . All the songs are great ( of course since R.Kelly wrote them ) and Aaliyah sings them beautifully . The best song are the title track , & quot ; Back and Forth & quot ; , and & quot ; At Your Best You Are Love & quot ; ... all the other songs are great too !	1
Well , I liked this CD a lot . someone that I did n't know purchased it for me off of my wishlist ( you can buy me something for me , too if you like ! ) . And when I got it , I listened to it all the way through . I 've been an Aaliyah fan since & quot ; Back and Forth , & quot ; and I 'd heard some songs on this album , but not the whole thing , so this was really a treat for me . I liked the CD , and the beats , it really DID have & quot ; a 90s swing. & quot ; the only thing I did n't like was R. Kelly all over it . I 've always disliked R. Kelly , and I think that the best ONLY thing he ever did was Aaliyah . The album , though , and the content was really immature , which was n't rare for albums that came out in the 1994 period , but I still liked it . It was pretty good . But my favorite is still & quot ; Back and Forth. & quot ; : D	1
Aaliyah came out when she was 15 and had some great hip hop laced R & B ; cuts with help from R. Kelly , her mentor and rumored husband.Aaliyah had a certain charisma and smooth delivery that made up for her sometimes immature lyrics ( which was not her fault ) . Still this Cd was very important in the mid 90 's . Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number , Back and Forth , and At your best ( You are love ) were her singles but I was also impressed by her other cuts.This Cd is straight 90 's music but it is Aaliyah and it is still a classic ! Favs : Street Thing , Im so into you , No one Knows.. , Old School , along with her singles !	1
Aaliyah . The name of the woman who gave birth to every teen sensation out since her debut . this includes Mya , monica , christina aguilera , britney spears , 3lw , 702 etc . She made it tight to sign a teen to a record deal . With 49 minutes of sheer genius of R. Kelly production and songwriting ( no they were never engaged ) catapults this from mediocrity to being a cd for the ages . This beautiful girl with the beatiful voice knock folks on they heels with Back and Forth , then she went for the knockout punch with At Your Best and the title track . All the songs are brilliantly done and sung . Production is timeless . Another opus is Street Thing . Do not sleep on thsi joint anymore . Cream will always rise to the top . Dont get it twisted about Aaliyah . I bet some people think she a new artist which is pretty ridiculous . The mother will return witha album this summer drops on July 17th . She teased u with Romeo Must Die soundtrack but it is now time to restore order in her household of little & quot ; teenyboppers & quot ; . If you consider ya self a true r & amp ; b fan then you should already have this cd If you dont you should be at the store in the next 15 minutes u will not be disappointed .	1
I 'm a 31 year old white guy that normally listens to metal and grunge , but I love this album . I had a roommate in the Airforce back in 1994 who played this alot , and I just came to really like it . It 's a good mix of songs , some smooth R & amp ; B stuff , and some more upbeat hip-hop type songs . & quot ; Back And Forth & quot ; was the big song off this , but & quot ; Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number & quot ; , & quot ; I 'm So Into You & quot ; , and & quot ; At Your Best ( you are love ) & quot ; are all great as well . My favorite though is & quot ; Young Nation & quot ; . It 's just super sweet . I do n't know her other albums at all , and I do n't know the genre well , but I do know this disc will make you & quot ; Throw Your Hands Up & quot ; .	1
This is a really great album . It sounds really cool like early nineties , summertime , you know that kind of sound . And it has some of my all time favorite Aaliyah songs like , Back and forth , At your best , Down , young nation , age aint nothin but a number , no one knows , and my absolute favorite Aaliyah song street thing .	1
With production by R.Kelly , you had the making of a great album and Aaliyah delivered in many ways ; tunes were right and her voice still had not developed the full capability ( being only a 13 y.o . ) but well done .	1
This release was the young and talented Aaliyah 's debut on Blackground , and Jive , which was the first label on which she would release her music . Her voice has startling maturity for her youth on this album , as she pulls-off excellent party tunes like her first single & quot ; Back & amp ; Forth & quot ; , the energetic & quot ; Down With The Clique & quot ; , and the funky & quot ; Throw Your Hands Up & quot ; . Slow jams are also present , the best being her cover of & quot ; At Your Best ( You Are Love ) & quot ; . Other top tracks include the & quot ; Mr. Lee & amp ; R.Kelly 's Remix & quot ; of her afformentioned first single , the slow burning & quot ; Young Nation & quot ; , and my personal favorite of this collection , the title track & quot ; Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number. & quot ; This song is so very catchy , and nearly instantly you can sing along to it , and being doing so days after just that single listen . Truly a great debut album , for a great talent , I will miss the music she could have done before her loss this past year , but I will always enjoy her shining debut .	1
I 'm amazed this album does n't have that many 5 star reviews considering the beats are catchy and has that typical90s sound . I agree that One and a Million is her strongest album but it would be hard for me to give Age Ain'tNothing But A Number less than 5 stars . Yes , the lyrics can be fluffy at times but I still feel like it doesn'ttake off the focus of the song . I 've been listening to it alot these days . The songs are just hard to resist . Mostof them made my body rocked to the hooks . It made me miss the 90s and how much fun it used to be . I think R.Kellywas trying his best to make Aaliyah more marketable to the public . Throughout the songs , there are frequentshoutouts to her name.1 . Throw Your Hands Up ( 5/5 ) -When I listen to this song , it gives me energy . I love the chorus or the bridge . Ithink having the guest artist rapping throughout the song gave this song more funk.2 . Back & Forth ( 5/5 ) -a song that is about chilling with your friends on a Friday night . R.Kelly 's voice adds anice touch to it.3 . Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number ( 5/5 ) -AMAZING ! I would give anything for r'n'b music to sound like this rightnow ! Her smooth vocals go so well with the hardcore , gansta hip hop . It just makes the song more mysterious.4 . Down With The Clique ( 4.5/5 ) -I do n't think Aaliyah sounded all that good especially with the occasional `` ooos '' .It makes her sound like she ca n't sing . But the song itself is very laidback and the lyrics flow well together.5 . At Best You Are Love ( 5/5 ) -best ballad on the album . it suits her voice very well.6 . No One Know How To Love Me Quite Like You Do ( 5/5 ) -the beat reminds me of Janet 's You Want This . Great song todance to ! 7 . I 'm So Into You ( 5/5 ) -typical fluffly love song , but it sounds really nice.8 . Street Thing ( 5/5 ) -I could hear the R.Kelly influence in her voice . She displays alot more soul in this songthan the others and it 's the only song where she showcases her upper range in which she did not do very often . This is the side of her I enjoy seeing.9 . Young Nation ( 5/5 ) -it has that same smooth , laidback like Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number . Her vocals sound verysensual and very sexy especially with R.Kelly's.10 . Old School ( 5/5 ) -I thought it was kinda boring at first , but it grew on me ... .11 . I 'm Down ( 5/5 ) -everytime I listen to this , it takes me back to the mid-90s and those saturday afternoonswatching soul train . i love the lil piano playing in the background.12 . Back & Forth remix ( 4/5 ) -cool remix but I prefer the Ms.Mello remix . I wish they had included that remixinstead of Mr.Lee 's one . I think it would have flow well with the smooth and laidback vibe of this album.Average rating : 4.75	1
Sad and weird it is , but the fact is that I had n't bothered listening to Aaliyah before . All I knew was that she had starred in & quot ; Romeo Must Die & quot ; alongside Jet Li.Now , I found out this morning she had been killed in a plane crash yesterday , in the Bahamas . So I figured : let me see who this girl really was ! And I saw myself listening to her music , to be gladly surprised that she 's not the common type of R & amp ; B act at all : she died at 22 , so that makes this 1994 album a remarkable feature , having recorded it age 14 ! If you listen to the sample tracks above , you 'll be as amazed as I continue to be ... I know her music will live in the hearts of all her fans , and will continue to gain the respect she well deserved . The biggest irony of all is that barely a month ago , her new album had hit the stores , one which the majority of the public reviewers here in Amazon have termed 'more mature ' and 'eclectic'.R.I.P . Aaliyah	1
YO THIS WAS HYPED WHEN IT CAME OUT I WAS A SHORTIE TO BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD I STILL KNEW THE WORDS AND HAD THIS ALBUM WHEN IT DROPPED BUT YO I LOVE THIS CD TO DEF FOREAL ! ! ! ! BUT WE MISS AND LOVE YA BABYGIRL FOREVER ! ! !	1
Your fans will rejoice in your music and spirit forevermore ! I still ca n't believe how young AALIYAH was when she recorded this CD . Her angelic voice glides effortlessly over driving hip-hop and r & amp ; b beats . 'Back & amp ; Forth ' and the title track 'Age ' are great examples of her vocal abilities.AALIYAH , with the help of R. Kelly , remakes the Isley Bro 's classic 'At Your Best ' . Her version is simply outstanding ! Great Job AALIYAH ! You will never be forgotten .	1
This cd was Aaliyah 's debut cd , and it was very nice . R Kelly obviously had alot to do with this project since he can be heard all over it . Aaliyah had a sweet and melodic voice , and I had n't heard this cd in years . Some of my favorite songs are Back & forth , At your best , I 'm so into you , Old school , and I 'm down..If you are an Aaliyah fan get this asap !	1
I bought this album when it first came out . I liked all of the singles : & quot ; Back and Forth , & quot ; & quot ; At Your Best ( You Are Love ) & quot ; -- both the original and remix and & quot ; Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number. & quot ; But after I listened to the whole album , I immediately fell in love with & quot ; Street Thing. & quot ; Some of my other favorite songs are & quot ; Noone Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do & quot ; and & quot ; I 'm Down. & quot ;	1
I took out her 2 cds , that I own , when I heard of her passing . So young . And due to the 2 cds that I have , along with her other non album singles , she was definitely going somewhere and had wonderful talent ahead to show . I think you 'll definitely have to like R & amp ; B/very soft Hip Hop in order to appreciate the album . Also , keep in mind that she was 15 when she did this album . Some of the 'young me ' favorites on the cd are ( quite a few off the album ) ; & quot ; Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number & quot ; , & quot ; Down with the Clique & quot ; ( fun beat & amp ; rhythm ) , & quot ; At Your Best ( You Are Love ) & quot ; ( R & amp ; B love song , pleasant ) , & quot ; No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do & quot ; ( more of a hip hop love song ... unique ) , & quot ; Young Nation & quot ; , and I like the R. Kelly remix of & quot ; Back & amp ; Forth & quot ; ( party song ) . All in all a pleasant album . And I would rate this a 4 even before her death . Wonderful debut album from a 15 year old , and the songs are what a 15 year old would sing and create ( along with her co-creators ) .	1
Aaliyah Dana Haughton is one of our world 's finest entertainers . Aaliyah possesses a golden voice . Her vocal range is very wide ; she can hit the high and low notes with effortless ease and pristine perfection . & quot ; Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number & quot ; is a wonderful album . Aaliyah has the unique ability to sing to the listener . Her music touches my very essence . This thirteen track album is loaded with hits . Every track is a perfect ten . Aaliyah is kind enough to share her fantastic artistic abilities with the world . I thank Aaliyah for that . I guarantee that you will love this album . Do n't think twice , buy this album . Peace from Barbados .	1
Long before Britney Spears asked to be hit one more time , Christina Aguilera was a genie trapped in a bottle , and Rihanna offered her umbrella ( ella , ella ) , there was Brandy , Monica , and Aaliyah . Brandy was the cute girl with braids begging to be dubbed `` down '' by a crush and Monica was the `` too big for her britches '' Miss Thang apologizing to her man for trippin ' cuz `` it 's just one of dem days ! '' Aaliyah was cool and mysterious with dark shades and baggy clothes . The Detroit native was discovered by Mr. Bump'N'Grind himself , R. Kelly . The results are pretty good to meh and a bit creepy , but it was only the beginning.Back and Forth was the song that put Aaliyah on the map with it 's summery vibe that made you wan na `` throw your hands in the air and wave 'em round like ya just do n't care '' . The sloppy remix tacked at the end is pointless . The title track is one of the best slow jams out there , but it 's creepy when you take a look at the lyrics . `` Age ai n't nothing but a number/Throwin ' down ai n't nothing but a thing/This lovin ' I have for you/It 'll never change '' . Anybody remember when Aaliyah and R. Kelly got married when she was 15 and he was 27 ? Yeah . The short intro of her writing in her diary does n't help either.Aaliyah 's cover of At Your Best ( You Are Love ) is the softest song on the set and showcases the ethereal beauty of her voice . She did n't have the widest range , but the angelic pureness of her vocals were her strength . The Gangsta Child remix would 've been a better choice for the last track over the Back and Forth mix . Other highlights are the ballad Street Thing , I 'm So Into You , No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do ( although R. Kelly 's `` Liyah , you 're the only one for me ! '' is all kinds of wrong ) , I 'm Down , and the jazzy cool Young Nation.Down With the Clique is ok , but nearly ruined by R. Kelly 's silly mumbling about it being the 90s . I do n't know what he was babbling about . Speaking of which , Old School turns into a song all about him and how he broke into the business . Last time I checked this was Aaliyah 's cd . Yeah , he 's hovering in the background like a weirdo stalker on the cover , but still . I also could 've done without the annoying raps from Tia Hawkins ( whoever that is ) .This album has some pretty good tracks , but Aaliyah would come into her own on her next project , the Missy Elliott and Timbaland assisted One In A Million . The less creepiness from R. Kelly , the better .	1
The soulful , sexy , attractive , elegant , beautiful , talented Aaliyah has started it all with this album . Although this cd is almost 10 years old , it is still in my cd player non-stop . My all time favorite track is At Your Best ( 06 ) * . It is the most soulful track she has ever done . Others include Age Ai n't Nothing But A Number ( 04 ) , Back & Forth ( 03 ) * , and I 'm Down ( 12 ) . All the other tracks are incredible as well . These are the songs I play the most . I love her style and her whole everything . The tracks are smooth with her singing and then has a hip-hop flavor to it . I love it when an artist knows what sells and sticks with it . This cd sounds like it took time to do . The song selections on here are just amazing . I love her . This is what you call real music , not that techno , synthesized $ h*t that is now called R & B . This is true and not overplayed . If a cd can last for 10 years and not sound out of date , then you made a successful album . This is one of the four she has ! Much Love ! ( *These songs can be found on the I Care 4 U album + DVD )	1
If you 're even a lukewarm fan of Brandy , Monica , Mya , Nivea , Ashanti , Britney Spears , Mandy Moore , Jessica Simpson , Teirra Marie , Lumidee ( did I miss any of the clones ? ) , give THIS Aaliyah debut a good listen ... All of the aforementioned basically tried to come out behind a very distinctive path carved out by the GREAT Aaliyah : a true entertainer who combined dance , a girl power-esque image via assertiveness ( she called it `` street but sweet '' ) and was the first to dare to put cool , smooth vocals over a blazing hip hop beat.Aaliyah was indeed one in a million ... Highly recommended LP .	1
Great work from Aaliyah an Kelly ... She was known for working with the best but this is not flawless like the Red Album or Damn near perfect like One and a Million.It 's still has many hit 's like , Bacc and Forth ! ! ! ft R Kelly , Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number ! ! ! , Down with the Clique , At Your Best ! ! ! , Street Thing , & Young Nation ! ! ! { The Best Tracc }	1
Aaliyah 's debut CD yielded two Top 10 singles - `` Back and Forth '' and `` At Your Best ( You Are Love ) '' ( the later or which was written and originally recorded by the Isley Brothers ) . However , the CD is filled with great songs , including a great balance of hip-hip songs ( Throw Your Hands Up , Down with the Clique ) and ballads ( Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number ) . Almost any of the songs on the CD could have been a hit single . That said , Aaliyah 's voice was not as mature as it would be later , and some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile ( if you 're not down with my clique/ then you 're poop on a stick ) .The entire CD was produced by R. Kelly ( he appears in the shadows on the CD back cover and is name-checked in several songs ) . With one producer , the CD sounds very cohesive , but it also is not as varied as her later CDs . It was rumored that she and R. Kelly were married at the time , even though she was only 15 years old . Her marriage seems to be addressed in the song , `` Age Ai n't Nothing But a Number , '' which argues that she is wiser than her years would seem.At times , the album sounds a bit dated ( the CD `` One In a Million '' is much better ) . One of the lyrics states , `` Aalyiah 's got a 90 's swing , '' which is pretty accurate - the CD sounds very much like an early 90 's hip-hp CD . Despite this complaint , I still greatly enjoy this CD . It sounds great and is a lasting tribute to Aaliyah 's talent . We will miss out on hearing future recordings from this superstar , but will continue to enjoy the music she left behind .	1
With the anniversary of her death approaching , now seems like an appropriate time to look back on this promising debut . While it has a fair amount of filler and the hit tunes are good but not great , `` Age Ai n't ... . '' showed great promise and still entertains on many levels . For every half-baked song sketch with bad rapping ( `` Throw Ya ' Hands Up '' , `` Old School '' ) there 's a moment of sheer inspiration and joy ( `` Back & Forth '' ) and a title track that still bumps after 8 years . She was taken from us far too soon , but listening to this first effort reminds us of why we fell in love with her in the first place .	1
This is a really good debut album , and it has that funky 90s hip hop swing sound that I absolutely LOVE ! This is what real hip-hop is about , not that ( garbage ) that 's on radio and TV nowadays . My favorite song on the album is Throw Your Hands Up , it 's the best song with the best hook that 'll stick in your head for days and you ca n't help but bob your head and rap to it . It 's kind of like an anthem to Aaliyah and similar artists at the time. '' 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 ! Aaliyah 's in the house ... So if you down with the funky flava throw your hand up , and if you got the flavor for Aaliyah throw your hands up , and if you down with Blackground throw your hands up ... '' The sassy female rapping voice you hear throughout the album on her songs is Tia , FYI , but for some reason she was n't credited in the album flap . This album sounds quite different from her subsequent ones because she was teamed with R. Kelly and Tia instead of Timbaland and Missy `` Misendeamor '' Elliot . The singles are `` Back and Forth '' ( an excellent song ) and a cover of `` At Your Best ( You Are Love ) '' ( this one puts me to sleep , but it 's pretty ) . The title track has a sweet catchy hook and a message I can relate to .	1
G-Funk from the bay E-Fizze rep that Bay Life the beats are bangin the lyrics are dope they slam on my JBL 's makin heads turn	1
Being E-40 's first true `` LP '' to be released , this album 's quality amazes me even today . Every one of the 11 songs is worth listening to , and there are very few slow parts on the album . This disc is very underground and street sounding , considering it was released so early in E-40 's career when he was still sellin ' tapes out of his trunk . But after this CD was released , the north bay area rap scene changed greatly and new respect was given to the area.The disc starts off with an instant classic track , `` Drought Season '' ... this song talks about exactly what the title says - the lack of 'substances ' going around in the area . Do n't need to explain more than that . Following this track is `` Rat Heads '' , a pretty good cut about snitches in the game . True words spoken on this track . Skipping a couple [ good ] tracks , we come to two of my favorites on the album - `` Hide N Seek '' and `` Let Him Have It '' . Earl injects a whole lot of story-telling into his raps and both are like a street-book-on-tape . Both of the beats are insanely well produced and hit your subs with madness.The second half of the CD is just as good as the first . Near the end of the disc , we have `` Carlos Rossi '' which is possibly the best song on the album , featuring the Click ( E-40 's group from Vallejo ) and a tight beat . `` Nuttin ' Ass Nigga '' is a diss towards Mac Dre , and although the beef has been settled these days , back then things were n't as calm . A great song , even if it is towards another one of my favorite rappers.Overall this disc is a street classic and anyone who enjoys Bay Area rap should not be without it . While not quite as classic as his later albums , `` In A Major Way '' , and `` Tha Hall Of Game '' , Federal paved the way for future hits . Nothing less than an A.OVERALL SCORE : 92 / 100	1
This is a dope album by a very young and under rated e-40 . I brought this in 97 and took a chance buying it because I never heard it . im a big e-40 fan and i have of his other cds but this one got by me . The song federal is super tight that will break your speakers.This cd is great but not as good as the mail man which came after this . But this is a must has if your a e-40 fan cause it has great those old cali mob style beats .	1
this cd elevated the whole rap game to another level ! from the independent hustle , lingo , words and topics . this certified 40 to legendary status ! every song on here bumps , no skipping . my favorites on here are hide n seek , ratheads , tanji , let em have it , xtra manish and drought season drought season . if you dont have go get it ! look for the original pressing with the 14 songs , SMG release .	1
This is one of the all time sickest albums ever ! But why is this not the original ? Where is Tanji 2 ? Why do so many older albums either leave songs off or put additional songs on them that were n't there before ? I am trying to replace all of the albums I had when tapes were popular with cd 's and THIS KEEPS HAPPENING.Anyone know where I can find the original E-40 Federal ?	1
A lot of you think this is there first national record to rise to stardom but in actualality N2DEEP Back to the hotel put E-40 and B-legit to the gold record artist status that they were bound to achieve.this record did n't achieve that status but more than should've.if your someone who is a pure click fan the song V-town on back to the hotel is one to get.When this record was first released independently samples were n't cleared and when jive picked it up they chose not to clear them and took them of the record . bad decision.they have sold around 400,000 copies of this yet this a bay classic . It still will most likely go gold but it would make it there faster if they would bring back the original album.These 4 artists have tried to hold down the westcoast while the rest of the west has been and stayed on vacation.If you do n't have this record get it but if possible hit a store that has the original copy not the edited version .	1
I was introduced to E-40 and The Click with `` Mr . Flamboyant '' and 40 's flow was so tight I had to get it . Though it 's not the original copy/release from 1991-1992 , Down & Dirty is still tight . Sick Wid ' It Records was the first independent rap label to get at least a million advance . Studio Ton did a mojority of this release that was quickly picked up and imitated by southern producers . `` Mic Check '' is a good display of the talent of the fast , slang filled rhymes of the crew . The original funk on `` On A Mission '' about retaliation on another click having game being told instead of a hook . `` ... I 'm sideways , doing about a buck fifty / took another exit to another part of the city ... '' how 40 water started on `` Let 's Get Drunk '' . The Hillside of Vallejo , California family that started a lot of the slang that we now say and need their due recognition on this dirty release .	1
the original version of this album is one of the best f***in albums out tha bay-definetly ! ! ! forget getting the re-release its missing 1/2 the album ... songs-skits , different beats & samples	1
The original release of Down & Dirty with 18 tracks is definitely one of the best albums ever made . It 's a versatile gangsta rap album , that touches a lot of different topics.The beats are ahead of their time , the big names Studio Ton , Mike Mosley and Sam Bostic take care of that . E-40 is at his best on this album , his unique style and delivery with great lyrics combined . B-Legit is also on fire here , and even D-Shot comes very hard . Suga-T is only featured on one track , on Sohabs.Even though the whole album is classic , the best songs are Let 's Get Drunk , On A Mission , Mr . Flamboyant , Daily Routine , You F***ed Up When You Slammed My Motha and of course Let 's Side.The re-release on Jive with changed beats and narrowed tracklist ai n't anything after you 've heard the original.And guess what ... I have the original tape on great condition for sale ... Holla at me ! My e-mail address is ailuv @ suomi24.fi	1
I heard this when I was 12 and loved it.It has tight beats and will have you nodding your head . It has that funky sick wit it style all over this one . I noticed the beats are different though that is the only bad point.THis is a rerelease so it get 4 stars .	1
This album is the Click 's first album that went out nationwide , after being an underground hit in the Bay Area . & quot ; Down and Durty & quot ; presents for the first time V-Town 's E40 , B-Legit and D-Shot together with their supporing crew which includes Lttle Bruice , Kaveo , Mugzi , Levitti and more . After hustlin ' many years tryin ' to make it in their hometown - sellin ' the tapes from their cars ( like many great people in the hip hop industry did - Too Short , Eazy-E.. ) , performing everywhere in their Area they signed with Jive and their way up began . E-40 , his brother D-Shot , their couisin B-Legit and their sister Suga T ( who 's not on this album ) came out with a perfect album - every single track on it is bangin ' . Tight production by Studio Ton and Mike Mosley persents the special sound of Sic-wit-it - the record label E40 and B-Legit founded . A bangin ' album with smooth and funky music with some of the Bay Area 's greatest rappers . True lyrics about street life over some dope music . A real classic , so it 's a must buy not only for people who like the bay area flava but also people who wan na hear some real dope mobbin ' sh*t .	1
first time I 've ever heard of e 40 , b legit , suga t , and d shot I thought they would have been memories by now boy was I wrong still they came up in the game e40 had the most underground sucess and still he 's very underrated still if you feeling these mugs buy this badboy .	1
The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click . They combine tales of slangin ' rock with beats that sound like `` Cutie Pie '' or `` Computer Love '' . It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble , Hillside , and Its All Bad . This is something different , because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this . Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word , Love him or Hate on him .	1
E-40 was a long-time veteran in the rap game when his seminal album `` In a Major Way '' was released in 1995 . It 's really the album that got E-40 noticed by a mainstream audience , and pushed Jive to ultimately stuff more money into his forthcoming albums ( the next being `` Hall Of Game '' [ 1996 ] ) . This album rides the line between independent and mainstream lines ridiculously well . As far as rapping goes , E-40 is at the very top of his game , boasting his slang-filled flow with a cunning wit , that is arguably in peak form . Most notably , some of the best west coast rappers came to support Forty 's untouchable style - 2Pac , Mac Mall & Spice 1 - who all perform flawlessly on the classic posse track `` Dusted 'n ' Disgusted '' . `` Da Bumble '' kicks off the album right after a solid intro . From this point on , we catch a glimpse of what the production will sound like throughout , although minimal , it bangs nicely . The production is mainly kept in-house , and is handled by Mike Mosley , Studio Ton & Funk Daddy among others . There are some stellar tracks here ! `` Sideways '' featuring The Click 's B-Legit & Mac Shawn is probably my favorite . The beat is tight , and is one of my favorite appearances from B-Legit . `` Spittin ' '' is also one of my favorites . The album 's front half burns brightly with bangers like these ... it almost feels front-loaded with the goods , but truly boasts quality through and through . Then comes perhaps E-40 's greatest single - `` Sprinkle Me '' . The Click 's Suga-T performs immaculately alongside Forty Water . The beat is tight and the lyrics are true to form . Other standouts are the aforementioned `` Dusted 'n ' Disgusted '' , and the breakthrough single `` 1-Luv '' . The quality of album tracks in the mix leaves the album free of filler.Consistent quality has always been part of E-40 's repertoire . Consistently enjoyable full albums are another thing . `` In a Major Way '' is definitely his most consistent effort to date . Although the beat-makers will prove to hit harder on later albums , there has never been a set of beats/collaborators that E-40 has worked better with . This is one of the albums that defines the Bay Area in the rap world .	1
The third solo release , In A Major Way , from the self-proclaimed `` Ambassator of the Bay '' delivers a complete project with mainstream success . E-40 speaks over `` Intro '' as he gives the ingredients contained in this album that ties with `` Da Bumble '' both produced by Sam Bostic & Mike Mosley with speed variences . The objective is definately arranged for the trunk as 40 Water flows without any hooks , chorus or breaks , but his original multi-styled flow with charisma and energy as quoted `` ... he say / she say / b*tch , that away ... '' `` Sideways '' featuring B-Legit & Mac Shon is for the riders hitting the strip or the block as E and B share verses highlighted by the catchy hook . `` ... big timer , timer / 40 water ... '' `` Sprinkle Me '' featuring Suga T had all the perfect elements with a memerable hook , perfect delivery and production makes this a highlight with a mainstream feel . Taking it to the streets with all star support from 2Pac , Mac Mall & Spice 1 on `` Dusted 'N ' Disgusted '' as each shined with their signature flow . Performed as a letter to a friend in jail `` 1-Luv '' featuring Leviti poses the reality of simply living and E-40 did not miss a beat . Relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smokers and drinkers , `` Smoke 'N ' Drank '' , was written with just that in mind . `` Dey Ai n't No '' is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this LP a more street feel . Speaking about the street games , E-40 spits on how to invest into businesses for a legal hustle on `` Fed '' featuring Suga T. Sharing verses with B-Legit & Celly Cel representing the `` H.I . Double L. '' side of Vallejo , California on how they live . `` It 's All Bad '' is about life in the ghetto and changing times comparing it to excerpts found in the Bible . This song was enlighened at the conclusion with a surprise guest by E-40 's son with a solid performance . The `` Outro '' only left the listener craving another dosage of this sixteen track album .	1
1995 was The Bay Area 's biggest year . Artists such as The Luniz , Mac Mall , and the Hieroglyphics were having big hits that year . Too Short just dropped a near classic album . And The Click was on point , reppin ' northern Cali area . 40 Water comes out with his third solo album In A Major Way back in'95 . The album has that northern west coast vibe that is guaranteed to get listeners moving . A few standouts include `` Ridin ' Sidewayz '' with B-Legit , and Mac Shon . `` Spittin ' '' has a dope bass line too that will hype you up . `` Sprinkle Me '' is the album 's first single that features 40 's younger sister Suga-T ( she also sings the hook for `` Fed '' ) . Bay Area artists Spice 1 , Mac Mall , and Tupac drop in for the dope `` Dusted 'N ' Disgusted '' . `` Smoke 'N ' Drank '' is my favorite from the album that will keep you bouncing ( that pre-hyphy style song ) . 40 's younger son comes in and drops a few bars on `` All Bad '' to help close out the album.E-40 dropped an excellent album for '95 . In A Major Way is mostly consistent all though out , as it helped represented the west coast . This album vibes like most albums out there and it is highly recommended if you 're a fan of their music . 4 stars- Highly recommended . Peace.Lyrics : B+Production : A-Guest Appearances : B+Musical Vibes : A-Top 5 Tracks:1 . Smoke 'N ' Drank2 . Spittin'3 . Ridin ' Sidewayz ( featuring B-Legit and Mac Shon ) 4 .

On my opinion , this is his best album , it 's just damn good ! ! His unique style mixed with the funky and fat westcoast beats make this album a CLASSIC . It 's not right that he did n't sell the units he deserved to . It 's not right , that for example Ja Rule or Nelly , who do n't have no talent or are n't real make the money , that does n't belong to them . Maybe E 's flow is just too fast for the big audience .	1
I had to write this . I am a huge e-40 fan since 1993 . After listening to all his cds . This is the best . Its his best beats and most creavtive lyrics and styles on this cd . I love the songs sprinkle me , dusted and Disgusted with 2pac , and one love . He made videos for all of those . This came out in 96 and he was just starting to make a national name for himself . He never matched this masterpeice.He still never really gets airplay he deserves . But get this cd .	1
i had this cd back in the days and it broke got me a new one brings back memories . lovely cd .	1
After dropping two underground albums , E-40 came out with In A Major Way , which is an instant classic . E-40 is from Vallejo , and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next West Coast rap star . His crazy , comical , hip style is a pleasure to listen to . Also , the beats on this album are some of the best I 've heard in a while . They have a richness to them , which is real good . Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely , Studio Tone ( who produced some tracks for Kurupt ) , Funk Daddy , and a few others . Also , E-40 raps extremely fast on some tracks , and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago . However , after a listen , everything sounds clear as a bell ! He 's also got an amazing guest list : Tupac , Suga T , Mac Mall , Spice 1 , B-Legit , Mac-Shawn , and Celly Cel to name a few . But most of the tracks have E-40 going solo , which is good too , because it 's good to see he 's not just relying on others to guest on his album . Overall the tracks sound & quot ; Hipper than a hippopotamous & quot ; .The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat , but then moves into the crazy funked out & quot ; The Bumble & quot ; . E-40 rips this track to shreds , and the beat is bananas ! Definitely one of the most original beats I 've heard in a while . & quot ; Sideways & quot ; also has a tight bouncy beat , and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class . Mac-Shawn does the chorus , clever lyricism on here too . & quot ; Spittin ' & quot ; has a heavy , sunny funk beat . E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning , but sounds nice throughout . & quot ; Sprinkle Me & quot ; is a classic single , with a fun , sunny beat and Suga T ( E-40 's sister ) guests on it . They make a nice sibling team . Sprinkle me mayne ! & quot ; Dusted And Disgusted & quot ; like everyone else says , is a CLASSIC posse cut . It features Tupac , Spice 1 and Mac Mall . The way the beat changes is so dope . E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees . Part of the beat is a nice , laid-back one , and the other is a rough gangsta beat . & quot ; One Love & quot ; is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal . Great line : & quot ; This ai n't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious , more realistic than radio-shack & quot ; . Actually sounds like it could 've been a huge hit even today . & quot ; Smoke And Drink & quot ; has more of a Zapp sound to it . E-40 raps really fast on it , but nicely , and the beat has this cool groove to it , and I love the refrain ! & quot ; They Ai n't Know & quot ; is a slower song about street life and gettin ' money . The lyrics are worth listening to . & quot ; Fed & quot ; has a GREAT bouncing bass beat , and E-40 rips it , the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else , it 's catchy . & quot ; H-i-Double-L & quot ; is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40 . The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car . & quot ; Bootsee & quot ; is a tight funky track about a busta named & quot ; Bootsee & quot ; . I 'm sure you 're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they 're really just fakin ' it . & quot ; It 's All Bad & quot ; is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life . He knows the game well.Overall if you like Bay Area rap , you probably have this , but if you do n't try it . E-40 tears it up everytime he 's on the mic on this record , and the beats are amazing .	1
This is easily E-40 's best work . & quot ; In a Major Way & quot ; is top-notch material from beginning to end . The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk , while 40 's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur , but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic & quot ; Dusted & amp ; Disgusted , & quot ; & quot ; 1-Luv , & quot ; and & quot ; Spittin. & quot ; There 's not one weak track on here . If you 're into the West Coast sound , and even if you 're not , this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days .	1
In a Major way is E-40 's best album , a Bay Area classic . The Vallejo Boss Playa just blew up on this amazing album . Features the unmatchable beats by Mike Mosley & amp ; Sam Bostic , Funk Daddy and Studio Ton . The album is perfect from start to end and it 's got the two classic cuts : Sprinkle Me ( feat . Suga T ) and the one and only Dusted 'n ' Disgusted , which has one of the TIGHTEST beats I 've ever heard , combined with BREATHTAKING verses by the greatest rappers - SPICE 1 , 2PAC , MAC MALL AND 40 WATER ! The album also features 40 's long time partner B-Legit and also Mac Shawn , Levitti and Celly Cel . This album takes the Sick Wid It Mob sound to a whole new level and E-40 continues to develop his own unique style , inventing new slang and always comming with fresh delivery .	1
Umm ... What shall I say 'bout this one ? It 's pretty easy , if you like westcoast rap you gon ' love this one ! E-40 's best all around and probarly one of Bay Area 's finest , up there together with Mac Mall 's Illegal Business ? .E-40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many albums , he still has n't got the props he deserves.The whole Bay Area is painfully underated.Mac Mall , Spice 1 , E-40 and his Sick-Wid-It records click and Ray Luv , these are my favorites outta Bay Area.Buy anything by them and show love , 'cause it basically do n't get pretty much better than this type of Westcoast rap.One word for this record : Classic.I do n't even have to mention highlights 'cause they 're all great , but my favorite probarly is Dusten 'N ' Disgusted featuring 2Pac , Spice 1 and Mac Mall.Get this one , it will make you money worth , no doubt .	1
man , this is cd is FIRE , man fo reel . this is his best work in my opinion . u can pop this in and play it thru , E-Fo Day drops heat on this one . id give it 10 stars if i could . go buy this NOW , goddammit . the best songs are : ALL OF 'EM	1
E-40 is at his best on this album . He may rap about hustlin , sex , and violence like many of his peers , but the way he does it is inventive . He created much of the slang we use today . This album is laced with hard mobb beats ( `` Dusted and Disgusted '' ) , melodic G-Funk laden with whiny keyboard riffs ( `` Drank and Smoke '' ) , and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today `` crunk '' ( 1 Luv ) . He paired these neat beats with with his tongue twisting flow . Most of the songs on the album are classics ; the ones that are n't are still tight . Bump this funky materpiece from the yay while sittin ' sideways in a lac !	1
This is 40 Waters second best { just behind element of ... } .Intro { that 's one of the best intro 's i ever heard } , Spittin ' , Sprinkle Me { I ca n't celieve vibe did not add this classic tracc on there 50 greatest duets of all time } { smh } , Dusted 'n ' Disgusted,1Luv is crazy , Bootsee , H.I . Double L , Dey Ai n't No , Smoke & Drank , Sideways , The Bumble , & It 's All Bad ft his lil son .	1
E-40 , Forty Water , whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste , even though I heard his music years ago , it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his albums . I first heard him on Aint Hard To Find off 2Pac 's All Eyez On Me , and I was thinking who the f*ck is this guy ? His goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to , but after bumping Dusted & Disgusted for a long time I decided to pick up In A Major Way.I had to order this from Amazon as there are literally no copies of this album in England , you just ca n't get hold of stuff like this , and I was surprised by how great it was . E-40 has long been known as an innovator ( something hiphop is sorely lacking ) , both in terms of his unique flow , and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the years . This album according to most people is when he was at his peak in both , though I ca n't comment as this is the only album of his I own ( I do intend to buy more though ) . My favourite track is still Dusted & Disgusted ft Spice 1 , 2Pac & Mac Mall , which is a westcoast classic , but other classics include 1 Luv and the amazing Smoke N Drank . Pretty much every other track is tight , the only reason i do n't quite give it 5 stars is because of a couple of filler tracks ( Dey Aint No & Bootsee , which is terrible ) . Production is top notch throughout , some classic westcoast beats that really bump.Recommended to any hiphop fans , especially westcoast , if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever . He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do , but he does it creatively , if you ca n't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up , very good album 4.5 stars , another case for half stars at Amazon .	1
Slipped lipped , body snatchin ' , thugroovalishus , playa for playa , and ego trippy , E-40 's has been my favorite rapper since he and the Click came & quot ; Down 'N Dirty & quot ; in the 90 's . I like this one the best because my favorite & quot ; Fed- & quot ; is on it , but anyone of E-Dollah Dawg 's cuts are good from any of his or the Click 's CDs ...	1
Great clazzik s @ # t E-40 forty water iz killin em all in the rap world.I love this whole disc a must buy for any serious rap heads .	1
Every song on this album is solid as close to no flaws as possible for any record i have been a fan for years and its good to see that there all still shinin as a group and as solo artists . It would also be tight to see a new records from B-legit , Suga T. , The Mossie , Levitti , and the rest of valley joe giants.IF you like westcoast rap then you got ta have this to be a rap fan , and thats real .	1
Critics trashed this album when it came out . Too polished , overproduced , not like down and dirty ... ... ... blah blah blah.This is a great album that showcases their growth and success . Everybody really does a good job on this album . This second album has more great songs than their third Album & quot ; money and muscle , and better performances , and more mature than Down and Dirty . Definite satisfaction.Take the down and dirty album and add about million dollars worth of production value and you get this album . The group probably wo n't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember .	1
The Click have been under-rated and overlooked for years , and probably always will be . Despite that , they 've managed to put out better sh** than 90 % of rappers out there . `` Game Related '' is a must have for any west coast fan , and any rap fan in general should at least check it out . My personal fav tracks are `` Hurricane '' , `` Out My Body '' , `` We Do n't F*ck wit Dat '' , `` Scandalous '' , & `` Learn About It '' . Peace	1
I love there first album is I had to get this one . THis is just as good as that one . The music has more quality to it . THe underground sound is kinda missing but its still good . Boss baller is good , .actin bad and hurricane are stand out tracks . This should have done better cause it has that commercial quality . Bet or Mtv didnt play rap they do now in 1996 . But yeah get the album .	1
E-40 is the head of west coast sibling clan THE CLICK . Their 1995 release & quot ; Game Related & quot ; is a mix of west coast twang and funky productions. & quot ; Wolf Tickets & quot ; opens this set . A comical set about peeps talking trash but not being about their business . The drug slang hit & quot ; Hurricane & quot ; and the ZAPP sampled & quot ; Scandalous & quot ; were the hit singles and are definitely the catchy hits.E-40 and B-LEGIT work the drunken craze of the funky & quot ; Out my body & quot ; . B-LEGIT also rocked his solo joint & quot ; We dont f*ck wit ' dat & quot ; . Sister SUGA T. gets down and dirty with her call out & quot ; If i took your boyfriend & quot ; ( The much used PRINCE sample ) Other standouts are the gangsta story & quot ; Be about your paper & quot ; and & quot ; Hot ones echo thru the ghetto & quot ;	1
This album is reel good . E-40 , B-Legit , D-Shot , and Suga-T put doan some dope tunes and rhimes in dis 14 track album . I would say dat track 9 , ( Boss Baller ) , is da best track on here . Track 9 is D-Shot basically rappin ' by himself and da song is pretty damn dope . Get this album if ya like hardcore rap or any rappers from SickWidIt . If you wish to e-mail me my addy is yuckplace @ hotmail.com .	1
A few years after releasing the all time Bay Area classic album `` Down and Dirty '' , the Click ( E-40 with his brother D-Shot , sister Suga-T and longtime partner B-Legit ) drop their second LP . And it 's just amazing - taking the Sick-Wid-It Mob Style music to a whole new level , especially musically . And when you have such a talent on a group you do n't need any guest rappers ! E-40 , D-Shot , Suga T and B-Legit are all amazing and drop unforgettable appearences on each song , spittin ' nothing but pure game ! ... Everyone of this Vallejo , CA crew has got a unique voice , style and lyrics and the combination of those 4 is just leathal . To me it 's also one of the greatest albums that has ever come out the Bay Area . It 's got 15 songs , no intros or skits . Just 15 songs , each one of which is REALLY worth listening to . EACH ONE . No weak filler tracks on it . At the time this album was released ( around 95 ) Bay Area rap was at it 's peak - cats had major deals , and released top-quality records .	1
From the instant this album starts with props to KRS from just about every Old School rapper , DJ or figure you can think of , you know that this is going to be an album with distinct nods to the past . When you see who features on some of these tracks ( Fat Joe , Channel Live , Das EFX and Mad Lion ) , you know that the album 's going to look forward to the future.KRS is one of hip-hop 's elder statesmen , having made his mark as frontman for Boogie Down Productions ( & quot ; The Bridge Is Over & quot ; ) , with this album he registers two solo albums as well . As a result of his experience , he knows what he 's talking about - when he claims & quot ; Rappers R N Dainja & quot ; or & quot ; MCs Act Like They Do n't Know & quot ; he means it.Another feature of his vintage is that he comes from a time when MCs lived and died by the lyrics they recited , not by the catchiness of a hook or funk of a beat . Thus , he is able to preach his sociological messages while still making superb rhymes . If anyone doubts his sociological qualifications , he has done many lecture tours and ( & quot ; wrote over 1000 rhyme hooks/and sociological books/while you were worrying about your looks & quot ; ) .One slight downside to KRS-ONE 's style is that the abrasive nature of his voice can sometimes get irritating , it 's a good thing then that he has brought in rappers with distinctive styles and voices to balance his . This practice does have its downside though , & quot ; De Automatic & quot ; is one of the stronger tracks on the album but the outro has the only appearance of Fat Joe repeating the words & quot ; The south Bronx/The south south Bronx & quot ; , which seems to interrupt the flow a bit . The same is slightly less true for & quot ; Wannabemcees & quot ; where Mad Lion 's distinctive toasting style only turns up in the outro ( at least it is more grabbing than Fat Joe 's rap ) .The best tracks on the album would probably be & quot ; Wannabemcees & quot ; , & quot ; De Automatic & quot ; and & quot ; Hold & quot ; ( in which KRS tells a story with one of the most amazing rhyme schemes ever recorded ) . Honorable mention would go to & quot ; MCs Act Like They Do n't Know & quot ; where , over a DJ Premier beat , KRS does a version of Kurtis Blow 's intro to & quot ; The Breaks & quot ; ( & quot ; Clap your hands everybody if you 've got what it takes/Coz I 'm KRS and I 'm on the mike and Premier 's on the breaks & quot ; as opposed to & quot ; Clap your hands everybody if you 've got what it takes/Coz I 'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know that these are the breaks & quot ; ) .On the whole , KRS-ONE delivers another sterling performance , highlighted by amazing use of the mike and a great instinct to give the people what they want - straight up with a twist .	1
This is the teacher 's self-titled album contains more lessons , and upliftment for African-Americans . DJ Premier 's production on `` Rappaz R. N. Dainja '' and `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' was are great East Coast hip-hop feel displaying Krs ' lyricisim . `` Ah-Yeah '' displays his consciousness of scociety 's problems . As automatic as his flow on `` De Automatic '' featuring Fat Joe . `` ... stack some money for a video , I do n't have any . You 're looking at the last emcee with true talent ... '' he put it into perspective with `` Build Ya Skillz '' . This release is a presentation of plain hip-hop . Nothing commercial just `` R.E.A.L.I.T.Y . '' through the eyes of Bronx own Krs-One .	1
Hip Hop Vs. Rap was the origonal name of this album before Krs-One self titled his '95 album . This is one of those albums that shows why the east coast had dominated this rap game in the mid 90 's , even though during that year the west coast peaked with such banging album . Not to mention being in the game for such a long time , Kris was one of those emcees with his socially concious lyrics , who was ahead of his time , and would reach his peak with this album here.No matter what way or how he does it , he gets the job done . Talking about how the fake emcees are making albums , and he 's ready to get them on `` Rappaz R. N. Danja '' , an idea carried over from the song `` Outta Here '' from his previous albumReturn of the Boom Bap . He has major energy on dope tracks like `` Ah-Yeah '' and `` R.E.A.L.I.T.Y. '' . And there are tracks that explains why he is The Teacha of hip hop , on the song that questions religion `` The Truth '' . Even the guests bring their A game as well , such as Das Efx on `` Reperesent The Real Hip Hop '' , and Channel Live on `` Free Mumia '' ( Kris , I hope you 're not defending the slave record company ) . Other guests like Busta Rhymes and Fat Joe , do ad libs on the songs that they appear on . All throughout the album there are a few drops and shoutouts from artists and DJ 's from different radio stations.Even the production will keep you intuned . DJ Premier flies in the dope headbanger `` MC 's Act Like They Know '' , and `` Wannabeemceez '' . Showbiz and Diamond D , as well as others brings in come dope beats for this album here.Kris ' self titled album is great like I said . Each song here shows why he is one of the best in the game . Somehow he still manages to get his point across with his dope rhymes , not to mentioned backed by some great producers . If you have n't heard any other solo albums , also check outReturn of the Boom Bapas another hot album by Kris . Caution : Do n't Sleep . Peace.Lyrics : A+Production : AGuest Appearances : AMusical Vibes : ATop 5 Tracks:1 . MC 's Act Like They Know2 . Free Mumia ( featuring Channel Live ) 3 .

For his second solo album , KRS-One worked with a variety of younger hip-hop talents , perhaps in an attempt to resuscitate his street credibility and his commercial standing . Featuring appearances by Das EFX , Mad Lion , Fat Joe , and Channel Live , KRS-One is loaded with fresh talent of the first-rank and they help spark the Teacher into giving an inspired performance . The album also showcases a bit fuller production than Return of the Boom Bap , but that does n't mean he has sold it out -- it just means he 's continuing to experiment , which is one of the reasons KRS-One remained a vital artist nearly a decade after his first record .	1
The general opinion of this album seems to be that this is the best KRS has done so far . I would have to agree 100 % . The beats and rhymes have not been repeated by himself before or after this no matter how hard he may have tried . Lyrics-wise KRS1 has always come correct , rhyming with clarity , purity , intelligence and skill . Beats-wise he 's not that bad either and on this album he 's better than that . Dj Premier produces 3 of the best songs Ive ever heard KRS do with `` Rappaz R. N. Dainja '' , `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' and `` Wannabemceez '' . The beats are simply soul shaking to put it mildly . The rhymes are delivered with real drive on virtually all the joints apart from the more laid back ones like `` Ah-Yeah '' ( which I wasnt really feeling ) , `` Hold '' ( masterful wordplay ) , `` Squash All Beef '' and `` Health , Wealth , Self '' ( simply uplifting ) . I think tracks like `` R.E.A.L.I.T.Y . `` , `` Free Mumia '' , `` The Truth '' , `` Build Ya Skillz '' and `` Out For Fame '' are all amazing and only strengthen the album even more . Outstanding from start to finish . Apart from `` Ah-Yeah '' and `` De Automatic '' its perfect .	1
KRS-One ( self titled ) Released in the fall of 1995 , KRS-One 's self-titled LP ( technically his second solo effort ) hit stores at a time when hip-hop was still dominated by the East/West rivalry of factions like Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records . The 80 's era `` old school '' were waning from public view as the then-current rap stars were taking the spotlight -- not just with their records , but with their run-ins with the law . By the mid-90 's it was n't hip to be a ` teacher ' so much as it was to be a `` thug '' or `` gangsta '' .A vocal critic of the widespread trend of the `` video superstar '' , on `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' , KRS confronts this dilemma -- '' You could be a mack , a pimp , hustler or player , but make sure live you are a dope rhyme-sayer.. '' In other words , whatever your ` role ' is in rap , be sure to be an engaging performer . `` Ah , Yeah ! '' is a militant tribute to the Black Panthers ; `` Squash All Beef '' warns people to avoid the fatal consequences of holding grudges , `` Represent the Real Hip-Hop '' teams the artist with Das EFX.Other artists providing cameos either on or in-between recordings include Fat Joe , Busta Rhymes , and even MC Hammer . The production is largely handled by DJ Premier , Showbiz and Diamond D , along with the artist . A re-release of this album should include some of the remixes done , including the rare `` Rappaz R N Dainja/Chain Me to the Gear '' remix by Audioslave 's Tom Morello .	1
HA HA those were the days Krs one is the greatest battle MC of all time and if you listen to Hiphop Mainstream or underground and dont own one of his albums then you need to get with the program Hops Because whoever your favorite mc is whether it be Beanie seagall , Jay-Z , NAS , Talib Kweli , Capitol D , C-rayz Walz , Mos-DEF , or Akrobatic these MCs and thousands of other were directly influenced by Krs Ones Rhyme style . If that doesnt make him the greatest MC of all time I dont know what does . Lyricly Kris has always brought it but this album is a personal favorite on the lyrical tip . I consider this to be one of the greatest lyrical albums of all time . Beats are provided by DJ premier which is always a plus . Kris ' rhyme style worked really well with preimos production it would be really sweet if they could get back together and produce another album . If your looking for a truly dope lyrical and musical album it really doesnt get much better than this .	1
I have seen KRS-One on television for as long as I can remember , talking about hip hop and rapping in his videos . Also , when people speak of some of the best artists hip hop has ever seen , his name is often mentioned . I never took the time to listen to him with my undivided attention because I was so young when his music was popular . I finally listened to his self-titled album and was truly amazed at every aspect.There are no weak songs on this album . Here you will find real hip-hop . Real hip hop beats that will have you bobbing your head uncontrollably . Real hip hop lyrics about both positive and negative aspects of life . For example , in `` Squash All Beef '' , KRS is telling his listener the virtue in dealing with confrontations without violence . This is such a positive message because in hip-hop , there is a vortex of negative energy . Rap artists are constantly talking about who they have killed , who they want to kill , and who they should kill . It becomes sickening after awhile . To hear KRS say `` squash all beef '' was so refreshing . That song is very real and positive ; I commend him for his maturity . `` Out For Fame '' and `` Ah Yeah '' are good tracks , too . `` Ah Yeah '' is definitely controversial , but the lyrics are so powerful.I highly recommend this album to fans of hip-hop/rap music . I finally see the difference between a hip-hop album and a REAL hip-hop album . Because , in essence , hip-hop has more than one aspect . There has to be a certain energy in the artist 's voice , the beat has to sound a certain way , and the lyrics have to hit some in some way . KRS-One passed the REAL hip-hop test with flying colors . I will definitely be listening to much more of him . 4 shining shars.Mikeisha 's Top 51 . `` Wannabeemcez '' 2 . `` MCs Act Like They Do n't Know '' 3 . `` Wealth , Health , Self '' 4 . `` Ah Yeah '' 5 . `` Squash All Beef ''	1
I am a fan from the BDP days of KRS.His self titled release here was a bit slept on at the time.I think Boom Bap was just so cool and groundbreaking that when this came on people wanted more of that sound.Now that nearly 10 years have passed this album stands up very well.Especially with this Blinged out era its almost like crawling into a time capsule.The hottest joint Mc 's Act Like They Do n't Know could put any rhyme out there today on its back by itself.Thats not even the hardest cut on a emcee basis.Check out Build Ya Skills with Busta Rhymes , thats some whoop ass for ya.DJ Premier probably did some of his finest work on this album.KRS also blended his productions nicely too.If you are KRS fan this ca n't dissapoint .	1
How is this not 5 Stars ? ? ? There is way too many 4 Stars for this album but besides that Mr. KRS-One has delivered possibly the best hip hop CD of 1995 the singles were bangin `` Rappaz R N Danja '' starts the album off perfect with premier on the track you ca n't go wrong `` Ah Yeah '' has a killer drum beat and is one of my favorites from the album , MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' is the hardest track KRS ever did and definitely is Premiers top produced track `` Free mumia '' is dope as hell KRS produced this himself `` Hold '' is KRS describing a gun and what it means to hold one classic track `` The Truth '' a song about religion and who where the first human beings on earth which is we all know Adam and Eve `` Build ya skills '' a dope track featuring Busta Rhymes classic feature right here but enough talk go out and buy this album it truly is KRS-One best solo album post BDP era .	1
The most blazing cuts- & quot ; Rappaz R N Dainja & quot ; ( also try to find the rare remix by Rage Against the Machine 's Tom Morello ! ) ; & quot ; Ah , Yeah ! & quot ; ; & quot ; Squash All Beef & quot ; , & quot ; Represent the Real & quot ; , with Das EFX. & quot ; Out for Fame & quot ; gives props to graffiti artists . Dope production tactics by DJ Premier , Diamond D , and cameos by Fat Joe , Busta Rhymes , and a who 's who of hip-hop personalities ! One of 1995 's best albums , but still slept on ! ! Go buy this record !	1
this is a classic album , and it 's krs-one 's best , it includes the well known hit single mcs act like they do n't know , but my favorite song was represent the real hip hop , this is a must have album , it made '95 one of hip hop 's best years .	1
Krs one 's `` krs one '' , is one of my favorites albums by krs & also my favorite cd in my collection , because i feel this album is deeper then anything i 've heard in my life . Im a huge huge fan of krs works and his lirycs and his production is just amazing . Support Krs one ! He 's the truth !	1
One thing 's certain : If you 're trying to find out why KRS is considered by many to be one of the greatest emcees of all time , look no further than his self-titled 1995 album , `` KRS-One . '' The Blastmaster kicks scathing battle rhymes ( `` MCs Act Like They Do n't Know '' ) over hardcore , boombastic beats ( `` Rappers R N Danja '' ) and proves why he is THE definition of an emcee by FREESTYLING his verses on the album 's main criticism of fake emcees , `` Wannabemceez . '' Elsewhere KRS explores the frustrated ghetto mind ( `` Hold '' ) , encourages blacks to use compromise over killing ( `` Squash All Beef '' ) , questions orthodox Christianity ( `` The Truth '' ) , and puts a muzzle on rap critics ( `` Free Mumia '' ) . To understand the overall tone of the album , an excerpt from `` Rappers R N Danja '' : '' I remember thinkin ' back to '83 , no video no you had to be a real live emcee ! Now you youngins grow up buggin , any new jock your huggin , ' weak production , let me tell you somethin : Any emcee can battle for glory , but to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people 's another story . Act like you never saw me , cauz when it comes to lyrics , I 'm in a different category ! `` Cop this album today and enlighten yourself .	1
Celly Cel is a Bay Area vet who despite an impressive discography never quite received the acclaim of his buddies E-40 and Spice 1 . His 1995 sophomore effort `` Killa Kali '' is an excellent album of top-notch Bay Area hip hop . Celly 's not a lyrical visionary , but he 's an appealing rapper because he has style , a good flow and delivery , and a commanding presence on the mic . He raps about what he knows , and most of the time that consists of life in the Bay , hustling , and violence . He delivers good hooks and overall makes a nice performance . What sets `` Killa Kali '' apart from the sea of Bay Area albums from the mid-90s is the production . The music carries a distinctly Bay Area sound , with the choppy and bass-heavy beats and whiny instrumentals , but it is more melodic , smoother , and catchier than most of Celly 's brethren 's . The beats are funky and have a clean polish . `` Killa Kali '' is one of those albums that is so consistent , not much stands out . But that 's definitely a good thing ; you 'll be hard-pressed to find any flaws in this well-executed LP . Celly is a likable rapper and the beats are awesome , among the best from the left coast in the fine year of '95 . Guest appearances are strong , and unlike some of the weirder stuff that came from the Bay during this period , it has a wide appeal and rap fans of all types will enjoy the funky tracks.After the intro , Celly spits some menacing lyrics on the nice `` What U N ... z Thought , '' and trades off verses with E-40 on the Bay Area thumper `` 4 tha Scrilla . '' The single `` It 's Goin ' Down '' is just an awesome track , boasting a perfect laidback g-funk beat with woozy electronic elements and a great performance from Celly , profiling a day in the life . `` Ca n't Tell Me S ... '' has some hard-hitting production , and `` Tha Bullet '' is a surprising concept track , with verses coming from the perspective of a gunshot bullet . My favorite song is the Spice 1 collaboration `` Red Rum , '' because the two MCs display such great chemistry . The production shines on `` Skanlezz Azz B ... z '' and `` Remember Where You Came From , '' and the latter is a catchy track that supplies one of Celly 's better performances . The title track is a potent West Coast anthem on all fronts , while `` Playerizm '' is slow-rolling . The closer `` Funk Season '' is a highlight , with Celly showing a tight flow over a nice beat . `` Killa Kali '' is n't revolutionary by any means , but Celly puts together a great album with tight beats and good performance . This is one of the very best LPs to emerge from the Bay Area explosion in the mid-90s , standing tall with the best albums from E-40 , Spice 1 , and the Young Black Brotha roster . '95 saw so many classic LPs that ones like this often get overlooked , but the tracks on `` Killa Kali '' have the spirit that made '95 such a great year for hip hop . I highly recommend this album to West Coast fans .	1
THIZ ALBUM IZ DOPE ALL THA WAY THRU-DEFINETE CLASICC JUS LIKE ALL HIZ OTHERZ-RAW FLOWZ W/OG DELIVERY & SUPER CLEAN BEATZ-DONT SLEEP & MAKE SURE 2 PEEP ALL THAT OTHER SIC WIT IT RECORDS $ HIYIT	1
Back in early '96 , I remember watching the classic video & quot ; It 's Goin ' Down & quot ; on rap city while I was in college and I said to myself I 've got to go and find this CD and I did a couple of weeks later . This CD from top to bottom is just dope with & quot ; Round 2 Intro & quot ; . K-Lou does most of the production on this CD which makes this CD an instant g-funk classic . Some of the other tracks that just brings this CD to the forefront is & quot ; Killa Kali & quot ; & & quot ; Skanless A** B****** & quot ; , & & quot ; Funk Season & quot ; . So go ahead and order your copy if you love g-funk .	1
Celly Cel 's Killa Kali is a dope record . A lot of Hip Hop/Rap Fans Sleep On Dude , and I ca n't understand why ? If you love gangsta rap music and do n't have this , you 've been missin out on one of the best albums in the genre . A++	1
Dope west coast album , I 'd heard of it for a long time and finally found it and decided to give it a try and it turns out to be dope , definently a night album though , most of the beats are slow and real funky , it 's definently a west coast album , sick	1
This album is filled wit some tight lryics and beats . Celly Cel put down some pretty cool hardcore rap in dis album . It is worth checking out and if you are a SickWidIt Records fan then you will like dis one . Any questions you wish to ask me go ahead and ask me at yuckplace @ hotmail.com	1
If your looking for a funky ass west coast classic look no further . This is the only CD of Cell 's that I 've heard and take my word for it , every single track has a awesome beat and Celly Cell tears it up on the mic.This CD is a straight up mid-90s west coast classic.COP IT ! !	1
I first heard of Celly Cel on E-40 's In A Major Way . Then a certain music company ( who I 'm not at liberty to say their name ) had his album for sale so I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised . Celly Cel can flow and the production team behind him is serious . What U N****z Thought is the hard edged opener as Celly Cel drops some good rhymes over a hard beat . In Tha Bullet ( creative concept ) he talks about being a bullet and all the damage it causes . He has two songs with guest appearances 4 Tha Scrilla ( featuring E-40 and B-Legit ) and Redrum ( featuring Spice 1 ) both of which are standouts . He also drops you a gem on Remember Where You Came From as he tells the consequences of what happens when you forget where you came from . There is no fillers although I dont like the screwed up voice in the hook for Funk Season . Bottom Line : Celly Cel 's Killa Kali is his best album and is definetly a highlight underground album for 96 . Celly Cel can be added to the long list of underrated MCs from the west coast ( Yukmouth , C-Bo , Xzibit etc ) . Standout tracks : WHAT YOU N****Z THOUGHT , 4 THA SCRILLA , ITS GOIN DOWN , THA BULLET , REDRUM , SKANLEZZ AZZ B*****Z , KILA KALI and FUNK SEASON .	1
Celly Cel really does his thug thang on this album ! He throws in his complex , loud , and often fast flow over tight G-Funk beats . A standout track is `` What U N -- -- z Thought . '' The song is laced with some of the hardest beats and rhymes in gangsta rap . A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background . He sounds really angry and crazy on that song . `` It 's Goin Down '' is a lot slower . It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting : `` It 's goin down '' during the hook . Throughout the album , he shows the harder side of California life !	1
After establishing himself as a strong solo presense on12 Playthis album really does distance R.Kelly from any semblance of New Jack swing that remained on his earlier recordings . Much as with Mary J'sMy Lifethis album is part of a series of recordings that swing the genre of hip-hop/R & B ; into more of a fluid groove that showcases a mixture of modern touches as live instruments . As with the `` sermon '' on the intro this is an album where R.Kelly really began to involve himself in the age old soul music tradition of blending the spiritual with the secular-consistantly pulling a very Al Green style lyric tag throughout this album at the drop of a hat by pleading to jesus and pleading for romance all at the same time . During this era this comes as something of a surprise as often enough the two concepts seemed to play out more seperately than together . Overall , from song to song there 's a strong similarity to most of the cuts on this album . Except for some very shallow lyrics on `` You Remind Me Of Something '' this album largely focuses it 's attention on on midtempo songs with light hip-hop beats . It worked dynamite in the day and usually , aside from occasions where it worked better as a single the songs on this album all kind of flow together as one statement . Some songs such as the intricately textured `` Religious Love '' feature an interesting mix of percussion and modern beats wheras `` Trade In My Life '' really bought the pretty full on gospel out of the box completely . Of course , to me the strongest cuts on the album are the full blown disco-funk arrangements of `` ( You To Be ) Be Happy ) with Notorious B.I.G and that excellent `` Thank God It 's Friday '' -both of which showcase the type of sound that R would begin to explore to a far broader degree ( and with a huge creative leap ahead in his musical career ) in the albums to come . R Kelly is still not at the apex of his career with this album . There 's still a bit of ( mildly ) dated hip-hop productions here and there but when this album cooks it char broils and is an excellent , if quickly executed beginning to the second phase of R.Kelly 's musical career .	1
R. Kelly 's self titled third album and second solo release has everything the others have with more exploring of his boundaries and even spirituality as done on `` Intro - the Sermon '' , `` Heaven If You Hear Me '' , `` As I Look Into My Life '' and `` Trade In My Life '' . R. takes it to a club scene with `` Hump Bounce '' as he states `` ... everyday , every night humpin ' and bouncin ' is all I wan na do ... '' `` You Remind Me Of Something '' is a mid-tempo tune where he compares a woman to a jeep , his sound , his cars and his bank account . She must be something especially nice then . The mood changes to a bit more sexual atmosphere with the inviting `` Step In My Room '' and he makes offers to anything you want on `` Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby ... '' The classic love or anti-love song with 70 feels about creeping on `` Down Low ( Nobody Has To Know ) '' featuring Ronald & Ernie Isley . He then begs for forgiveness and wants his lover to come back with `` I Ca n't Sleep Baby ( If I ) '' . `` Thank God It 's Friday '' has the same feel of his later hit `` Step In The Name Of Love '' . To the rescue , he comes in with `` Love Is On The Way '' for another mid-tempo bass filled song . `` Religious Love '' is simple and have feelings of depths undiscovered for a single person as he prays for love . He slows the motion to almost still as the lights turn down low on `` Tempo Slow '' . The sixteen songs which were written and produced by R. Kelly seem never-ending and on the other hand it seems too short . But it will be kept on repeat .	1
This cd starts off with slow beats and features B.I.G and a couple others . Thats all there is to know . My favorite song is probably Thank God It 's Friday	1
Very few albums out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish . Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly 's other albums , the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God . God really must have inspired him , as it is far greater than his previous work ( although 12 Play is a classic ) .Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote ( & quot ; I Ca n't Sleep Baby ( If I ) is probably the best song on the album , followed closely by the mid tempo & quot ; Thank God It 's Friday & quot ; . The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here . It is a pity Kelly does n't use it anymore.If you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore elements of & quot ; Best of Both Worlds & quot ; , get this album as it will really open the door to what tis guy is trying to say .	1
i cant get enough of this CD . all the songs are STR8 . this CD is a musy buy .	1
This is the album that really made me take notice of `` Tha Rrah '' ! I gave it a 5 star rating because as a music lover , any album that grabs my attention & allows me to listen all the way through without skipping is classic in my book . This album just flows from song to song , no production flaws , no songs that jarred my sensabilities.There 's not a bad song on this disc but the standouts to me are : You Remind Me of Something - classic slow jam for the 90 's ( You To Be Happy ) w/ Notorious B.I.G . - great collaboDown Low - who can forget that epic videoI Ca n't Sleep Baby - love this song ! Trade in My Life - as powerful as `` I Believe I Can Fly ''	1

I did n't think R. could top 12 Play but he did . Although the begging stuff gets kinda worn out , only he could do it in so many ways ! ! ! And & quot ; Trade in My Life & quot ; is one of the best gospel songs I 've ever heard ! ! ! Keep it up ! ! !	1
i like these cd that he has in amazon we really like his singingand you can to like him	1
You could think that this was his first album based on the eponymous title of it , but it was his third album after `` Born Into the 90 's '' from 1992 together with Public Announcement , althought it sounded like a R. Kelly affair all the way , and then the sexual explicit `` 12 Play '' from 1993 . This album was released in 1995 and stands as one of his best albums to date , only `` 12 Play '' and `` R '' can measure with it . This is a quite easily accessible album since it does n't follow any trend or theme , no overwhelming sexual lyrics nor a overpretentious Step album either . It got a great mix of the best , some faster songs but many wonderful tearjerking ballads aswell , infact some of the greatest R. Kelly songs are actually found here . There is n't much filler either nor any annoying hip hop collaborations like we saw on latter albums , no , `` R Kelly '' stands strong on it 's own and as a whole this is a fantastic story of trade mark R. Kelly songs that fans would drool over.The album starts with `` Hump Bounce '' that actually , based on it 's name sound like it would have been on `` 12 play '' , it 's a sexy midtempo with lyrics both from a woman and a rapper . A very good song . `` Not Gon na Hold You '' is a semi-ballad that also feautures female vocals , `` You Reminds Me Of Something '' stands as one of his best ballads to date , songs like this made R. Kelly one of the most promising songwriters of the 90 's . `` Step Into My Room '' , yet another laidback sexy ballad . Perhaps also better for his previous album ? . `` Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby '' yet another laidback soulish ballad . `` ( You To Be ) Happy '' is midtempo soul . `` Down Low '' is one of my favorite R. Kelly songs , it 's a very poignant ballad feauturing Ron and Ernie Isley , the great video also which portraited R. Kelly in the middle of a fatal jelousy drama . `` I Ca n't Sleep '' follows the trend of slow jamz while `` Thank God It 's Friday '' is a excellent club song , even if it 's slick . `` Love Is One the Way '' is yet another good midtempo , `` Heaven '' is only a interlude but `` Religious Love '' shows some of his more faithful sides . `` Tempo Slow '' is one of the slower songs of this album , it 's dreamy and meditative . Next song called `` As I Look Into My Life '' is also more of a interlude but `` Trade My Love '' closes this album well , another midtempo that is . `` R.Kelly '' is one of his best albums , needless to say it captures you with it 's mix of slick and sexy ballads and midtempo 's and it does n't contain much filler either . If You 're new to R. Kelly start with this one or `` 12 Play '' . This album is more clean though . 5/5	1
I listened to this CD and I was amazed . This CD starts off fast , then at the end it is slow and calm . The last song is an inspirational song which sounds soooo good . Pick up this album because it is worth it .	1
I love R Kelly and all his material , and I love this album the best out of all I 've heard of his . I have almost all of his cd 's but out of all of those , and in fact out of all I own , I still listen to this cd real often . It 's the best . I love love love Down Low , Ca n't Sleep ( Baby ) and Thank God It 's Friday - they are the best cuts on here . He 's such a great talent , and so underrated . He 's soulful and a joy to listen to . Despite whatever goes on in his personal life , he remains one of my top favourite singers ever . Down Low is among my top 10 favourite songs of all times and I could listen to this cd over and over again , never get sick of it .	1
Who can make a CD better than Kells ? This is an oldie but as with all of them its a goodie ... ..	1
This cd is really good . As usual , R. Kelly is really talented writer and producer when it comes to music . No matter that this cd is ten years old , you can still listen to it over and over again . The best songs on here are `` you remind me of something '' , `` step into my room '' , `` baby , baby , baby , baby '' , and `` down low '' , which was a huge megahit when it came out and still is widely known for pinning the popular term to call any relationship that is the quiet , hush-hush , secretive sin of illicit sexual rompings ( not that this is a good thing because it is really not , but the song sounds so good ! ) I do have to disagree with his message in `` the sermon '' where he throws the criticisms back in the faces of all those who condemn him for this sexual and explicit nature . All of that `` even the statue of liberty wants to bump and grind '' was uncalled for and unnecessary , and it is exactly this reason why he has gotten into so much trouble with his little scandals and sexual escapes . Though I like his music , people are right in their analysis of him because , really , he is just too sexual and wanton in nature for which he makes no apologies . What he calls `` judgment '' is really the truth . Thus , the conclusion : Despite its lax morals and looseness , its just a really nice and well-produced cd .	1
This album in my opinion is R 's finest of all . Sadly 1995 's `` R. Kelly '' seems slept on ( Due to a lack of real hit singles ? ) , which is a damned shame as he never got as deep before or since . It is mature , beautifully orchestrated and he had now found his own vibe . `` Born Into The 90s '' and to a lesser extent `` 12 Play '' were soaked with the influence of Guy 's New Jack era material and although both ( especially the later ) had great chart friendly appeal , this album is his fully realised masterpiece.Operating within the framework of a gospel themed intro and closure , R. is on best behaviour and there is little of the shallow , thug posturings that on occasion have hurt his recent releases like `` R '' and `` TP-2.Com '' . There is a chilled , bumping flow throughout and this is no better exemplified than on probably my favourite R. Kelly track of all , `` Down Low '' . The chemistry between R and Ronald Isley ( Brother Ernie assisting on guitar ) is beautiful to behold . A true epic , laid back jam . `` Contagious '' the sequel ( On Isley Brothers ' `` Eternal '' album ) is equally excellent.Other highlights to be found include `` You Remind Me Of Something '' with it 's humourous metaphors and `` ( You To Be ) Be Happy '' which effortlessly works a Notorious BIG rap in . There 's the usual quality bedroom ballad `` Step In My Room '' , yet he ploughs a deeper grain with the exquisite `` I Ca n't Sleep Baby ( If I ) '' . `` Hump Bounce '' and `` Thank God It 's Friday '' are prime relaxed , head nodders.There 's not a weak moment to be found and the LP 's self titled moniker of `` R. Kelly '' surely comes from the work here being the ultimate personal statement of his artistic muse . Despite the relative inconsistency of subsequent efforts I 'm sure he can sleep well , rest assured that in this album he produced a true work of class no matter what the future holds ...	1
I truly dig this Album alot & more as time passes it just gets better with time.Between this Album,12play & Chocolatefactory/Loveland R.Kelly to me Has made 3 of the Most Important Albums since 1990.this Album Combines many elements that truly highlight R.Kelly as a Writer , Producer , arranger & His Vocals truly soar here.rocking it with Biggie on `` You to be Happy '' that Jam is my cut . `` thank god it 's friday '' is a Knockout Jam that truly gets me hyped on the weekends . `` Dow Low nobody has to now '' with the Great Ronald Isley is a Hall of Fame Song that still is tight . `` Religious Love '' works as well.this Soulful Genius is unstoppable when He allows His Musical Strengths to direct His Flow .	1
R kelly began in that 90 's generation era , which was my coming out so im kinda partial to the R ( present legal problems excluded ) he is an excellent song writer and producer , he has got that platinum touch no denying that . This Cd is one of his best .	1
Before the release of this album I thought the 12 Play was his best but this self-titled release blew that album out of the water . I love 12 Play and it would still gets spins till this day but this album got more spins from me than that album . This album came out at a time when R & B ; gave you quality artists with tight albums so you couldnt go wrong with R Kelly back then . You could go wrong with him now because he 's trying to hard to remain relevant by making songs for teenagers like that 's all his fanbase consists of . At any rate ... .You Remind Me Of Something was the summer jam and I refuse to let some corny cable channel that nobody watches and some lame ragazine that is the b*st*rd child of Rolling Stone magazine tell me different . R Kelly is at his best when he does the slow jams like Step In My Room , Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby , Religious Love and the fantastic I Cant Sleep . I love Tempo Slow . It has a unique concept where the tempo of the song changes after every chorus ( you would rarely find an artist that creative now and when one does come around stupid hoity-toity critics will knock them for being unconventional ) . The late Notorious Big makes his presence felt in ( You To Be ) Be Happy . Hump Bounce and Thank God Its Friday are dynamite party songs . Down Low feat The Isley Brothers is the beginning of the Mr Biggs/R Kelly saga . The album closes off with Trade In My Life . There are no bad songs to be found on here and that in itself is rare with 2000 R & B . ; R Kelly 's self-titled sophomore release is his best album point blank period . Its shows his range as an artist . It shows his talent at songwriting and it shows that he was a giant in the game that was here to stay . Pick it up if you are interested in what real R & B ; is supposed to sound like.Standouts : YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING , STEP IN MY ROOM , BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY , DOWN LOW , I CA N'T SLEEP BABY , RELIGIOUS LOVE , TEMPO SLOW and TRADE IN MY LIFE .	1
It 's rare that an artist releases a record with no title . As if to say , & quot ; Here I am , baby , this record is so good it does n't even NEED a title. & quot ; Now , in R. Kelly 's case , I would say that 's a little overestimation , but this is still a very good record.My main issue with R. Kelly is that he ca n't decide what he wants to be : his songs exude vibes of a sex maniac , a star-crossed lover , even a seriously religious devotee . And it 's that multiple-persona problem that makes his albums sound like a compilation more than an actual work . But be that as it may , the collection of songs on this album is more than ample.Kicking off with a Baptist-style sermon , we segue right into the complete opposite end of the spectrum with & quot ; Hump Bounce , & quot ; the world 's Fifteen-Millionth song to sample & quot ; The Big Payback. & quot ; However , R. rides the track to R & amp ; B/hip-hop perfection . & quot ; R. Kelly & quot ; is laced throughout with a distinctively more urban/hip-hop feel than his debut , & quot ; 12 Play , & quot ; and it works to his advantage much more so than on slightly clunky numbers like & quot ; 12 & quot ; 's & quot ; Back to the Hood of Things. & quot ; The best example of this from the new record is & quot ; You to Be ( Be Happy ) , & quot ; where R. pairs with the late Notorious B.I.G . who kicks a memorable verse indeed over a bouncy bass-laden track.There are , of course , the syrupy-sweet ballads like & quot ; Step In My Room & quot ; and & quot ; Love is On the Way , & quot ; as well as the more R-rated songs like & quot ; You Remind Me of Something , & quot ; where R. croons & quot ; You remind me of my Jeep/I wan na ride it/Something like my bank account/I wan na spend it. & quot ; Words fail me.All in all , this album works very well , and is a good addition to your R & amp ; B collection .	1
R. Kelly 's 1995 self titled album is a classic R & B album . It 's an album that all music fans must have . R.kelly is the best R & B artist ever . he released of 7 albums , each one I would give a 5 star rating , and who ever would n't , is crazy . But this is his album I would consider his best album . It has 16 of his greatest tracks ever , including his classic hit `` Down Low '' and other great songs like `` Thank God It 's Friday '' and `` Hump Bounce '' Cop this album , you ca n't have a music collection without it .	1
One of my favorite albums by R. This is when we had to realize , `` this brother is talented ! ! ! ! '' This album was good because he had some of his love songs on it , then the songs to make you groove , and threw in some spirtual songs to round it off . There is something for everyone on this CD.My favorite cuts on this CD:2 . Hump Bounce - nice litte groove6 . Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby7 . You to be Happy8 . Down Low - the relationship between he and Isley was born9 . I ca n't sleep baby14.Temp Slow16 . Trade in My life - he was testifying on this song ! ! ! The whole album is good , but the songs I listed are the songs I play the most .	1
12 Play was the first . Actually , this joint is a lot more musical and thematically well rounded than it 's predecessor.Classic Joints : Hump BounceNot Gon na Hold OnYou Remind Me Of SomethingStep In My RoomBaby , Baby , Baby , Baby ( You To Be ) Be HappyDown Low ( Nobody Has To Know ) I Ca n't Sleep Baby ( If I ) Thank God It 's FridayLove Is On The WayTempo SlowAs I Look Into My LifeTrade In My Life	1
After releasing his best album of his career 12 Play.. R.Kelly drop another incredible effort in 95.. This CD was kind of a departure from the sexual overtones of 12 Play.. The material here concentrated more on love and romance and spirtually.. However there are a couple of tracks here that finds Mr. Kelly going back to the formula that work for him on 12 Play on such tracks as You Remind Me Of Something and Tempo Slow these two songs could have easily been on 12 Play.. The best moments on this CD is when it concentrates on love that evident on such tracks Religious Love , If I , Baby , Baby , Baby , Baby these songs Mr. Kelly sings with such heart and conviction.. Other note worthy selections Be Happy ( You To Be ) , Step In To My Room , Thank God It 's Friday , a great effort from one the best in r & amp ; b today.. If you missed out on this the first time.. Do yourself a favor pick it up.. You dont know what you 're missing	1
Mystikal set up shop with his unorthodox style and flow on this groundbreaking debut . In 1995 Mystikals style was unlike any other in the rap game . His cadence , use of swift tongue twisting flow , voice variations etc etc etc . made him an instant superstar . His first hit , Here I Go , was THE hardest song when it dropped . I do n't care what you say , That song is probably one of THE Hardest songs , if not the Hardest song , to ever come out of the south . This is a real battle track dedicated to who ever wanted to test.With lines like : `` You wan na battle bring a body bag , I 'm gon na need it to carry yo STUPID A $ $ '' , ` Ill [ mess ] you up with the quickness ! `` , ` you can bring yo whole posse punk I still wont lose , Ill stomp your whole staff , must want a bloodbath ! `` , '' you wan na fight [ punk ] put em up , how that sound ? Come get knocked down ! `` This is just a non-stop lyrical assault delivered with unparalleled aggressiveness and poise . Definitely a classic track.Just because that song is so great does n't mean the rest of the album is weak . Mystikal drops some unforgettable quotables and choruses on this album . His technique is that straight fire . Delivering confident lines like `` I know yall [ people ] ca n't [ mess ] with me because I ca n't [ mess ] with my damn self ! '' and `` The only way to keep my Mfing name out your Mfing mouth is to keep yo Mfing mouth shut ! `` , Mystikal could n't possibly be stopped.Every single song on here is the joint but my favorites include Yall Aint Ready Yet , Mr . Hood Critic , Not That Nicca remix , I 'm , Here I Go , and Beware . The beats are off the chain and perfectly compliment Mystikals style . Overall you should make every effort to hear this album . It is definitely a classic album that is nearly untouchable . This is a diamond in the rough . EXTREMELY recommended .	1
This album is awesome ! The best songs are `` Ya 'll Ai n't Ready Yet '' , `` Beware '' , `` Mr . Hood Critic '' , `` I 'm '' , `` Out That Boot Camp Clicc '' , `` Here I Go '' & `` Ya 'll Ai n't Ready Yet ( Remix ) '' . This album is definately worth getting .	1
Before Mystikal became mundane he was putting out southern rap classics like this album . When you listen to Y'all Aint Ready Yet and Here I Go you can tell that Mystikal put effort into his raps and wasnt going through the motions like he does now . Out That Boot Camp Clicc remains as one of my favorite tracks from Mystikal . As for flaws , there are none . This album was Mystikal at his best . I really think he messed up when he decided to go commercial and put out lackluster material ( four albums later ) . Bottom Line : Mind Of Mystikal is one of the best releases in 1995 and is Mystikal 's best album . The production was cool and Mystikal was hungry as hell back then . Standout Tracks : YALL AINT READY YET ( original and remix ) , MURDERER , BEWARE , I 'M , HERE I GO , OUT THAT BOOT CAMP CLICC , MIND OF MYSTIKAL , NOT THAT N**** , NEVER GONE BOUNCE ( The Dream ) .	1
Mystikal is definitely at his best on this album nowadays Kal ai n't all that and of course with his rape charges i guess he put out the greatest hits to get some kind of an appeal goin ( haha ) yea thats kinda wrong but hey its the truth i guess but this album along with `` Unpredictable '' and `` Ghetto Fabulous '' are his absolute best works I have all 3 and still bump every one of them definitely worth your money Pick it up .	1
1995 , New Orleans ' Mystikal gets his chance to shine . This album is a far cry from his `` Shake Ya A -- '' joint from 2000 or Tarantula album from 2001 ( which I have , and is a fun and funny commercial album ) ; this album is definitely gangsta and has an underground feel to it . Mystikal has a unique and original flow and at times , gives off an angry vibe . I do not know much about his rape charges from a few years ago , and some may let that color their opinions about him ( people make mistakes ) , but that can not take away from the quality of this album since the two have nathan to do with each other . Beats are simply fantastic southern fried funk and crunk . `` Precise '' Edwards produces these phat beats . `` Y'all Ai n't Ready Yet '' has a dope N'Awlins jazzy , deep bass beat . He shuts down marks with funny punchlines and has a humorous bragadoccio . `` Murderer '' is whiny and rattly crunk-meets-G-Funk , and is lyrically menacing . He is angry about his sister , Michele Tyler being killed and wants revenge . The hook is angry with him moaning `` Cops murder n -- -- z at night . '' `` Mr . Hood Critic '' is melodic G-Funk with Mystikal calling out haters and how he wo n't let them get him down . The beat is relaxed and sweet , while Mystikal spits hard and fast . Mystikal also goes hard on the crunk inflected `` Not That N -- -a . '' I like the scratches on `` I 'M '' and the fast adrenaline rush paced beat , another crunk banger . See , the crunk from this period was different than now ; now , it is over commercialized , but stuff like this is fun and exciting . I am relatively new to the sub-genre . I used to only look at as club mainstream crap like it often is now ( not always though- think new 3-6 or UGK ) . Mystikal flows over the beats with ease . He can rap fast over the slower beats as effective as he can over the fast ones . This album establishes him as a force in the rap game . I never heard Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous off of No Limit/Jive , but I hear they are good too . This is a must-have classic .	1
People know Mystikal can rap , and that 's something that makes LET 'S GET READY and TARANTULA tight , but people forget before he was & quot ; bouncin ' back & quot ; and makin ' chicks & quot ; shake it fast & quot ; , Mystikal was tellin ' people they & quot ; ai n't ready yet & quot ; .MIND OF MYSTIKAL made people notice he was n't a come-n-go rapper , which he prove a lot through this c.d.Every track is tight ( in some cases lyrically and comically ) .If you heard this c.d , you know it 's tight.If not , then you missin ' out .	1
This is a personal classic of mine ... .The album dropped almost 9 years ago , I cant believe its been that long ! ! ! Overall , its one of the best hip hop albums ever produced ... Bun B and Pimp C rip the beats apart ... .Classic material throuout ... IF ya have n't come across this album , pick it up now -- -you 'll love it	1
A great album by one of the pioneer rap groups to make it big out of the South ! Much love UGK ! One love Bun B ! RIP Pimp C ! ! !	1
ONE DAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE FROM UGK . I HAD TO REPLACE THIS CD IN MY COLLECTION .	1
Port Arthur , Texas ' own Pimp C and Bun B return for the third time with Ridin ' Dirty . Underground Kingz start the album off with a touching reality song about life on `` One Day '' featuring 3-2 over a soulful southern instrumental . Next on `` Murder '' a more up-tempo track with a continuous loop as the duo each take on a verse . For a classic old school feel , `` Pinky Ring '' has a funk sample as Pimp C sings the hook . The southern accents are apparent , but on `` Diamonds & Wood '' it contains a DJ Screw sample for the chorus . On a late night tip `` 3 In The Mornin ' '' is a tale of being out in the streets during the wee hours of the day . `` F*** My Car '' is about how women choose by what type of car they drive . They take it back to the streets with `` That 's Why I Carry '' featuring N.O . Joe on the reasons why they carry guns . UGK reach for higher grounds and spiritual guidance on `` Hi-Life '' . For another aspect that 's still non-mainstream , but a club swinging tune `` Good Stuff '' will have listeners bouncing and nodding their heads to this . Laid back sounds to end the LP off with the title track for clean and clear production . `` Outro '' is a shout out track by Pimp C over another laid back track to complete the mood and overall fell of Ridin ' Dirty . Seven of the thirteen tracks were produced by underrated UGK 's own Pimp C. Underground Kingz took us for a ride with good instrumentation , lyrics and presentation for southern hip-hop / rap .	1
Yesterday was a sad day for rap/hip-hop , as officials found Chad `` Pimp C '' Butler , 1/2 of the group U.G.K. , dead in his hotel room in Los Angeles . It 's a shame that such a talented artist who helped elevate southern rap died at a young age ( he was 33 ) . In memory of him , I decided to spin their third album on Jive Records `` Ridin ' Dirty '' . An album full of funky , laid back production and some great wordplay by both Bun B and Pimp C , just how I like it . Hearing this album , there are songs on here that reflect on life such as `` One Day '' ( hearing the hook on that song is so depressing ) , as well as `` Hi-Life '' , a song about the duo getting their life straight . The former song features Rap-A-Lot member Tre-Deuce ( Mr. 3-2 ) , and he also appears on `` Touched '' . Another standout would be `` Diamonds & Wood '' has an excellent chopped & screwed sample for a hook that makes the song impressive . Other great songs on here are `` F My Car '' as well as the mello funky bass track `` Ridin ' Dirty '' . I would say that the latter is my favorite song on this LP because the song is so laid back . The album ends with the outro , as Pimp C giving shoutouts.Overall , this album is a southern classic . This is a huge improvement over their previous albumSuper Tight ... . I 'm glad I picked this up a while ago , because this album dropped in 1996 , and it still sounds fresh today . The production on here is excellent , comming close to such funky albums asGet in Where You Fit Inor along those lines . Most of the songs on here clock in at over five minutes , so there is plenty of funk for a listener to digest . To tell you the truth , I also believe this album was slept on , and should have made UGK a household name . This is one I recommend everyone , especially fans of southern rap , to check this out . This album is not too expensive as of now , so that gives you a reason to give it a listen . It 's one of those albums you can just pop in , roll one up ( if you smoke ) , and just ride to . Trust me , you 're going to feel this one , if you know how southern rap is supposed to sound like . It 's sad now that the Pimp is gone , because southern rap will never be the same . Rest In Peace Pimp C.Peace & Much LoveLyrics : AProduction : A+Guest Appearances : AMusical Vibes : A+Top 5 Tracks:1 . Ridin Dirty2 . Diamonds & Wood3 . One Day ( featuring Tre-Deuce ) 4 .

U.G.K . 's 1996 album `` Ridin ' Dirty '' is a great showcase of Texas hip hop that would prove very influential . Rappers Pimp C and Bun B were already two albums deep when they dropped this one , and in my opinion it 's the best album they 've ever released . `` Ridin ' Dirty '' is an album that 's centered around simple yet very appealing production . The laidback grooves are bass-heavy and funky , but without the synths , horns , and extra instrumentation you might see on a g-funk album of this era . They 're rolling beats meant for top-down cruising and chilling , and nine of the album 's thirteen tracks are five minutes or longer . Most songs are pretty hooky , and the choruses are either rapped or delivered by a female singer , this can add or take away from the given song on `` Ridin ' Dirty . '' Former Rap-A-Lot in-house producer N.O . Joe is very involved here , and he 's one of the South 's finest producers ever . I do n't think anyone would ever call Pimp C and Bun B lyrical geniuses , but for the most part what they lack in pure lyricism they make up for in style and character . Their tales of crime , violence , and women or their talk of cars and materialism are not out of the ordinary for a gangsta rap record at all . However , they both have very distinctive deliveries and unique drawls and accents that could not be mistaken for anyone but Texas natives . They have good flows and chemistry , working very well together . `` Ridin ' Dirty '' has a few truly classic cuts , and the rest of the songs are pretty good , there 's only a very few that I do n't really like , so it 's actually a pretty consistent work . I do n't believe it 's a classic on the level of some of Scarface or Geto Boys ' work , but it 's one of the finest albums to come from the hot Houston scene of the mid-90s . I highly recommend `` Ridin ' Dirty '' to fans of southern or even west coast rap , it 's a great album for the car and the summertime and it 's very entertaining.After the intro comes one of my two favorite songs on the album , `` One Day . '' Using a classic Isley Brothers sample and the album 's greatest rolling , bass-heavy beat , Pimp C and Bun B deliver some of their best rhymes in a laidback manner . The depressing subject matter and perfect production make this song a true southern classic . `` Murder '' is tough and upbeat but still has the heavy riding quality of the slower songs on this album . `` Pinky Ring '' is fast and funky , it 's not my favorite because the flossy lyrics do n't really go anywhere and I do n't like the hook . `` Diamonds and Wood '' is a showcase of the excellent slow and funky production at its best , it 's great to just let it roll for over five minutes . `` 3 in the Mornin ' '' comes next , a solid track but not one of the best , the production is simple and the hook is n't great . The 3-2 collaboration `` Touched '' is very good , it 's got some mid-tempo , catchy funk to make your head nod , and this is the song with the infamous `` Now once upon a time not too long ago , a n ... a like myself had to strong-arm a h.. '' verse . `` F ... My Car '' is about deceptive women , some basic gangsta rap . The N.O . Joe aided `` That 's Why I Carry '' is nice , and I also like `` Hi-Life , '' a profile of the crime-ridden life of a successful hustler . The nice but not too memorable `` Good Stuff '' comes before the absolutely classic title track . I totally love this song , it 's one of the most laidback , chilled-out rap songs ever . The production is just awesome , and the lyrics and hook do it perfect justice . The outro is almost ten minutes long and not worth listening to more than once even though it has a nice beat , because it 's just spoken shout-outs.In my opinion , `` Ridin ' Dirty '' is the best album U.G.K . ever put together , and it 's a really fun listen . It 's not perfect by any means , but it 's certainly worth owning for any hip hop fan . The deep grooves , rough styles , and southern drawls will have most listeners coming back for more I 'm sure . If you like this album , I might also recommend U.G.K . 's first two albumsToo Hard to SwallowandSuper Tight ... , as well as Scarface'sThe Diaryand E.S.G . 'sSailin ' da South .	1
Exactly 14 years on this day records stores across the country put a CD on the shelf that changed and set the tone for hip hop and music in general if you ask me . Ridin ' Dirty was that album . Years previous before this album dropped , I argued that The Chronic was the best album front to back until this one dropped . Not to take anything from The Chronic , but this one split it 's fair share of speakers . Pimp C himself said something to the effect that he wanted to make an album on that level and be in the zone Dr. Dre was in.I can damn near rap to this whole cd but the tracks that stand out the most to me is the following : MurderDiamonds & Wood3 in the Mornin'TouchedThat 's Why I CarryHi LifeOutroSo what I plan on doing is playing this one off and on throughout this weekend as I ride through this city called Houston and pay homage to 2 of my favorite rappers ; Pimp C ( RIP ) and Bun B .	1
I 'm unsure if The Source reviewed this album back in '96 , but if they did , I 'm sure the reviewer ( s ) gave it a rating which just did n't do it justice ( they rarely do unless it 's something bubblin from the east ) . I grew up on U.G.K . but this album came out around the time when I was really beginning to appreciate the culture of hip hop and rap , so I kind of `` came of age '' on this one ... and still , 9 years later , `` Ridin Dirty '' is still in my TOP PICKS of best , classic albums of our generation , or any period.Listening to the introspective , sometimes too real lyrics from the minds of Bun B and Pimp C will do a mind job on you -- these brothers have been through some stuff . Topics that get touched are dealing in the streets , scandalous women , zoning out on how the human experience can be cut short , shiest family members , being afraid to sleep because of the streets , and how the high slice of American pie is basically unattainable for `` particular individuals . '' At times , these cats get so deep , you ca n't help but think that their venting on this album is a mental mind release , and almost a silent plea for help , and if not help , at least , silently begging the listener to just lend them an ear so you can understand what goes on in their average day . This is TRILL MUSIC.These brothers are talented , especially the incredible Pimp C who handled a little more than half of the slick production on the album . Bun B 's insance breath control , sharp words , and often witty lyricism remains unmatched in the game , even by wordy east coast emcees - Bun B is still holdin . It 's a screaming shame that Pimp C was locked up recently ... check out their back catalog , as well as the immensely underrated and slept-on branch off group MDDL FNGZ ( some homeboys of Bun 's from Houston ) . PEACE ! !	1
UGK 's third album is the album when they came with it lyrically . Their other albums were built around thumping grooves and samples with playalistic rhymes about life . While they still rap about their lives , now they are RIPPING songs to shreds . Bun B comes into his own on this album and proves why his name is mentioned among the most slept on mc 's ever to grace a mic . The production as always is excellent and the samples are still going on on this album . And if there was ever a song to pop that collar to , it would have to be `` Pinky Ring '' , that song is for the playas around the way . The album 's title `` Ridin Dirty '' does the album justice as it is perfect for your car while you are just cruising around . `` Diamonds & Wood '' is just playalistic cruising with one hand on the wheel seat back in that gangsta lean ... just chillin and ridin . I would compare this album to Outkast 's first album `` SPCM '' , every joint is borderline classic if not a classic . `` 3 In the Mornin '' , `` One Day '' , `` F ... My Car '' , the title track , and `` Hi Life '' are all bumping tracks . Any true hip hop fan should have at least heard this album and more likely than not own it somehow someway . Dirty South Masterpiece . Five stars easily .	1
This album ranks up there with Nas 's Illmatic , Jay-Z 's Reasonable Doubt , Dr. Dre 's Chronic , and the first three A Tribe Called Quest Albums . Ridin ' Dirty is so smooth and it still bangs in my ride and this album is 7 years old . The best songs are `` One Day , '' `` Murder , '' `` Pinky Ring , '' `` Diamonds & Wood , '' and my personal favorite along with track 5 is `` Hi-Life '' because that song is so real . These are no sugarcoated , powder puff rappers that you hear on the radio . UGK is too real . Get UGK 's entire collection because they never put out a wack album . Even their `` Side Hustles '' album which is more like a guest appearances greatest hits is their worst album and that 's bangin ' .	1
The best group of the south puts out one of the best albums I ever heard ( I have over 700 ) for their 3rd group effort . Rightfully earning the name Underground Kingz on this one . 2 years after their 4.5 star `` Super Tight '' the boyz from Port Arthur come out Strong . Only 11 songs and nowhere near a weak spot on the album ( except possibly the skits ) , 4 are classics , 2 are almost classics , and the other 5 are good or great songs . Production is great as well . Pimp C does 5 songs , N.O . Joe does 4 and Sergio does 2 . Guests rap on 2 songs , and do the hooks on a few , so you get alot of Pimp C and Bun B. a definite classic that everyone should own , one of the best rap albums ever , period ! # 2 - 8 ( f/ 3-2 ) # 3 - 10 ( CLASSIC w/ great beat and some great hard verses ) # 4 - 9.5 ( another great beat ) # 5 - 8.5 # 6 - 10 ( CLASSIC w/ great beat -- f/ Big Smokin Mitch ) # 7 - 10 ( Another CLASSIC -- great beat -- - f/ 3-2 ) # 8 - 8 # 9 - 10 ( CLASSIC w/ great beat -- f/ N.O .

Ridin ' Dirty is most def . some of Pimp C & Bun B 's best . Great Southern Fried Funk with a hard gangsta lean . These guys pioneered southern hip hop , this is the real deal . If ya like some fresh , country flava with your beats..cop this	1
These boys do it right ! I have never had a rap album that has been this good for this long . I can listen to this album all the way through . Its amazing that they made this album in the early 90s and how it still remains ground breaking . MY ALL TIME FAVORITE RAP ALBUM EVER ! ! !	1
This is one of those CD 's that you can just let play because every song is good . Two of the best rappers in the south and one of the best cds . BUY IT	1
Classic cd , represents the south good , with songs like one day , murder , Hi life and ridin dirty makes this cd good for the collection . They even give dj screw props in a song . Better cd then dirty money , with pimp c 's smooth flows and bun b 's lyrics makes this cd a keeper.Free Pimp C	1
great cd my favorite from ugk . rip pimp c this cd looks better then the original i used to own .	1
Long before Chamillionaire was `` Ridin ' Dirty '' ( which was questionably changed to simply `` Ridin ' '' when it made radio waves ) on the charts , the Underground Kingz were ridin ' dirtier than anyone else in the game ; and to this day , this is still one of the grimiest records to come from the Dirty South . This is arguably UGK 's greatest album ( although Dirty Money is also a classic album ) , and was quite a few years before UGK were first exposed to the mainstream with Hova 's `` Big Pimpin ' . `` Some people new to the game probably think that Bun B , who makes a guest appearance on seemingly every Southern rapper 's album , is some new cat who 's trying to make waves in the underground . While I can see why they 'd think this ( Bun B is always hungry when he raps , leading one to believe he 's trying to make an impact on the industry - despite the fact he already has made a significant one ) , Bun B has been in the biz for well over a decade , alongside his partner in rhyme ( although , 'in crime ' maybe more appropriate for Pimp C than it is for most ) , Pimp C. Together , they 're the Underground Kingz , who identify themselves by the acronym of UGK . When they first came into the game , the South was obscure ; now that it 's blown up ( especially their native land of Texas ) , one would think that UGK would get better publicity . Unfortunately the Kingz ' publicity still does n't compare to their skills , and only true heads have been able to check out their undeniably dope music.Hailing from Port Author , they may not be Houstonians , but they still possess the love of flossin ' , and grindin ' , as well as slow hypnotic beats , and equally entrancing flows . On Ridin ' Dirty , UGK provide one of the most revered music to ever come from the South ; and for good reason . While one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter ( whips , drips , chips , tips , and tricks ) , they deliver their raps with so much finesse , and style that you ca n't help but overlook these issues . No matter how much these things are rapped about , UGK always provide an interesting take on them , complete with captivating rhymes , and superb flows . Their production ? Just as somber , yet hypnotic as their flows.Highlights ? I 'd say this album has gems , but in all honesty , it 's a complete gold mine . Every single track on this album is a five-star cut , and even the outro has a dope enough beat to warrant it that label , despite the fact it 's all shout-outs . Whether it 's the smoothed out , Isley-sampled `` One Day , '' the gritty `` Murder , '' the Southern anthem `` Diamonds & Wood , '' or the impressive showing of wordplay on `` Touched '' ( which Jay-Z lifted a verse from on `` 99 Problems '' ) , this album has something for every hip-hop head . If you 're a fan of Southern rap , then you need this album ; if you 're a detractor of Southern rap , you also need to this album to show you just how great it is . If you 're a head who is n't prejudices to coasts or regions , this album will have constant rotation , and you too will be able to appreciate the dopeness that is UGK .	1
... these boys done f @ & amp ; ked around and got a triple-double with this ! the production on here is rich and deep ... you can play this on your granmama 's ol ' clock radio and its gon na make you sit up and lissen ! it 's true , tho , they aint sayin a whole lot ... references to drugs and sex are integrated into damn near every verse ! but they are so skilled in creating lyrical landscapes and the production is so tight that true hip hop fans wont complain too much ... but if you want insight and meaning then check out mos def , talib , outkast or any of the old school recordings that are still out there . these boys only wan na keep it crunk .	1
Im from Baltimore . Some rather most do n't really listen to the southern stuff . Maybe Outkast or stuff like that ( commercial ) . But I do n't care where your from what you like or do n't like . You have to love this CD . I never took this out of the car you know how some cds make it back to the cd book , shelf or garbage , this never since I bought it in 2000 ( I feel bad for sleeping on it that long ) has ever came out of any of the rides . Through all of the flights it flew with me . If you cant feel this CD ridin in the night around 3 in the mornin I ca n't help you . This CD sets the mood for any on road situation . Whether you drinkin , smokin got a little shorty in ride witcha or you doing something you dont have any damn business doing or you just ridin dirty by your damn self just zoning out . It gets no better down south and or north when your rolling then Ridin Dirty .	1

Comin out of Texas , UGK 's third full-length Jive album `` Ridin ' Dirty '' is contradictious , because the rhymes are dirty , but the beats are clean as hell ! ! The album is bumpin ' from start to finish . The production is some of the best I have ever heard from any region , south , north , west , east , whatever . Production is held by Pimp C , 3-2 , N.O . Joe , and Sergio . Beats are heavy Southern G-Crunk and deep-fried funk , with some smoother joints . The lyricism is awesome . I love the way these two flow and complement each other . `` One Day , '' produced by 3-2 , is a deeper song about the unpredictable ways of life , and how some heads are really trippin ' over a gorgeous , faster , twangy Isley sampled beat . `` Murder '' is a crazy and awesome crunk type joint with heated flows ; check the bass on this one . `` Hi-Life '' is smoother , slow rollin ' G-Funk dropping street sociology about the drug trade cycle , a classic ! A cool street jam is `` That 's Why I Carry '' over a heavy N.O . Joe ( he also raps the hook ) ; this one explains why they stay strapped . `` Good Stuff '' is a danceable , twangy sex joint . `` Pinky Ring '' is a dope pimpin ' joint with deep twang ; just listen to those guitar riffs , a nice joint to roll in the cady with the fuzzy dice hangin ' off the mirror ! You can hear the DJ Screw influence in `` Diamonds And Wood , '' beat by Pimp C , a slower crunkish joint , an awesome rider anthem for flossin ' your whip . 3 In The Mornin ' is perfect for the late night cruise ; the beat is relaxed G-Funk influenced , but with less melody . This has to be their best album . It just has an awesome vibe to it , and is one of my favorite albums in my collection , and the album is a pinnacle and a standard setter for southern rap ! This is my first UGK album , and it solidified me as afan of theirs .	1
Positives : A really laid back album that 'll keep you in a relaxed mood . Both members of Underground Kings have really distinct voices and tight Southern accents . An all around nice album to bump when you just want to sit back and chill.Negatives : Nothing here for those who want inventive or & quot ; meaningful & quot ; topics in their rap . This is n't exactly Dead Prez or Common . These guys do n't have the lyrical skills of someone like Pac , Eminem , or Canibus .	1
This album in my opinion is a definate classic . Alot of rappers today that are from the South really got influenced by this one . You can tell by all the samples they use in their songs and some of the song titles , liek Chamillionaire 's `` Ridin ' Dirty '' for example . Bun B and Pimp C 's best album also . IF you like ol ' skool gangsta rap or southern rap , this is a MUST BUY ! TOP TRACKS : One DayMurderPinky RingDiamonds & WoodHi Life	1
Back in 1995 , when I was in 7th grade , I saw these guys perform in my middle school lunch room before anyone knew who they were . They had those little pre-teen girls soaking wet . The blond haired kid hit piercingly high notes . I was completely baffled by this as I sat back and ate my cream corn and mini corn dogs . So I bought the cassette tape . Then the ladies were all talking to me . They were like , `` Hey Chad , can I listen to the B-Boys on your headphones ? '' And I was like `` Ah yeah baby , come over here and sit on my lap , and we can listen to the sweat sounds of the B-Boys together . '' He he he he he . Backstreet 's back , alright !	1
Terrific pop CD has some of the best songs of the late-nineties on it . & quot ; As Long As You Love Me , & quot ; and & quot ; Quit Playing Games With My Heart & quot ; were smash hits and are still favorites on soft rock stations all over USA . Now , there is a lot of controversy over if Backstreet or 'N Sync ( that other group ) are better . I like both , but Backstreet Boys always will be my favorites . They 're the kings of ballads and have a couple great up-beat songs ( mostly on this one . ) 'N Sync are the more hip-hoppy group if you like that stuff . Their first CD was great and I thought the second that everyone is fussing over is horrible . There 's only about two good songs on it . So , I definately say to get this ( the Backstreet Boys debut ) , and their second release Millenium . If you like these , you 'll probably like 'N Sync 's first CD too . You wo n't be disappointed with any of these three .	1
Loved this CD , when I was 12 . When it 1st came out . I 've been a huge bsb fan . Every sense . The CD was like new , great quality . No scratches nothing . Now that I have it , it 's scratched lol . Played to much ! : )	1
The Backstreet Boys became highly admired dominantly by young girls just like New Kids On The Block in the late 80 's and early 90 's . In 1997 when this album was released , it sold by the dozens just like Hanson 's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE album . Hit songs include EVERYBODY ( Backstreet 's Back ) * , QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART , I 'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART , ALL I HAVE TO GIVE and AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME , all later recycled for 2001 's THE HITS-CHAPTER ONE . SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS contains music excerpts for Spandau Ballet 's TRUE . Personally , this album , like every other BSB album , I believe is one of the greatest ever recorded . It continued to sell well throughout 1998 . *How could that be ? They just started .	1
I got Backstreet 's debut album a couple years after it came out , but I still thought it was pretty good . & quot ; Quit Playing Games & quot ; , & quot ; As Long & quot ; , & quot ; All I Have & quot ; , & quot ; Everybody & quot ; , and & quot ; Never Break & quot ; are all enough to make you want to buy this album . Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls , you should n't totally dismiss this album . However , this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years . I never understood how this music is considered & quot ; pop & quot ; when all it is R & amp ; B . But that 's all a part of a critic 's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category .	1
As a person with a variety of musical tastes , loving everyone from Bjork who is my all time favorite , to Loreena McKennitt to Mel C ... ( you get the idea ) you can pretty much tell that I realize that this is n't the deepest music , but who cares ? As Duke Ellington said , & quot ; If it sounds good , it IS good & quot ; , so I do n't see why everybody feels like they have to hate fun music that gets you through the day , even if song twelve of this album is something less than savory in sentiment . I like the Backstreet boys a lot and I think this album is just great ! Boy-band music is always fun , unless they do too many ballads , and as a great lover of dance , club , and overall danceable and enjoyable music I play this album a whole lot . And even if two of the ballads are slightly boring and both start with someone whispering & quot ; baby.. & quot ; , there 's something kind of sweet about them . Though their second album as a whole has slightly better overall production and is more introspective and thoughtful and is , I think , preferable to this , this is still a great album and is great fun . So if you just want something fun and nice to listen and dance to , buy this album . I think you 'll really enjoy it and even be caught bouncing around the room to it alot .	1
THE WHOLE POP CULTURE WAS REALLY KINDA DEAD FOR A WHILE , THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A BUNCH JUMP ON THE SCENE SELLIN RECORDS TO THE MASSES BYE THE MILLIONS.THEY SEEM TO BE STILL COMING BUT IM TELLIN YA NOW 2-3 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD ONLY A COUPLE WILL STILL BE HERE HERE AT LEAST SELLIN RECORDS ANYWAYS.HOWEVER I DO THINK THE BACKSTREET BOYS WILL BE ONE OF THE FEW STILL STANDING.IM NOT SURE ABOUT 5 YEARS THOUGH AT THAT POINT POP CULTURE WILL SLOW BACK DOWN AGAIN , THEN REPEAT ALL OVER.NOT BECAUSE OF TALENT BUT BECAUSE OF POP MUSIC BEING SO TRENDY.IF U LOOK BACK TO SOME OF THE PAST POP STARS OR EVEN R & amp ; B STARS U WILL SEE THERE REIGN ON TOP IS SHORT WITH ALWAYS A FEW EXCEPTIONS.IF U LOVE THIS MUSIC DONT WORRY IF THE GROUP OR ARTIST YOU LIKE FALLS OFF OR STOPS SELLIN CUZ THIS MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WILL FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE THEM , AND IT WONT BE A LONG WAIT I PROMISE ... .THATS JUST HOW IT WORKS . HOWEVER I DO FEEL THAT THIS RECORD IS ALOT TIGHTER THAN A LOT OF OTHER POP RECORDS THAT HAVE COME OUT IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.QUIT PLAYIN GAMES WITH MY HEART , AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME , EVERYBODY AND SET ADRIFT OF MEMORY BLISS R ALL GOOD SONGS . THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM FOR ANY COLLECTION THAT IS FILLED BY R & amp ; B AND POP ...	1
So I admit that I was a huge Backstreet Boys fan when they came out ... but then again so was n't anyone my age . To say now that they suck would be unfair to the genra of music that they profess . They are bubblegum pop , and in that effect they deliver decent bubblegum pop . THis is not their best album , for it was their debut and their sophmore album was much more polished but the hits turned out by this album were plenty and this album did solidify them quite the fanbase thanks to whiny `` girl come back to me '' type lyrics and Nick Carters just plain whiny voice . Not sure what the hype is there for him but oh well ... The Backstreet Boys had it all ... they had the young cute one ala Nick Carter , they had the talented one ala Brian , they had the drug addict ala A.J. , they had the funny looking one ala Howie and they had the creepy older guy ala Kevin . And they could carry a note for the most part . Thus the Backstreet Boys were born and teenage girls everywhere went crazy . I admitt that I liked this CD even though my friends thought I was nuts , all but a few , but how can you resist songs like `` Quit playing games with my heart '' or `` As long as you love me ? '' ... `` Everybody '' was huge and so was `` All I have to give '' and the balance of the CD was n't to bad either . No , it 's not in my CD player right now , and no it wo n't visit anytime soon , but for what it was , for the time it came out and for the fan base they were after , Backstreet Boys came , saw and conquered .	1
I remember this album when I was the 5th and 6th Grade . This album is a keeper ! This album is armed with powerful harmonies , groove friendly beats , passionate ballads , a dynamic stage show and charisma that will not be denied , They were ready to show USA what the rest of the planet has already figured out : They are more than a phenomenon , they are here to stay . This album has been certified 14x Platinum . Remember , this was 1997-1998 .	1
When I first heard QUIT PLAYING GAMES on the radio , I went crazy trying to find out who sung it . Who had every heard of THE BACKSTREET BOYS anyway ? Well no one is asking that question anymore , since these great looking , talented young guys have risen in the music world and can sell out a stadium in less than 10 minutes ! This cd contains all their popular hits from the late nineties . You 'll sing along and dance and really enjoy adding this to your & quot ; favorites & quot ; collection . And of course , MILLENNIUM is out of this world too !	1
I am picky about my pop , but I actually really liked it ... it 's a guily pleasure . All the songs are catchy and danceable . Liked this much better than N'Sync 's debut .	1
Yep , Backstreet Boys have ever remained my Fav ' Stars since their singing debut 'Quit playing Games with my heart ' and Everybody ... Rock your body ' . Millennium proved to be the Best Hit Pick in my List and sure , sure , Backstreet Boys CD is a prize collection in the closet . Brian is cool , so is Nick n rest and this is one group one ca n't resist to listen to their catchy , sweet ballads n dance numbers . Quit playing games and As long as you love me are great numbers . Hey Mr. DJ is a song to hum n hope it keeps playing along . If you wan na be a good girl , get a bad boy is sweet lyrics coz makes me smile at the words and is a pretty number smartly conveying the message . All I have to give is a nice ballad singing blues of a girlfriends tears . I 'll never break your Heart is an emotion through lyrics . The group is a unique togetherness and has topped the charts with their 'Larger than Life ' . Great Pick if you like the Pop n Ballad n Cool Listen . My choice - Enjoy !	1
OK , some people may just pass on the Backstreet Boys simply because they think they are just another one of those teenybopper face bands that will become VERY big , then just grow & quot ; un-cute & quot ; and disappear into the 99 cent bin in a few years . Remember New Kids on The Block ? Thought so . That is what happened to them.Now , what makes the Backstreet Boys different , is that they have pure singing talent . Listen to their harmonies . SOLID . Listen to their songs . They ALL can sing . They can sing lead , they can do back-ups . They even play instruments ( which I have recently seen from some concert footage . ) Talent , people ... all talent . I think the Backstreet Boys will be around for awhile . Just listen to them .	1
The album opener 'Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) ' is handsdown one of the best party songs of the 90s and of the boys along with the intoxicating , 'If You Want It to Be Good Girl ( Get Yourself a Bad Boy ) ' . 'As Long As You Love Me ' still is a lovely love ballad about unconditional love and has never gotten old to me as I still hear it being played over the radio . '10 000 Promises ' , 'Like a Child ' , 'That , s What She Said ' , and 'If I Do n't Have You ' are very romantic songs that further captured how much the boys love to sing about love , not to mention how wonderful their singing voices are . ; - ) 'All I Have to Give ' is such a beautiful love ballad on the album and has always been my favorite from the boys and speaks about what REAL love is . 'That 's the Way I Like It ' ( which might had been sampled for the boys 'Millennium ' song 'Larger Than Life ' ) is a swell mid-tempo song as well as 'Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playing This Song ) . 'Set Adrift on Memory Bliss ' is a very smoothing which should n't be overlooked along with the other songs from the album that were n't major hit singles.The second album from BSB has what their debut album has , a few catchy Dance and Funky songs , but has more love ballads-which displays how REALLY talented Nick , A.J. , Howie D. , Brain , and Kevin are . : - )	1
The Backstreet Boys started out Europe , because they felt that the US were'nt ready them yet. ! And when they released this CD it caused them to explode into the USA spawning 5 top 10 hit singles ! ! ! This CD is a *GREAT* mix of pop and R & amp ; B however I hated the cover of PM Dawn 's & quot ; Set adrift on memory bliss & quot ; its one of my fav songs and they murtilized it ! ! ! But the rest of the CD is really good. ! Beginning with the dancy song & quot ; We 've got it going on & quot ; the first hit single in the US & quot ; Quit playing games with my heart & quot ; , & quot ; As long as you love me & quot ; my personal fav on the album very catchy and a cute song ! ! ! , track five is & quot ; All I have to give & quot ; I *Love* this song its just a really GREAT song ! ! ! , Track 7 is one of the BEST ballads of all time & quot ; I 'll never break your heart & quot ; its so sweet and the harmonizing is amazing ! ! ! , Also the tracks If you have the newer album version with & quot ; Everybody ( Backstreets Back ) & quot ; that 's a *GREAT* dance track ! ! ! , Get Down you 're the one fore me : is a really good dancer too ! ! ! , I *Love* the last track & quot ; If you want it to be good girl ( get yourself a bad boy ) & quot ; its pretty funny , catchy , sexy , and cute all at the same time ! ! ! So go buy this album and the rest of BSB 's album 's cause they ALL rock the house ! ! !	1
This is the greatest CD of all time . Though Millennium is a VERY close second , this CD has it all ! My faves are & quot ; Quit Playing Games & quot ; & quot ; We 've Got It Going On & quot ; & quot ; I 'll Never Break Your Heart & quot ; & quot ; Everybody & quot ; and & quot ; Backstreet 's Back & quot ; Because they all have their own sound . The Backstreet Boys are my favorite group now and forever . I hope Kevin and Brian have very happy , successful marriages , but just incase , keep my e-mail !	1
Very stratified with the item . Good album from start to finish . Quality production and hot tracks . BSB brought back the boyband fad with this one .	1
Backstreet Boys broke big in Europe and Asia before they finally broke the US market . Their debut album was released internationally in 1996 , but it would take another year before it was released in the US . Nevertheless , it is amazing to me that it 's been 15 years since this was released . `` Backstreet Boys '' ( 12 tracks ; 52 min . ) starts with an incredible infectious `` We 've Got It Going On '' , what an opening track ! It is followed by the pleasant mid-tempo `` Quit Playing Games With My Heart '' and the ballad `` As Long As You Love Me '' . But then things get even better with the rebel-rousing `` Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) '' , the best track on here , and the best BSB track ever , period . Not that BSB was away as this was their first album , but hey , who 's minding . Great tracks follow one after another , such as the pensive `` All I Have to Give '' , and the dance-alongs `` Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) '' and `` Get Down ( You 're The One For Me ) '' , but truth be told , there are no weak tracks on here and sounds like a greatest hits album.15 years on , this album stands the test of time , and it is amazing to me how fresh it still sounds ( compared to say , the Spice Girls a few years later , who now sound very dated ) . This is the best BSB album period . I saw the BSB in concert once in 1999 , at the peak of the BSB/*NSYNC boy band craze ( I went on a date , to be honest ) , and what a great show it was . Meanwhile , this album was and is a MAJOR musical guilty pleasure .	1
I still think that Backstreet Boys ' US debut is still a solid pop debut . The Max Martin-dominated songs like Quit Playing Games , As Long as you Love Me and others are still superb pop songs . There are some funky numbers like Hey Mr. DJ and We 've Got It Going On . I still love the breezy ballad Darlinwith its lush landscapes and bridges . It was smart that they added Everybody to the album in early '98 -- made the album have more energy to it ! This helped start the boy band trend of nearly identical male groups , even a rival group which I wo n't say here . The singing 's very good , as AJ McLean and Nick Carter 's twin leads along with Brian Littrell 's inclusions make the songs entertaining . Kevin Richardson and Howie Dorough provide good background singing . I still love Good Girl/Bad Boy and its rocking closing to the album ! It has that AC/DC type feel to it with its naughtiness . This is a landmark album of many proportions !	1
I 've been a huge fan of the Backstreet Boys since '97 , and I have each and everyone of their albums . All of them are GREAT ! This one , however , is their American debut ( they 've had two other Import albums before this one ) . I think it 's a rockin ' CD that shows the more fun , relaxed side of the BSB . Every song on this CD is awesome ( well , with the exception of one song ! ) . So here 's the run-down : '' We 've Got It Goin ' On '' - - this is the very first single the BSB had . They first released it in the US , but it did n't do very well on the charts so they decided to try Europe ... and it became a major hit ! This is a groovy , upbeat song and the lyrics are awesome . So are the Boys ' vocals . `` Quit Playin ' Games ( With My Heart ) '' - - you 've all heard this song before . I personally love it and it never gets boring or old ! `` As Long As You Love Me '' - - still my favorite ballad on this CD . You 've all heard this one , too . `` Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) '' - - the CD I have does n't include this song , but I have the single for it and it rocks ! You 've all heard this song so you decide . `` All I Have To Give '' - - a great ballad . The vocals and lyrics are smooth and solid , and so is the music . You 've all heard this one , I believe . `` Anywhere For You '' - - a cool love ballad . The lyrics and vocals are wonderful . `` Hey , Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) '' - - an awesome uptempo dance song . The lyrics are cool and so are the BSB vocals . `` I 'll Never Break Your Heart '' - - one of my favorite love ballads . And what they say is true : They never WILL break my heart ! Beautiful lyrics and vocals . `` Darlin ' '' - - OK song . Brian does great here . But not one of my favorites . `` Get Down ( You 're The One For Me ) '' - - an awesome uptempo song ! I just love it . The lyrics , music , and vocals are amazing . `` Set Adrift On Memory Bliss '' - - I think this is the only song by the BSB that I ever disliked . It should n't have been included here . Really bad . `` If You Want It To Be Good Girl ( Get Yourself A Bad Boy ) '' - - my favorite uptempo song ! Nick 's lead vocals are awesome ( I think Nick is so gorgeous and talented ! ) . This song should NOT be missed.All in all , terrific CD . It 's great for a party or just for having a good time and relaxing . Nick , Howie , Brian , AJ , and Kevin were al much younger when they recorded this CD , but that does n't make them bad ! BACKSTREET BOYS - if you have n't got it yet - is the one CD you should n't miss out on ! ... This CD rocks ! !	1
I am glad I bought this cd because it is worth every cent of your money for the first track to the last the boys do a great job introducting themselves to the us . I love all the songs and it is just a great cd your whole family can listen to .	1
This album was released stateside in 1996 , but I first heard the Backstreet Boys ' `` We 've Got it Going On '' during a trip to London in 1995 . While America was still in the waning years of grunge , London had taken the lead in jumping on the boy band bandwagon with Take That , so they were the first to embrace the Backstreet Boys . When the Boys finally brokethrough in the states , I was thrilled . As a Teen Pop fan from the 70 's and 80 's , I was glad to see it return.On this album , the Boys ' youthful exhuberance shines through . The songs are full of energy and are still fun to listen to all these years later . As with most artists , their time in the spotlight has apparently come and gone . But who knows , these boys had talent and we may hear more from them yet . Whoever thought Jordan Knight or Joey McIntire from New Kids on the Block would make solo comebacks.A word of caution , this is an enhanced CD , which can sometimes be a pain if you want to listen to the CD on your computer without disturbing other programs you have running . The problem with these enhanced CD 's is that the information becomes out of date and useless . My advice is when you first put it in your CD drive and the Boys come up on your screen , click Exit so you can just play the music without all the other unnecessary programs running .	1
I actually liked this cd ! Even though almost everyone I know HATES the Backstreet Boys I actually think some of their material is actually good . This cd was better then Millenium though.1.We 've Got It Goin ' On OK track , it sounds like Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) 2.Quit Playin ' Games ( With My Heart ) I liked this pop song . It 's one of the reasons I bought this album.3.As Long As You Love Me See Quit Playin ' Games ( With My Heart ) 4.Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) I loved this dance song . Though it sounds like We 've Got It Goin ' On , it 's better . Catchy.5.All I Have To Give Nice ballad.6.Anywhere For You See All I Have To Give.7.Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) Nice dance track . Catchy.8.I 'll Never Break Your Heart See All I Have To Give and Anywhere For You.9.Darlin ' Did n't like it much.10.Get Down ( You 're The One For Me ) See Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) . I also liked Kevin Richardson 's rapping.11.Set Adrift On Memory BlissSee Darlin ' . Confusing.12.If You Want It To Be Good Girl ( Get Yourself A Bad Boy ) See Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) .Overall I really liked this cd except for Darlin ' and Set Adrift On Memory Bliss . My favorite songs are Quit Playin ' Games ( With My Heart ) , As Long As You Love Me , Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) , All I Have To Give , Hey Mr. DJ ( Keep Playin ' This Song ) , I 'll Never Break You 're Heart , Get down ( You 're The One For Me ) , and If You Want It To Be Good Girl ( Get Yourself A Bad Boy ) . I 'd buy this iif I were you . I ca n't wait until the new Backstreet Boys album comes out in September . I 'm going to buy that one too .	1
THIS IS VERY GOOD . YOU EVEN GET A TUPAC APPEARANCE . RING IT IS THE SHIZNIT . YOU BETTER GET THIS BEFORE YOU GET THE ELEMENT , THIS IS WAY BETTER .	1
One Of the Best . People knock him for his own vernacular , his style , But he 's A Mack , E-40 40 FONZ , ... MY FAVORITE ON THIS CD is Million Dollar Spot with His Cousin B-LEGIT , And Homie 'Pac . My first 40 ' cd . I appreciate the songs , especially his heartbreaking some things will never change which sounds just like pacs changes . I also love his Diss against Rasheed Wallace . ( who hated on him ) . Good Music .	1
Most people say that E-40 never topped In A Major Way but I beg to differ . He not only topped it with this album , he made it a distant memory . I loved In A Major Way but lets be real . How many of you remember it after hearing this album ? Exactly . The album starts off with Record Haters where E-40 disses the pants off Rasheed Wallace and AZ . I like Az but he was out of line dissing 40 water and how is Rasheed Wallace dissing anybody ? Anybody who heard him rap before knows that he shouldnt be within 3 point distance of a microphone ( Im talking Shaquille O Neal wack ) . Rappers Ball with Too Short and K-Ci is a classic joint . 2pac ( RIP ) and B-Legit join E-40 on the spectacular Million Dollar Spot . Ring It featuring Spice 1 and Keek Da Sneak is another classic joint and why this song was never an anthem out here still bothers me . E-40 also has you covered on the positive tip with The Story and Things 'll Never Change ( which beautifully samples Bruce Hornsby 's The Way It Is ) . Some people think I Wan na Thank You with Suga T is corny but is still a highlight track in my opinion . Circumstances is another bangin track that features The Luniz , T-Pup , Celly Cel and Kokane . The only tracks I couldnt feel is My Drinking Club , Keep Pimpin and Growing Up ( he could have left the kid who was rapping offbeat of that track you know ) . The rest of the album is still noteworthy . Bottom Line : E-40 's Tha Hall Of Game is his best work and is definetely a highlight album of 1996 . This album came out at a time when you can expect most album that come out to be good . Boy do I miss those days . Anyway E-40 put a lot effort into this album and it paid off . Standout tracks : RECORD HATERS , RAPPERS BALL , MILLION DOLLAR SPOT , THE STORY , RING IT , I LIKE WHAT YOU DO TO ME , THINGS 'LL NEVER CHANGE , CIRCUMSTANCES and SMEBBIN .	1
e-40 's the man . a weird man but still the man . nobody will give this guy a chance to see what skills 40 really posesses . in no way is he commercial , far from it with his goofy voice , rapid fire flow , and his own personal slang . but that 's the beauty of it - he 's not like every other rapper ! straight from vallejo , ca ( adjacent to oakland ) , 40 brings us `` the hall of game '' . this album shows e-40 's fun side and also his more introspective side , making this his best album to date . if you want party songs check out `` drinking club '' which production wise sounds like 2 yrs ahead of its time . `` ring me '' has a hot beat with 40 's fire flow and is very danceable and club friendly . `` rapper 's ball '' the lead single features the great k-ci and too short and is fun . if you want hood songs check out `` million dollar spot '' with the great late 2pac , song 3 ( i forget the name ) which has a driveby skit , and `` smebbin '' with its song about hoes . then , e-40 takes a 180 and raps about introspection . `` the story '' is a classic followed by `` circumstances '' with the chorus saying that you should watch the things you get into and the company you keep , `` it is what it is '' is a perfectly narrated eerie story of how the law catches up to you in time , and the last song being `` things never change '' which looks back on 40 's hard life . this dude can rap and is so different than your average rapper that you got ta give him a try . you will be impressed ! he is straight pimpin here and he puts together some classics here . 40 fonzarelli baby !	1
Back in the day you got classic after classic . This is just one of them . Still though E-40 's new music is great but not this great if you know what I mean . This is laid back westcoast music at some of it 's best . Bay-Area has many talented artirst and if you 're into west coast rap E-40 is one of the most important to get . I 'll admit this ai n't 40 's best , but it 's far from his worst and it does deserves five stars even though it 's more like 4.5.Definitely check this out if you 're interested in some west coast talent.Also check out music by Too Short , South Central Cartel , Havoc & amp ; Prodeje , B-Legit , Richie Rich , The Click , Celly Cel.. oh my God so many talents that never get the props they deserve . I think it 's time now ! Get this for your collection .	1
This is just as solid as his first and then them.B-legit is showing the world that the Clicks sucsess was no fluke and how bright the future for him and the sickwitit family really is ... From E-40 and the Click to the Mossie this is the team thats been here since 92 and I do n't see that changin any time soon ... . ( I was at Philly Blunts studio in Vallejo back in September of 98 and a heard a new B-legit song that was recorded for his new album and it was off the hook..I hope it makes the album ... .. ) Watch 4 the new album cuz he keeps gettin better ... ..	1
Well if you like the click and are a yea area rap fan this should be one of your favorites . I 'm sure if you asked more than 100 w/coast rap fans if legit can hold his own at least 80 would say he can . Even though his cousin e-40 blew up the click , legit could have blow up himself with a big label backing him . B-legit has always had a good solid understandable flow , he raps right on the beat , kinda like too short . He really dose n't need the help of the click but it would be a crime if they did n't rap together , c'mon I mean there family . Now to the album it 's self . Producers Studio Ton and Mike Mosley are never a let down , they can always suply none stop mob funk . All the songs on here u should be able to listen to because legit can flow and the producing is good but if u like legit for his hardcore sound than you 'll do like me and skip over the softer tracks at times . The guess apperances on the album are very good and with all creditable w/coast rapper 's ( C-Bo , Kurupt , Celly Cel,40 , A1 , Lil Bruce and the Mossie ) . Singer Levitti also adds a much needed soulful sound to the album . What really suprises me about this album is tha song & quot ; Getto Smile & quot ; , which is a wonderfull remake colaberation of singer Daryl Hall 's original late 70 's hit & quot ; Smile for me & quot ; , Daryl Hall singing the chourus in between legits rap verses . Also the bonus track # 15 , not originaly intended to be on the album is a nice gift to all B-legits fans .	1
Just one year since his solo debut , the Savage is back with his best album of his 5 to date ( I do n't have his debut album ) . Of the 13 songs on here , there is 1 classic , 9 good songs , and the other 3 are ok , no bad songs on here . Like all his albums I have , guests are on alot of the songs ( on every one on here actually ) but B-Legit still tears it up . Production is great , especially for his flow and his style . A lot of funky beats with deep bass grooves make it a good album to listen to straight through , and some good samples are used as well . Studio Ton does 5 songs , Kevin Gardner & Redwine , and Mike Mosely each do 2 songs , and Femi Ojetunde , Tone Capone , K-Lou & Funk Daddy all do 1 song . A must have album for fans of his , the Click or northern Cali rap. # 2 - 9 ( f/ Levitti -- nice beat ) # 3 - 8.5 ( f/ Dionne Jackson ) # 4 - 8 ( f/ E-40 & Kurupt ) # 5 - 10 ( CLASSIC -- f/ Lil Bruce & C-Bo -- great upbeat production and sampling used ) # 6 - 8 ( f/ Suga T & Emgee ) # 7 - 8 ( f/ The Mossie ) # 8 - 7.5 ( f/ Daryl Hall -- another decent sample ) # 10 - 7.5 ( f/ Mac Shawn ) # 11 - 9 ( f/ C-Bo & Celly Cel -- nice beat ) # 12 - 8 ( f/ Harm -- upbeat song ) # 13 - 8 ( f/ Big Bone & D-Day -- nice beat ) # 14 - 7 ( f/ Levitti ) # 15 - 8 ( f/ Mac Shawn , G-Note & K-1 -- nice beat ) Brandt Jones -- Vallejo , CA	1
B-Legit holds it down for the Yay Area but not with & quot ; The Click & quot ; but solo wise . He makes sure you feel this album with knockin ' beats and lyrics showing you that he 's not in 40 waters shadow . Not only does he put it down by himself but he features some of the top rappers puttin ' it down for California . I recommend this album to everyone who likes E-40 , Suga T , D-Shot , and & quot ; The Click & quot ; because B-Legit shows he 's a major part of & quot ; The Click & quot ;	1
B-Legit comes through in a major way with his second project & quot ; The Hemp Museum & quot ; . The CD from top to bottom is just superb from & quot ; City 2 City & quot ; with LeVitti , & quot ; For So Long & quot ; ( Mike Mosley doing what he does best ) , & quot ; Check It Out & quot ; ( Kurupt & E-40 adds some great lyrics on this track and Studio Ton provides a great mob beat to it ) , & quot ; Got ta Buy Dope From Us & quot ; ( C-Bo & Little Bruce serves up some game on this track ) . I can go on & on but this is just a sample of how good this CD is . There is not one weak track on here . The Hemp Museum is in a class of it 's own . Check It Out ! !	1
This cd is better than his first . He is more versitle on this one . He got alot more guest on here . Ghetto smile is a good song . Check this cd out	1
One of the best albums I 've ever heard . B-Legit 's great delivery and lyrics along with many fly guest featured over this tight production - it just makes a perfect album with the bay area flava . C-Bo , Kurupt , E40 , Celly Cell and many more join the Savage in one of the west coast best and most underrated albums . Get that fly sh*t ! ! !	1
I first heard of B-Legit on 2Pac 's `` All Eyez On Me '' and 40 Water 's `` In A Major Way , '' and I am glad I did ! B-Legit 's 2nd album `` The Hemp Museum , '' is tight . It is straight hard-hittin ' g-funk you can bend corners to and lowride to ! He keeps it old school on `` Neva Bite '' ( # 7 ) with whiny synths and a faint use of a talk box in the hook . # 6 , `` Hemp Museum '' is laid back , funky , and fresh , one to hit switches to , or ride with the top down ! ! `` For So Long '' ( # 3 ) is also tight with a kickin ' beat and use of the whiny synths . Be sure `` Check It Out , '' and cop it !	1
Keith Murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled Enigma . He impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like `` World Be Free '' and the heartfelt `` To My Mans '' featuring Dave Hollister . As he begins by antagonizing others on `` Intro '' it continues over to `` Call My Name '' as he dares any competition to contest . `` Dangerous Ground '' featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith , but his ability to adapt nearly passes by . The highlight of this LP is `` What A Feelin ' '' with its groovy , scale runs with the bass . `` Love L.O.D . '' featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D . as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession . To close , Keith Murray 's Enigma is lyrically fulfilling .	1
If you check Keith Murray 's lyric sheet , you will know that he lays down some of the most complex lyrics to ever come out of one 's mouth . No doubt he is a lyrical genius , if you heard his debutThe Most Beautifullest Thing in This World . With this album , he turned up the intensity of his lyrics and got some darker production form producers like Erick Sermon.The best songs on here are the ones when Keith does n't wonder all over the world with his lyrics . Meaning that he is staight foward , and not come up with something that has no topic . A few of my favorites are `` Manifique ( Origonal Rules ) '' and `` The Rhyme '' . The production on those tracks are excellent too . `` Call My Name '' is a nice song ( not sure who he is aiming that to on here ) , but Keith has a message for those who steps to him . Another excellent cut would be Def Squad cut `` Yeah '' . That track also features Busta Rhymes , and Erick Sermon produced a phat beat to listen to.Enigma is an excellent album for Keith Murray 's catalog . It 's a little more dark sounding than his debut , but he still has the lyrical skills to let anyone know he was bringing the heat back in '96 . Fans of Def Squad should already have this in their hands . If you 're new to Keith Murray , check outThe Most Beautifullest Thing in This World , before checking this one .

Keith Murray returns after 2 years , to bring a solid 4.5 star sophomore solo album . Of the 6 solo 's of his I have this may be the best ( close with `` Rap-Murr-Phobia '' - both 4.5 stars ) , he has 3 4 star albums , ( `` The Most Beautifullest Thing in the World '' , `` Puff Puff Pass '' and a low 4 star album in `` It 's a Beautiful Thing '' ) , and one 3.5 star album in `` He 's Keith Murray '' , not to mention Def Squad albums . This one has 12 songs , of the 12 , 2 are almost classic , 2 are ok , the others are good , mostly real good songs . Guests are on 4 songs rapping and do the hook on one more . Production is very nice as well , no surprise as Erick Sermon does 8 songs , Sugarless does 2 , and Rod Kirkpatrick and The Ummah each do 1 . As usual he shows why he is one of the top lyricists to grace the mic , in my opinion as his lyrics are always on point . A must have album for his fans. # 2 - 9 ( nice beat ) # 3 - 9 ( nice beat ) # 4 - 8.5 # 5 - 9.5 ( great beat ) # 6 - 8 ( f/ 50 Grand ) # 7 - 9.5 ( f/ Kel Vicious -- great beat ) # 8 - 9 # 9 - 9 ( nice beat ) # 10 - 9 ( f/ Erick Sermon , Busta Rhymes , Jamal , Redman -- nice beat0 # 11 - 7 ( f/ Kel Vicious & 50 Grand ) # 12 - 8.5 ( f/ Dave Hollister ) # 13 - 7.5 # 14 - 8.5 ( remix of # 5 with not as good of a beat ) Keith Murray - Long Island , NYCheck all my reviews	1
Mr Keith murray the rap enigma brings us his second LP `` Enigma '' ! this album is just fire ill rhymes , ill beats ( courtesy of erick sermon ) ill concepts & ill guest appearances from busta rhymes , redman , dave hollister , 50 grand , kel vicious , & young jamal ! This album keith takes various shots at mobb deep who tried to subliminaly diss him , redman , & erick sermon on a skit off the infamous . the `` Rhyme '' is the only single released for this album which has keith rapping over a nice Franky Beverly & MAZE sample . This whole album is certified classic but the tracks that I really took notice of was The rhyme of course & the rhyme remix which has the same lyrics but over a different beat done by the late J Dilla ! `` Whuts Happenin '' is keith describing whats been going with him & the rap game over a nice beat also he takes another jab a mobb deep `` then you got rap artist claiming to be the hardest bust in they ish & they quick to press charges '' `` Dangerous Ground '' a great track with keith & his boy 50 grand going back & forth trading verses warning punk mcs to stay out of their path . `` Yeah '' is bomb track with keith , busta , redman , erick sermon , & little jamal tearing up the mic ! `` To My Mans '' a great heartfelt track from keith ( reminds me of some of the tracks from OC 's word life & jewelz ) basically talking about the people in his life who are dead & gone & thats hes trying to keep his head up in this crazy world . And finally My fav track `` World Be Free '' is another banger better yet a concept track where keith describes how hes travels all over the world state to state country to country interstate to tristate ripping up the mic where he raps line slike `` Kentucky was lucky I had to much hennessey When I was representing love love in Tenessee Kansas City Missouri can speak upon the glory St. louis can even tell the story Of how I drop ish thick and cold like the snow in Chicago A major up in Ohio '' or `` I transformed like Dr. Bruce Banner Stepped off the plane and blacked out up in Canada I 'm a million dollar man like Lee Majors messed around and hit the jackpot up in Vegas '' This album is just as good if not better than his first LP so with that said , pick up the Enigma you wo n't be disappointed !	1
The Best work for east coast if it isnt Premo is Underground Smooth Sounding beats and this has them . 1 of my personal favorites Go Get It you will love this	1
The BEST album from Keith Murray ! ! ! All the songs have keiths signature lyricism and Def squad beats to keep your head knockin ' ! Do n't sleep , Keith 's a genuis with the words !	1
This CD came out with little publicity at all ( I 'm sure you can tell by the lack of reviews ) . Anyway , this cat is nice . I first heard this CD in 1996 . Back then I really was n't buying music , but I ended up copping it in 1999 . This is Keith Murray for real . Not the & quot ; Yeah , Yeah , You No It & quot ; stuff . Heavily underrated CD .	1
After a great first album , Keith Murray follows it up with Enigma . The album does have its flaws like Rhymin Wit Kel and Dangerou Ground ( which was boring on the Dangerous Ground Soundtrack and is boring now ) . Outside of those two joints the album is great . Call My Name , Manifique ( Original Rules ) , How To Def and What A Feelin show you why Keith Murray is one of the most underrated eastcoaster . I liked his first single The Rhyme and the remix is not a bad touch . Busta Rhymes , Redman , Erick Sermon and Jamal totally ripped Yeah in half . Love L.O.D . is another highlight as Keith Murray , Kel-Vicious and 50 Grand let of steam on the track . Keith Murray gives a touching tribute to his fallen partner on To My Mans with Dave Hollister adding to a good chorus . Bottom Line : Keith Murray 's Enigma is Keith Murray at his best and is unquestionably a rap highlight of 1996 . Keith Murray was still on fire when this album came out so you could expect the best from him . Standout Tracks : CALL MY NAME , MANIFIQUE ( ORIGINAL RULES ) , THE RHYME ( original and remix ) , WHAT A FEELIN , YEAH , LOVE L.O.D. , TO MY MANS and WORLD BE FREE .	1
ORIGINAL RULES OUT STANDING SONG .	1
Back in '97 , I believed that hip hop was changing . The previous two years , the Bay Area was dishing out hit after hit from artists like E-40 & The Click , The Luniz , Too Short and The Dangerous Crew , etc . Mostly around that time due to recent tragedies of Tupac and Biggie , the east coast and the west were showing unity between the two regions . Although on this LP , there are no colab from anyone but the west , mostly from northern and southern California ( as a path followed by Ant Banks'Big Thangsreleased the same year ) Spice 1 has dropped a few gems as well along that time . His sixth album `` The Black Bossalini '' really comes as a real solid LP full of gangsta tales , as something that you have mostly have heard from him in the past.The first and the easiest standout track would be `` Thug In Me '' as the song is dedicated to his close friend Tupac . The beat on the song would exactly fit the style of Pac . The following track `` I 'm High '' is a song dedicated to smoking weed . `` Recognize Game '' features Too Short and Ice-T , that is real solid . `` Playa Man '' is very lively track , as Spice 1 has a sped up flow over the beat ( yeah , I saw that fresh cut he had in the video as well ) . `` Caught In My Gunplay '' is very mellow and laid back sounding . Me I think it is kind of weak , but at the same time , solid . `` Ballin ' '' is excellent with the beat provided by Hen Gee , and features Caffine , Yukmouth of the Luniz , Gazzepha , and MC Breed . `` The Boss Mobsta '' is another track to fit Spice 1 's style in rapping ( think of his earlier songs ) . `` 510 , 213 '' are odes to the area codes of the Bay Area and Los Angeles respectively with the help of W.C. and Big Syke . `` Kill Street Blues '' is a great track laced by a nice hook . `` Fetty Chico And The Mack '' has a dope beat by Ant Banks , but I 'm not feeling the hook or some of the rhymes . `` Wan na Be A G. '' and `` Diamonds '' are both solid tracks . `` Down Payment On Heaven '' is a song dedicated to his deceased homies . The final track `` 2 Hands & A Razorblade '' is Spice 1 telling a story about being locked in the L.A. County Pen.Spice 1 does n't dissapoint here on this album . But at the same time , this is nowhere nearAmeriKKKa 's Nightmare , which is the only other Spice 1 album that I own . Mainly I do n't own1990-Sick , as many reviewers are mentioning . The album here as many rememerable cuts and good production ( curteosy of Paris , Ant Banks , and others ) . Thankfully Jive records has kept this in print , as well as their other popular Bay Area artists ( i.e . Too Short and E-40 ) . Fans of Bay Area rap will enjoy this here , mostly for the tracks that I said were great . Peace.Lyrics : A-Production B+Guest Appearances : B-Musical Vibes : B+Top 5 Tracks:1 .

I believe the only reason this album is not liked more than hes previous effort is purely due to it being hes next release . The album is more of a 1990-Sick part 2 than a knew inovative effort and I think alot of fans expect to much of there rappers to create knew ideas and beats instead of just cranking the bass and feeling the beats and bouncing on the ride . Black Bossalini does this better than Sick although both albums are simply impressive . Spice 1 is one of the games best flowing MCs pretty much only his trade mark and annoyingly boring BLOW call takes prestige off hes name . However he has been given deep riding beats again on this album to work with and it comes off in a much enjoyable way . The opening 2 tracks are great openers especially Im High . Its a great song to listen to in that way . Ant Banks steals the show as Fetty Chico and the Mack has a typical deep funk groove by the master producer and Recognize game is up there as one of the best as well . Ballin is a fun track and Diamonds is one of the best softer produced tracks I have heard by any artist . The hook is extremely catchy . This is Spice 1s best in my opinion . It makes me wonder how he could drop so low with hes follow up to this Immortalized . Its not even worth rating .	1
He does it again . His 5th album is yet another classic to add to his collection of many . This man shows as he ages he still can rap , and rap good . It has 3 classics , 1 song I skip , 1 that 's ok and the rest are good or great . Production is great and handled by a lot of people , Paris ( 4 songs ) , ant Banks , Ric Rock , and Ali Malek ( 2 songs each ) , and Hen gee , Payback , Mike Mosely each do a song and Femi O. co-produces on 2 tracks . If he had airplay out here on the east coast I 'd bet he 'd have many multi-platinum plaques on his wall . That 's what 's wrong with rap , hardly any of the good rappers sell . All th fake a*s pu*sy 's sell the most . If you wan na hear some real rap from a real cat who 's been in the game puttin out albums since '88 check out Spice 1 . Get this album ! ! # 1 - 10 ( classic - dedicated to his homey - 2Pac ( R.I.P . ) ) # 2 - 9 ( song about gettin ' high ) # 3 - 8 ( f/ Too $ hort & Ice T ) # 4 - 10 ( classic laid back track ) # 5 - 6.5 # 6 - 9.5 ( f/ Yukmouth & MC Breed ) # 7 - 10 ( another classic ) # 8 - 8 ( mellow track f/ WC & Big Syke ) # 9 - 8.5 # 10 - 8 ( f/ Mack 10 ) # 11 - 8 ( mellow track ) # 12 - 9.5 # 13 - 7 # 14 - 8.5b . Robert Lee Green in Texas around 1971 - moved to Hayward , CA '' Ca n't fu*k wit the East Bay G '' Check out all my reviews	1
Although It 's not as Heavy as his other songs I 've Heard . Nor as Good As 1-800-C.o.l.l.e.c.t. , It 's good , It has ICE T on it , Mack 10 , but thats not what makes it good , despite it 's shortcomings compared to previous works , Spice 1 still does it gritty . Spice is a Good Story teller .	1
On this album Spice 1 comes out on most of the songs a bit less hardcore than the usual , I guess he wants to change his style a little bit , he matured . He is less the cold-hearted murdera and more like an OG playa . But still on songs like the Boss Mobsta and 2 Hands & a Razorblade Spice Ace rips s*** up and does what he does best - drops hardcore violent lyrics with so much hype and energy that hit yo ' face as strong as Spice'1 fo-fo . The production is very tight all over the album and producers include Bay Area 's finest , names such as Paris , Ant Banks , Rick Rock and Mike Mosley . The guest list is also VERY VERY impressive - Too Short , Ice T , WC , Big Syke , Mack 10 and others , make is a VERY special album . An awesome record makes you anticapate the next album by the East Oakland thug - the one and only Spice - Mutha****in ' 1 ! ! This album is a classic , West Coast gangsta rap at it 's highest form ! I love the fact Spice 1 even made a tribute to 2Pac , and it 's not one of those fake-a** tributes , by rappers that Pac never ever knew ( and probably would n't even like to know ) - Spice was real friends with Pac , and they worked together on several occasions , that 's real . The album is close to perfection , even if his previous albums were a bit better . Spice steps his game up , and releases an album , with more of an up-to-date feel . I have nothing but good things to say about this one . Keep going Spice , you 're a legend in this rap game .	1
Late 1997 , Spice 1 delivers us with his 5th album , and his 5th classic in a row . Intact is his awesome wordplay and thuggish ruggish maniacal flow over great beats . This album rates high in his discog . Producers include Ant Banks , Paris , Clint `` Payback '' Sands , Hen Gee , Ali Malek , Rick Rock , Mike Mosley , and Femi Ojetunde , and the beats are a mix of syrupy and melodic G-Funk and mobb music . Lyrically , he has a neat array of thug joints and a few deeper songs . `` The Thug In Me '' is a nice dedication to late homie , 2Pac ( RIP ) over a melodic sample and whiny synth . Spice fires the cheeba on `` I 'm High '' over a heavier , more mobbish beat . Spice 1 calls up WC and Big Syke from LA to kick some game about cali , the bay to LA anthem , 510 , 213 , named after major bay and LA area codes . Spice 1 flosses a little , but still keeps it hard on `` Diamonds . '' The beat is different , bass heavy , but softer on the foreground beat with a faint whiny synth . `` The Boss Mobsta '' reminds me of 1995 's `` Mind Of A Sick N -- -a , '' partly because the beat pattern is similar , a Whodini `` Friends '' Sample , and the lyrics and Spice 's flow are crazy like in the 1995 joint . Ant Banks ' beats on the banger street joints `` Recognize Game '' ( f/ Too Short , Ice-T ) , and `` Fetty Chico And The Mack '' ( f/Mack 10 ) are among the best on the album . `` Down Payment On Heaven '' is awesome lyrically and musically too ! The beat has neat soulful samples to give it a laidback , melodic , and deep feel . Spice 1 contemplates on life , death , and the things he has done , does , and may do . The drama in the hood and senseless killings that take place there are emphasized in a intellectual fashion . `` 2 Hands And A Razorblade '' is another maniacal Spice 1 joint about life in the county jails of Cali . The beat has a whiny riff reminiscent of Snoop Dogg 's Murder Was The Case , but the beat is some slick G-Funk that is subtle but with hardcore overtures . There is so much to like about this album . Spice 1 ruled the 1990 's , and this classic is a testament to that .	1
Krs has never been the type to follow trends or fads , he just continue to bring us that classic hip-hop . I Got Next is another lp where Kris gives us a variety of lyrical styles like the title `` Over Ya Head '' . This track is a jazz fusion of horns with a gritty drum beat underneath . The free throws and commentaries were a good touch to the album as well , despite other artists using horrible interludes between their music . The repitious use of the phrase `` ... who am I ? The emcee ... '' on the first song or track 3 `` The MC '' flowed well over the Domingo produced east coast type beat . `` Just To Prove A Point '' is a live rock song that quiets during the hook and seem to fit in the equation Krs-One calculated . On the sleeves it has 18 tracks listed , but there are actually 19 with `` Step Into A World ( Rapture 's Delight ) ( Remix ) '' featuring P. Diddy and turned out to be a good club/party song . `` Real Hip-Hop- Part II '' could have been done without Mic Vandalz and `` Heartbeat '' could have been left completely out . I Got Next is not quite the classic to get a five star rating , but Krs got a lot to offer on this One .	1
THE TEACHER , BLASTMASTER.GOD OF LYRICAL STORMS.NO ONE COMES TO A BATTLE LIKE KRSONE DOES.ALL THESE YOUNG CATS TODAY CA N'T COME CLOSE TO KRSONE.HE HAS BEEN ROCKING FOR OVER A DECADE.TOO MANY STYLES.THE ORIGINATOR OF ALL RAPS , ( GANGSTA , REGGAE , TEACH , ETC ) HE GETS THE MOST RESPECT FROM OTHER MCS , BUT DOES N'T SELL RECORDS LIKE SOME OF THESE CORNY RAPPERS.BUT INSTEAD OF PLATIUM RECORDS , HE GAINS PLATIUM RESPECT.HE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME . FRESH ! FOR WHAT EVER YEAR IT IS-KRSONE	1
This was the best hip hop album i 've ever heard and what makes me mad is that the legendary Krs did n't get noticed because of his looks , but his lyrical talent is what should be noticed bacause by far he remains the greatest lyrical rapper ever , and some other great lyrical rappers who do n't get noticed that much like Keith Murray , Mos Def , Skee Lo and Dead Prez should because they are the revolutions of hip hop , and if the game is interested in looks more than talent , then hip hop is dead . But nontheless , this is the man that inspired many known rappers today , including LL Cool J , Jay Z , Nas , Twista , Public Enemy etc and in my point of view is the greatest rapper alive . So if you like hip hop , Krs One , fresh tracks and collaberations , this album has it all , the legendary Krs One will forever remain the greatest lyrical rapper in the world , no one can reach his level .	1
I Got Next -- Released in the spring of 1997 , I Got Next was the last studio LP from KRS-One on Jive Records . The album was a gold-seller ( over 500,000 copies ) , propelled largely by the single and video `` Step Into a World ( Rapture 's Delight ) '' . The CD and cassette featured a Puff Daddy remix of the song that was not released independently -- the gamble by Jive worked , and helped push sales of the album to help KRS-One earn his first gold plaque in several years . Other standout songs include the Showbiz-produced `` A Friend '' and `` Heartbeat '' , featuring Redman & Angie Martinez.Curiously , DJ Premier , Kid Capri , and even the artist 's brother Kenny Parker are absent from the album as producers ; their presence is missed as a handful of songs are sub-par in impact . The most surprising turn is near the end of the album , `` Just to Prove a Point '' , where KRS does his first rap-rock fusion song since 1988 's `` Ya Slippin ' '' . One is left wishing that a full album was done like this . Interludes between songs feature the artist 's spoken-word poetry . But did you expect any less from the Blastmaster ? A re-release of the album should include some remixes , including one by former members of Sublime .	1
This is the blast master at his absolute finest lyrically KRS still had it and showed some of the best poetry and story telling skills that I have ever heard he just kept getting better and better as he progressed through the nineties but something happened towards the end of the millenium he kind of fell off musically then he fell off both musically and lyrically . its a -- - shame too because he is still the best live but he cant heat it anymore on solo records but this record is an often over looked classic in the world of Hiphop it has some of the greatest beats that I have ever heard and some of the dopest sleeve art I have ever seen on an album Check it out seriously . if you do not own this album and you call yourself Hiphop you need to do some homework on the history of REAL HIPHOP . My favorite track is `` Cant Stop Wont Stop '' the story telling lines in that song are so vivid you almost feel like you are there . You will not be dissapointed by this record if you choose to purchase it .	1
Yo this was the perfect album for KRS at the time because people was n't sure if he still had it in him after Boom Bap and KRS-One.To me this was the answer to Boom Bap.I Got Next prooved he can rock a party like know one else.The lyrics are probably his best stylisticly.The beats are tight and the guest appearences were on point too.I know some were upset with the Puffy remix of Step Into A world but I say why not ? KRS rhymed with Shabba Ranks back in the day so whats the difference ? Meaning at the time Shabba was making it in the mainstream and no one had an issue with that so big deal.It did n't diminish what was acomplished on this album.The only thing that was missing was a DJ Premier track or somethin close to it .	1
In my opinion , this is KRS best solo effort so far . I ca n't skip no tracks . From beginning to end , this whole CD is pure form of the term real peoples can recognize as : HIP-HOP . Tracks like `` The MC '' , `` Step into a world '' or `` A friend '' are real classics , such as the entire album . This is a fresh air of hip-hop which is mocked by fake , gangsta-like , commercial freaks like Puffy , Nelly , St. Lunatics or them C ( TR ) a $ h Money what-do-you-call-them 's ... This is TRUE hip-hop ! If you a fake cat , do n't buy this ! This is not meant for Y'ALL ! But if you like TRUE hip-hop skills , then buy it ! NOW !	1
I GOT NEXT WAS GOOD FOR THE 90 'S , EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT HAVE IT BACK THEN , LIKE I DO NOW , I 'VE HEARD IT , IT 'S OK TO ME ... FRIEND IS THE ONE I LIKE , PLUS I STILL REMEBER THE VIDEO .	1
What can I say its Krs One of the greatest of all timeif you like Krs or you dont know anything about him I would say there is no risk in getting this albumThe Classic is defenitly Step into a world which has the nicest beatOther great classics are The Mc , A FRIEND , AND CANT STOP WONT STOPcheck it out	1
It 's sad that many people wo n't give mystikal a chance just 'cuz he 's stuck with the `` Southern Rap '' title.This album is some of the most unique hip-hop I 've heard , but not in a lame artsy way . It 's raw and real . Kinda like a southern Busta Rhymes.Take some off-beat , chopped and screwed jazz beats and add mystikal 's frantic outbursts of lyrics about weed and girls and you have a very unique album which never gets boring .	1
The Crescent City 's own Mystikal releases his third album and the first as a No Limit Soldier , Unpredictable was surprisingly a stratigic move for establishing a name for himself . Immediately opening up embracing his position in the army with a salute on `` Born 2 Be A Soldier '' featuring Master P , Silkk The Shocker , Fiend & Mac as `` Ai n't No Limit '' featuring Silkk The Shocker . Continuing to release his anger of his sister 's death on `` Murder 2 '' as he confronts her killer as `` Shine '' mourns her death with memories . The production was unlike any other No Limit release going outside Beats By The Pound seeking the talents of Rick Rock for `` Murder 2 '' . Paving the path to his career and time span on `` 13 Years '' goes into detail . The title track contains a looped sample to emphasise the rapid , tongue twisted hook highlighted the production by another outsider DJ Darryl . Being a product of the ghetto , `` Ghetto Child '' featuring Master P & Silkk The Shocker is humbling experience of overcoming obstacles destined for those growing in that environment . Mystikal takes excerpts and punchlines from some of his other songs to create `` Did I Do It '' taking credit as the author . `` We Got The Clout '' featuring Mia X is a great duet speaking on their status without a hook and or chorus still is one of the most memerable tunes of Unpredictable . Explaining his addiction of smoking on `` Still Smokin ' '' where smokers can relate to the events over the production by The Legendary Traxster that should have been extended to complete the session . The hook alone expresses the feeling and contents of the hook on `` U Ca n't Handle This '' because of his lyrical capabilities also evident on `` The Man Right Chea '' . Showing his sexual prowness on `` D*ck On The Track '' goes into a musical composition being conducted for comparison . Confessions of infidelity on `` Sleepin ' With Me '' featuring O'Dell confronts his actions of being in a relationship . Stepping up to classic New Orleans bounce style , `` It Years '' gives the album more depth as a near dance track incorporating mixing and scratching . With a smooth swing and layered guitars complementing the slow groove of `` Gangstas '' featuring Snoop Dogg & Master P completes the albums effectiveness and overall feel . Mystikal 's Unpredictable was just as titled as his emphasis or lyrical delivery was deemed necessary to agressively get the point across .	1
This is probably the tightest album too come out of the no-limit camp . His flowing is tighter than ever , and the production is tight , something that is rare in no-limit projects . The only flaws on this are the unwanted occasional appearances by no-limit couter-parts . Mystikal can DEFINITELY hold his own ground without them.Peace El-715	1
Think Mystikal cant come out with a classic album but he did . in 97 . He has an original style with the occassional outlashes of quick spit fire deliveries ( Unpredictable ) an aggressive style and a laid back style . Mystikal flows with ease . His sound is natural and doesnt seemed forced . The production on this album is ok but it is Mystikals skill and charisma that saves some songs like & quot ; 13 years & quot ; . Here we go adds some west coast flavor with E-40 and B Legit and is the best song on the album . Still Smokin is a nice chillin track . The title track is his best display of his fast flow and it comes off tight . The man Right Chea is o ; h yes tight . Must Give Instrumental to me ... ... . D ... on the Track is a nice song also . Other tight songs include Did I do it , Aint no limit , Murder 2 . Exceptional cd . Pick It Up .	1
Man , I 've never been so delighted with a South hip-hop album like I am with this one ! I always thought the dirty south did n't deliver good hip hop untill I heard 'bout Mystikal ! I loved his voice right away when I heard it ! I went out and searched for all his CD 's but the first 3 are n't available here so I went to England and picked them up there ... And I got to say it is worth it , these CD [ are good ] ! His ruff voice and superfast flow ca n't be compaired to any other rapper , you could say Mystikal is one of a kind ! And them ol ' dirty south beats on this joint are just smokin ' , it is an allmost flawless album ! I like every track , from the first to the last ! But if I have to give the best tracks I would have to say ... Damn , I ca n't choose , the whole CD 's great ! ! Really , you have to believe me , it does n't matter if you like east , west , north or south , you 'll like this , no matter what ! This is defenitly No Limit at it 's best ! Just buy it and find out !	1
This is a great album from the Man Right Chea himself , Mystikal ! Mystikal is tight and also hilarious with his crazy , flippin lyrics that work well with the tight beats on this cd ! The best song on here is Here We Go but most of the other songs are tight as well , including 13 Years , Unpredictable , Ai n't No Limit , Murder 2 ( which I think they messed the title up on . It should be Murderer 2 , but oh well ) , U Ca n't Handle This , The Man Right Chea , D**k On The Track , and Sleepin With Me . This is an excellent cd from No Limit , so if yoou like No Limit , or if you just like Mystikal , or if you just like crazy , hilarious lyrics , then check this album out today !	1
Mystikal was doing his thing with Jive before No Limit . Mind Of Mystikal was great and I didnt think was going to top that one until I heard this one . The first track Born 2 Be A Soldier was slammin ( even though they could have kept Silkk away from that song ) . Murder 2 picks up where Murderer on the first album left off as Mystikal lets off some steam at his sister 's killer . Unpredictable , 13 Years , U Cant Handle This , The Man Right Chea is Mystikal at his best . As usual Mystikal always has his smoke record on each album and Still Smokin ' is the best one out of all of them . D*** On The Track and It Yearns ( which samples T La Rock 's Its Yours ) are Mystikal flexing his lyrical muscles and he does a good job too . Even though this album is tight it does have its flaws . Silkk The Shocker should have never been on Aint No Limit and Born 2 Be A Soldier . Sleeping With Me is kind of bland and Gangstas ( features Snoop and Master P ) was soso . The album ends with a nice tribute to his sister which is called Shine . Bottom Line : Mystikal was at his best on Unpredictable which is his best album to date . He was hungrier here than he sounds now and the production was great . This unquestionably one of the best No Limit releases . Standout Tracks : BORN 2 BE A SOLDIER , MURDER 2 , 13 YEARS , UNPREDICTABLE , GHETTO CHILD , HERE WE GO , STILL SMOKIN , U CANT HANDLE THIS , THE MAN RIGHT CHEA , D*** ON THE TRACK and IT YEARNS .	1
Man this is a clean album . Born 2 Be A Soldier is the jam . The Man Right Chere is tight and pretty much the whole album . Mystikal is one of the hardest rappers on the tank . He put the rap game on lockdown with this album . He 's on fire . NO LIMIT 2000	1
& quot ; Unpredictable & quot ; is maybe the best thing No Limit has ever released . Mystikal shows why he is the most talented soldier on this well crafted sophmore album ( his first was released on Jive/Big Boy ) . There are MANY standout trax , one of which is the title track , on which Mystikal spits that rapid fire stutter-stop flow he 's mastered . & quot ; Here We Go & quot ; is a nice collabo wit B-Legit & amp ; E-40 , while & quot ; Gangstas & quot ; features Snoop on one of his first No Limit appearances . & quot ; Still Smokin & quot ; is his ode to those sticky-green leaves , while & quot ; Dick On The Track & quot ; features some clever word play . But the two STAND-OUT trax on here have to be & quot ; The Man Right Chea & quot ; and & quot ; Shine. & quot ; & quot ; The Man Right Chea & quot ; features an UNBELIEVABLE beat combined wit Mystikal 's signature flow , while & quot ; Shine & quot ; is a touching tribute to his sister , who was murdered while he was working on his first album . & quot ; Born 2 Be a Soldier & quot ; is yet another in what was the long running & quot ; Soldier & quot ; series of No Limit trax . Not much to this one , basically fast-forward material . But all in all , the high points on this album FAR outweigh the lows . In my opinion , this album is DEFINITELY a worthy buy .	1
Mystikal is back and after signing with JIVE , decides to join the No Limit Records team as well . This sophmore release takes no prisoners with a slicker and more enjoyable release from No Limit . Includes appearences from the No Limit rappers as well as the track & quot ; HERE WE GO & quot ; featuring E-40 , B-LEGIT , and MASTER P. Also includes & quot ; AI N'T NO LIMIT & quot ; featuring SILKK THE SHOCKER and MASTER P and SNOOP DOGG 's first appearence on the label , & quot ; GANGSTAS & quot ; also featuring MASTER P .	1
This is Mystikal 's 1st LP 4 No Limit . He has another on Big Boy Records . This CD IS HOTT . THE RHYMES THE BEATS . ITS LIKE NO LIMIT AND MYSTIKAL WERE MENT TO BE TOGETHER . Mystikal is the man right chea . This screaming man on the tank expresses his feelings 4 the man who killed his sister and just out right rapping . Also the man can free stlye . He shows his talent on here we go with here we go . Also on this cd you can find rhymes by master p , silkk the shocher , B-Legit , E-40 , SNOPP DOGG and the flow of O'Dell . But the song that is off the hook is STIL SMOKIN ' . A Song which is he has continued off his 1st cd . All i can say is that No Limit is in the spot light with this man he is the most popular man on No Limit . Pick up the CD and you will feel the flow of the Man they call Mystikal .	1
Just like every 2Pac , it sold as one of the best cds ever . Well , this is a awesome cd , a must have . This is a classic , and if u do n't have it , then i think u should get it soon .	1
If any one ever asks you what poetry means tell them to buy this album . all the songs are tight , even though pac wrote songs within 5mins and the beats he went over were not great just goes to show what talent he had . Clasic songs are nuttin to loose , open fire , and only fear is death ... go buy it	1
A NOTHER GREAT CD BY PAC WHICH GOT HIS BEST TRACK EVER ( I WONDER IF HEAVEN GOT A GHETO ) AND OTHER GREAT TRACKS LIKE OPEN FIRE , WHEN I GET FREE 2 AND DO FOR LUV , GO GET THIS CD , R.I.P Tupac	1
Your purchase should be based entirely on the question asked in the title of the album itself . Are you still down ? There have been a lot of albums released after Tupac 's death , and beginning with `` R U Still Down '' it is easy to tell that quality , original 2Pac material is becoming hard to come by . Tupac was immensely paranoid about his own death , and was absolutely convinced he was destined to die an early , tragic death . Because of the paranoia , he recorded as many songs as he could . It is amazing there have been so many cds released after his death , but it is easy to tell that Sug and Death Row are running out of quality material.With that said , I still think this is a great album . `` R U Still Down '' is very catchy , `` Hellrazr '' is an incredibly powerful narrative , and of course there is `` I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto , '' which I think is one of the best songs 2Pac ever created . The first cd is great , and shows Pac at some of his best . But , the second cd is not nearly as good , and really starts to drag at the later half . You know it is bad when they have to double up songs too ( `` I Wonder if Heave Got a Ghetto '' reappears on the second CD and is a so-so remix at best ) .Overall , you just have to ask yourself `` Am I still down ? '' If you ca n't get enough 2Pac , go right ahead and buy this album , you 'll likely not be disappointed . However , if you are starting to lose interest , this CD may not be worth the money , especially since the second CD is only mediocre . And finally , if you are new to Tupac , `` Me Against the World , '' `` All Eyez on Me , '' and his `` Greatest Hits '' CD are better starting points .	1

Tupac Shakur 's `` R U Still Down ? ( Remember Me ) '' came out in 1997 , one year after his passing . Production could of been better on this album , but lyrics and 26 tracks definetly make it an album for the collection if your a pac fan . Nice tracks on disc one include the title track `` R U still Down ? `` , `` Hellrazor '' a powerfull track with sick beats as an angry Pac lays down memorable lyrics . `` I wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto '' is an upbeat track where Pac talks about growing up , making money , and thug life . `` Nothing to Lose '' is another ill track , Pac verses `` Walk a mile in my shoes and you would be crazy too '' . `` Im getting money '' , [ and other songs ] close off disc one well . Disc 2 comes next , third track `` Hold on Be Strong '' , is an upbeat track sort of like `` Keep Ya Head Up '' . `` Do for Love '' feat . Eric Williams ( of blackstreet ) is a deep and memorable track about love . `` 16 on Death Row '' is a powerfull harcore track . `` When I get free II '' and `` Only fear of Death '' are both nice tracks and close off the album well . `` R U still Down '' is really an album dedicated to thug life , and Pac comes across powerfully , hes less poetic and less philosophical on this album then previous and later releases , this album is gangster rap at its best . What makes some of the later post-death albums ( Untill the end of Time , Better Dayz ) better in my opinion is they cover the time period ( 1994-1996 ) right before his death , while this album covers music from 1991-1994 period , when he was still progressing as an artist . `` R U still Down '' may not be for everyone , but if you love Pac like I do , you will appreciate this album .	1
This album is only for REAL TUPAC fans that pay attention to lyrics as well as the beats , while some of the beats were off , PAC 's voice shined alongside with his lyrical skills . This album has songs taken from when he was a teen , which is why some people might not feel him . But that 's cool because tupac was all about keeping it real and if you do n't feel this album then you are n't real . No , I am not implying that you have to like it , but you ca n't call it WACK even if you did n't appreciate his work . FOr people to sit there and say PAC was pretty weak on this album is like saying Michael Jordan was WACK back in his college days of hoops . My point being is you ca n't compare PAC then and now of course he 's different now-he 's matured even moreso.In all I do believe that REAL pac fans will LOVE this album because it displays Pac 's lyrical versitility from way back in the days.peacemic 12	1
this album is decent , by no means his best work , but it still has a fair amount of songs that can easily be concidered classic material , I dont think that it is as concistent as his previous release like all eyez on me and me against the world but is stilla great listen with few weak tracks . The best songs are as followshell razordo for lovei wonder if heaven got a ghettolie to kick it	1
there are two 2pac album who rock : '' all eyez on me '' and ... `` r u still down ? ( remeber me ) '' this album is super great.each song has it own image he own ... topic which means , tupac had heart for everything . he was a really great person.i am an artist on my starting way and i 'm from israel so i learnand get ideas for songs from pac . he rocks everything.i love this album in peticular b-cus of the songs , they still talks for real . so buy this as fast as you can , if you like tupac .	1
These are 26 cut recordings from Tupac 's earlier days taken from the years of 91 ' through to 94 ' . A long listen , but at the end you end up realising what a great loss of talent the world of hip hop suffered when the thug rapper was tragically gunned down back in 1996.Although these are songs that did n't make it to his earlier albums , this did not doubt my opinions of their quality - it was good material , although not consistent enough . This is more of a black and white album with no shades of gray , the good songs are great , the bad songs are terrible . 'R U Still Down ? ' does have its hot spots with tracks such as the unforgettable 'Do For Love ' , the religious 'I Wonder If Heaven Got ta Ghetto ' and the haunting and very mysterious 'Only Fear Of Death ' . Lyrically , at this stage of his life especially , Tupac 's views are more political and intellectual for the majority of the album since he had not quite reached his Death Row days just yet.The two disc set , in a way , tells a story of a man who was on the verge of something here , yet never got the time to fulfil it as you can tell some verses are incomplete and hesitant . Do not think this lessens the albums quality , as about 80 % of it is worth while . Although one of my favourite Tupac albums , 'R U Still Down ? ' in short is a sad and depressing story of a man who knew his end was to come far too soon .	1
This double disc released after his death contains material from 92-95 ( before his death row days ) . It has some good songs and no real weak ones on here . Features some of his old homies ( Big Syke , Spice 1 , Outlawz ) but it 's mostly just 2Pac . Has a few classic joints and is a definite for all fans . It 's good Afeni & Suge did n't mess w/ the beats and guests like they did on all the rest of his post-humous material . Production is by Edi , Soulshock did 3 each , Tony Pizzaro , 2Pac & Live Squad , Warren G , Johnny J each did 2 , and Akshun , QDIII , Mike mOsely , Ricky Rouse , Choo , Rasser , DJ Darryl , 2Pac all did 1 . It has 3 classics , 3 or 4 almost classics , 1 ok song and the rest are good . A must have rap album for all.DISC 1 # 2 - 8.5 # 3 - 8 # 4 - 9 ( f/ Val Young ) # 5 - 8 # 7 - 8 # 8 - 8.5 # 9 - 8 # 10 - 9.5 ( f/ Richie Rich - talking 'bout how to spit game & get some ) # 11 - 8.5 ( laid back track ) # 12 - 9 # 13 - 9DISC 2 # 1 - 10 ( classic f/ Big Syke ) # 2 - 7 # 3 - 8 # 4 - 8 ( f/ Big Syke & Spice 1 ( almost same verse Spice has on `` Tales from the Hood Sndtk '' ) # 5 - 9 # 6 - 8.5 ( slower song f/ BLACKstreet ) # 7 - 8 ( f/ Kadafi ( R.I.P . ) , Kastro , Napoleon , & Edi Amin { Dramacydal or Outlawz } ) # 8 - 9.5 # 9 - 8.5 # 10 - 8 ( same as # 7 on disc 1 ) # 11 - 10 ( classic ) # 13 - 10 ( very deep song and a classic - one of my favorite 2Pac songs ) Tupac Amaru Shakur - b . 6/16/71 - d. 9/13/96check all my reviews	1
I would like to also point out to you that I have a broad taste in hip-hop , I do also like many of the rappers you point to , as do many Tupac fans , so maybe it is you that is ignorant . Biggie has an amazing flow , but his lyrics are average , and he never really raps about anything meaningful . Nas is , in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever , I love NWA as well , but none of them had the charisma and presence Tupac had . As for him contradicting himself , you do n't think he noticed that ? Everyone contradicts themselves , he was n't afraid to show it either , because he said what was on his mind at the time . Have you ever listened to his lyrics , he genuinely believed that women should be treated with respect , yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stands he had ( listen to Temptations on Me Against The World ) . He was the realest to ever pick up the mic , and not just that he was also a well above average lyricist , anyone who says otherwise is talking s**t. Buy Me Against The World and listen to him at his lyrical peak , he was not wack , I can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to Biggie . Get over it , the beef died when they both died , it was 9 years ago , I feel sorry for people like you who ca n't appreciate both of their music . this album is n't his best but is still a good one but needs some work.R.I.P . 2PAC	1
I 'm surprised how this album has been accepted . Lets not get carried away with `` his legacy '' and his tragic death and all the controversy surrounding 2Pac . Everybody already knows about all that.R U Still Down is my favorite album by 2Pac . Makaveli and All Eyez are both 5 stars to me , but R U Still Down is more raw . Especially as far as the production is concerned . A lot of people are apparently disappointed by the production on this album . I find it to have a sense of being more genuine , and more fitting than the other posthumous releases . This is probably since Pac actually had some input on creating these tracks . Overall , the sound of the album ( and individual tracks ) is more whole . Listening to R U Still Down helps to show how much of a project Makaveli and All Eyez On Me were . Those two albums were obviously much more orchestrated and calculated , and designed to provoke in every way . They were much more surgical and precise.R U Still Down , however , is just straight hip-hop . There 's scratching on here ! There 's no name dropping , or disses aimed at specific people . Just general expression of different emotions . Instead of a song about Tipper Gore or Bad Boy ( for example ) specificly , you get the more general ( and undated ) song about the struggles in general with government oppression or social commentary or anger or whatever . This is technically easier for a listener to relate to , since hardly any of us actually know Tipper Gore or Puffy , etc ... ..but somehow the audience does n't want that . wtf ? `` Thug Style '' is probably the single song by Pac to most adhere to the street chronicling and nostalgic waxing scenarios in hip-hop . And at the same time , he 's replying directly to everybody giving this album bad reviews : 'you do n't know my style . 'Just because All Eyez sounded one way , or Makaveli sounded one way , or Strictly 4 My sounded one way ... .do n't get it twisted . Its art . You got ta be open . Do n't expect artists to be how you want them to be . You can not expect anything from art , all that does is turn it into a product instead of art.The lyrics on this album are of things more accesible to the common listener . The production is reminiscent of earlier 2Pac and more of a east-coast style of the early 90 's ( pre-Death Row ) . There 's more lyrical acrobatics than usual ( Let Them Thangs Go ) , and more of the same techincal ( Lie to Kick It ) and simple formats ( F*** All Y'All ) we 're used to from 2Pac.If you ignore all the hype and controversy surrounding the artist , and drop your expectations of him ... just listen to the music on R U Still Down for the music , then maybe you can re-discover the best MC with this album .	1
prolly best album next 2 all eyez on me and the 7 day theorymy favorite junts is fake ass bitches , hold on be strong , hellrazor , and losin it	1
This album is good , but not Pac 's best . This album is probably worth getting . It 's the kind of album that some people like and some people do n't .	1
Tupac 's mother did a great work on putting this Cd together . Most of this material are unreleased songs from around 1994 . For the people that are really down with MR. Makaveli , you must own this item it highlights a phase of tupac 's life . & quot ; Hellrazor & quot ; , listen and learn .	1
Great Tape . R U Still Remember me ? Some unreleased material . Eerie , Sad , Happy , everything is on there , the good the bad and Da ' Ugly . Good album , Would Recommend .	1
This is one of my more favorite cds that came out after his death . it ` s great and as the rest of them to follow as well .	1
Came out in 1997 , the records were recorded during the years around `` Strictly '' time . I did n't get this until last year because I could n't find it anywhere and it took me a while to grow up on it and after all these months , I finally did . Since it came out in 1997 , it leaves me asking the question why its releases were never featured on 2pac 's Greatest Hits album . After all , the releases he released were all great tracks and deserved to be on his Greatest Hits album . Many people did n't like this track because it sounded different from all of 2pac 's other work but to me , it sounded like the work 2pac would usually do , just in his younger days . This CD provides many great unreleased tracks that are groovy to listen and dance to and has the most party tracks I 've seen 2pac release on an album . Some of my classics on this are- Hellrazor , I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto , Nothing to Lose ( the best song on the CD ) , Lie to Kick It , Hold On Be Strong , Fake Ass Bithes , Do for Love , Nothin but Love , When I Get Free II and Only Fear of Death . I would recommend this to true 2pac fans as it will take a while to grow on it since its the present , not the past ( many people do n't really like listening to old music now but I find I enjoy it ) but it is definately worth a listen . Peace to Rap 's finest rapper , R.I.P .	1
It really sucks with Mr.Shakur long gone , no politics in Hip Hop / Rap ! ? Shakur was a better activist than Public Enemy or Cube , the true thug 'd out Outlaw , it also sucks with Eazy & Big Poppa being gone aswell . I would like to also point out to you that I have a broad taste in hip-hop , I do also like many of the rappers you point to , as do many Tupac fans , so maybe it is you that is ignorant . Biggie has an amazing flow , but his lyrics are average , and he never really raps about anything meaningful . Nas is , in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever , I love NWA as well , but none of them had the charisma and presence Tupac had . As for him contradicting himself , you do n't think he noticed that ? Everyone contradicts themselves , he was n't afraid to show it either , because he said what was on his mind at the time . Have you ever listened to his lyrics , he genuinely believed that women should be treated with respect , yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stands he had ( listen to Temptations on Me Against The World ) . He was the realest to ever pick up the mic , and not just that he was also a well above average lyricist , anyone who says otherwise is talking s**t. Buy Me Against The World and listen to him at his lyrical peak , he was not wack , I can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to Biggie . Get over it , the beef died when they both died , it was 10 years ago , I feel sorry for people like you who ca n't appreciate both of their music . this album is n't his best but is still a good one but needs some work . The joint Open Fire featuring Scarface is a heavy hitting joint by our beloved Pac , Hellrazor featuring Stretch & Val Young is another tight joint about stress in the projects & sparking up dubs , Nothin ' But Love featuring Dave Hollister is a tight block party Bay area song about drinking Hennessey , smoking on some Dope & Hustlin ' & my very favorite When I Get Free II featuring Outlawz is a phat joint thats just Krazy & has the best beat ! Shakur 's greatest joints 4 Disc . 1 are 1 , *2 , 3 , *4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 & 13.Shakur 's greatest joints 4 Disc . 2 are 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , *8 , 9 , 10 , *11 & 13 , oh yeah ( R.I.P . ) .	1
After the 7 day theory was R U Still Down.This 26 track albumwas hard but a diffrence side of pac came out on I Wonder if hip-hopgot ghetto.It Still a Great Album	1
THIS CD IS A SAD REMINDER OF 2PAC 's MUSIC , BUT LUCKILY THEY PUT ALBUMS TOGETHER TO SHARE THE GREATEST RAPPER 'S MUSIC WITH US THAT WAS NEVER RELEASED . R U STILL DOWN HAS MANY GOOD SONGS ALSO LIKE : OPEN FIRE R U STILL DOWN HELLRAZOR THUG STYLE WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE [ interlude ] I WONDER IF HEAVEN GOT A GHETTO DO 4 LOVE ONLY FEAR OF DEATH WHEN I GET FREE III ADVISE YOU BUY THIS CD EVN THOUGH IT 'S HARDER TO FIND NOW . GOOD CD .	1
This album came out after 2pacs death . I believe they are unreleased tracks . Their some pretty good tracks on this double disc album . It 's best to get this album to add to your cd collection !	1
I read some review where people said it was rushed . Tupac wrote these songs before he died . These songs were never altered , sold , poluted , or reprised by any other producer/artist . Eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent 's to a song or album . I believed it was somewhat of a cry from the grave , or in a sense final words to poets and fans alike , who could benifet from his wisdom . This album is not be appreciated for its abilty to entertain a club or crowd . And not all rap albums arent supposed to . I believe this album to be the true voice of Tupac after his grave . It is familier of his `` Me Against the World '' album . I urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car , play at a party or while cleaning their house TO NOT BUY THUS ALBUM , But anyone who wants to know what Tupacs real future for his music to do so ! Please lets not poision his legacy lets uphold it .	1
RU Still Down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died . Pacs vocals are not sped up and the production sounds like a 2pac album . I could list this whole album as the best songs but the standouts to me are RU Still Down , Hellrazor , Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto hip hop version , Open Fire , When I Get Free 1 and 2 , Do For Love , F=== All Yall , well just forget it . Every song on here is a standout in my eyes . Pac 's albums would go downhill from here .	1
2pac is the most lyrical and heartful rapper i have ever listen to . They have Amaru Records still going strong with 8 released 2pac cds since his death . This one is another classic with my favorite songs like `` Open fire '' , R U Still Down ( Remember Me ) , `` Hellrazor '' , `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto '' , and `` Definition of A Thug N*** '' . Well , im gon na stop boring the crap out of you all . This just shows you how good and kick ass this cd is . In my opinion if ya want a 2pac cd that has come out after his death this and the 7 day theory is the ones you want , peace out . RIP 2pac Amaru Shakur .	1
Any true Pac 's fan will loves this album in the first time hear , it is hard for me to decided which one of the cd 's is the best , cuz both of them are GREAT ! ! ! But the one thing for sure is , this album is my third favourite after `` Me Againts TheWorld '' & `` All Eyes On Me '' . Although most of the songs in this album are remixes but they are still great , might be the reason for this , is because the original versions is too sloppy , so that 's why its never appeared in the previous albums , and if it 's so then this album is true definitions of Lost Tapes . Unlike the others Pac 's posthomous album , this one is far from commercial approach . You do n't have to worry about the new beats because it 's still carrying the sounds of Pac 's album before the Death Rows years . We should give a big props to Ricky Rouse who makes a magic touch for the most of songs with his excellent guitar plays , which not only great complement for the songs but also turns Pac 's lyrics into vivid picture that you can see clearly like movie on the big screen . If you already have `` Me Againts The World '' & `` All Eyes On Me '' , you must have this album or if you wan na start hearing Pac , this is not bad choice .	1
Though , this album was rushed out after the sucess of the Makeveli album , it still contains some gems on it . Unfortunately , the production ( lack there of ) is average at best.Disc one starts off nice with `` Open Fire '' `` R U Still Down '' and `` Hellrazor '' ( which is a headnodder and lyrically tight ) , I like both versions of I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto but prefer Disc 2 's version slightly better w/Brownstone singing backround . `` Nothing To Lose '' is definitely the best track on Disc One . That track along w/Hellrazor is typical 2PAC at his best . The next three tracks on Disc One however , needed better production period . I loved the fact that they added `` Definition of A Thug Nigga '' ( which was previously only available only on the `` Poetic Justice '' soundtrack which is one of PAC 's hardest joints.Disc 2 `` Do For Love '' and the hip hop version of `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto '' were the chosen singles to be released for radio the obvious bangin track is the reggae flavored `` When I Get Free pt 1 '' which is the slamminest track on there . Takes me back to A Soldier Story Pt . 1 days . Too bad it is n't actually PAC 's voice on there rappin but the track is hot nonetheless . `` 16 On Death Row '' is typical politcal PAC w/a hidden message of course , `` When I Get Free Pt 2 was okay but compared to the first version on the same side , it 's no comparison . and `` Only Fear of Death ends the Disc 2 nicely . The song almost gives you an insight into PAC 's state of mind before his death.This album had the potential to do much better with better production but PAC 's songs like always , seems to supercede even weak production .	1
2pac 's best album . I love his music and this album is a classic . combining gansgta rap to his angry voice . Buy this one if u r a BIG fan of 2pac . also reminds of good times with Biggie ( B.I.G ) I tried to get it from different stores when it came out but this album was always OUT OF STOCK finally i got it ( along time ago ) and It is still in my CD player . Never got out from there.For me this is the best rap album EVER ! and also 2pac 's greatest work .	1
It 's very much a patchwork , but I like the whole thing , there 's alot of those various voices Pac used to play with and theres different types of beats that are mostly good , some dj quik , one with the wind parade sample that Black Moon used for Buckemdown , and then a bunch of beats by some group of guys that use a lot of guitars , but I like them . 16 on Death Row , When I get Free , Wonder if Heaven got a ghetto , etc : 'typical ' Pac fare in one way , lots about dying , but there 's also a variety of differen phases , some of that real melodramatic `` brenda got a baby '' type stuff , before he perfected his drama . Both cds are really good to listen to , even if there 's no real `` hits ''	1
i do agree with a earlier reveiw that the first disk is verry good.if they took do for love , ready 4 whatever , and the second version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto , along with loosing my mind , when i get free and the interludes and cramed the in the first cd this would actually be a tight cd.but it still deserves 4 stars even though its not a single disc .	1
First of all ive got to say that cd1 is'nt better than cd2.But overall this album is not that bad , not the best 2pac album of course for several reasons.It was released in 1997 but the songs are from 1994 , some of the songs lacked what id expect of him.I liked do 4 luv and hellrazor , when i get free2 , hold on and some others.But this album has some really good beats and tunes , get it but dont be to disa pointed about some of it .	1
Why do Amazon randomly delete reviews , there was nothing wrong with my previous review , and in fact the guy above me actually used a whole paragraph of my old review for himself ! This is the best compilation of posthumous Tupac songs , there are some serious classics on here , how some of these missed the cut for Strictly 4 my Nig*az and 2Pacalypse Now , i do n't know . My favourites include the title track , I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto ( with the verse they recycled for Changes ) , Hold On Be Strong , Do For Love , Fake A*s Bit*hes , Hellrazor , Lie To Kick It etc ... Probably the track he goes deepest on is Only Fear Of Death , which is another eerie track in which Pac predicts his early death.This album is nothing like his other posthumous releases , the beats are as he intended and most importantly no one has messed around with his lyrics ( Eminem ) . He may not have considered these tracks to be worthy of release when alive , but there are still many gems on here , highly recommended .	1
Before I begin , I 'd like to state something . Everyone has a right to say what they feel . It 's the FIRST ammendment of the constitution . numero uno . Why should these guys be denied that right ? Simply because they have a problem with the system ? OK , we 'll change the ammendment to & quot ; freedom of religion , speech , press , and assembly UNLESS you talk smack about the wretched current shape of things . Seriously , that ammendment lets you right these reviews , you 're exercising the right you think they should be denied if all you do is rant about them being & quot ; unamerican & quot ; . That having been said , this is a very good CD . When I first got it , I was n't too crazy about it . The vocals did n't really hit , largely because I could n't understand them , and I would go off and listen to something else for a while . After I had gotten thru this CD a few times though , it really started to grow on me , and it 's becoming one of my favorite punk albums . Sure , it gets a bit repetitive , and I do n't like how they diss Davey Havock from AFI ( & quot ; davey destroyed the punk scene & quot ; ) , but the musical quality overall is just awesome . If you 're a brainwashed propaganda spouting conservative , then no , this album is not for you . But if you like well done music with a purpose , then pick this up . The best tracks are & quot ; you 've got to die for the government & quot ; , & quot ; rotten future & quot ; , and & quot ; f*** police brutality & quot ; .	1
This is the first anti-flag album and I didnt like it at first , but it quickly grew on me . This album is less accessable than their current work , but still great . Anti-flag are your classic anti authoritarian , anti patriotism , etc , punk band . Their main influences being the sex pistols and the uk subs , they create brilliant album . The highlight here is really the title track , you 've got to die for your government , which is an ironic attack on the government , reminiscent of the sex pistols ' God save the queen and the dead kennedys ' kill the poor , among others . I know a lot of people dont like them , because they are getting really popular , but so what , just because most of their audience are posers , doesnt make the message any less valid , or the music any less great . And to all those patriotic idiots , LOL , maybe one day you 'll wake up . Probably not , though .	1
Okay , in response to a few people , while Anti-Flag may not be revolutionary , being revolutionary in an age where almost every formula has been tried is a difficult thing to do . What they are , however , is a very thought-provoking band ... and what 's so wrong with getting people to think ? Secondly , this is NOT a band for those who got into punk via Blink 182 . I 've been listening to punk rock since I was 14 , initially with Sex Pistols bootlegs like & quot ; We 've Cum For Your Children , & quot ; eventually moving on to the Clash 's earlier works , Minor Threat , Dead Kennedys , D.I. , and a slew of other old school bands . Now , six years later , I embrace the philosophies put forth by Anti-Flag . These guys are doing today what DK did in the '80s . And the reason to buy this CD is not because you hate America ... buy this CD because you love the American people , and because you 're sick to death of seeing them mistreated and slaughtered by their own government .	1
I personally like their newer stuff better because they christened their sound over time and Justin 's voice got better but he has always been a political genius and it shows here as much as in any other album . The lyrics are incredible in almost every song but the best songs are You 'd Do The Same , Die For The Government , Red White and Brainwashed , F*** Police Brutality and my personal favorite Punk By The Book . Also Drink Drank Punk is a funny one and She 's My Little Go-go Dancer is a good song but the lyrics are kind of dumb . Most of the other songs are also good for a listen except for a few like Your Daddy Was A Rich Man Your Daddy 's F***ing Dead which to me just get annoying . Overall this is a great PUNK album but I personally prefer albums such as Underground Network and The Terror State	1
Anti-flag is one of the few truly punk-core bands that are still running these days , and this is one of their greatest albums , maybe the greatest AF album of all times ... that for sure suckas , and you can find them in Fat Wreck Chords , BYO and a bunch of independent labels out there mija ! ... so buy it or steal it from a punk guy who often likes to forget stuff ... ..	1
I love this band they get better and better finally a new school band with a good messege amazing	1
Those are the words that describe this legendary , and often disputed , punk band . Alot of people accuse these guys of being non-patriotic , but the fact of the matter is these guys want change and they are willing to fight for it . Die for the Government reminds me alot of the Sex Poseurs 1st release , except these guys actually write there own stuff.1 . Youd Do The Same 5/52 . Youe Got To Die For The Government 6/53 . Drink Drank Punk 5/54 . Rotten Figure 5/55 . Safe Tonight 4/56 . Red White And Brainwashed 6/57 . Dayed Destroyed The Punk Scene 6/58 . Summer Squatter Go Home 5/59 . Shes My Little Go Go Dancer 4/510 . Police State In The USA 5/511 . Punk By Hate Book 5/512 . F*** Police Brutality 5/513 . Im Being Watched By The CIA 5/514 . Kill The Rich 5/515 . No More Dead 4/516 . Confused Youth 5/517 . Your Daddy Was A Rich Man Your Daddys F***ing Dead 5/5This is an excellent CD which one can listen to all the way through . No skipping tracks here , no this is a gold mine of pure punk adrenaline . This is definately worth your time and money , and I strongly recomend purchasing this incredible CD by this incredible punk band . All hail Anti-Flag ! ! !	1
With this ten dollar CD purchase , I replaced the import vinyl version I purchased back in the 70s for basically the same amount of dough . `` Five Leaves Left '' is probably one of the best debut albums anyone 's ever produced ( there 's a list I need to make ) , and nearly four decades after it was released it sounds amazingly fresh . `` Cello Song , '' `` When the Day is Done , '' `` Man in a Shed , '' ... I could rave about individual songs but the truth is there 's not a clunker in the bunch.A lot of CD collections have been compiled of Drake 's music , with added outtakes , demos and such . I think the best way to listen to `` Five Leaves Left '' and `` Bryter Layter '' are to listen to the songs in the order that they were originally presented . A lot of musicians cite Drake as an influence , but his vocal phrasing , poetic lyrics and odd guitar tunings make his music like no other I 've ever heard . Some find his music depressing , I find it like a rainy Sunday afternoon ... melancholy but much needed for growth .	1
In my opinion , `` Five Leaves Left '' was Nick Drake 's best effort as far as attaining a balance between the arrangements of his songs in the studio and his guitar playing . Whereas his songs on `` Bryter Layter '' were suffocated by overproduction and orchestration and `` Pink Moon '' was notoriously underproduced , `` Five Leaves Left '' has just the right balance between accompaniment and his great guitar work . Songs like `` Three Hours '' have percussion that does n't interfere with or bury Nick 's guitar in the mix , allowing the listener to check out his amazing fingerpicking technique . The songs are really strong too , songs like `` Saturday Sun '' ( an example of Nick Drake 's rarely heard piano playing ) have such great melodies that they stick with you . This album also includes the eerily prophetic `` Fruit Tree '' , which could serve as a fitting epitaph for Nick Drake himself . In it he sings about being out of step with the times he was in and eventually achieving fame and appreciation after death , which is exactly what happened to him . The haunting last line , `` They 'll stop and stare when you 're gone ... '' is chilling . The title of the album refers to a saying on the box of the brand of cigarettes Nick smoked , but it has also been noted that Nick died five years after the release of this album in 1969 . Like the song `` Fruit Tree '' , this coincidence makes you wonder . It 's amazing that Nick Drake was 21 years old when this album was recorded and he already displayed such talent on the guitar . It 's also amazing that he wrote these songs at such a young age . I would recommend this album to anyone regardless of what their musical tastes are . There is something about Nick Drake 's music that stays with you long after you hear it .	1
Nick Drake came on the folk scene at a time where most folkies wrote songs inspired by blues and country just as much as traditional music . Drake , however , did the unthinkable by mixing jazz and even classical influences with his music . His guitar playing here is strong ( actually quite technical at times ) and its wonderfully backed up by strings , piano , and various other instruments.This is progressive folk . Much like progressive rock , it combines its sound with music not normally associated with that particular genre : in this case classical , chamber , and jazz . This is in direct opposition to the country and blues based music of Bob Dylan and such . For this reason , this album does not sound very dated at all . In fact it could have been released today , in the 70s , the 90s ect . Psychedelic rock and acid rock are so rooted in the 60s , they now sound like artifacts of that era where as this music , which resisted the norms of the time , sounds just as fresh as when it was first released.Even though the lyrics do n't seem to be personal when you listen to them , the music says otherwise . The album has a very somber atmosphere , most likely associated with Nick Drake 's condition . It 's well-known that he died from a pill overdose , and some even think it was a suicide . He only released a few albums but all of them reveal a tortured mind , expressing itself the best way it could , through music.Please be advised that this is not a folk album in the traditional sense . It is n't even a folk-rock album . Nothing rocks hard here : it does n't need to . In a way this music is just as advanced as most progressive rock . If you 're willing to take a chance on a very unique sounding album , then this is a great purchase .	1
There are four Nick Drake albums , and I think that this is probably his best work ( though they are all wonderful ) .A lot of hooks will leave this one in your CD player . From the opener , & quot ; Time Has Told Me , & quot ; the music is irresistable . That song has great lyrics , perhaps somewhat fortelling of his untimely death : & quot ; Time has told me not to ask for more ... because someday our oceans will find the shore ... & quot ; It 's lyrics like this that will leave him remembered as a remarkable singer-songwriter.Drake 's voice is deep and haunting . His guitar is surprisingly rich . A few of the songs also have orchestral accompanyment ( Way to Blue , Fruit Tree , etc . ) and they are equally gorgeous . Fruit Tree , I think , is one of the most sad and beautiful songs I 've ever heard . It makes my heart heavy every time I hear it . And & quot ; Man In a Shed & quot ; is one of the most fantastically catchy tunes I 've heard to date . It 's enough to make me hit the repeat button on my player multiple times.If you want to get some of Drake 's music , this is a good place to start . And though I think most people will probably buy & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; first because of the Volkswagon commercial , I think & quot ; Five Leaves Left & quot ; has the edge , and fans of the two-minute-ditty & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; certainly wo n't be disappointed to digest this album .	1
A very pleasant album , immaculately produced , perhaps a masterpiece of British folk . The songs are nice and pleasing , very pleasant to listen to : relaxing . Drake 's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly , augmented by fine string and wind arrangements ( though they can be slightly overbearing at times ) , and bright splashes of piano . Drake 's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry . His vocals are distinctive , very English , and a good medium for communicating this poetry , especially with this musical backing . It 's a nice package . Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk .	1
In a recent review , I calledTape from Californiaby Phil Ochs a classic for its inventive , barouqe treatment of folk . On the other side of the pond , England , around the same time , Nick Drake created another classic , Five Leaves Left.The similarities between Ochs and Drake are interesting . Both expaneded the guitar strumming scope of folk music with orcherstration , both suffered from depression -- a much harder illness to treat in 1969 . And both died young , Ochs from suicide and Drake from an accidental drug overdoese.But Drake was more musically subtle . He wrote about deeply personal issues , not the political and social ideas Ochs choose , and while Tape From California features hapsichords and huge scores , Drake used quiet and yes depressed string sections . Listen to `` Riverman '' to hear Drakes more pastoral approach.The quiet muted sound is from a quiet muted man . Drake often sings his Keatsian lyrics in a low tone , just above a whisper . You get the shy sadness of a broken young man in both the resignation of music and words.Drake is not trying to overcome his sadness , but rests in it , sitting still to witness whatever beauty he may be able to see and feel . His music indicates that was a lot , and there is a classical grace and vurnerability to all the songs . Through these he is able make you experiance his own sadness and resignation , and immediately , you connect with Five Leaves Left.Drake was also an excellent guitar player , and a lot of his songs have the impulse of celtic jazz . Backed by memebers of Pentangle and Fairport Convention , two of the best jazz-folk outfits in England then , these songs contain an expert ressonce that take them way beyond average folk .	1
I was lucky enough to hear to original LP when I was younger as my father was a huge fan of the ever thoughtful and often melancholy genius of Drake . There 's nothing I can add that has n't already been said with one exception . The re-master of this album is showing its colors in that there is a noticeable gain hiss from the original session tapes . This may have been a problem to deal with in the late 90 's when this was re-mastered and re-issued . But with todays `` de-hiss '' technology , it effectively eliminates this slight noise that blankets the entire album . They really should reconsider re-re-mastering this album , again , from the original tapes , and not from this master to make this a completely perfect album in both execution and final CD ( or DVD Audio ) pressed result .	1
It 's impossible to me , an educated 29 years-old south american man , describe the fellings that been brought to me by Five Leaves Left . As all Nick Drake 's records we got here sadness , shyness , fragility and above it all , beauty . But it 's a new kind of beauty , which come from soul , and it 's not just coming from Drake 's soul . This music makes our souls more beautifull than before and I ca n't explain it with simple words . Songs like River Man are modern opus of the century , with the strings floating over the ground , made by Drake 's voice and guitar , leading us to a state of grace and compassion . I know it seems corny , but it 's true . Buy this cd now and be prepared to see the world by another perpective .	1
What a revelation this was , to discover such a talent many years after the artist 's death . Now a personal favorite artist of mine for a few years now . Today , and not too long ago , one can hear artists who were deeply inspired by Nick Drake , who to me has one of the most peaceful , but tortured voices that I have ever encountered . During the time that Nick Drake was alive , his music was n't nearly as appreciated as it is today . This album , his debut , is also his best . Bryter Layter 's pace seems a bit more sped up , and lacks his better songs . 'Pink Moon ' was my first album by Nick Drake , but personally , I just do n't care for the more stripped down sound . This one contains weeping strings and soft vocals , it 's surprising that songs like `` River Man '' or `` Way to Blue '' were n't hit songs in their day . Those two are also two of Nick Drake 's finest achievements . Maybe with recent artists like the late Elliott Smith and Iron and Wine , we can appreciate Drake 's incredible talent that much more . Not only was he an incredible singer , but the strings sections by Robert Kirby , on this release is just simply gorgeous . The great Robert Thompson , of Fairport Convention , also lent his talent , playing guitar . I can not think of any artist with a more piercing voice than Drake 's , one that can split a Man 's heart . You could n't say that about any hard-core band or heavy metal group that has more shock value than they have songwriting skills . No , and for me it is hard to think of any other folk artist with a more powerful delivery . This man , Nick Drake , was a genius , who died way too young at age 26 . At least people are still discovering his music . Whether these people are generally happy people , or sad , Nick Drake 's music always touches the heart . As with most artists , one only wonders what could have been if Nick Drake was still living today . He could have become one of the finest singer/songwriters , although to me , with only 3 albums , he is just that .	1
Yes , I confess , like a lot of people I came to Nick Drake 's music because of that car commercial . And , despite my aversion to `` greatest hits '' packages , the first disk I bought was `` Way to Blue . '' I do n't have any excuse for buying a `` best of , '' aside from monetary restrictions , but I do n't feel bad for being sold an album because of a Volkswagon ad -- Carlos Santana once said it does n't matter how you get the music as long as you *get* it , and he 's a guy who openly admits to first really hearing John Coltrane 's music in a Jeep commercial.I eventually did get the music . As I listened to `` Way to Blue , '' though , I discovered that the songs I liked the most , `` River Man '' and `` Cello Song '' and `` Way to Blue '' all came from the same album : `` Five Leaves Left . '' I finally went out and got it and I 'm stunned at how much atmosphere , how much tone , how much sensation Drake achieves with so little . `` Five Leaves Left '' is a flat-out amazing record . It sounds like the nostalgized memories of a passionate romance after a bitter break-up -- and I mean that in the best way . `` River Man '' is a song that never fails to beautifully cause my spirits to sag ; likewise `` Saturday Sun '' consistently brings them right back up again . A sad and beautiful bunch of music .	1
Every song on this album reeks of sadness . Not the put on pale make-up and put on a show sadness but a genuine rejection of the idea that life has any capacity to be enjoyed . `` Time has Told Me '' has a wistfulnes that perhaps the woman he imagines in the song will take him out of the doldrums but the hope ends there . `` River Man '' is a poetic dirge that perhaps ( using poetic license ) that the riverman of the underworld mentioned in Greek mythology will take him away from this life . `` Day is Done '' imagines , perhaps , a typical day where at the end nothing has been accomplished and is now coming to an end . `` Fruit Tree '' worries about impending fame . Even the very idea of being recognized by people brings on more sadness ( Nick Drake rarely performed live though his performances were legendary though unfortunately no known recordings exist ) . Though his lyrics are closer to romantic era English poetry and not the wild flights of the imagination of Syd Barrett , this album and all other releases by Nick Drake still hold up . His music is reflective and poignant rather than pointlessly morbidly depressive . The orchestral embellishments enhance the music . Five Leaves Left is my favorite Nick Drake album though I 'd reccomend them all .	1
Five Leaves Left was Nick Drake 's first record , and was released in 1969 . He left Cambridge to record it , a year before he would finish his degree.. but music was his love , so he followed it to London , and the rest is history . The album was titled after the saying on the inside of cigarette papers at that time -- when it said `` Five Leaves Left , '' it was time to buy more.Where Nick Drake 's second album , Bryter Layter , is very jazzy and complex , with multiple , somewhat upbeat arrangements , and Pink Moon , Nick 's third album , is very stark and somewhat quiet , with really only the man and his guitar , this album , his debut , is somewhat somber , melodic , and classically-influenced , with a sort-of baroque , heavy feel . Most arrangements here were done by Nick 's friend and collaborator , Robert Kirby.Beginning with Time Has Told Me , a beautiful psuedo-love song with an uncharacteristic country-style twang ( actually Richard Thompson on electric guitar , the Fairport Convention member being of the same band as the man who 'discovered ' Nick Drake at a show , Ashley Hutchings ) , the album goes on its lovely course with the second track , River Man , a beautiful , lulling song which has a true feeling of motion . Some say the song might be about the river in Cambridge that one must cross to get from one part of the city/campus to another.. in any event a gorgeous , inventive song.The haunting and melodic Three Hours appears next , a song written about a friend of Nick 's , and featuring some great guitar work . Then comes Way to Blue , a classical , sweeping song of great beauty , it enchants with its violin arrangements.Day is Done ( which in the past couple of years has been covered by the talented Norah Jones ) is a pretty song with wonderful guitar-work . The next track , Cello Song , is my favorite song here . It is absolutely gorgeous , from the first notes to the last , and with its intensive , rootsy percussion and full arrangements , really is a classic Drake song , up with Pink Moon , Fly and Black Eyed Dog as one of his most recognizable `` trademark '' songs.The Thoughts of Mary Jane is a whimsical song with light wind instruments as accompaniment . An even more whimsical version appears on the 1986 cd ( and part of the Fruit Tree box set ) , Time of No Reply . ( Drake had rejected that studio version in favor of the one that appears here . ) Man in a Shed is a simple unrequited love song , and Fruit Tree is a brooding , almost prophetic ( in Nick 's case ) song about post-humous fame . Like Van Gogh , Drake was destined to live his life in obscurity , the intrinsic value and beauty and importance of his art unrecognized by the world until he was gone . It is such a sad story , but the only consolation is that his music is being heard now , by more and more people all the time . And we can all hope that somewhere he can hear us saying , `` Thank you , '' and `` it is so beautiful ! '' The closing song here , Saturday Sun , is a playful and pretty piano track which nicely rounds out the album.All in all an interesting , multi-faceted album with depth and innovation , beauty and soul . There is something timeless here , something elemental . Those who have heard Drake 's music know there is something special about it , a kind of quiet mystery which reaches into your heart and intrigues it until you find yourself just wanting to listen.. in the morning , at night , on a rainy afternoon in autumn . The mood , the essence of Drake 's work just seems to suit our days here on this earth so well.. he sings of seasons , of time , of love and love lost , of hope and of friendship , of hardship and trying to overcome it , of loneliness and heartache.. the stuff of life . The mystery , the joy , the pain , the love , all of it . As we live our lives , as we do our work , as we explore and wander and inquire , as we love our loves , win sometimes and lose others , have our ups and downs , we find that music is great company , and Drake 's music , and company , is some of the best . Anyone who considers buying any of Drake 's albums should really consider getting Fruit Tree , which includes all four official Drake releases . Once you hear his music , anything less might not be enough.Highly recommended .	1
nick drakes debut album sounds like the starting point for a lost cult legend . even though it 's nicks first album , he sounds as though he has been recording his entire life . it 's a very sad album ( although not as sad as pink moon , mind you ) , but includes many more instruments than later works . there is n't a bad number on this entire album . every song is a work of art . nicks lyrics ( even though they 're much more like poetry ) sound as though they were written in the 17th century . they really are works of genius and beauty , and nick was without a doubt , one of the greatest poets of the 20th century .	1
Considering that Nick Drake 's music is utterly breathtaking , emotionally connecting & life-affirming as it is . It seems truly remarkable that his music was virtually ignored on its initial release . A chronically shy person how expressed himself via his music , his breathy vocals , and gorgeous acoustic guitar arrangements , were ( without me understating this ) Exceptional ... .yet his songs of mortality , introspection , dark nights of the soul and mysterious haunting melodies did n't connect with the record buying public some 30 years ago , and this album , his debut ... .only sold a minuscule 2000 copies ( ? ? ! ! ! ) on release . Nick would go on to record a further 2 albums of melancholic beauty , with still none of the sales to sustain his career . What followed was a man who plunged further and further into depression , and would eventually overdose on anti-depressants ( aged 26 ) , and only over the last few years have the plaudits and celebrity musicians expressed their admiration and love for Nick 's work , ( even so far as to having a Documentary about his life , persented by 'Brad Pitt ' ) .Nick was one of the few English musicians at the time , taking Folk music and moving into the new wave of 'Progressive Folk ' ( introspective , intricate music that added new layers of musical and lyrical complexity ) , from the first song `` Time Has told me '' , Nick intones in a world weary vocal over a lovely understated acoustic section `` Time has told me , You 're a rare rare find , A troubled cure ... .For a troubled mind '' , beautifully captures Nick 's gift for combining pastoral imagery with piercing self revelation . A lush cacophony of string arrangements mark out `` River Man '' , with Nick displaying a bittersweet level of melody unlike anyone else at the time of this albums release , and with Nick musing `` Going to see the river man , Going to tell him all i can , About the ban ... On feeling free '' , not even the beautiful strings and gentle guitar can disguise the achingly sad tone of the song . `` Way to Blue '' is arguably one of the best known tracks on this album , and rightly so , its a song that highlights many of Nick Drakes attributes : remarkable instrumentation , anguished poignant vocals , subtle emotion , accessibility & an unsettling level of intimaticy , and lyricism far beyond his years : `` Have you seen the land , Living by the breeze ... Can you understand a light among the trees , Tell me all that you may know ... ..Show me what you have to show , Tell us all today ... .If you know the way to blue ? '' it feels like such a deeply personal song , that you almost feel like your intruding on someones personal memoirs , yet incapable of ignoring it 's captivation content.This album has a fuller arrangement than later albums ( especially over the largely acoustic guitar driven `` Pink Moon '' ) This album was to feature prominent names in the growing English folk scene with : Dave Pegg ( bass ) Dave Mattacks ( drums ) both of Fairport Convention , Richard Thompson ( ld gtr ) ex-Fairport , John Cale ( celeste , piano and organ ) ex-Velvet Underground , Ray Warleigh ( alto sax ) , Chris McGregor ( piano ) and Pat Arnold and Doris Troy ( backing vocals ) , all contributing to the album with performances virtually equal to Drakes own insular beautiful performance . But nothing detracts from the sheer beauty of this album.For those that do n't have any Nick Drake Albums , this truly is a absolute must-buy , I ca n't think on any reason that anyone that considers themselves to like Folk ( progressive or otherwise ) , or feels that they have a wide variety of music that they listen to , should not own this album ! ! ! Is this Nick Drakes best album ? ? ? ... I find that question impossible to personally answer . Critics point this album as his best ... . '' Bryter Layter '' was his most popular album , and `` Pink Moon '' is my personal favourite ( go Figure ? ? ) . The fact that this man only sold 2000 copies of this album when it was released kills me everytime it hear it mentioned . And the fact that even with the re-evaluation of his career , and a world-wide new found love for his work , this album has still only sold 250,000 copies , and highlights that even music as stunningly timeless as this , does n't always find an audience . All three of his albums deserve to be owned , because no one album feels weaker than another , and they complement each other beautifully . Put it this way ... ..every single friend that I 've convinced ( hassled ? ? ) to buy a Nick Drake album , owns all three of them . This is timeless music , that might have been ignored first time around , but now is truly worth of the Renaissance , and I impore you to not pass on this , like the listeners did some 30 years ago . Utterly breathtaking music ... . ! ! !	1
Not quite as minimalist as Pink Moon , which is part of what makes it debatably Drake 's best record , and certainly the first album to get . Incidentally , it 's also his debut . The album is about as folksy as folksy gets : some of it is filtered through country ( `` Time Has Told Me '' ) , other times through chamber music ( `` Day is Done '' ; `` Cello Song '' ) . The string arrangements are often quite captivating : they ruin `` Way to Blue '' , at least for me ; but give a lot of flavor to `` Day is Done '' and especially `` Cello Song '' . Not to take credit away from Nick himself : his meditations on life , love , and loneliness are often fascinating ( `` Three Hours '' ; `` The Thoughts of Mary Jane '' ) . I 'll admit it 's a bit hard to understand Drake 's quiet , mumbling diction , but even then sometimes it 's nice just to sit back and let his soft baritone take you away ( the hypnotic `` Fruit Tree '' ) . Bits of this ramble , sure ( `` River Man '' ; `` Man in a Shed '' ) , but all things considered this is a hell of an album . Oh , and if you liked Van Morrison 's Astral Weeks , you 'd be glad to know that `` Saturday Sun '' is comfortably close to that album 's best moments . I do n't think Bachman-Turner Overdrive could put out something anywhere near this . Do you ?	1
When my good friend Phil recommended this CD to me , he helpfully provided a product advisory . `` I 'm warning you , '' Phil emailed . `` It 's really melancholy stuff , so make sure you do n't have any sharp objects lying around when you listen to it . `` Like any good Irishman , I love mournful music , and I have a particular weakness for suicidal musicians , especially the ones that died too early to suck . So Phil 's words of warning were like catnip to me . Move over Joy Division , Nirvana , and Elliott Smith ; make room in the Case Logic for some Nick Drake.I soon found that Phil was right -- and wrong.On one hand , `` Five Leaves Left '' feels like the saddest CD ever recorded . You ca n't fake these emotions ; every poignant lyric , every aching guitar chord , and every weeping cello proclaim that this is the voice of a troubled and self-critical soul . Nick Drake died of an overdose at the age of 26 ; oddly enough , of his three albums , this first one sounds most like a suicide note.Granted , there 's some debate among his fans as to whether his death was indeed a suicide , whether the overdose was accidental or deliberate . On one hand , he OD 'd on antidepressants , even though barbituates were available , and he did n't leave a note . On the other hand , he 'd already written `` Fruit Tree . `` Has any musician penned a more convincing suicide note ? I doubt it . `` Safe in your place deep in the earth/That 's when they 'll know what you were truly worth . '' I 'm sorry , Ian Curtis -- '' Closer '' may come close , but nothing 's more depressing than that . And unlike , say , Elliott Smith , whose pop sensibilities often contrasted his morbid lyrics , every note of this song amplifies its mournfulness.Still , this album is comforting in its melancholia -- it does n't leave you feeling suicidal , because you listen to it and know there 's someone out there who has felt your feelings and given voice to your thoughts . In fact , it 's perfect music to listen to at sunset on a Sunday night , when the day and the weekend are over and you have n't accomplished anything and you 're facing another 40 hour week of work-related drudgery . If you 're thinking of picking up a guitar and hiring a string arranger and writing a song about those emotions , do n't bother -- you wo n't do any better than `` Day is Done , '' a 2-and-a-half-minute gem that perfectly encapsulates those feelings.So cheer up , all you sad people -- there 's a man out there who understood you , even though he never met you . I wish he 'd found a way out of the depression , found a way to stick around , write new songs , and keep his old songs from being used in Volkswagon commercials ; they say dying young 's a great career move , but you miss out on a lot , and when you 're dead you ca n't stop people from doing silly things with your back catalog . Also , even though people romanticize depression and drug overdoses , they really are n't all that fun , especially for those left behind . But Nick left us with some great music , and we can at least be thankful for that . `` Do n't you worry , '' he sang , to us , and to himself . `` They 'll stand and stare when you 're gone . '' Amen , brother .	1
This is my favorite Nick Drake album , even though all 4 ( the 3 he released in his life , and Time of No Reply , an album of outtakes ) are perfect . This album has some of his most elegant songs , with my personal favorites Time Has Told Me and River Man . One can look at Drake in many ways . He made only 3 albums in his lifetime , they were hardly known during his life , and he ended up overdosing and dying quietly . Yet , today , this man 's work is more alive than ever , with people discovering his melancholy and brilliance . Many performers spend their whole lives releasing albums , TV shows , films , poetry , books , and never reach anyone other than on a superficial level at best . Nick put out 3 albums , and touched the soul of thousands , perhaps tens of thousands , and maybe someday millions . It 's something to think about for budding artists . What do you want to be remembered for ? Some silly catch phrase , a star in a trashy sitcom or overblown TV drama , being a coked out celebrity , a musician who puts out a few hit albums then indulges in endless nostalghia tours , a professional celebrity who likes to appear on talk shows to do countless interviews and occasionally does film/TV roles just to keep the bank account full , or for a really , truly artistic work that will reach people for generations ? The latter is n't an easy road , but it 's the only true road that you can take if you want to create something significant .	1
If you ask most of the general public who Nick Drake is about 90-95 % wo n't know who you are talking about . That is because Nick was unknown during his lifetime and today he is still a relatively underground artist . However , all his studio albums are regarded as classics and all three frequently pop up on lists of great albums.This was the album that started it all , the fascination . His debut album is generally regarded as being less depressing than it 's successors . It contains a lot more orchestration and world music influences . Overall , it is a lot more richer in a generical sense.The album starts off with `` Time Has Told Me '' , a great little tune , which has some amazing instrumentation and has touches of country music inspiration . The electric guitar part is truly irresistable , while Nick 's voice is strangely uplifting . Next is `` River Man '' , this song is in a rather unusual time signature of 5/4 . This gives the song and unorthodox structure . The string section is breathtaking.The next song `` Three Hours '' is the first of two songs on the album to feature a slight world music touch courtesy of superb conga work by Rocki Dzidzornu . Following on from that is a song that is widely regarded as one of Nick 's best and signature tunes , `` Way To Blue '' . This song was also the title of a compilation of Nick 's work released posthumously in 1994 . `` Day Is Done '' continues the rather autumnal , strangely mellow feel of this album . This song along with most in Nick 's career features a string section arranged by his good friend Robert Kirby , who has gained fame for his work with Nick . `` 'Cello Song '' s probably most notable for being featured in `` The Good Girl '' a movie starring Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal . It is used in the scene where Jake 's character commits suicide . The superb cello work which gives the song its name is also very reminiscent of the cello part in PJ Harvey 's song `` Plants and Rags '' .7 tracks in , `` The Thoughts Of Mary Jane '' may be viewed by many to be a reference to the infamous drug marijuana , this may be true as Nick was known to be a recreational marijuana user . `` Man In A Shed '' is a beautiful song whose lyrics give a meaning of isolation and seclusion , obviously autobiographical in Nick 's case.The final two songs are really great . It starts off with `` Fruit Tree '' , whose lyrics offer a chilling insight into the mind of this tortured artist . The lyrics to this song have often been used as a template for Nick 's life and sometimes to describe his mental state . Finally , `` Saturday Sun '' lifts the mood slightly up a bit . This song features Nick on piano and offers a glimpse of what subsequent albums could have been if he lived and experimented with his secondary instrument . Overall it is a beautiful track that has some jazzy bits.In conclusion this album is definitely not as depressing as `` Pink Moon '' or as varied as `` Bryter Layter '' , but it is still a magestic effort nonetheless . Nick is one the few artist whose every song is flawless , and even if he had lived longer subsequent albums would have almost guaranteed to be perfect .	1
I have to give this album simply 5 stars . Not that I love every track just as much , but most songs are so incredibly beautiful that it 's impossible not to give them so much credit.I 've only been into Nick Drake for a few months . After hearing about him and listening to his album , I thought it was just boring ol ' folkmusic and left it for what it was . But for some reason I typed in his name in a MP3-search program and ended up with a CD-R full of songs . A new world opened , which sounds exaggerated , but is not.I ca n't say what my favorite album is , as every album has it 's own charms , but Five Leaves Left is the best to start with , as it was his debut-album . There are songs on it which touch me so deeply that there are times that I just ca n't listen to them . Them being 'Day is Done ' and 'Fruit Tree ' . The album is filled with melancholy , but these songs breathe out a type of sadness I 've never heard in any other music . 'River Man ' , maybe his most famous song after 'Pink Moon ' , is arguably his greatest song ever . The brooding string-arrangement lifts the song to great heights . It 's unbelievable.The only songs that are hard for me to hear are 'Mary Jane ' and 'Man in a shed ' . Not because they 're not good ; but I got to know them in the acoustic version ( as on 'Time Of No Reply ' ) , which I like MUCH better than these versions , all dressed up with unnecessary arrangements.If you have n't discovered Nick Drake , now is the time to do so . He has enriched my life ; I 'm addicted to his music .	1
This is hands-down , just a stirring and beautiful album . Distinctive guitar playing , the saddest voice you 'll ever hear this side of the Red House Painters . This is one of the most haunting and elonquent albums you may ever hear .	1
Five Leaves Left . '' The title itself seems a puzzle , and this sometimes sparse yet strangely compelling testament likewise contains other riddles and juxtapositions . Foremost is Nick Drake 's own character , who , though lost to us , saw nuances and meaning in everyday life that most tend to gloss over and seemed to follow muses hidden to most.Whether conversing with `` time , '' in the opening track , Time Has Told Me ( full of foreshadowing of Mr. Drake 's inner turmoil ) ; suggesting that we `` look through time and find your rhyme '' in Way to Blue ; or acknowledging the cycle of life in Day Is Done , Mr. Drake is transfixed by the ephemeral elements of life , the cycle of seasons , and the need to self-evaluate.He writes lyrics about the deeper meanings of things and the inherent tension of trying to live life fully without becoming mired in melancholy , like a water skimmer shooting across a slow moving creek.Certainly Mr. Drake was also a master of understatement -- -though I think the string section may be a bit much in a couple of passages -- -the interplay of Mr. Drake 's voice ( I 'm unsure what adjectives to apply to his singing ) , his acoustic guitar , and the congas and bass imbue Three Hours and Cello Song with shimmering elegance.The original production was excellent , and the remastering accentuates the tenor of the songs . `` Five Leaves Left '' provides an appropriate soundtrack for the in-between seasons of fall and spring and the transitional spaces one often carves out of mornings and evenings .	1
Nearly unknown in his own day , but revered by his contemporaries , Nick Drake has had a bit of a renaissance in the wake of , of all things , the use of one of his songs in a Volkswagon commercial ( `` Pink Moon '' from the album of the same name ) . But this album was his first , and in many ways , his best.Drake 's legacy is sadly pretty small -- three albums during his lifetime and two posthumous collections . His music is melancholy , in ways no one else 's is . Understated , often punctuated ( on this record and its followup `` Bryter Layter '' ) by a mournful arrangement , lightly sung in Drake 's smoky tenor , the music is effecting -- I find to this day that when I play this one , when I hear `` River Man '' , I have a habit of stopping whatever I 'm doing , Drake 's voice just compels you to listen . And he so directly expresses loneliness , fear and sorrow through his music that listening to him can sometimes be difficult for me -- indeed , I only rarely play his music , but when I do , I marvel at it.But to this record , `` Five Leaves Left '' is probably my favorite of Drake 's catalog -- the songs are consistently inventive and surprising , and with the exception of closer `` Saturday Sun '' ( which sounds forced ) , honest , sincere , and brilliant . Several of the songs have that quality like `` River Man '' , `` Way to Blue '' can grab you the same way with its pained voice-over-strings . And `` The Thoughts of Mary Jane '' is really beyond words , a sort of melancholy love-from-afar stance , Drake almost sounds content in this , as though the alternative would be too much.Bottom line , this is a masterpiece , essential listening . Highly recommended .	1
`` Five Leaves Left '' released in 1969 is the first of only three albums Nick Drake managed to get released in his short lifetime.Several of the album 's lyrics suggests a delicate and fragile mind , which might ultimately have led to his untimely death in 1974.Musically Drake 's music may at time appear a little reminiscent of Donovan 's from the later 1960s . In Drake 's case , though , there are strong inspiration from classical music , which is hardly the case with Donovan.The album contains several of Drake 's best and most beloved songs . Among them `` Cello Song , '' `` Time Has Told Me , '' `` Way to Blue '' and `` Thoughts of Mary Jane '' The Instrumentation is in most cases , sparse , with Drake 's beautiful acoustic guitar as the turning point.On the opening track `` Time Has Told Me , '' one may recognize Richard Thompson 's characteristic electric guitar and the sound of this number is slightly reminiscent of early Fairport Convention . Otherwise , it 's Danny Thompson ( Pentangle ) who appears most frequently on the record . Also Strings-arranger Robert Kirby has put a strong stamp on several of the album 's key tracks , `` Way to Blue '' Day is Done `` , The Thoughts of Mary Jane '' and `` Fruit Tree '' .Summed up this is very fine album that wins for each new listen . If you are not familiar with Drake 's music in advance , however , I recommend that you start with the sequel `` Bryter Layter '' , which is , without being lightweight at all , probably easier to fall for .	1
Nick Drake-Five Leaves Left ****Of all three of Nick Drake 's albums only one of those ever struck me as fantastic , made me absolutely fall in love with it , and only one of those three ever felt like it truly lived up to the hype . That album is Pink Moon . That damn thing haunts me and I think about it at random times and feel an urge to listen to it immediately . A Love Supreme is the only other album that does that to me.Five Leaves Left however would come next . For me it does n't live up to the hype and I do n't particularly love it . There is n't a single bad or weak track here , they are all great in fact . Drakes lyrics are easily the most personal and best written here as against the other two albums . His guitar playing is a virtuosic as always , but something about this album just does n't feel right . Maybe because Pink Moon was my introduction into Drake 's music it will always be the standard for me to which I compare the rest of his work . It may sound quite jaded but it is n't anything I can help.Only three songs on Five Leaves Left really hit me as classics and as brilliant . 'River Man ' being the first . The somber tone in Drakes voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing John Lennon and Paul McCartney tried to do with 'A Day In The Life ' but did n't quite pull of . The second being 'Three Hours . ' This to me might be the greatest song Drake ever wrote next to 'Pink Moon . ' In at a staggering six minutes in length , which is like the equivalent of 'Mountain Jam ' for the Allman Bros. it is truly a mini-epic . Lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else . The mood is dark as usually but I ca n't help but feel hope in the songs melody . The chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel . The song is pure genius . The third being the lyrical genius of 'Fruit Tree ' in which on his debut album Drake confesses that he knows his music wo n't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life has ended . Poetic bliss.As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out , nothing strikes me as blaam ! Though nothing else is bad . It just simply plays , and plays well . For a debut album , Five Leaves Left is incredible , but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover .	1
My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation , i.e . Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar , piano and bass ; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement , and ; Cello Song , a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello , bass and congas . I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours , a brooding little number . As with all Drake 's work , the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies , where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places .	1
Nick Drake 's debut album Five Leaves Left is a hauntingly beautiful album . Mr. Drake 's folk music is backed by the baroque sounds of chamber music . This provides a lilting background to his deep , introspective lyrics . Mr. Drake had problems with depression and there is a sense of melancholy that permeates the album , but not near the degree of his later album Pink Moon . & quot ; Fruit Tree & quot ; , & quot ; Day Is Done & quot ; , & quot ; The Thoughts Of Mary Jane & quot ; and & quot ; Way To Blue & quot ; stand out amongst an album 's worth of stellar music .	1
Each album made by this cult hero from the 70 's British folk movement , is quite impressive , but Nick Drake 's 1969 debut , Five Leaves Left may be his best . Drake 's strongly plucked acoustic guitar finds a warm home with the guesting chamber music instruments and together they create an almost flawless , misty , rainy atmosphere , which permeates through all of Nick 's top class songs . It is astonishing that a young man in his early twenties is so vastly adept to writing wise , heartfelt songs such as `` Cello Song '' and `` Time Will Tell Me '' or songs as profound as `` Three Hours '' or `` Fruit Tree , '' the last of which eerily forecasts Nick 's posthumous rise from overlooked singer/songwriter to cult hero . `` Safe in your place deep in the earth/That 's when they 'll know what you were really worth/Forgotten while you 're here/Remembered for a while/A much updated ruin/From a much outdated style . '' Although , Drake would sadly never live to see his work at all appreciated , many more experienced and popular songwriters are trying desperately for the skillfully executed eeriness and unpretentious thoughtfulness mastered on Five Leaves Left .	1
Pink Moon was dark as they come , but Five Leaves Left , despite others saying it is the most depressing of the three , or some other stuff , it 's like an autumn morning . Or a dark night on the river . It 's also longer , and features more than just the guitar . Nothing is as naked as Pink Moon , but Five Leaves Left is beautiful , and , if you have the ears , becomes apparent with the first seven seconds of The Thoughts of Mary Jane ( though to me it seems about drugs ) .Five Leaves Left takes me on a journey to the rivers , forests , star-filled sky , and sunsets ( sometimes with a girl on my side , sometimes not ) . Drake 's lyrics , as always , are filled with lyrics of hope , depression , life . Sometime , I really need to take a music based journey to the places that conjure in my mind . Really experience the music ( actually , you all should , NOW ) . That 's a testament that how , some music , can really be more than just a mere listen.I think I would stop right now , because Five Leaves Left has been described just by that last paragraph . Man this review was crappy ! While not as good as other albums , some albums , even if they are n't the greatest to exist , just can not be said with justice ( at least my attempt at it ) . Shows when you try to review albums you really just ca n't explain . Just . Listen.9/10	1
nick drake and fives leaves left a classic folk album that is no means depressing as others have stated it 's a visonary album of beautiful strummed guitar with a voice of an angel over the top with simple lyrics too not over-stretch our tiny mindsa beauty of an album a great artist who died too young well i suppose these things happen for a reason	1
Whether you know it or not , you 've heard Nick Drake before . Maybe it 's from his other albums , maybe it 's from that VW commercial , maybe it 's just the sound of that quiet bleakness we all feel when sadness comes to the door and does n't want to leave . This music lives with all of us . It exists in quiet lonely nights , chilly autumn evenings , and the muted grey of the world when it 's been raining all day . During his too-short musical career , Nick used music to look at those little feelings we all have and give them an exquisitely beautiful voice.Ok , fine , I 'll start talking like a normal person now . I realize those comments seem a little silly . It 's easy enough to describe how this music sounds , but it 's not as easy to convey the emotional impact it might have . Everything about this 40-minute jewel is beautifully composed , elegantly performed and topped off with Nick 's simple understated lyrics , which read as well as poetry . His voice and guitar ( pretty tricky guitar work , too ) are backed up by changing accompaniments : some electric guitar and bass at times , some flute , some quiet conga percussion at others , and most often a smooth string section providing just the right bittersweet background . It 's quiet folk melancholy with an addicting quality that ca n't really be explained . Not everything here is quite as sad as `` Way to Blue '' or the eerily prophetic `` Fruit Tree , '' either . `` Saturday Sun '' adds some relatively upbeat jazzy piano , although it remains low-key to the end . `` Time Has Told Me '' is uplifting in its timeless simplicity . `` Man in a Shed '' is a wistful boy-girl tune , but the theme is as un-cliched and downright humble as I 've ever heard it.Five Leaves Left was Nick 's first album , and overall the most realized - he took over a year putting it together after all . If you do n't like the sound of strings and flutes you 'll probably want to hear the later Pink Moon instead , which is basically just Nick and his guitar . Either way , just make sure you check him out somehow . Any Drake offering is a treasure not to be missed .	1
this is a truly incredible debut . almost every track is exceptional . cello song is really beautiful , time has told me is another classic featuring great steel guitar work from richard thompson . way to blue has some great orchestration that is not overdone . three hours includes some intricate guitar . fruit tree shows the profound mystery , beauty and tragedy of drake 's tunes . saturday sun is one of the greatest things he ever did , it seems to me that few people regard this jazzy piece as one of his all time best but it is . the vibes , piano , drums , and bass on that song are terrific , not to mention drake 's excellent voice . the man was definitely one of the greatest of songwriters it is too bad this did n't sell well enough to bring him the acclaim he so richly deserved . try bryter later and pink moon as well , for there are lots of classics in drake 's short catalogue .	1
The one thing I 've been admiring about Nick Drake the last five years I 've been listening to him is his ability to really connect on a personal level with listeners.I 'm one of his fans . No doubt about it . Maybe not the biggest fan in the world , but a pretty big one nonetheless . He writes lyrics where they feel so simple and complicated at the same time , but in a way you can really understand where he 's coming from , and in a way where you connect with him immediately . In some instances , that connection escalates to a very , very personal level.So personal in fact , I highly recommend NEVER listening to one of his albums if you 're feeling down . Then again , listening to one of his three albums on a day where you 're feeling good might have a reverse effect and make you feel depressed instead , haha.I guess the best time to put on a Nick Drake album is a day where you 're feeling somewhat in between . When you 're in one of those moods where you feel like appreciating a lot of honest songwriting passion . This would be the perfect day.Simply put , Nick Drake writes highly effective folk rock.What 's REALLY strange , and one thing I still have trouble believing , is that Nick Drake was n't considered immensely popular back in the early 70 's . We 're talking about a musician who was on the same level as someone like John Lennon and Cat Stevens are far as writing meaningful lyrics in a way where you can easily attach yourself to every word and vocal melody he wrote . He was original and talented enough where he *should* have found a huge fanbase 40 years ago . A fanbase should n't have been on hold for several decades.In addition to that , it gets even more bizarre.Even back in the early 70 's most people were able to recognize greatness when they first heard it ( such as with Led Zeppelin , Pink Floyd , Neil Young and several other groundbreaking artists ) and yet , Nick Drake flew under the radar almost completely for the most part ( at least he did here in America- my parents never heard of him for instance , and they 've heard quite a number of rock bands from the same time period Nick Drake was releasing his albums ) .There 's one more thing about Nick Drake I find absolutely amazing ( even MORE amazing than his ability to connect with listeners through his honest lyrics and well-crafted songwriting ) .It 's the fact his songwriting skills just do n't sound dated at ALL . The music of Nick Drake does not sound like typical early 70 's rock music . You see , not only does Nick Drake sound completely different from most folk rock artists such as Bob Dylan , Cat Stevens , Gordon Lightfoot and Peter , Paul and Mary- his albums honestly do n't sound dated in the least . They sound like they could have been recorded using todays equipment . These albums sound like they could have been made today . How can this be ? How in the world did people not notice this distinctive style Nick Drake was going for back when he was new ? So you see , if you add up all these things ( extremely popular fanbase nowadays- completely different from 40 years ago when most people never even heard of him , recording equipment that definitely made his music stand the test of time , the fact Nick Drake writes from such a personal point of view ) it 's hard to believe Nick Drake actually DID exist 40 years ago . What an artist.Honesty is the main word when it concerns connecting with peoples emotions , and that 's what makes it so hard to believe people did n't pick up on these touching emotions back when Nick Drake was releasing these albums . Why did n't he catch on ? No reason not to become extremely popular and be in the same league as other folk rockers.Picking a favorite song off Bryter Layter is a very difficult task . I guess the longer songs are my favorites , especially `` Hazy Jane I '' with lyrics written in a way I can almost exactly relate to , the brilliant saxophone jams in `` Poor Boy '' , or the creepy piano playing in `` One of These Things First '' . His vocal melodies are just as good as on the previous and next ( final ) album.I 'm glad to see Nick Drake is getting the appreciation these days he rightfully deserves . He deserved success back in the early 70 's but unfortunately fortune and fame did n't catch on for him in the States the way it should have ( for plenty of mysterious reasons listed above ) but at least people are finally appreciating his meaningful music nowadays . It may have taken a long time , but it finally happened.If I was in heaven right now , I 'd pat Nick Drake on the back and say `` Well , it finally happened , but too bad it took several years '' which I imagine he 'd respond with a simple smile as we 'd part ways . That 's the way I always picture it at least , heh .	1
Bryter Layter is Nick Drake working with expanded orchestrations.Five Leaves Lefthas subtle string , but here , horns and even female singers are added.This almost sounds likeForever Changes , except that Love album ratiated Authur Lee as mastero , calling the shots . Drake seems to be a lone guitar player surrounded by adoring musicians on Bryrer Layer . His singing is mournful and self-effacing as ever.Which makes the album so effective . The musical buffer around Drakes subtle voice only highlights his poetic modesty as a singer . The contrast of his insinuating singing and the big shell of the arrangements works wonders . Listen to `` One Of These Things First , '' or `` Chime of the city clock . `` `` Poor Boy '' is a bit much . When the singers sing `` poor boy , feels sorry for himself , '' towards Drake , it underminds the depths of his sadness . The whole piece is a little mellowdramatic and insulting to Drake , who was struggling with a serious mental illness.But even this song is a good spin , and the album as a whole is top notch .	1
It 's a shame but I 'm just listen to Drake 's work by now , at 29 . Here in Brazil we do n't have these releases and the imported ones are the only solution for this & quot ; bossa-nova syndrome & quot ; . This album has great and happy songs . Yes , happy songs . Drake sounds happy singing At The Chimes of City Clock and others . But the great charm here is the similarity with the most beautiful album ever made , Van Morrison 's Astral Weeks . Horns , flutes , acoustic instruments and an haunting voice under service of wonderful compositions . There 's no cut here ( and on the others Nick 's albums ) less than perfect . Seems Nick had & quot ; the formula for the perfect songs that make souls more bryter & quot ; . Since I 've heard Pink Moon , Five Leaves Left and Bryter Later life has become a little more bryter than before . Thanks , Nick , wherever you are now .	1

Anything from Nick Drake is excellent ! ! ! i own Pink Moon , 5 leaves left , and bryter layter ... i would n't trade them for anything	1
All of Nick Drake 's music is so fantastic , so streaked with genius and beauty , it is truly a difficult task to pick a favorite album ! But if I had to pick , Bryter Layter would be *it* , with the sparse and ethereal Pink Moon following closely.This album is perfect , magical , full-bodied and brilliant from its opening notes to its last . At the Chime of a City Clock , Fly , Hazey Jane I , One of these Things First , Northern Sky ... these are Nick 's masterpieces , and they stand tall and proud against any music created anywhere , ever . The horns , strings , piano , and guitar here all come together to whip up a musical confection so sweet , and so nourishing , it 's hard to imagine I 'll find anything I will enjoy quite as much . When coupled with knowledge of Nick 's story , his sad , difficult time in London , isolated in his flat and working so hard on this album , the album just becomes his crowning achievement . After this album , Nick was still producing ( Pink Moon is truly a seminal , unparalleled album in its own right , and his last four songs reflect much of the pain and confusion he was experiencing ) , but Bryter Layter reflects Nick 's belief that he was soon to be riding a star , and it shows . It was meant to carry him on to fame , and it is only the sad nature of fate that it took 30 years for it to happen . But it *did* happen , and for this I am very grateful to say the least ( if he had n't gained such success now , I never would have heard of him , or the story of his life . ) Nick Drake was the ultimate artist , and is a true inspiration to many.The elaborate and classy arrangements provide an unparalleled showcase for Nick Drake 's lyrics , voice ( oh what a voice ) and fantastic guitar playing ... some say , over-produced , I say , sheer heaven . The crackling and glowing magic of this album , now thirty years old ( it was released in 1970 , the second of three albums released in Nick Drake 's lifetime ) has made its way into the limelight , at long last , with songs from it showing up on movie soundtracks and the album itself on many a 100 Best Albums of all times lists ( alongside other Drake works , I might add , at least in Britain ) .For Nick , `` If songs were lines in a conversation/The situation would be fine . '' He was shy , retiring , incredibly self-conscious . And with this music , what a conversation ! Pop this album in your cd player , lay back in your favorite chair , and enjoy .	1
the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just gets you into this masterwork of an album . nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece , and rightfully so . it is definetly his most up beat album , but thats to nick drakes standards . the album is full of beautiful poetry , nicks humble fingerpicked guitar playing , lush instrumentation , and even horns . northern sky , fly , and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest songs ever written by anyone . if you are new to nick , this should be the second album you pick up , after pink moon . but all three of his albums should be in everyones colection	1
The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded . There 's even a near-rocker ( `` Hazy Janey II '' ) , albeit one in Nick 's usual somber style . I actually do n't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one : a bunch of weak instrumentals ( title track ; `` Sunday '' ; `` Fly '' ) , and `` Poor Boy '' is the closest to overproduced Drake gets . Regardless , there are several fantastic songs : `` Hazy Janey II '' and its psychedelic-folk counterpart , `` Hazy Janey I '' ; `` At the Chime of a City Clock '' , which is some good jazzy stuff ; `` One of Those Things First '' is charming but slightly rambling ; and `` Northern Sky '' is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake 's catalogue , which is saying something . So it 's slightly uneven , but the best songs make it very worthwhile .	1
first off let me praise the string arrangements by a fella named robert kirby that are amongst the most enjoyable i 've heard on any pop/folk album . this album is almost sunny compared to the beautiful melancholy that prevades nick drake 's other 2 masterpieces ( five leaves left and pink moon , of course ) . bryter layter , the title track , is an instrumental that could just about fit on an antonio carlos jobim recording ; buoyant spirited and fun . alto sax , viola , harpsichord , celeste , piano , flute and backing vocals all add to make this quite a different affair than the other drake recordings . l love all nick drake 's work and each of the 3 albums that he made in his short lifetime are so spectacular it 's hard to say which is my favorite . whatever one i 'm listening to at the moment is almost always dearest to my heart . if you have yet to experience this great artist 's music , just dive into it : on five leaves left , bryter layter , or pink moon , you ca n't go wrong .	1
People love to talk about their proverbial perfect desert-island albums . Quality-wise , Nick Drake 's `` Bryter Later '' could easily be on my list , but that description does n't sound quite right.I imagine desert islands as being dry and bright and isolated places ; this album 's much more suitable for rainy afternoons holed up in the condo . `` Stay indoors beneath the floors , talk with neighbors only ; the games you play make people say you 're either weird or lonely , '' Drake sings on `` At the Chime of a City Clock . '' The music , too , amplifies the urban cabin fever vibe ; the arrangements are jazzy but melancholy , with a wonderful blend of wise guitar and playful piano and sad strings and resigned horns . ( The horns are crucial ; they help make `` Bryter Later '' that rarest of things -- an excellent album that does n't quite sound like anything that came before . ) Drake 's voice , soothing and hushed and cool , complements the songs perfectly , but there are great instrumental pieces , too , bisecting and bookending the album . `` Five Leaves Left '' was my first -- and first favorite -- Nick Drake album , but now I find myself listening to this one far more frequently . There 's still plenty of melancholy here ; on Hazey Jane I , for instance , Drake asks : `` Do you like what you 're doing ? Would you do it some more ? Only to stop once and wonder what you 're doing it for ? '' But all in all , the relentless depression 's been tempered quite a bit . That album 's vibe is I-want-to-kill-myself-because-life's-pointless-and-I-won't-be-noticed-otherwise ; this is more like I-don't-quite-feel-like-going-to-the-grocery-store-today.And that resignation 's leavened , too , with a cautious optimism -- today may be shot , but tomorrow 's at least worth sticking around for . `` Please give me a second grace ; please give me a second face , '' Drake sings on `` Fly . '' And then on `` Northern Sky , '' he asks : `` Would you love me for my money ? Would you love me for my mind ? Would you love me through the winter ? Would you love me until I die ? If you would and you could , then come blow your horn for me . '' It 's a lovely song , but the pronouns alone are significant ; on both this and `` Five Leaves Left '' there are times when the `` you '' refers to Drake himself , and the songs become mere mirrors , places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection , but on this , there are far more moments where the `` you '' is someone else . So Drake is at least spending less time gazing into mirrors and more time looking out windows , looking out from the darkened apartment at the faces in the city , searching for a connection with someone who can end the isolation .	1
Steeper , breezier arrangements on BL compliments his other bare-bones melancholia , rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything Drake composed .	1
This is just a CD you 've got to have . Once you 've gotten to know it , you 'll start hearing Drake 's influences in musician after musician who knows what he/she is doing . Beck , Robyn Hitchcock , Jim White , Lucinda Williams , David Byrne , Vic Chesnutt . That 's just for starters . The list of people who cite Nick Drake as an influence goes on and on . Once you get this CD , you 'll want to dig into Drake 's entire catalog , which , unfortunately , is only 3 or 4 official albums . Amazing musician who made an incredible splash in his short life and limited number of recordings .	1
Definitely Nick Drake 's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography , Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines , Nick 's expressive vocals , and even drums/flutes/other instruments ! Wow ! Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music , but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left , though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen , and of a purchase .	1
There were a whole lot of demons wrapped up in the brilliant , but tormented soul of Nick Drake , who succumbed to depression and death before his full talent was allowed to flourish . Nick Drake only left behind three complete albums , `` Bryter Layter '' being the middle and most beautiful one . The string arrangements are superb and with sympathetic backing from the likes of Dave Pegg , Richard Thompson , Dave Mattocks and John Cale , the songs really grab your heart . In a year when the singer / songwriter has comeback from the Wilderness the re-issue of Drake 's `` Bryter Layter '' could not of been better timed or more welcome . This is the best way into his oeuvre : ornate , drenched in melody , emotion , evocative of a long-lost London and its small , smoky nightclubs . All told , the songs run counter to his melancholic reputation , as evidenced by the very breezy and up tempo opening track , Hazey Jane II . However , in case you start getting the idea that it would all be dog biscuits you are soon brought down by `` At The Chime Of A City Clock '' , which reminds you of who you are listening to . `` You stay indoors , beneath the floors , and talk to neighbors only '' , sighs Drake . Pretty autobiographical then . Nick Drake 's , finger-pickin ' guitar rises above all the musical arrangements to leave you breathless at his dexterity . Although the re-mastering of the songs has given them much more definition and depth , my problem with this re-issue is in its time . Forty minutes of music is not a lot in these days of C.Ds , perhaps Island Records could have found a few more songs from Nick Drake 's back catalogue to give the C.D . buying public a better deal . If your not familiar with Nick Drake , the excellent `` Way To Blue '' is a must buy . This clocks in at way over the hour and containing songs from all three albums , `` Pink Moon '' , `` Bryter Layter '' , `` Five Leaves Left '' and the posthumously released , `` Time Of No Reply '' . It gives a good overview of Nick Drake 's work plus a nice booklet with an introduction by ` Nick Drake Devotee ' Joe Boyd , some photos and complete lyrics . Not music to listen to when your low , rather relaxed and contemplative . Mott the Dog .	1
It 's no Pink Moon , but that hardly matters . The important thing about Bryter Layter is that it 's as sweeping and memorable and melancholic and uncannily beautiful as any other Nick Drake album , but that it 's also more lush and intricate than anything else he 's put out . He 's backed by various Fairport Conventioneers as well John Cale on this album , and it shows ; the songs are like siren coos seeping from a pastoral swath of English countryside , except that they 're not weird and inaccessible like those of , say , Tim Buckley in his Starsailor period ( not that Starsailor is n't a wonderful album , of course , it 's just that it 's a bit ... well , weird and inaccessible ) . Drake 's voice , which sounds like what would happen if velvet could sigh , is in fine form , and his maze-like guitar constructions are on display in all their universe-evoking glory . And there are also flutes and strings and pianos , and none of it sounds even remotely pretentious . The intricacy of Bryter Layter explodes like a flashbulb on `` Poor Boy , '' which is an oceanic gospel-jazz odyssey with samba rhythms and ghostly backing vocals . `` Hazy Jane I '' sounds like being left by the love of your life on a gorgeous summer day , and `` At The Chime Of A City Clock '' is like winning her back in the dead of winter . `` One Of These Things First '' roils with quiet bitterness , and `` Hazy Jane II '' lets a sprightly soul rhythm percolate under a lyric that 's rife with claustrophobic paranoia . `` Northern Sky '' is almost unbelievably gorgeous , and it contains every precious memory I have of my childhood , as well as the intense sense of loss I feel when it occurs to me that I 've left those moments behind forever . There are some pretty instrumentals , too . Neat !	1
`` Bryter Layter '' superbly pulls one along with a gentle tension : the music is arranged in a largely upbeat manner . Yet Nick Drake often sings about detachment as though it offers stability . It 's as though he is the catalyst , melding jazzy riffs and structures with his lyrics that conjure up images of what was , what should have been , what could have been.Even the instrumental tracks evoke a longing , a need for completion , a yin-yang that does not quite fit.How anyone could quibble about the significance of this session escapes me : pairing Nick Drake with peers such as Thompson , Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks from Fairport Convention ; John Cale ; and Chris McGregor who contributes some excellent piano on Poor Boy is like a folk-rock dream team.Mr . Drake 's delicate vocals and the deft arrangements are the gossamer that binds this session , and `` Bryter Layter '' should ultimately be remembered for its myriad strengths instead of a foil for the rest of Mr. Drake 's work or as a prescient-laden testimony to Mr. Drake 's subsequent depression and death .	1
`` Bryter Layter '' by Nick Drake is from 1970 , which is already more than 40 years ago . As a folk-pop record it is peerless , as an encapsulation of the era it is second to none , and as an alternative album it ranks among some of the best works by Rufus Wainwright or even Joanna Newsom . As with every record of such staggering worth , it was a colossal disaster upon first release , eventually sending its ' maker into a downward spiral from which he never fully recovered . Let me preface this review that if this album has any one direct comparison , it would be `` Parallelograms '' by Linda Perhacs ( another obscure and forgotten gem of a record ) .I would rank Nick Drake as the Jeff Buckley of his generation , as it takes the boy and a guitar idiom and transposes it decades before Buckley . Drake is also rather comparable to Tim Buckley ( Jeff 's father ) , but while Tim has a more neo-folk , whimsical touch to his albums , Drake is firmly planted in the acoustic-folk & jazz genre - although some songs here are so stripped down that you would be hard-pressed to fit them into any genre other than ` melancholy ' . What makes this album special , even within Drake 's own small discography , is that it was recorded with some very alluring musicians of the time - Fairport Convention and John Cale from The Velvet Underground , as well as Beach Boys musicians Mike Kowalski and Ed Carter . All of them bring just the right amount of talent to the table , and are more than willing to play second fiddle to the lead instrument here - which would be Nick Drake 's voice . It is n't a very strong voice , and there is n't a single song of his ( on all his three albums ) where he displays any soaring notes or stretches his vocal abilities , but he has a warm , cozy quality to his voice , akin to curling up in a corner with a really good old book . I suppose this is one reason Drake appeals to such diverse yet niche audiences . This is very much a ` home ' record , and is best experienced solitary.It must be remembered that Drake made this record with the intent that it would be a departure from his first album `` Five Leaves Left '' , which had flopped considerably . The jazz elements were brought in , in a move to edge away from the more pastoral elements of the first record . This was in 1970 , and it was also the infamous year in which Drake attempted to play live concerts , all of which went badly , as he did n't believe in communicating with his audience ; and spent inordinate time between songs tuning his guitar . However , Drake 's interest in this album was primarily to make an impact on the marketplace , something that had eluded him with his first released ; and even John Cale , who contributed backing vocals , was sure of the records success . Much to Drake 's horror , `` Bryter Later '' was released with little promotion and went on to sell only slightly less than 2500 copies . It would mark the beginning of Drake 's descent into further depression , one from which he never fully recovered.Forty something years later , `` Bryter Later '' has received much acclaim , partly because of the renewed interest in Drake in the ` 90s and ` 00s , but also because somehow , this album has aged beautifully . Its certainly a record that gets better with time ; and songs from it that I first heard in the mid ` 90s sound almost radically different now ; and seem to burst with far more life than I had imagined . I thought this to be an anomaly , so I went back and listened to his debut record , but it did n't sparkle with the it-factor that this album does . What adds to its appeal , is that the production is impeccable and very considerate towards the underlying rule that Drake 's voice is the true star of the album ; and never do the instruments overpower his voice . On most tracks , all we get is Drake 's pristine vocal , clean and clear , in super clarity . Its almost disconcerting that something of such power could have gone overlooked at the time of its ' release , because even compared to the other ` folk ' records of 1970 , it is markedly different in almost all aspects . `` Bryter Layter '' opens with `` Introduction '' and closes with `` Sunday '' , both instrumental pieces that act as Prologue and Epilogue . The first true track of the album is `` Hazey Jane II '' ; followed by the splendid `` At the chime of a city clock '' , where he can rightfully be compared to Tim Buckley . Note that if you are interested in a male voice with a lot of gusto or power to it , this is not the place to be looking for it . Drake has often come under criticism for being a weak vocalist who appeared to ` talk ' over his songs . This is in part true . In truth , his delivery is mixture of singing and talking , and his intonation is n't exactly conducive to a real vocalist . Despite this , there is a certain warmth and magic to his voice ; like an old friend ; that will keep you coming back to certain tracks to relive them repeatedly . At the time however , I suppose his vocal skills were n't considered praiseworthy , considering he was up against some big names back in the day . Drake released only three ` proper ' albums during his lifetime , and this is undoubtedly the best of them . If one had to choose a ` best ' track , it would be `` Fly '' and `` Poor Boy '' ( where Nick really goes outside his comfort zone in many ways ; plus also check out those stunning background vocalists and their harmonizing ) and the closer `` Sunday '' ( a beguiling instrumental ) . On his next album , `` Pink Moon '' , Drake would strip down even further to just his voice and a guitar ( it was recorded in just two days , and it sort of shows ) . While all of Drake 's works can be considered vital , I would recommend `` Bryter Layter '' and his debut CD as the most immediate purchases . If you like this , you can then venture to some of his other work , such as the later compilation `` Family Tree '' , that feature songs recorded even before his debut , with vocals by him , his sister , and his mother ( though it is n't as consistently listenable as this record ) .This record deserves a vital place in any serious music lovers ' collection ; and especially for listeners who rank Vashti Bunyan , Meg Baird , Andrew Bird , Tim Buckley & Jeff Buckley highly . As a forgotten gem from the 1970s , it should finally come to possess the recognition it so richly deserved upon first release.Five Stars .	1
I wish Nick would have a longer career and a longer life.Bryter Layter it ` s indeed a fantastic album , you don ` t have to skip a single song each one is so emotionally charged and intense , in comparison to pink moon and five leafs left this album features a fantastic band following Nick ` s chords at its best It ` s hard to tell which song is my favorite in this album cause I Love them all . I own Nicks complete discography but this album to me is something really special . If I would have to recommend an entry to new fans this album will be it.The beauty about Nicks music is that even while he was clearly depressed all songs leave to your own interpretation , it ` s like a living soundtrack on your own life , you will find comfort on those velvet chords and acoustic strumming paterns while listening to his beautiful voice.My recommendations : Really get them all ! ! Bryter LayterFive Leaves LeftPink Moon ( this were the only three albums released by Nick , Five leaves left was the first but he was unnoticed at the timem gorgeous album ! ! he went somehow notticed and gaining a following cult with Bryter Layter and consumed his own with Pink moon . A 4th album appeared later with 4 tracks that were going to be part of his 4th studio album that never happened plus a few other takes on tap , this album is Time of no reply.Worth it !	1
This is the key Nick Drake album to get , with its excellent production values , and fully realized arrangements . He 's in great voice , and each song gets a sensitive treatment , whether its sonorous strings , or a bopping horn section , or a quiet bluesy piano . The sax on At the Chime of a City Clock it is worth the price of admission . Sad he could n't hold it together enough to make more music -- sad he died so young , but many in his era 's British folk scene suffered , too . This album is haunting AND optimistic -- just listen to Hazy Jane II . A classic which creates a mood from the first to the last track .	1
I have only recently become aware of Nick Drake 's music , but now I know all his albums pretty well . They all provide very fine songs and great music , though some of the posthumously released albums are somewhat uneven.Among his three original albums , I have come to the conclusion that his second , `` Bryter Later '' , is his most successful and in any case the album I would only recommend a friend.It is his most `` produced '' album with musical assistance from the three members of Fairport Convention Richard Thompson , Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks . Furthermore contributing John Cale on a few numbers.Several tracks have tasteful stringsarrangements written by Nick 's good friend Robert Kirby.All the songs are good , but you obviously get your favorites . `` One of These Things First '' is a quiet and very beautiful song with nice accompaniment by Paul Harris , Ed Carter and Mike Kowalski . `` Fly '' with nice contributions from John Cale at the harpsichord and viola is number seems to be better every time you hear it . Perhaps most moving on the album , if that title does not go to the album 's second track with significant contributions from John Cale - `` Northern Sky '' . This was the song I fell for the first : there 's something magnificent about this beautiful and airy number . `` Poor Boy '' is almost a little jazzy , with strong vocal backing from PP Arnold and Doris Troy . There 's something very liberating unpretentious over both lyrics and music . The same can be said about `` Hazey Jane II '' , which also has fine lead guitar from Richard Thompson . `` Hazey Jane I '' is a totally different song - as I hear it , they have only the title in common . Also a nice song with backing from Mattacks , and Pegg.There are three instrumental tracks - are all fine and well distributed across the album as 1 , 6 and 10th tracksOn all tracks you have Drake 's acoustic guitar , which he mastered to almost perfection.A strong album that deservedly has become a classic , albeit pretty long after its release in 1970 , where it was almost unnoticed .	1
Maybe I just want some of it too , but one of the greatest glories is to know that you have encouraged someone else to enjoy something life-enhancing . That is the honour bestowed on one of my best friends , who introduced me to Nick Drake by telling me to shut up , stop criticising the cover , and listen to the bloody music ( his words , not mine ) .Five Leaves Left is a different , more depressing , more restrained , kettle of fish from this ... and this , well , it is one of the greatest solo albums made ... ever ? Yes , ever . It is a subjective statement - whereas I often try to wonder what others might think of an album , I have no means of conceiving a critical report of this one . Perhaps some of the music might not hit home with you , perhaps Drake 's voice will prove dull or frustratingly depressing.I ca n't tell - all I can say is , this is truly beautiful . Songs like Hazy Jane ( pick which ever one you want ) , or One of These Things First , or Northern Sky , go beyond pop or folk or normal mortal range . Drake entered the legion of immortal musicians among his fans not just because he died so young - Lennon 's death did not influence my preference for McCartney - but because he reached so many . And still does.His are not just words for youths , either - my father bought this on the basis of the Introduction , and loves the rest too . It 's awe-inspiring acoustic guitar . Astoundingly mature use of strings . A beautiful ( annoying to use this word so much - but there is no other to express the sentiment ) voice . Clever , haunting , moving lyrics . An album that works.And now I understand the cover - we can not empathise with the genius who feels isolated from his own world . But perhaps , by seeing his humility , hearing his message , we can touch something of ... well - that too is subjective , and for you to work out alone .	1
Nick Drake 's & quot ; Bryter Layter & quot ; is an awesome CD , my favorite song on this CD is & quot ; Fly & quot ; . I love this song it is soft , simple , light , and exceptionally mellow . It reminds me of water , because it is cool and crisp of extreme necessity . It drenches and washes the soul freeing and setting it free -- kind of like a fly.I find this CD to be the best that I have ever heard . I love groups like Bread , Ambrosia , and Fleetwood Mac . Mr. Drake definitely had his on sound and nobody . . . I do not think that anyone could ever produce such lovely music as he did . I wish that he could have produced more . Either way what he left behind was indeed a legacy.I am truly blessed by listening to such music that inspires the senses and the heart . Mr. Drake 's music is truly touching and soothing to the soul . . .	1
Aw no , not another hippy . Not another counter-culture lifestyle mullah . Ok , it looks that way but first , let 's check Nick Drake 's hippie-dom credentials ; 1 , Centre Parting ? - Check.2 , Floral Shirt/Dungarees ? - Check.3 , Being on Island Records ? - Check.4 , Standing in the woods with an acoustic guitar looking meaningful ? - Check.So , he meets the criteria , but does he have a pleasing , cynic-bashing , soulful music , designed ( in a genuinely conspiratorial sense ) to make your wobbling correspondent eat his facetious words with side-orders of tofu and quorn ? Of course he does , 'Bryter Layter ' is yet another excellent surprise.This one is screaming 'winner ' before you even get to the music . The sleeve reveals he has John Cale and Richard Thompson ( who is rapidly becoming one of my all time heroes ) in tandem , so you instinctively know he 's running from the winning blocks.Drake 's from the Cat Stevens school of smoothy folk-pop but he 's far from drone and earnestness . He 's got torrential strings , ringing guitar , and more impressively , good songs in abundance.A big music ( in a small sense ) but it compliments his sweet lyrics and melodies without swamping them.Thompson 's influence is immeasurable . Not just here but in music generally . He 's enriched works from Sandy Denny to David Thomas and his enigmatic-isms are seized on by Drake who uses them as a platform for his own successes , a building-block to his own particularly pleasing house of tricks.On top , he 's got the best use of flute and strings since Tull 's sumptuous 'Reasons For Waiting ' , ( which a fair block of 'BL ' is very like ) and a vital , vibrant album results.Sure , Drake looks all Woodstock , wet and wimpy but his voice has a sandpaper smoothness , and his songs very definitely have depth , insight and unity . He ticks the creative boxes much more than the ( deliciously ) sarcastic ones above , and therefore he emerges with kudos and no shortfall of credit.He 's nowhere near the genius Roy Harper is , ( See ? That Thompson again ! ) but 'BL ' is firmly on the right track and can fight it 's corner with vim and plenty of pride.So , puns well and truly on the back-burner , ( and is n't it cute the way that my reviews are circular ? ) one last condition..Does Nick Drake have a deserved 5-star brilliant album ? - Check .	1
What can I say about Nick Drake that has n't been said ? It was very late one night . I was writing at my computer with the radio on . Suddenly there was this beautiful song by a woman . I was instantly captured by it . So I got the phrase `` gon na see the river man . Gon na tell him all I can . '' I typed it into Google and discovered the amazing Nick Drake . The radio song was a cover version.Funny it took seconds for me to become a fan . And within minutes I was here at amazon.uk ordering his albums . What a amazing song writer and singer . Then I discovered his recordings were some 40 years old ... and it broke me to learn he died back in 1974 in a ( accidental ) suicide.How can someone like Nick die ? It does not enter my mind that the man who wrote all those beautiful and unique songs can simply die . And that was back in 1974 ! Those songs could have been written today . They have n't aged a month.I would say this one is my favorite album ... from a man who never wrote anything below brilliant . ONE OF THESE THINGS FIRST and the sweet SUNDAY are my favorite tracks . I can not grow tired of this . On the other hand , I 'm very happy to know he is getting today the recognition he deserves.The songs are so sharp and intimate you can almost recreate the feeling ( if such a thing is possible ) . The singing is so full of truth . The arrangements are so tasteful . Nick Drake is the rare kind of Artist who really connects . There 's no noise . Just the full experience.God bless you , Nick ! You did it !	1
The cinematic instrumental , Introduction , opens this treasure trove of an album , and is followed by Hazey Jane II , a lilting dreamy pop number . At The Chime Of A City Clock has its jazzy moments with lovely sax , while One Of These Things First , with its lively piano , is the closest Drake comes to happiness . The wistful and spacious Hazey Jane I is followed by the title track , an elegant breezy instrumental , and the sublime Fly . This version , with its fuller instrumentation , is my top favorite Nick Drake song , displaying the man at his best in its exquisite spirituality . Poor Boy is a jazzy/R & amp ; B song with soulful backing vocals , while John Cale 's celeste , piano and organ contributions on Northern Sky make this track a classic . Like two of his collaborators , Richard Thompson and Cale , Nick had his own poetic voice from the beginning , and his legacy is being rediscovered by a new generation of musicians . This album is the perfect entry point to investigate Drake 's magic . So many styles , but so coherent . Bryter Layter 's variety , sympathetic production and breathtakingly beautiful songs make it my favorite by this gifted artist .	1
Nick Drake 's second album , Bryter Layter , is the & quot ; lightest & quot ; sounding of the three he released during his lifetime . While not happy by any means , there is a breezy sound that flows throughout the album that adds a lighter touch to such brooding tracks as & quot ; Fly & quot ; , & quot ; Poor Boy & quot ; and the two & quot ; Hazy Jane & quot ; songs . The standout track on the album is the incredible & quot ; At The Chime Of A City Clock & quot ; which digs at the depths of the man and he confessionally lays his thoughts on the table . Another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer .	1
After the rainy mournfulness of his debut , Five Leaves Left , Nick Drake 's second album , 1970 's Bryter Layter , presents a warmer , jazzier treatment of his sensitive songs . Flutes and saxophones replace the somber violins and cellos and many tracks take a more uplifting feel , moving Drake 's sound closer to Van Morrison 's Moondance than Fairport Convention 's Liege and Leif . `` I never felt magic crazy as this/I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea/I never held emotion in the palm of my hand/Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree/But now you 're here/Brighten my northern sky , '' he sings on `` Northern Sky , '' and one can almost see a humble smile on the handsome , schoolboy face of the shy singer/songwriter . In fact , all songs , except the woeful `` Hazey Jane '' saga , seem to be more contented than Nick 's previous work . He manages to be sweet , buoyant and peaceful without sounding generic , oversentimental or boring . The only way in which Bryter Layter is a step down from Five Leaves Left is its instrumental tracks . Drake 's ability to pierce emotions does not transfer well into this format . The title track and `` Sunday '' dither into weightlessness . Besides that , the more Bryter Layter is as golden as Nick Drake 's other work .	1
Well , you pretty much have no excuse for lending an ear to Nick Drake 's three albums . Like many artists that manage to only release three albums , each of their records are so different and good that it 's quality over quanity . While Drake 's albums do n't score a hat trick together , all of them are worth listening to , and all of them are quite stunning.Nick Drake tried something new with Bryter Layter , and it sounds the best when the right mood hits ( just like Nick Drake 's other albums , actually ) .Bryter Layter is lighter than the rest of the albums , and is brilliantly orchestrated . Drake still has that beautiful guitar playing , though I think his playing is less highlighted , not quite as shimmering as Five Leaves Left or Pink Moon , but it does n't need to me . His voice is , as usual , stunning and evokes all kinds of things , his lyrics are as good as you 'd expect from him , and the other instruments are brilliantly used , as they are also a highlighted part of the record.As mentioned before , this is probably his most experimental of the three.All kinds of things show up , like flutes , strings , piano , percussion , horns , saxophones , bells , John Cale , plodding drums , other kinds of guitars , and bass . It 's closer to Chamber pop , or at least that 's the best I can make a connection to , than folk music ( at least in some of the songs ) . Three instrumentals also make the cut.For the songs themselves , they all have quite to offer . The three instrumentals are all beautiful guitar pieces with other instrumentation evoking moods like you would n't believe . Some of it is indeed quite jazzy , like Poor Boy , which sounds actually like bossa nova at times . Northern Sky twinkles beautifully , as it 's one of the best tracks on this album , and it 's a love song that does n't resort to cliches . The Hazey Jane songs , At the Chime Of A City Clock , no bad songs really . You get ten evoking pieces that shimmer with beauty , well your getting Nick Drake , and that says it all.This album does n't feature his best guitar playing ( that belongs to Pink Moon ) , but it perhaps shows Nick Drake 's amazing way of beauty , well , it 's just a fantastic showcase for Nick Drake ( hate to sound like the amazon editor 's review , but it is ) . Nick Drake is the best folk artist in my opinion , and it shows in his three albums . Get it now.9/10	1
This is Nick Drake 's most upbeat album , which is n't saying much , I realize . He does combine elements of smooth jazz , horn lines and sax into his folk sentiments ; it works well together . While I would n't call it a happy album , it is nice , smooth and mellow.As always Drake 's lyrics are built upon a series of images , mostly derived from nature . Personally I find them the strongest element of his composition ; but in this album the music is superb as well .	1
It took me a while to decide whether to tack on that fifth star or not . It feels unfair to give any Drake album a rating less than perfect , but this is the only release where the production and arrangements did n't entirely mesh with Nick 's vision . He was first & amp ; foremost a brilliant songwriter ( if I may be forgiven for making such a simplistic understatement ) with a talent for beautiful folk melodies and lyrics that read like fine poetry . He used odd guitar tunings and chords nobody else had even thought of , yet made it all sound completely natural . Every time I bought a 'new ' Drake album I had n't heard , I could n't get it out of my stereo for at least a week or two . Every person I 've played them for has completely fallen in love with the music and gone out to buy copies of their own . It never fails . Though Nick lived a short life and left precious few recordings behind , they remain as universal and personal as anything I 've ever heard.Ultimately though , I give just four stars here . Bryter Layter is overridden with even more trimmings and embellishments than his 1969 debut . On Five Leaves Left , the strings and backing musicians added nicely to Nick 's gorgeous songs without being overwhelming . Here they tend to drown out the beautiful simplicity of the songs on offer.. and consequently make the whole thing seem somewhat dated . It 's as touching and personal as anything Nick ever did , but this release has always been the one I listen to the least . ( This is all a matter of personal taste , true , but then so are all opinions on music to begin with . ) Robert Kirby 's string arrangements are well-done and sweetly soothing , but adding them to the degree heard here is like drowning a canvas in layers on layers of paint when just one simple coat would be just right.So what else is different ? This is the brightest and , dare I say , happiest of Nick 's four releases . & quot ; Hazey Jane II & quot ; has the most pep and energy of all Drake tunes , even going so far as to ride on a steady drum beat and include an upbeat sax solo . Three strong female voices give & quot ; Poor Boy & quot ; an extra backup before it flies away with the humbly hopeful & quot ; Northern Sky. & quot ; & quot ; One of These Things First & quot ; glides over a sunny piano ; & quot ; Fly & quot ; is a simply-perfect songwriting gem that makes you close your eyes and dream of happy places far away . A couple string-drenched instrumentals round things out before an ending that comes all too soon.As much as I love what 's on offer here , I still prefer the simple power of Nick 's velvety voice and unique guitar.. alone.. and I find myself listening to the bare-bones Pink Moon more than all his other albums combined . If you 're merely curious , go for that or Five Leaves Left first . There 's a compilation ( Way to Blue ) , but once this music touches you , you 'll only want them all anyway . Look up Bryter Layter later once you 're already hooked . Then join the rest of us in wishing there had been more ...	1
i think this could be his best album- i think the best tracks on the first album might be better than the best ones here- but overall bryter layter is probably the better of the two . i defy anyone , and i mean anyone , in rock n ' roll today to write something as perfect and as beautiful as , say , fly or at the chime of a city clock . drake 's voice and guitar work , as well as the beautiful orchestrations of robert kirby and guest appearances by john cale and fairport convention members , among others make this a lush and truly incredible album , nearly every track is a classic . this timeless album is like all of drake 's catalogue-essential . he just may be the best post dylan singer songwriter , and certainly until recently an underrated and unsung figure .	1
Nick Drake was one of those artists whom I 'd heard praised a thousand times in the past , but by whom I had never heard even a single note . So when I walked into Borders a couple months ago , I had n't thought about him in months and had no intention of getting anything of his . But when I saw his name out of the corner of my eye in the `` Folk '' section , something - I ca n't say what - impelled me to pick up a copy of BRYTER LAYTER . I had no idea what I 'd find inside . And that made listening to this album for the first time all the more magical.The categorization of music is a futile exercise at best , but BRYTER LAYTER is especially hard to pigeonhole into a single defined `` style '' . The music contained herein is just as likely to recall ( or rather foreshadow ) the jazz-pop of Joni Mitchell 's COURT & SPARK ( `` Poor Boy '' ) as the British folk of the Fairport Convention ( `` One of These Things First '' ) , dressed in Nick Drake 's exquisite guitar and strings straight out of `` Yesterday '' , accessorized by delicate flute and harpsichord . But then you have that alto sax appearing from nowhere in the baroque folk-pop of `` At the Chime of a City Clock '' , or the peals of distant tom-tom thunder in `` Hazey Jane I '' . And I swear the entire Belle & Sebastian catalogue might well be modeled on `` Hazey Jane II '' . `` Fly '' sounds like some timeless nineteenth century art-song , it 's so lovely and yearning . And `` Northern Sky '' ... I do n't know where this comes from , and I do n't especially care . I just know it 's one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard.Maybe the most accurate comparison I can make is to Van Morrison 's contemporaneous , similarly impossible-to-classify masterwork ASTRAL WEEKS . But that still that does n't do Mr. Drake and his record justice . Maybe BRYTER LAYTER does n't defy categorization so much as it simply ignores it . Its pastoral world can not be limited by such tags as `` folk '' or `` rock '' or any other label you care to think of or invent.I 'm a musical adventurer . I love to discover new artists and new albums and new sounds . But the best music , the stuff that really sticks with you , is familiar . Not samey or derivative , but familiar - comforting . So when you listen to it , even though you 've never heard it before , you have heard it before , if you know what I mean . Like meeting an old friend for the first time . Like BRYTER LAYTER .	1
Nick Drake was a selfless songwriter.His own identidy on this planet meant less to him than his music did.When his music failed to find an audience all that was left was the feeling `` of a remnant of something that 's passed '' .It is hard for me to be judgemental on someone for his possible suicide when you listen to the man 's music and find that person put all of his very existence into his songs.Not that it would have been the right thing to do , but the amount of healing thru song this man left on all three of his album 's is a lifetime 's worth.Bryter Layer is probably my favorite one as it still has the feeling of someone who hopes to reach people which is hard to find on his last album `` Pink Moon '' , which is quite a personal album ( Though still a masterpiece ) .Even the instrumental 's are stunningly good.His piano playing is both tasteful and subtle at the same time , which leads me to suspect he may have been just as gifted a pianist as he was a guitarist , but may have been disciplined enough of a songwriter not to overdo anything , which is why all of his song 's sound so sculpted and finished.He used his instumental gifts to showcase his poetic whisper of a voice.When I look back on his work 's the last thing that comes to mind is wasted talent , but on the contrary talent that was recognized , used with all humbleness , and just never appreciated.The beauty in it all is that we still have his album 's to find him immortalized.Nick Drake is `` The sweet breeze felt in the top of a tree '' and the breeze hold 's enough beauty to `` Brighten '' anyone 's `` Northern Sky '' .What an artist !	1
Hearing Nick Drake for the first time was quite a revelation . The guitar playing was so intriguing and ... different . And his voice really caught my attention . This disc is awesome-I would say as perfect as an acoustic folk album can be . & quot ; Place to be & quot ; and & quot ; Which will & quot ; are especially powerful . No frills on this disc , just a man and a guitar . There is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc , it 's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind . It helps me slow down . Essential .	1
Simply put , this is some of the most intimate and haunting music I 've ever heard in my life . It is also one of my favorite albums of all time . I had read an article in 1990 which mentioned one of Nick Drake 's songs and piqued my interest in his music . For some reason his name stuck in my head for a few years even though I was n't able to find any of his CD 's in stores at the time . I found `` Pink Moon '' in a store in 1995 and bought it immediately , excited that I finally found something by Nick Drake . This CD runs about a half hour , and the night that I bought it I literally listened to this album at least 6 or 7 times for what ended up being hours . I just could n't get over it ; his voice so hushed yet so expressive , the otherwordly tunings on his guitar , the impressive and powerful finger picking style evident on each song ... it still amazes me today . I really believed at the time ( and was probably right ) that this was one of the best kept secrets in music , and until the Volkswagon commercial which featured the song `` Pink Moon '' , it was . Nick Drake had struggled with mental illness and depression in the years preceding this release and the lyrics , desperate and depressing as they can be , give an insight into his mind that apparently no one close to him was able to achieve . The surprise is that the end of the album features the more optimistic `` From The Morning '' , which Nick 's parents chose to quote on his gravestone . `` Pink Moon '' , an introspective , all acoustic album with no instrumental backing aside from a brief piano solo in the title track , did n't help Drake 's already suffering record sales , and his depression increased until his death from an overdose of anti-depressants in 1974 . His biography made me more aware of why this album did n't sell more copies until recently , explaining that with bands like Roxy Music dominating the airwaves at the time , `` Pink Moon '' was not exactly going to take the world by storm and seemed decidedly uncommercial . The fact that this was Nick Drake 's final album ( out of only three he released ) is a sad fact , but thank God this was made . My CD collection is nearing 2,000 and this album has remained one of my top five favorites for the past ten years . Definitely a `` desert island '' disc .	1
The title track of this album , which is evidently the reason a lot of people buy this one ( from seeing the VW commercial ) is merely the tip of the iceberg.That commercial still amazes me . It 's introduced so many people ( including me ) to something wonderful . Pink Moon is 2 minutes long , but it is enough to hook right through you and pull you into Nick Drake 's beautiful , albeit fragile and melancholy , world . & quot ; Which Will , & quot ; also a deep , quiet song , is probably his second best-known song for being covered by Lucinda Williams a few years back.I 've yet to hear anybody blast Nick Drake for writing bad music , so that 's good news for new fans . Although I like & quot ; Five Leaves Left & quot ; a bit better , this album is also essential to any music lover . & quot ; Things Behind The Sun , & quot ; for example , is equally brilliant . As is & quot ; Place to Be , & quot ; & quot ; Parasite , & quot ; ... ah , hell , they 're all great . The real challenge would be to decide on which Nick Drake album is the best , not whether or not you should buy it .	1
There are three eseential Nick Drake albums : Five Leaves Leftwith its chamber folk , Bryter Layterwith its huge arrangements . and Pink Moon.Pink Moon is bassically Drake on solo accustic guitar . But Drake was no strummer . His complex composing and full guitar playing -- he could strum , pick , and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic -- make these full songs , rich in sound like jazz classical minitures.The sad Drake alone is a whisful , poiniant experiance , and listening to the beatiful music on Pink Moon is a trip like few others -- queiting and disquieting , sad and comforting.Essential	1
Pink Moon is the one of the most revealing folk/singer-songwriter records out there..which is odd , because the lyrics are impenetrably nonsensical . I think the reason Pink Moon is such an emotionally stirring record are Drake 's melodies and the intimate recording style ; as well , the strange guitar tunings provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics ' surrealist imagery . The magic of this album is in it 's less-is-more approach that conveys Drake 's mental state at the time . A fitting elegy for one of folk-rock 's most talented , and troubled , songwriters .	1
Recently , it has become fashionable for artists ( particularly in the alt-country movement ) to record spare , stripped-down albums featuring mostly just their own voice and and accoustic guitar . Richard Buckner 's `` Devotion + Doubt '' and Patty Griffin 's `` 1000 Kisses '' are two excellent recent examples of the style . But Nick Drake 's `` Pink Moon '' was the grandaddy of the all . Given the sheer talent that burns on this record , it makes his subsequent overdose and death all the more unfortunate.As for the songs , the title track is the signature song and thanks to Volkswagon is now Drake 's most well known song . Almost as good is the second song , `` Place to Be . '' Also outstanding are `` Which Will '' ( later covered by Lucinda Williams ) and the instrumental `` Horn . '' After that , the going gets a little rougher . `` Things Behind the Sun , '' for example , is a bit too rambling and at a mere half hour , the album feels a tad slight.Nevertheless , it is still a substantial and chilling work from an influential and tragic musical pioneer .	1
Have you seen that Volkswagon commercial where those college looking co-eds look like their going on a road trip at night , and then lay on the roof of their car and look up at the stars . Well if you have , you probably did , or did n't now that Nick Drake 's 'Pink Moon ' was playing in the background . 'Pink Moon ' was Drake 's last album ; originally forgotten by mainstream music fans , is now a testament to what a true artist is.You could listen to this recording 1000 times in a row and not get tired of it , and probably hear something different everytime . The album itself is a melancholy , moody , sort of naive triumph.Although Drake 's premature death of an overdose of antidepressants took down a genius in his prime , we still have his great recordings ; such as 'Pink Moon ' , and just wonder , what if .	1
It 's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes . Drake 's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever . But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words and single guitar remains stronger than poetry , than VW commercials ( that I did n't and I wo n't see here in Brazil ) , than all the simple things . This disc is a statement of life and how big it can be , Drake is saying death is possible . And only someone who knew the life can say it .	1
I thought with all the new found attention the song is getting ( due to the very nice VW commercial ) I 'd add this to my reviews.This is a classic collection of short , soft-folk driven music with amazing guitars and lyrics to die for . It 's certainly is nice to see everyone finding out about his music ... finally . Artists like Belle and Sebastian certainly have Nick to thank for their own style here in the new century . Like Ian Curtis after him , Nick was a genius for the ages . He was a more dark artistic type a songwriter , one who was simply a special unique voice way before his time or ours.please feel free to check out my other reviews .	1
One of the greatest folk records out there . Not much else needs to be said . We lost a genius to an overdose . Not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever as long as it is available to listen to . The stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing , so troubled , and so damning of the culture around it . I ca n't really say much more . This record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musicians . The remastered tracks sound every bit as good as they should . Perfection .	1
I remmber the day clearly when I first heard this record . I was in a record store ( Live music ? in Berkely ) and they had a listening section . The cover really fancied me and I decided to give it a listen . I fell in love with it from the first strings . I listened to the whole album and that day & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; was in my head everywhere I went . I finally bought it and I still feel the same about this record . It has the imagaination of a Lewis Carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that Dylan could only reach a few times . In my life I have only met less than a handful of Nick Drake fans and one day I was cleaning my room and from the T.V . in the other room I heard & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; and saw it on a car commerical . Atleast that gives me a feeling some people know Nick Drake . This album just does something to you inside . You 'll just have to buy it and see .	1
Never has music this beautiful been made . This is a precise peice of art , and you only wish he had made 20 or so albums . IT is very bare and to the point , but it is also inspiring . On a warm Fall day , or a cool night , put this on and sit back and relax , and let the music flow over you . It 's pretty amazing , and i do n't know why anyone would deny that . Hope no one does . Beck 's `` Sea Change , '' and THe Sundays must have been made with this album in mind . So if you like them you 'll love this , or vice versa . Besides the first song it is just Nick Drake and his guitar in a very stripped down personal setting , that sounds so fresh it feels like he 's in the room . If it is possible to cry over an album of music then this is the one you 'll be crying over . IT is that beautiful .	1
Being a big fan of Iron & Wine , Sufjan , Joshua Radin , Elliott Smith , and Damien Rice , I thought I would try out this CD ( also bought `` Five Leaves Left '' ) , as he seems to be an original ... and I was impressed . Nick 's guitar work is very solid , his lyrics poignant , his voice mellow , and his songs strong . The CD whips through quickly with its short songs ( too short ! ) , and I could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singers I mentioned above . Although I prefer the modern singers , this CD definitely will work its way into my rotation . I definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music ... if you prefer Iron & Wine over Blackeyed Peas , or Sufjan over Timberlake , or Radin , Elliott , and Rice over Maroon 5 , then you must buy this CD . But do like I did ... wait until Amazon puts it for sale under $ 10.00 .	1
Of all the places to discover Nick Drake , I had to discover him in , yes , the Volkswagen commercial . Despite this method of discovery , I am thrilled to have been able to discover Drake . His music can be dark and moody , but it is always beautiful , and always original . His lyrics , though sometimes non-sensical , fit the music well . They are mysterious and cryptic . The songs on & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; are unforgettable . There is the bluesy & quot ; Know , & quot ; the elegant & quot ; From the Morning , & quot ; and my favorite , & quot ; Horn. & quot ; Horn is a sparce instrumental track . Drake creates an atmosphere with this song that I have yet to see paralleled . My only quam with this album is that it is over far too quickly . With each listen , I am left wanting another half hour of music . Despite this shortcoming , I would classify this album as a true & quot ; classic & quot ; and would recommend it to music fans everywhere .	1
Pink Moon was the first Nick Drake CD I purchased , after reading a ridiculous magazine article a few years ago that compared him to Cat Stevens ( ? ! ) I may have set the bar a bit high for myself . Drake 's last album is probably also his least accessible , and the first few listens can be something of a shock to fans of a style and era in which songwriters usually wore their hearts on their sleeves . There 's as much raw emotion here as on any singer-songwriter album , but you have to go looking for it . Nothing about this album is easy or straightforward , and it 's easy to see why Drake 's music was rarely heard on the radio then or now . But that 's why it 's worth listening to again and again until it all clicks.Although the album was recorded in just two days , it features a polished and rehearsed sound , as if Drake had been working on these selections for years to settle on just the right vocal and instrumental combinations . Most of the songs feature only his guitar for accompaniment , but thanks to his intricate fingerpicking , the sound is oddly spare and full at once . Reading the lyrics on the page is a bit like reading impressionist poetry , and listening to them in Drake 's edge-of-death whisper hardly clarifies the picture much . A few of the songs still have me wondering if there 's any meaning to them , but they 're nothing if not thought-provoking.And over three decades after their release , they have n't aged a day . This is definitely one of those albums that require repeated listening ; but like most such albums , it 's a nice antidote to most of what 's popular at any given moment .	1
`` Pink Moon '' ( 1972 ) ... is the 3rd and final recording we were blessed with by Nick Drake ... This album consists of Nick alone-vocals , acoustic guitar and piano-where on his previous releases `` Five Leaves Left '' ( 1969 ) and `` Bryter Layter '' ( 1970 ) ... he was accompanied by studio musicians , also featuring John Cale , and with bass and string arrangements provided by the Excellent Robert Kirby ... Pink Moon is an essential piece of music history ... and will be forever recognized as some of Nick 's finest work ... Although ANY of the [ 3 ] albums are sure to please ... I own all [ 3 ] and would be lost without them ... How strange that Nick died in 1974 ... 5 years ( leaves ) after the album `` Five Leaves Left '' was released ... He is sadly missed-a poet , a wisened old soul who died at an all too early age ... yet the perfect age to preserve who and what he was .	1
This is one of those things you catch wind about and pick up at the store out of curiosity , wondering what it 's going to contain . You 're almost sure to find something special about this one , though . The first time i listened was probably a rainy day , and it 's peaceful quiet is soothing . Yet when looking at the lyrics , we see that Nick Drake was anything but peaceful and happy . Still , he somehow managed to take all of his inner turmoil and create something absolutely magnificent and unique , which is one of the crazy things about genius.The guitar playing is reminiscent of classical runs , like a folk Mozart combination . Drake 's voice is light and unpretentious ; quiet and naked . The album 's stripped down recording only adds to it 's ambience , because you get to see the songs as they really are , a theory i dearly wish other artists would try . There 's nothing about this album that lies , it is only a man and his songs , and it can only be that . Do n't worry about classification , or about what music you already like , because this album will strike you the first time you hear it . It 's music that has no limit .	1
Just to be different , I 'm not gon na spend this review rambling on endlessly about whom Nick Drake sounds like or whom he 's influenced . Instead , I 'm gon na talk about his music -- specifically , in this case , the album & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; . Ready ? Let 's begin : All of Drake 's albums are pretty terrific . & quot ; Five Leaves Left & quot ; is wispy and fragile-sounding in a typical late-sixties folksy kind of way . The only thing that makes it rise above the sandal-wearing fray is the strength of the songs themselves -- which , when you think about it , is a pretty good way to rise above the fray , if one feels compelled to do such a thing ... .Drake 's second release , & quot ; Bryter Layter & quot ; , is something quite different . This time , the songs ( while still -- genetically , at least -- wispy and fragile ) are beefed-up through a more ambitious ( did someone say intrusive ? ) production technique . The end result is intriguing ( & quot ; Hazy Jane I & amp ; II & quot ; ) and burdensome ( & quot ; Poor Boy & quot ; ) in equal measure . Call it a draw.Which brings us to & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; . Apparently , Drake was uncomfortable ( surprise , surprise ) with the pop star treatment of the & quot ; Bryter Layter & quot ; material because & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; 's stark , acoustic offerings are obviously a bold reaction to it . These songs are so quiet and introspective that they make & quot ; Five Leaves Left & quot ; sound like Deep Purple 's & quot ; Machine Head & quot ; . But that is exactly why & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; is Nick Drake 's crowning achievement . If anyone 's songs were meant to be recorded in a bedroom with nothing but a few wooded instruments and whispered vocals for accompaniment , it 's Drake 's . Just listen to & quot ; Road & quot ; , & quot ; From the Morning & quot ; , or the astounding , otherworldly title track and tell me that I 'm wrong ... .	1
If Bryter Layter , Nick Drake 's second studio album from 1970 , was Nick Drake 's public masterpiece , complete with a myriad of fantastic guest musicians , Pink Moon , his stark and lonely and incredibly beautiful , and let 's face it , 'solo effort , ' is his private one.The songs here are an ode to the night , an ode to solitude , to thought , to dreams , to finding a place in the world that is uniquely yours , despite the difficulties inherent in doing so.Pink Moon is an ode to the mystery of life , and , as in the Volkswagen commercial , seems to carry within it this strange feeling of motion ... it feels as if it is moving past you , as if Drake is , somehow , fading all the while that he is singing . It is ethereal and beautiful beyond words . The second song , Place to Be , is truly a gorgeous lullaby , and leads well into the rest of the album.Other standout tracks include Parasite , with Drake 's languid , barely awake voice crooning along to his brilliant guitar , the beautiful and haunting Horn , which summons up huge depths of emotion with just a simple guitar melody , ( short but brilliant ) . This song leads perfectly into the mesmerising , guitar-driven Things Behind the Sun , the ultimate song for artists - `` Do n't be shy you learn to fly/And see the sun when day is done/If only you see/Just what you are beneath a star/That came to stay one rainy day/In autumn for free . '' Other standouts are the tracks Which Will , a sweet , beautiful song which has been covered by the likes of Lucinda Williams , and finally , the gorgeous From the Morning , an ode to the beauty of the spirit.Throughout the darkness here , there is light . Sounding patient , measured , calm , Drake guides us through his days with a reassuring hand.. he is here for a little of the journey , but at some point , he leaves us , and we are on our own , with only the music to guide us from that point on.And what beautiful music it is .	1
the music of nick drake is like a dark look inside someones soul . and this album is the darkest part of it . after making 2 brilliant albums , that got little or no commercial acclaim , nick drake became very depressed , and made this in 2 nights at his home , brought the tapes to the record company unnanounced , then checked himself into a psychiatric ward . this is the music of someone about to lose their life . the title track was used in a volkswagen commercial a few years ago , but it is a classic song , and is great . the songs on this album ca n't exactly be explained track by track , but the standouts are pink moon , place to be , which will ( which i think might be the best song nick ever penned ) things behind the sun , free ride , and from the morning . if you are interested in getting into the music of nick drake , i feel that this is the best place to start with . believe me you will go out and buy five leaves left , and bryter layter the same day like i did . nick was a tortured soul , who was taken way too soon .	1
Pink Moon will always hold a special place in my heart . Not only was this my first introduction to the Artist . But was also my first CD exchange with a dear friend . The ramifications of emotions and memories this album brings are at times overwhelming.This Album embodies all I ever wanted to achieve , and all that I have.In the most simple definition Pink Moon represents the true shape of music . Music in its purest form and most beautiful shade.Recorded over two nights in October 1971 . Nobody knew he was making an album . He turned in the master tapes and proclaimed `` I have no more songs left to sing '' .This is just a man and his guitar . No more , no less . This is not about making a statement , creating greatness , or re-designing the laws of music . But merely an expression . And that is what music should be.Is so easy to indulge ourselves with production details and ideals . That we forget what true music should be .	1
Although someone with a ( admittedly large ) cultist appeal , Nick Drake 's music has never failed to enthral or inspire those that are willing to embrace his work . After suffering from two breathtaking beautiful , but commercially underperforming albums ( `` Five Leaves Left '' / `` Bryter Layter '' ) , Nick retreated into himself and produced his darkest album yet . Alone with nothing except an acoustic guitar ( and a piano accompaniment on several tracks ) Nick sings his way through some of the most reflective , poignant & introspective work of his short career . And the brevity of each of the songs ( most clocking in under 3 minutes ) only exemplifies it 's anguish & disenchantment , with Nick quietly strumming his guitar , and leaving his plaintive voice to exude emotion . For me this stark world that Nick inhabits is ( for me ) best exemplified by what I Consider a song of anguish , yet remains a truly , truly beautiful song . `` Parasite '' encompasses everything that was significant about Nick Drake and proved to be what was to be his fitting swan song ( the retail poor performance of his previous albums caused Nick to fall into a psychically crippling bout of depression ) . And thus ` Pink Moon ' was the final album release that Nick completed before his death , and remains one of the most emotionally stark albums ever created .	1
So stark , minimalist , and underproduced , it makes Plastic Ono Band look like 1984 . This is what makes Nick Drake one of those artists everyone 's heard of , but few have actually heard . Unless you can imagine any of this getting radio play , that is . Only one song , the album 's title track , features an instrument other than his acoustic guitar - a piano . The whole here is much more than the sum of its parts . I suppose that was the idea here , since only two songs run seriously over three minutes ( `` Things Behind the Sun '' ; `` Parasite '' ) . Those two are two of my favorite songs on this album , coincidentally , though that 's just because Nick is such a good lyricist , using metaphors and cooking up a stew of complex emotions ( title track ; `` Which Will '' ; `` Harvest Breed '' ) . His baritone is warm , inviting , and sounds very good . This is a very good record , though it 's so minimal it can wear just the slightest bit thin at times : hence , I 've rated it a full star below my favorite Nick Drake album , Five Leaves Left . All three of his albums are excellent anyway .	1
i 've heard well over 7,000 albums in my days here on earth , and this is a member of my favorite dozen . i have a whole arsenal of adjectives polished & ready to go here , but words really can not capture what makes this album so special . the sound of it all is just shot through with magic , sculpted in a musical language that escapes the written word . these are about the greatest folk melodies ever , a gift to the world from a troubled young man touched by a singular muse . the whole album plays out in under 30 minutes . stark and spare . gorgeous as it gets , mr drake 's unique guitar style is captured in astonishing vividness on this bare bones production . the piece titled `` horn , '' which is only one minute and nineteen seconds long , is as haunting a musical composition as i have ever experienced . a minimalist gathering of single notes that have a soul-wrenching impact . really ca n't be described . just pure feeling . unique and perfect . `` pink moon , '' `` which will , '' `` from the morning , '' songcraft at its finest . `` radio '' has guitar work that is astonishing . i could go on and on about this thing . few pieces of art have ever had such impact on my soul . do n't miss this tremendous outpouring of creative genius .	1
Clocking in at under 29 minutes , and just the sound of Nick Drake 's voice and guitar ( with a touch of piano on the title track ) Pink Moon is an undeniable masterwork by a pure , deeply troubled , genius . It would be the last record of Drake 's short life . As the story goes Pink Moon was made with just recording engineer John Wood in the studio , and it was realized in only two late night sessions . Apparently when the session was finished he dropped the tapes off at the front desk of his record label without a word . From start to finish , Pink Moon is miraculous ; raw , confessional and stark . The bleakness of the proceedings is leavened by Nick Drake 's wonderful , intricate fingerstyle guitar work and his gorgeous , rich other-worldly voice . From the Morning ends the album on an optimistic note , but it belies all the songs that preceed it . Every track on Pink Moon is essential to the whole . What is most astounding about Pink Moon is that it is utterly timeless . Almost any other recording of the period , whether it was British or American , would be heard today as a product of the early 1970s . Not Nick Drake 's work . And his guitar playing , with tricky open-tunings , was so technically outstanding . While Volkswagen has been alternately praised and lambasted for using the song Pink Moon to sell cars , the auto-maker did a great service by making this beautiful album known to a wider audience . No music collection is complete without Pink Moon , Bryter Layter and Five Leaves Left . Essential ! !	1
Many call this album stark , depressing , and disturbed . Yes , there are elements that are deeply sad , stark , and depressed , but I find most of the music beautiful , haunted , and beguiling . The title track is justifiably a Drake classic , and despite being used in a car commerical , I still love the song . The commercialisation of the song did n't hurt the integrity of it . Drake 's music is like that . It 's completely in its own universe than nothing can ever damage it . It 's so pure and so unique . Nothing can poison it in the eyes of those who love this man 's work.This is the most stripped down album Drake ever did . It 's just his voice , his guitar , his songwriting , and a touch of piano in the title track . That 's all that 's really needed . Despite the fact that his other albums have beautiful instrumentation ( including appearances by Richard Thompson and John Cale ) , the stripped down quality of this recording really enhances it . I 'm not going to say if this is my favorite Nick Drake album , but ultimately , it does n't matter with him . All 3 of his albums are so unique and special there 's no need to divide them up . They are like chapters in a book , all contributing to the greatness of the man himself . I miss Nick Drake quite a bit , but the albums will remain .	1
Somehow I 've come across Nick 's music , it 's an exquisite blend of folk and soft-jazz . The story behind Nick 's music and his life is tragic yet what he left behind is amazing , three studio albums and about four songs to start off a new album to be started before he died of a drug overdose.This album is by far his most melancholic , the most sparse record I have ever listened to , just Nick 's vocals and acoustic guitar plus a minimal piano overdub on the title track . The sparseness may be attributed to some people as making this album less accessible than his sophomore effort , but in my opinion it shows perfectly Nick 's state of mind in his last years , depressed and distant.The title track starts the album off , it has the most instrumentation and sounds the most mainstream on such an underground album , this song is a quaint song that explores the deep register of his voice . This song is commonly known because it was used in a Volkswagen commercial in 2000 . `` Place To Be '' continues in the same vein as the previous song , the lyrics illustrate longing and regret , very confessional , keeping in style with the album on the whole . `` Road '' makes use of Nick 's superb mastery of the finger-picking technique on the guitar , it sounds very intricate and masterful . `` Which Will '' is again , great but it has something extra , Nick 's voice seem to have a lot of hope in them and are n't full of regret and darkness . It 's a beautiful song . `` Horn '' is a great instrumental that shows off the musicianship of Nick . It leads well into the next track , `` Things Behind The Sun '' which is strummed in a great minor key and has an awful lot of melancholy shrouding it . `` Know '' is the most simple track on the album , built around a four note guitar ostinato it proves that you do n't need a Phil Spector treatment to stisfy your target listener . `` Parasite '' is written undoubtedly from how Nick saw himself , as worthless and a burden . It 's a chillingly realistic track that unnerved me deeply . `` Free Ride '' has some nice harmonics and use of keys , the song is quite unpredictable , but Nick keeps the song flowing well . `` Harvest Breed '' sounds like it 's in a slightly lower key than `` Free Ride '' , it may be short , but then so is the album at only slightly over 28 minutes . `` From The Morning '' is a beautiful way to end the album and is considered to be one of his best songs , one of the lyrics adorns the back of his headstone at his resting place in his hometown 's cemetery.Overall , `` Pink Moon '' may be short but it still is a lovely album , many people consider it too depressing to listen to because they think it emphasises too much on melancholy , well what kind of album do you expect a clinically depressed musician to make ? ? However , I believe there is hope in a lot of the songs , showing glimpses of Nick fighting the horrible depression that plagued him until his death . Simply an exquisite album .	1
Brief , sparse , warm yet haunting ... Drake 's folk classic has stood the test of time . His playing is masterful , concentrating on relatively simple melodies but putting amazing , unpretentious riffs in between . And that voice ... has love and fear ever been articulated vocally like that ?	1
Although the newly discovered attention to this song seems to be by way of a television commercial , I must say that the folks at VW knew this album and the feelings it encompasses . That much is crystal clear as one watches the individuals surrounded by the clear night sky , who then decide to leave a loud ( obnoxious ? ) party , and never say a word . Right on the mark VW ... kudos.This album is incredible . Nick Drake 's material , in general , is incredible . But , there 's something about this album that moves beyond all the others . It 's something you ca n't quite place your finger on ... but you will understand.For some , yet equally indescribeable reason , this album in particular brings to mind Joy Division . If you care to , follow this album with & quot ; Atmosphere & quot ; by Joy Division , or the & quot ; Closer & quot ; album in its entirety.You will not be diappointed with this one . Get a copy , drive to the most poignant place you have or know of , and lay back and take in the beauty that surrounds you ... .and the beauty this cd adds to it.Something else to keep an & quot ; eye & quot ; out for ... Brendan Perry 's latest release , and Peter Ulrich 's solo effort . Very , very beautiful .	1
Released in 1972 , this wonderful ( yet short 28'29 '' ) album of acoustic music by English singer/songwriter Nick Drake is haunting and sad , yet is also quite hopeful . Based on what I have read , the album was recorded in a mere 4 hours , which was spread across two sessions that each started at midnight and lasted until 2 am . Instrumentation on the album is sparse , and apart from Nick 's husky and warm voice , the only instruments used include acoustic guitar ( very unusual tunings are used ) , with rare sprinkles of acoustic piano here and there . Nick 's acoustic guitar playing is quite good and alternates folk-like strumming with some virtuosic , right-hand finger picking ( some of Michael Hedges quieter , delicate , and less busy pieces come to mind ) . The piece Know is fairly interesting because it features a repeated four note pattern on the acoustic guitar over which Nick sings - this `` minimalist '' approach stands in stark contrast to the comparatively more involved playing on the other pieces . A quick glance through the lyrics suggests a lingering sadness and hints of self doubt , although the music itself and the attention that went into crafting each piece suggest that Nick loved his music very much . This remastered CD features pictures of Nick , along with the lyrics and photos of his original notes made during the writing process . Sadly , this was to be his last album before his untimely death in 1974 of an overdose of antidepressants . Other studio albums by Nick Drake include Five Leaves Left ( 1969 ) and Bryer Later ( 1970 ) , which feature a wider variety of instruments and are not as stripped down as Pink Moon . Very highly recommended .	1
Like , and not like , ROBERT JOHNSON 's Blues , PINK MOON is NICK DRAKE 's masterpiece for the fan of Folk Rock , but this record Rocks not , yet is quite Bluesy . The unusual and spare guitar , with NICK DRAKE 's unique tuning , is reminiscent of the great American Blues artists like JOHNSON and SKIP JAMES , and yet , it is something else , something other , something more . These short songs are constructed of DRAKE 's idiosyncratic guitar and melancholy lyrics that are not quite circular , but softer , more introspective and I 'd dare say `` organic , '' and only because NICK DRAKE is so ... different . And also because his expressions are all Earthy : morning moon sun stars ... Yet like the Blues , these tunes have deeply personal themes borne of individual pain.Not really Orpheus wooing Eurydice with a guitar ( as the Rolling Stone Album Guide calls it ) it 's more rustic than that , Celtic , but still timelessly dreamy , ethereal , and yes , a bit spooky , PINK MOON is an artist fully realizing his potential and expressing it . Ephemeral , romantic , insidiously charming , alluringly poetic , PINK MOON is the record that music lovers eventually find , will find , should find , in their dreamscape . Unforgettable and indescribable , this soft , lilting record is of a voice not really like anyone you 've heard before , and wo n't hear again , unless you know or have known the dark angel murmuring in your dream night .	1
Nick Drake did not record a bad album during his all too brief life . This is his darkest effort , the sound stripped down to mainly his own guitar , and quiet voice . It is clearly a product of a great mental anguish , someone fighting their daemons , barely able to function . The lyrics are less lush and hopeful than earlier efforts , the arrangements starker -- overall , a bleaker , surreal mood that matches the album cover . The album showcases his guitar virtuosity drenched in melancholy and alienation . It is impossible to listen to this album and not feel for this man .	1
Nick Drake has become the darling of the soundtrack set . His songs have been used in the films `` Serendipity , '' `` Garden State , '' `` Dream With the Fishes , '' and `` The Royal Tenenbaums , '' as well as in a Volkswagen commercial . Pretty amazing for a guy who achieved no real commercial success while he was active and has now been dead for over 30 years . `` Pink Moon '' was the last album Drake recorded . It 's a haunting experience to listen to it now with the benefit of hindsight , knowing that the artist was only a couple years from taking his own life ( though many will argue whether his death was a suicide or just an accidental overdose ) . According to Drake 's producer/engineer John Wood , `` Pink Moon '' was laid down late at night over two evenings in early 1972 and featured almost no overdubs . The tracks average roughly two minutes in length , and the whole thing clocks in under half an hour , but the brevity and immediacy only add to the emotional impact.The more complex arrangements that marked Drake 's first two albums , `` Five Leaves Left '' and `` Bryter Layter , '' are gone . What remains are Nick 's soft , wistful voice , his guitar , and a little piano piece on the title track . The album is drenched in loneliness , disconnection , and the hard-earned advice of someone who was learning the difficult lessons of a world with which he could not cope . It is also dotted with signs of Drake 's desire to depart this life ; the four-line lyric to `` Know '' sounds an awful lot like a goodbye note . At the same time , tracks such as `` From the Morning '' reveal someone still able to find beauty and hope around him , even if he was only finding it for others and not for himself.I 'd single out other songs , but `` Pink Moon '' is a collective experience ; the perfect essence of folk music and a sorrowful portrait of a young man in the grips of an emotional state that he could not master as he mastered his art . I think few would argue that the best music is honest and offers us a look inside the performer . `` Pink Moon '' certainly meets that description , providing a window into an injured soul . At times it 's almost painful to listen , but at the same time it 's too magically beautiful to turn off .	1
I , too was shocked and amazed ( and a little saddened ) to hear Nick 's Pink Moon used to shill for automobiles , and I ca n't help but wonder what people will make of this if they buy it because of the TV ad ... this could most accurately be described as & quot ; uneasy listening & quot ; , on a par with Neil Young 's & quot ; Tonight 's The Night & quot ; and I would instead recommend Bryter Layter for the uninitiated . However , this is my personal favorite Drake LP , so yes , buy this one too , so you can discover what a very select few have known for years ... that Nick Drake was a major talent and the world is a poorer place for his passing .	1
This was Nick Drake 's final album before his 1974 overdose . It 's not even a half hour long , but in that short amount of time , he created some of the most emotional , challenging , somber , and thought-provoking songs , just with an acoustic guitar and his voice ! Not to forget that piano line in `` Pink Moon. '' 7 ! ! ! count em , 7 songs on this album made me cry , the title track , `` Place To be , '' `` road , '' `` which will , '' `` things behind the sun , '' `` parasite , '' and `` from the morning . '' That says a lot on how moving and harrowing an album can be . Nick Drake certainly had a gift of finding the right guitar chords to trigger someone 's buttons , and of finding the right vocal tones that are not too quiet , but not loud either . His near-whisper resonates so loudly that it sticks in not only your mind , but also your heart and even your blood.While some either scream at the top of their lungs out to get their point across , and others use walls of sound tyo capture an essence , Drake expressed more emotions on this album than Linkin park ever will , and moved me to other dimensions in music more than Jimi Hendrix , although Hendrix has always been a God to me.It 's a tragedy that Drake went unnoticed during his lifetime , which only adds to the mystique of this album and his entire catalogue , but thankfully , people are discovering him 28 years after his untimely death , and his music will definitely live on for centuries . The 2 best words to describe his music : ephemeral and ethereal . He might 've only released 3 albums , but those 3 albums are some of the greatest ever ... this one is the best one . This one is definitely in my top 10 for best albums ever . Buy it now .	1
It 's hard to explain to someone why you like Nick Drake . People either hear the unique talent or they do n't . To say he has a cult following today is an understatement.In all his songs there is a soft gentle vocal wrapped around an intricate guitar arrangement . 2 of the better examples of this would be the title cut and `` Place to Be '' . Listening to his music all these years later , it 's hard to see how radio missed this wonderful artist .	1
This album exists in a precarious balance : it is clearly the record of its artist 's descent into paralyzing melancholia , but it records that arc so beautifully . Its lack of ornamentation , which may alienate some new listeners , is also its greatest virtue . This structural clarity allows the subtle lyrics to shine through . Once neglected , with the rest of Drake 's body of work , this album is now rightly regarded as a rediscovered classic.In the unlikely event you do n't already know this album , it was his last studio album , recorded by Drake alone with his guitar ( he later added some piano flourishes to the title track ) . This allows him freedom to explore his vision , and he proves quite the guitarist . The intricate arrangement on `` Free Ride , '' for instance , contrasts with the austere sound of `` Know , '' an unvarying railroad shuffle with no dynamic variation , powered instead by Drake 's `` high lonesome '' wail.His lyrical theme appears to be that he cares deeply , but can do no more than he already has . The deeply fatalistic structure of his verses comes across in lines like this , from `` Road '' : You can take the road that takes you to the stars nowI can take the road that 'll see me throughHe 's granting his listeners the freedom to go on , even though he believes he 's turning them loose on a fool 's errand . Similarly , from `` Harvest Breed '' : Falling fast and falling free you look to find a friendFalling fast and falling free this could just be the endThe collation of freedom with finality seems remarkably dark , at first blush . The moment you 're free , you will die . But consider it from the other angle : the moment you die , you 're free . Death need not mean bodily death , though . As in the tarot , death may mean any sudden change , the end of an old way , and the commencement of a new . Death , then , is not scary . And it 's not final.Nick Drake scares some listeners because he is n't bound by the strictures of cultural normalcy . If you know anything of his life , he may not have even been aware that such strictures even existed . He speaks an argot that does not bend to the whims of fashion . But if you like music with an edge , and lyrics which speak perceived truth , then the very traits that alienate Nick Drake from some listeners will endear him to you .	1
Nick Drake was a tortured soul but sometimes it seems the most beautiful works come from angst . This album 's greatness lies in the simplicity : Nick Drake and a guitar ( and a tad of piano ) . Saturday mornings with some coffee and this CD make me feel so relaxed . `` From the Morning '' is probably my favorite , but that can vary as well . The entire CD is only about 28 minutes , probably the most melancholy 28 minutes ever recorded .	1
In the throes of a depression that would see him dead at the age of 26 from an overdose of anti-depression medication , Nick Drake still managed to produce his last album , `` Pink Moon . '' Unlike his first two efforts , which consisted of orchestrated folk-pop music , this 1972 album was just Drake playing his acoustic guitar and singing ( with a bit of piano here and there ) . The result is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that has a haunting and pristine beauty . There are only eleven songs , most of which are under three minutes in length , which is why the album is not even a half-hour long , but there is a sense in which anything longer would be too much to bear . `` Pink Moon , '' by itself , justifies Drake 's status as a cult figure among those who love folk-rock.Ironically , you have probably hear Nick Drake 's music before , because the title track was used for a Volkswaggen commercial , just another example of how music is perverted to commercial interests ( what else is new ? ) . I have been spending the cold winter putting together mixes of folk music ( in the broadest sense ) and making a concerted effort to get beyond Bob Dylan and the Byrds to explore the likes of Sandy Denny and the Beau Brummels . Checking out Sandy Denny led me to Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson , and eventually to Ralph McTell and Nick Drake . Now I can only wonder what rock I have been living under that I have never come across these artists before.The title track is a beautiful folk ballad , performed with just Drake 's superb acoustic guitar playing and haunting vocal . Throughout the album you notice the depth of his lyrics and his guitar playing . The latter might have been lost in an album with orchestration , but here you have the opportunity to listen to the openings of `` Radio '' and `` Parasite '' unadorned . For the former a choice example would be the opening of what is probably the best song on the album ( it is hard to choose ) , `` Which Will , '' which begins : `` Which will you go for/Which will you love/Which will you choose from/From the stars above ? '' There is a simple elegance to the lyrics , captured by the vocals , and complimented by the more complex guitar playing.Nick Drake only produced three albums , so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library . These works represent the very best of the British folk-rock scene and Drake is a first rate singer-songwriter whose songs of failed romance , mortality , and depression are quite affective . Drake intended `` Pink Moon '' to be his final album , saying he had nothing left to record . When you lose yourself listening to these songs , you can actually convince yourself that this was true .	1
I have listened to `` Pink Moon '' again for the first time in a year . In fact , I let it cycle through three times , feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fades away to silence , for this , at times , the music of quiet . Perhaps it is the vocals , often a hoarse whisper that can not compete even with the solo acoustic guitar , or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life 's shortcomings . There are moments of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here.The title track is a delight , but the interplay of piano and guitar makes me yearn for more instead of less , so that after a few songs with just guitar and vocals my attention drifts . Each flows and melds into the next , never quite forging a separate identity , one extended thought shrouded in neither black nor white but a gray , hazy and vague . Still , the effect for me is much like trying to make a meal from a stash of communion wafers . Each song ushers in a promise of something more , something beyond the pall , but few fully satisfy . ( I prefer his other work on `` Five Leaves Left '' and `` Bryter Later . `` ) Desolation and isolation may permeate the songs , but Mr. Drake still displayed his mastery of the acoustic guitar with a touch and flair that both keep the whole recording from drowning in melancholy and testify to his considerable talents . Hence , `` Pink Moon '' seems as a fitting requiem for Nick Drake .	1
The thought of Nick Drake being so depressed that his life would end at the tender young age of 26 is itself , to me , a sobering and depressing fact about how hard life can be . While Nick Drake may not have been able to cope with life , it is also clear to me that his was a gentle and sensitive poet 's soul . Listening to this - his most stark recording - you come directly in contact with Nick Drake 's very soul , and this soul lives on . The record is thus haunting , and beautiful.I 'm no religious fanatic , but I can not help but think that the sheer depth of the music of Nick Drake , and of Pink Moon in particular , hints at a realm of the spiritual . There is simply something in this - Drake 's quiet guitar strumming , his mournful singing , the overall simplicity of the arrangements - that is not unlike the moment of contemplation that one sometimes experiences while sitting in a holy place , be it a church , or a chapel , or even a small natural pond surrounded by nature , and which is thus transcendent.In fact , as Ian McDonald 's sympathetic Mojo article `` Exiled From Heaven '' argues , `` Nick Drake was n't a literal disciple of Blake or Buddha . There are no direct Blake references in his lyrics , nor is he likely to have treated Buddhism as more than a confirmation of concepts he 'd arrived at through his own experience . Nevertheless Blake 's mystical vision and the tenets of Buddhism illuminate a great deal of his work . Drake 's outlook seems to have boiled down to the linked recognitions that life is a predicament and that the world is ultimately an irreducible mystery to us . Why it exists , why we exist in it , why there is anything at all , we have n't the slightest idea . From this sense of predicament and mystery flows all his work and also his message to us . More than that , the same influences shaped the growth and decline of his life . '' The article adds , about Drake 's vocals , that it is `` a low , close , sustained sound , rich in chest vibration yet entirely without glamorous vibrato . It 's the sound of incantation : slow , deep , OM-like . His phrasing is riverine , flowing across metre and through bar-lines as though detached from normal time . It 's as if he 's seeking to impress upon us the sense of another way of being . `` Looking at , and considering such elements of this music , it is obvious that there is more here than a quick consideration might recognize . It is perhaps these various elements which makes this music so rich , and which , for me at least , causes it to become ever more satisfying with each subsequent listen . I just know that I 'll be listening to Nick Drake for the rest of my life . I ca n't say that with confidence about too many musicians .	1
I was a latecomer into Nick Drake 's music . As many other people , I re-discovered him `` thanks '' to the media hype of recent times . And boy am I happy I did ! Nick Drake 's music combines the best elements of folk and brit psychodelia.When I listen to Drake , besides entering a peaceful state where I feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe , I remember music from Jeff Buckley , Elliott Smith ( both , no longer among us as well ) , Rufus Wainwright and even Cat Stevens ... Sad thing , how after thirty years of his passing , a commercial may bring his music back to life , some say . Me , I feel it 's all just fine : Nick 's posthumous album brings 1972 all back , with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it , making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work , write to or quite simply ... sit back and let go .	1
Nick Drake 's is one of the many sad stories from the world of music . He was signed by a record company when he was just 20 , released three albums , went into seclusion , and then died from overdosing on antidepressants , a death which was officially ruled a suicide . His music was well received by those who actually heard it , but partially due to his refusal to perform live or really do anything publicly , it never really sold well until many years later when the title track from this , his final album appeared in a car commercial . I instantly recognized it once the vocals started up , although I ca n't say whether it 's the commercial or just hearing it on the radio . In any case , it 's the beginning of one of the best folk albums I 've heard in my limited experience , and certainly still worth listening today.Except for a bit of piano on `` Pink Moon '' , the entire recording is just a half hour of Nick with his voice and a guitar . It 's apparently easily his sparsest release , but I found myself nevertheless enjoying what he was able to do with such a limited range of sounds . He plucks and strums his way through eleven similar but distinct enough songs , many of which portray all too vividly the personal issues and depression that likely led to his early death . There 's `` Place To Be '' in which he already seems morose over his long gone youth at the ripe old age of 24 . And then there 's `` Which Will '' , where he seems to ask a woman who she 'll love if not him . And who can forget `` Parasite '' , a title that conjures an image of a despicable , loathsome pest and is in reference to Nick himself . And despite all this self negativity , there 's a simple beauty to the music itself that somehow makes the whole thing even more depressing . It 's not the most interesting album I 've ever heard , but it 's one of the most emotionally affecting , and definitely worth a visit for anyone interested in the genre .	1
& quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; is one of the saddest -- and most beautiful -- albums put to tape. & quot ; Road & quot ; , & quot ; Horn & quot ; , & quot ; Things Behind the Sun & quot ; and & quot ; Parasite & quot ; are the sad songs . Otherwise , I think the album has more of a bittersweet feel to it . Sure , Nick Drake was melancholy and depressed , but he was able to find beauty in it and make pure art out of it all.This is my favorite Nick Drake album because it is so pure with no strings attached -- literally . Just his voice and his guitar , and a little twinkle of piano in & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; . And the brevity of it all is so amazing -- Drake says all he needs to say , and I was n't thirsting for more . Sure , I would have loved to hear more of Nick 's songs , but I do n't think the album would have had as much of an impact on me . More songs and albums should be this way -- it seems so many albums now and even back then thrived on excess.And Nick 's guitar playing really shines through . He was an exceptionally skilled guitarist , and he uses unique tuning on most of the songs on this record . His way of guitar playing has also shown influence on some of today 's folk troubadours like Elliott Smith -- another disciple of despair , misery and heartbreak.As far as the Volkswagen Cabrio commercial goes , I do n't look on it as a bad thing at all , so everybody should just stop their whining . It 's bringing Nick 's music to a wider audience , and I had n't heard of him until a year and a half ago , so I feel VERY grateful . Nick Drake was one of the most talented singer/songwriters , and his music is a true work of art .	1
of course it is..you know that.my first exposure to a nick drake songwas sebadoh 's cover of pink moonback in the 90's.for whatever reason i didnt really listen to nick himselfuntil 2007 when i was working at night by myselflistening to a playlist of hundreds of songs made by other coworkers , and this record came on the speakers.i think id always known id get it eventually.i think i had to grow up alot to really get it.now i feel i do more and more.a short perfect quiet melancholy record.very little going on , nothing but what 's absolutely necessary.anyway , get it if you love music .	1
The most popular and probably widest revered of his catalog , Nick Drake 's `` Pink Moon '' is a stripped down guitar-and-voice record , with only occasional overdubbed piano . In response to this , the production is much drier than on previous albums , lending a natural fragility to the record rather than the warmth on the previous two albums . The album has a sparseness to it , emphasized further by its short length , but a great power as well . I do n't think its quite the masterpiece its often thought of as ( I 'd reserve that for Drake 's debut , `` Five Leaves Left '' ) , it is a fine album.What it excels at is being delicate -- check the instrumental `` Horn '' , a simpel and beautiful guitar line , or the famous `` Pink Moon '' ( featured in a Volkswagon commercial ) and the stunning `` Things Behind the Sun '' . The material is brilliant , its just that there 's not terribly a lot of it , and some of it would have benefited from a stronger production and arrangement.Still , its a beautiful album , and well worth investigation . Recommended .	1
This is a quiet , haunting , intimate , sparse , spooky , lulling , uneasy album by one of the greatest ( previously ) undiscovered talents of the 1970s . The sound is so simple and spare you might not even hear it if it 's on and you 're not paying attention , but if you give it your full attention , you 'll find yourself being overpowered , and falling in love.All of Nick Drake 's albums are good , but this one , on which he strips away everything unneeded -- strips away all the sappy smooth jazz saxophone or unnecessary strings -- and leaves only a defeated yet hopeful voice , a masterfully fingerpicked lo-fi guitar , and a piano note here and there , is his most cohesive , coherent , perfect album . If this were the only thing he had ever recorded , his name would live in music history forever . If this were the only album you ever bought , your money would not have been wasted.Every one of these songs evoke emotion . You will feel dark nights , empty parking lots , feet crunching through gravel , lost loves , and times you can never go back to.You will feel like you know Nick Drake personally , and that feeling wo n't be wrong .	1
`` Pink Moon '' was the third and last album that Nick Drake managed to get released in his all too short lifetime . The album differs somewhat from the previous two ; first and foremost through the fact that the songs are only accompanied by Drake himself on his acoustic guitar , apart from the title track which has a nice little piano line also played by Drake.The songs are generally simple and short , and in some cases they may seem a little unfinished , with only one verse and a slightly raw sound on the guitar . Drake 's well known and strong songwriting is present on most tracks , and when a first disappointment may have subsided , you will discover several fine songs on a par with Drake 's very best.The title track `` Pink Moon '' is perhaps the easiest to tune to fall for ; a very melodic and catchy song , ywhich you may easily find yourself go humming . A nice variation with the nice piano-part.There is as of the first two albums a sad undertone to most songs . This applies not least `` Place to Be '' , one of the few songs with longer lyrics . `` Road '' is a nice little song that could well sound like a Donovan song . `` Which Will '' is also a song that wins on closer acquaintance , while `` Horn '' is a nice little instrumental which showcases Drake 's original guitar style . `` Things Behind the Sun '' is another of the album highlights ; a song which seems completely finished , unlike the next track `` Know '' , which in both sound and form appears rather unfinished - a little bluesy thing.The sad mood get an extra shot with `` Parasite '' also one of the most memorable songs . `` Free Ride '' may also appear a little unfinished but still quite charming Another fine Donovan-like song.b '' Harvest Breed '' is a very short little song with just a single verse - it has a fine typical Drake melody . `` From the Morning '' is a worthy end to a nice little album which may nevertheless appear somewhat unresolved , and one can easily come to feel that the album could have deserved a little more time in the creation process and maybe a little variation in the arrangements . The cover art , though , is by far the most interesting among Drake 's three albums .	1
Nick Drake-Pink Moon ****1/2Pink Moon is one of the most alluring albums in the history of music . Both dark and ominous and yet somehow either hits you as a incredibly hopeful piece of music or the bleakest track listing this side of Big Stars THIRD album.With songwriting so sharp and poetic it drives you nuts and encapsulates you with each listen . Acoustic guitar work to write home about combining to make a sheer classic.Pink Moon is an album for all times , moods , and most importantly all collections .	1
This album is the most perfect 30 minutes you could buy.It is one whole suite not individual songs ; each new song intensifying the last.PINK MOON opens and comes as a warning & quot ; its gon na get you all & quot ; . What follows are songs that capture emotions indescribable , Pure Blues . HORN is minimal to say the least , single notes express thoughts clearly.The last 3 songs are my favorite , Drake 's guitar playing is excellent on these . I can not imagine how it is just him playing one acoustic guitar and thats it . There is so much more going on . His finger picking and the tone that he gets from his guitar are almost impossible to replicate . Combined with his voice and lyrical interplay its just brilliant.Listening to this record is like a wiping clean all stresses and problems in your life . Pure and Simple melodies to soothe your soul .	1
Do n't get me wrong by the title of this review I love this cd . This is the most depressing cd Nick has done let alone any one has done , but I never felt depress because I listine to it . It is amazing that he managed to record these songs consdering that he check his self in a metal instution shortly after finishing this album . It is also one of the few cds with only a voice and guitar that I can listen too alot of times .	1
Nick is a recent discovery for me . Needless to say , it 's a much welcome discovery . Drake 's vocals are haunting and beautiful ; the style is vintage sounding yet distinct . The guitar playing is magnificent . If you are looking for something to fill certain void in your modern folk music files , look no further , Nick Drake fills the gap very nicely .	1
Nick Drake 's Pink Moon is roughly thirty minutes long . It 's worth ca n't be measured in minutes . How does one measure the pure poetry of a young man 's last stand . Time ca n't reflect a sadness darker than the deepest sea . A lone voice and single guitar have never said more . Pink Moon is timeless ...	1
This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there . It contains classics like `` Radio '' , `` Which Will '' and the well-known title track . `` Know '' is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice , while the jangling guitar of `` Parasite '' has an almost hypnotic quality . `` Ride '' has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists , I think . `` From The Morning '' is another pastoral gem . Although delectable in its minimalist elegance , Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album . I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing . Still , this remains a minimalist classic .	1
Nick Drake 's final album , Pink Moon , was recorded over the span of two days . Unlike his first two albums , which contained backing of strings , woodwinds and keyboards , Pink Moon is stripped down to bone . Mr. Drake 's expressive guitar takes center stage and the bleak arrangements feed the depressive lyrics . The title has become famous thanks to its inclusion in a Volkswagon , but it is only one of many stellar tracks . & quot ; Things Behind The Sun & quot ; , & quot ; From The Morning & quot ; , & quot ; Road & quot ; , & quot ; Harvest Breed & quot ; and & quot ; Rise & quot ; all contain dark , brooding , deep and thought provoking lyrics that show a man with clear inner demons .	1
In 1972 , Nick Drake , just twenty-four years old , felt beaten . The Cambridge singer/songwriter 's two previous LPs , although excellent , had gained little attention and a severe case of clinical depression was clouding his emotions . Now it was time for Drake to reluctantly enter a studio and fulfill his three-record contract with Island Records . The resulting work , Pink Moon , is one of those rare occurrences when a genuine sense of dread and sadness saturates through the recording studio wires and unto tape , captivating more focused and dedicated listeners . A mild mannered Drake recorded these eleven songs , clocking in less than thirty minutes , with just an acoustic guitar and his delicate , beatific voice , where his previous albums found Nick 's songs backed with a think layer of accompaniment . The music does not suffer in the least , though . Drake 's sturdy guitar strumming , always his secret weapon , makes this some of the lushest music ever recorded with only an acoustic guitar . Pink Moon is a superb album , containing much of the best of Drake 's brand of starry , heartfelt songs , including the sentimental , yet fearful title track , the bleak & quot ; Place to Be & quot ; and the touching & quot ; From the Morning. & quot ; Yet , Drake explores some distinctly new teritory with the paranoiac & quot ; Parasite & quot ; and the rhythmic & quot ; Free Ride & quot ; and & quot ; Harvest Breed. & quot ; When finished with Pink Moon , Nick left the master tapes on Island Record 's reception desk and quietly walked away , remorsefully withdrawing from the music business . Sadly his death from an overdose of anti-depressants followed two years later . Nick Drake never realized what an exceptional young talent he truly was . This album stands as the most emotional , bare boned reason why he so underestimated himself .	1
I , like pretty much anyone who has gotten into Nick Drake 's music in the past year or two , found out about him from the Volkswagen Cabrio commercial . I fell in love with the song , and pretty soon I was on ... trying to find more and more of his songs . Pretty soon , I just bought the album and gave the entire thing a listen . `` Pink Moon '' , the title track , is definitely one of the best songs on the album , but it is not the best . `` Things Behind the Sun '' is , in my opinion , the best track on the album ; every time I hear it , I get chills down my spine , especially the last two lines : `` And the movement in your brain , sends you out into the rain . '' Every song on this album is a gem , from start to finish . My only problem is that it 's only about 28 minutes long ... I wish he could 've put more songs on it.But that is only a very minor problem , and I only wish Nick Drake were still alive today to see that his dream really did come true . Nevertheless , at least I can still enjoy his music from all four albums and treasure them forever .	1
Thanks to the magic of the internet , I was able to listen to Pink Moon many times ( legally ! ) , and it 's the most stripped down album I 've ever heard . A sound system wo n't do anything to enhance the music . There is no hidden melodies , and what you hear on the surface is all you get . It does n't get more stripped down than this . Only one song features a piano , which is the title track . Everything else just consists of Nick Drake , his acoustic guitar , and his thoughts . Really does n't sound very interesting , I know.Yet this is the exact essence of one of the meanings of music , putting your thoughts and emotions into music . Nick Drake never felt more stark and empty , so he recorded this . Everything shows that in Pink Moon . Yet while it is empty , there is a beautiful emotion behind it . The right place for this to be listened to is in nature . Nowhere else will Pink Moon will click . Heck , just try blending this album with the ambience of a forest . Focus on the music and what he 's saying with the beauty of nature itself . Totally amazing . I get the same feeling listening to this as the same feeling when I sit on a porch in the forest , with nothing but nature , getting this emotion you just ca n't feel . Why listen to the music that makes me feel this kind of emotion in the place it conjures ? Sounds great to me.The music , of course , will always stand on it 's own , no matter where you are . When listening to this , you will forget people and be with yourself . Drake 's guitar playing is pretty catchy too . He can make a good melody with his guitar , and it does seem to fit the lyrics well . It 's a great thing he makes good guitar lines with plenty of melody , because it 's the only thing . It is truly some beauty in this , and the melodies are never boring , just beautiful . Thanks to that , along with his excellent voice , he creates something that will hook you from beginning to end.For people who want some music as pure as possible , buy this album . Nuff said.9/10	1
nick drake pink moonnick drake-guitar-pianoproducerthat 's all who was in the studio in the time of making this acoustic classic how can such beauty come from such raw elements i can tell you , because nick drake had talent , and he presented himself well in his vocals , his guitar playing and his lyricsyeah to some people the lyrics may sound naive and childlike but to me they are simple for a fact of getting a point across , and the instrumental horn is a superb track in a middle of a masterpieceafter you 've got this get `` five leaves left '' features the classic `` river man ''	1
I found this album in a used LP bin in 1990 . I bought it because the cover was cool . At first listen , I was unimpressed . It sounded so ... bare , so basic . Nonetheless , I found myself listening to the record again and again ... until I suddenly realized I had come to love it . A few years later , I picked up & quot ; Fruit Tree & quot ; which included everything Nick Drake had ever recorded on 4 CD 's . Pink Moon remained my favorite . After experiencing the spare , delicate arrangements of & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; , it was hard to relate to the horns and strings n & quot ; Bryter Layter & quot ; and & quot ; Five Leaves Left & quot ; ... the songs are great on those two records , but I feel the production hopelessly dates them.Just the other day , being an obesessive about sound quality , I bought the new 24 bit remaster of this album . The new CD sounds at least as good as the old LP ( although , in honesty , my copy was neither an early pressing on anywhere near mint ) . Inner details are subtly revealed . Drake 's voice has more & quot ; air & quot ; around it , you can discern the character more readily . The music itself , of course , remains utterly essential . The lyrics are spooky , the guitar playing is intricate . For all the talk about this being a & quot ; dificult & quot ; album , I feel it is actually very accesible . It is melodic , gorgeously wrought , full of mystery , and at times , full of joy .	1
I 'm not sure why I 'm writing this . If 199 reviews with an average of 5 stars apiece ( 4.8 if you get technical about it ) did n't convince you I 'm not sure what more I can say . But here goes.There have been few albums in artists that have made such a beautiful account of standing on the edge , of being depressed , disillusioned , longing , and sheer loneliness . Yes , Nick Drake encapsulates all these emotions so simply and so poignantly in a mere 26 minutes , with only shimmering accoustic guitar to accompany him . His lyricism is powerful , his poetry is romantic , his voice is angelic and his guitar play is as virtuosic as they come . And when he sang , he sang as if he meant everything he wrote . He sang with desparation when he sang `` Oh so weak in the palest blue , so weak in this need for you , '' with bitterness when he sang `` Know that I love you . Know that I 'm not there '' and with sadness when he sang `` I am the parasite of your town . '' And he did n't need a single distortion pedal , amp , a band , or even a pick ! There is no filter from the things in his heart to the mic , just him ! So those of watch tragic movies , lamented with Dylan when he sang Not Dark Yet , listen to Norah Jones and Jack Johnson and folk and blues or any other music that sings of inner frustrations , or play an accoustic guitar for that matter , you needto hear Pink Moon badly ! ( Note : Nick Drake 's music overall is n't as depressed as some would lead you to believe . If this is too disturbed for you , Bryter Layter might be more to your liking . But get Five Leaves Left too . No matter which one you buy first , you 'll want the other two as soon as you hear it .	1

Nick Drake 's third and most stripped-down album is music at its most elemental state : One guitar ( played without a pick ) . One totally naked voice . The only extra is a few piano notes scattered throughout the title track . This album was recorded in 1972 , but that matters not . Emotion and music this pure could 've been made 100 years ago or yesterday.Drake 's hushed voice and lyrics are full of loneliness , despair , regret , and alienation ( Parasite and the title track , especially ) ; but there 's a current of hope and introspection throughout that redeems it from pale sad-sack whining . Raw and real , very autumnal music . And Drake 's underrated playing never disappoints -- it never feels studied or dry , just an endless cascade of pastoral strumming and shimmering melody . In particular Horn , Know , and In The Morning are amazing , both in their simple yet eloquent songcraft and enchanting guitar lines.This is one short album , only 28 minutes total ( with the longest song measuring shy of four minutes ) but it remains unsurpassed in its minimalist elegance . Play this for uneducated folks who think that `` sensitive male '' acoustic fratboy crap like John Mayer is the be-all-end-all , and watch the amazement on their faces . Totally essential , and one of my favorite albums regardless of genre .	1
I own 3 copies of this cause I 'm concerned that I might lose the first two . 28 wonderful minutes of music that will stand the test of time . It has been said many times before but it bares repeating ... ..this is a masterpiece . A place where hope lives wrapped in a dark curtain .	1
This is less of a review and more of a sonic comparison to the two `` Pink Moon '' ( lps ) I own . I own this latest remastering and the Simply Vinyl reissue . The new one is more transparent , guitar strums have nice tone and resonance , transient response is greater . Overall , I 'm glad I decided to purchase this latest remastering from a great artist .	1
I do n't mean that title in a bad way , but there 's an undeniable dark-hours-of-the-night feeling throughout this album 's 28 minutes . Pink Moon is certainly Nick Drake 's saddest and darkest work , but ultimately the most timeless . Where Bryter Layter can sound slightly dated and over-orchestrated , I say the simple power of one good voice and a guitar will never age . This album could have been recorded in 1971 or tomorrow.Someone below used the phrase `` pleasantly melancholy '' and I entirely agree . Beautiful though short ( the longest track `` Things Behind the Sun '' clocks in at a whopping 3:56 ) , yet nice and moody , this is the kind of music that can make you cry and then make you glad you did . Hope comes and goes here ; never really joyful but never really gone . The title track - perhaps a precursor to the harbinger of doom `` Black Eyed Dog '' which only surfaced after Nick 's death - seems a recognition of an omen with almost a weary acceptance . We go out on a positive note in `` From the Morning , '' but that blend of pleasantness and sorrow never really leaves.If you 're reading this , chances are you know and love the treasure that is his music already . For someone who has n't heard any Drake before I 'd recommend the debut Five Leaves Left ; there 's a single-disc compilation ( Way to Blue ) , but once you get addicted you 'll only want to buy them all anyway . Pink Moon is about Nick Drake and about all of us , one of those rare works that truly speaks to something in everyone .	1
When I first saw and heard & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; , one of my favorite songs for many years , being used in a Volkswagen commercial , my first thought was , & quot ; Oh , cool . Nick Drake 's music is finally being brought to the masses. & quot ; Believe me , I 've seen many examples of great songs being tarnished forever by being used in a bad commercial , but this is n't one of them . The song is used tastefully and respectfully ; Nick Drake largely shunned human contact , so he would probably have approved of the commercial 's depiction of 4 kids who decide they 'd rather just drive around on a starry night than go to some party and get wasted and laid . I 'd also say that , judging from the fact that a 28 year old record is # 12 ( Mar . 27 ) on the Amazon best sellers list , that the song is just as much a commercial for Nick Drake as it is for Volkswagen . Think of the power of a 30 second snippet of a song : without any information about the artist , people have searched out this deceased man 's music , wanting to hear it again . My hope is that these neophyte Nick Drake fans will listen beyond the title track and discover just what an amazing album & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; really is . That song is just one of an amazing collection , recorded by a man in extreme despair , with lyrics that appear to be out of some poet 's feverish dreams . Maybe they 'll then move on to Drake 's other wonderful albums . And hey , if it took a car commercial for this to happen , so be it .	1
I bought a Nick Drake album once before & amp ; was really disappointed by the arrangements . Lots of strings ... could n't really listen to it . Then I picked up Pink Moon . WOW ! This is what all the fuss is about . Unique , acoustic , mellow & amp ; beautiful . If you are at all interested in Nick Drake get Pink Moon first & amp ; you 'll be hooked . This is a great album & amp ; I 've got to admit that it was that VW add that made me give Nick Drake another shot ... really a mellow classic .	1
yes , this is a sad and eerie record . i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake albums , but this is a fine album in its own right . my favorite songs are things behind the sun and parasite . know is also excellent , a weird little blues cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and a few deceptively simple words . a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60 's early 70s singer songwriters . and as always , his voice , arrangements and words are eerie , haunting , and touching . highly recommended .	1
The entire album consists of one man , an acoustic guitar , and a little bit of piano . Most of the songs do n't top 3 minutes , and the whole thing does n't top 30 . The album probably cost less to record than most artists spend on room service at the Hilton . Heck , there 's even a couple of mistakes here and there in the guitar playing.And yet , despite all this , I have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this is one of the most brilliant and complete albums ever made . What Nick Drake did on this album is just monumental , and despite its super-exiguous nature , this album just has so much to it , and proves to be more and more rewarding with time . Nick was no virtuoso musician by any means , but he was an awe-inspiring songwriter who knew how to entrance your senses with a simple 2-minute song . His distinctive , smoky voice just had an indescribable warmth and coziness to it that perfectly complemented his entrancing guitar melodies.He also does a magnificent job of keeping the songwriting interesting and diverse . With an album like this , it could potentially become monotonous , but not so here . From the bouncy `` Free Ride '' , to the dark and haunting `` Things Behind the Sun '' , to the infectious piano-adorned title track , there are plenty of different moods , shades , and textures to keep you listening , and keep you coming back . This is a great album for driving through the countryside , or sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold night , or just hanging around doing nothing in particular.This is just a really spectacular and timeless piece of music . Nick Drake 's career may have been brief , his ending tragic , his success too late , but with `` Pink Moon '' , he has made a bigger impact than he or anyone else could ever have imagined .	1
`` You can take a road that takes you to the stars , I can take a road that 'll see me through '' - as the lyrics to the beautiful `` Road '' ring , you ca n't help but feel the sadness of `` Pink Moon '' . Moments of sanguinity and senses of cynical optimism cut through the bleak overtones , but they are ominously tinted by the reality of Drake 's impending suicide . Certainly the legacy of a suicidal musician is nothing new , but while half-hearted , self-loathing singer/songwriters , surrounded in their glorification of depression emulate Drake 's altar , one must take `` Pink Moon '' for what it is - one of the very best folk albums ever made.Throughout the album Drake weaves a master class in acoustic guitar playing , utilising alternative tunings and complex , delicate finger picking , all produced through a wonderfully warm tone . The sound is sparse ; unlike `` Five Leaves Left '' or `` Bryter Layter '' there are no orchestrated sections , nor even a piano in the mix . It is stripped down , raw and lonely . And this acts well to emphasise the stellar writing , especially with such outstanding songs as `` Things Behind The Sun '' , `` Pink Moon '' , `` Road '' and `` Free Ride '' , some of the most delicate and haunting music Drake ever created . It is unfortunately a very short album , almost equalling a lengthy EP , and that is my one qualm . It is rightly heralded as one of the greatest folk singer/songwriter albums .	1
There 's music in the air and oh yeah , the music can be heard from across the waterway , the lagoon- It procrastinates out over the buffet table and the bar and the dessert table , through the lanai and over the gentle undertow where the bridge crosses , over the rustling of the green swamp water grass , the reminiscing of the beauty of the life of music lingers on . It was early and people began to drift in at a slow and leisurely pace , Freshly showered , perfumed , lazy days of life sustain without regret , White linen pants and summer dresses all year round . The employees came first , then the aroma of mesquite grilled abundance which was professionally marinated and cooked full moon for the party goers , smoked out over the embankment . Slow cooking-a whole days process in homage to this very night . Then came the young fresh energetics , more than ready and willing to celebrate the beauty of their existence , their diversity , their lives on this planet . The language of the music was not always their own but the emotion of their music was universal . There was mingling , laughing , and frivolous celebration of good things in life yet to come . Her real name is Betty , but we call her June . And when it was all said and done , couples walked slowly away from there , hand in hand , stopping every once in a while with their eyes glazed over , to make a point of remembering that particular moment in time . They had said , & quot ; We should really do this more often & quot ; and meant it.Tristan Tom	1
This album is pretty good . The singer 's voice for whatever reason reminds me of a softer version of Cat Stevens , the music is slower , quieter and melancholy . The arrangements are just him and a guitar , with a bit of piano on the title track . If this came out today , it 'd probably be labelled `` sadcore '' .My only real complaints is that the album is a little short , and I felt there could be a bit more accompaniment . The piano on the title track is nice . That 's just a matter of taste I guess.I enjoy this album nonetheless . It 's relaxing and I enjoy going for a walk during the evening with this on .	1
Who was Nick Drake ? What motivated him ? Why can you never tell , from his singing , what mood he was in ? Those tunings : where did he get them from ? What did his friends think of him ? These questions need answering . This music is as emotionality devastating and powerful as Joy Division.Why ? On the surface , we have beautiful melodic structures rendered on acoustic guitar , with unorthodox progressions . On top is the velvety voice , rather middle class , which never even attempts to ` project ' or ` emote ' . The key seems to be that Nick Drake realised something important : that surface structure and deep structure are orthogonal . You can express the deepest despair in the prettiest of ways . Joy Division and Nick Drake : totally different surface structures ; same deep structure.It 's not always true . ` Which Will ' has a gorgeous detuning which makes the guitar sound like a harp . Small triplets sound in the treble ; the bass strings take you down with them . The shape of the music , its progression , has some of the finality of Joy Division 's ` New Dawn Fades ' . But then again , it 's cheerful . Like Mozart . Cheerful and sad at the same time . During ` Pink Moon ' , Nick sings ` Saw it written and I saw it say ' ; only you 'd swear it was a strangely-accented ` Saw it written and suicide'.This music is undateable . You would not be surprised to hear ` 1965 ' or ` 2005 ' or anything in-between . Like ` Bryter Layter ' , this music is extremely sophisticated , formally advanced , durable , and totally enigmatic . It would sound at home in a wine bar . Why does it make you want to cry ? Where is the emotion , exactly , being expressed ? This music is an object lesson to the emoters , of which there have been far too many in rock . It is extraordinarily subtle , and makes nonsense of aesthetic theories that try to relate form to content , and which rock stars implicitly recognise . No flangers , no chorus effects , no big drums , no grunge screaming for titles like ` Parasite ' and ` Harvest Breed'.Nick Drake taps and expresses fundamental emotions which rock music does n't often go near with any real success . Things like , beauty of days ; loveliness of weather and girlfriends ; how do you survive lost love ; what do you do when you hate yourself ; what happens when the world does not accept you . He was some kind of genius at rendering these things . I am still trying to work out exactly what sort . RIP Nick .	1
This is actually one of the most relaxing albums I 've ever heard . & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; is ideal for 3am listenings , when the world is quiet and still and you want to be alone with your thoughts . The gorgeous title track , & quot ; Place To Be & quot ; and the instrumental & quot ; Horn & quot ; are my current favorites , but everthing here is so beautifully sung and simply played , singling out any favorites is kind of beside the point . One can actually hear Drake slowly coming unraveled emotionally as he sings ( and sometimes mutters ) his disquieting and somewhat caustic lyrics . The fact that he died not long after this was released adds a certain poignance to these proceedings , but one leaves away from & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; feeling refreshed and invigorated , sort of like having a new lease on life . Just dim some lights , lie down on a big fluffy pillow and let Nick take you by the hand and lead you into the ether ... ..you 'll never be the same again.Bonus ; the guitar playing here is a marvel of simplicity ! R.I.P . NICK DRAKE , you were a visionary .	1
Pink Moon , Nick Drake 's final album before his unfortunate death , is a masterpiece . Recorded during midnight sessions on consecutive nights , Nick Drake sat in a studio with himself and producer Joe Boyd . The only thing that accompanies Drake 's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar ( and piano on the title track , Pink Moon . ) As Drake plunged deeper into depression , he expressed himself by recording the bleak Pink Moon , which stands today as one of the most underrated albums by one of the most underrated singer-songwirters in history . Recommended .	1
Bobby Goldsboro was one of my favorites from the 60 's . All quality music . Very worth the investment for those who like the music of the 60 's .	1
This is an excellent compilation of Bobby Goldsboro 's hits and important tracks . Goldsboro is probably one of the more underrated singers from the 60 's . His music was at times sentimental , but his delivery was always heartfelt . His first hit `` See the Funny Little Clown '' was self-penned and still sounds fresh . His version of the Burt Bacharach `` Me Japanese Boy , I Love You '' is a lovely ballad that sounds fresh in this digital format . `` Little Things '' is a pop jewel that Billy Gilman covered several years ago . With its popping chorus and original bass line , it 's a track that holds up well 40 years later . `` Voodoo Woman '' is another great rocking track with that pounding drumbeat , `` Voodoo woman you break every heart you see ; so voodoo woman stay away from me . '' `` If You 've Got a Heart '' is a track that I 've come to enjoy as a result of this compilation with its pretty upbeat melody and breakup lyric . The combination of opposites is kind of a musical version of tragicomedy . `` Broomstick Cowboy '' is one of the more sentimental tracks that Bobby wrote with its midtempo beat and a pretty melody . My favorite Goldsboro track is `` It 's Too Late '' with its pounding rhythms , horns , driving bass line and Goldsboro 's expressive delivery , `` I remember when I told you that I 'd try in every way to hold you & kiss you & love you & keep you 'til my dying day , you just laughed and said you found somebody new , & you did n't need all the things I could do . '' This is excellent classic rock . `` Blue Autumn , '' Goldsboro 's biggest hit `` Honey , '' and `` Autumn of My Life '' all reflect the more sentimental side of his recordings . This collection is an excellent compilation of the magic of Bobby Goldsboro . Enjoy !	1
For the era in which I was interested , 1968-1973 , this CD was great because it had every Bobby Goldsboro song that ever charted then , to my knowledge . Some really great-sounding songs , especially for singers looking for acoustic guitar songs to play solo , are & quot ; The Straight Life & quot ; ( 1968 ) , & quot ; I 'm A Drifter & quot ; ( 1969 ) , and & quot ; Summer & quot ; ( 1973 ) . Minor complaints : ( 1 ) I 'm pretty sure this recording of & quot ; I 'm A Drifter & quot ; fades out several seconds earlier than the original single version did . ( 2 ) A very large percentage of these songs are irritatingly trite and mawkish , especially his earlier material , even big hits like & quot ; Honey & quot ; and later hits like & quot ; Watching Scotty Grow. & quot ; I never noticed that before , but that 's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 .	1
This is one of the more underrated , unheard of albums I 've come to know and love . The eclectic mix of influences in Matt Mahaffey 's life are obvious as there are tones of hip-hop , tones of pop and tones of rock splashed within it , and has some of the best pop music that 's been released in a long time.Marathon Shirt is one of my favorite tracks of all-time and the singles , & quot ; Cannon & quot ; and & quot ; So Low & quot ; were large reasons why I became addicted to the infectious music that Mahaffey puts out.This is probably the most accessable Self album that was ever put out ( Breakfast with Girls is fairly accessable too ) , and remains as one of the better albums , though & quot ; the Half-Baked Serenade & quot ; is absolutely GREAT , but good luck either FINDING it or finding it at an affordable price ( I paid $ 45 for mine about a year ago , and it took me about 2 months for one to catch one go on sale on Ebay ) .Gizmodgery , another Self project , is also a good album , but the fact that it 's as experimental as it is just makes it a little less open to the average listener.If you 've never heard of Self , buy this album . It 's well worth it . If you HAVE heard of Self , you 've probably got it already , and for those of you who HAVE heard of Self , good luck finding & quot ; half-Baked & quot ; and & quot ; gizmodgery. & quot ; I 've come to find that most people who buy this album end up fanatic like me ...	1
If you are too young to remember the 1990s , Self 's Subliminal Plastic Motives will give you an earful . From the time Nirvana releasedNevermindin 1991 to the tragic end with Britney Spears ... Baby One More Time [ ] at the other end , the Clinton era was home to some amazing , rock based experiments.Subliminal Plastic Motives contains some of the chainsaw guitars that became so popular during the 1990s , but this is no grunge album . You 'll know this on hearing the second track , `` Sophomore Jinx , '' which combines guitar fuzz with a silky synth line . Trendier bands were doing this , but `` Jinx '' turns a lot of melodic and textural curves and corners . You are pulled in by having to listen twice.Most of this music has a power pop sound , but this is only a starting point . Self powders this music continuously with unexpected little details , does the work that a lot of artists of the era were to grungy to do.You 'll never mistake this for any other time , but for the era , this is a great example of how interesting mainstream rock could get .	1
This is SELF 's first outing and it is no less than excellent . In any review of any disc by this marvelous act I will always say that MATT MAHAFFEY is a genius . A little more guitar driven than future efforts , SUBLIMINAL still has raw , unbridaled hook that makes every song catchy , intelligent , and extreemly listenable after several plays . A CD that should already be on the shelves of any who know what good alternative music is all about .	1
Self is one of the most innovative pop-rock bands of the 90 's and it 's a damn shame to see Mike never broke out into the mainstream . Subliminal Plastic Motives , while not his best album ( that goes to Gizmodgery which was made only using toy instruments ) , it 's probably the best for a new fan to get.Musically the album contains everything from Power pop and jazz to hip hop influenced beats and Nirvana guitar progressions . The way Mike uses each instrument is amazing , I especially love how he uses keyboards and pianos . Plus vocally he 's killer , very warm and inviting . Some of my favorite tracks off the album are the single So Low , Borateen , Big Important Nothing ( which features amazing jazzy keyboards ) , and Cannon .	1
Again a collection of relatively short songs passing through many rock sub-genres , Elvis Costello 's second LP is as good as its predecessor , and it seems that his melodic sonse is even getting better . The main difference between both efforts is that the cuts here sound much more like parts of a unity , actually like ` 'songs taken from Costello 's 2nd album '' , which they are - an important Leitmotiv here being a very clever use of synthesizers and keyboards , sometimes sounding like a weird electronic Hammond ( ! ) . Although his songs are more traditionally melodic , there is a weird sophisti-trash aura in the air that allows his second masterpiece to be as funny as solid , simultaneously difficult and easy . Plenty of hits and songs deserving-to-be-hits , it 's a total classic among fans . Sngles include ` 'Radio , Radio '' and ` 'Pump It Up '' , and best cuts include ` 'This Year 's Girl '' , infectious ` 'The Beat '' and shiny uptempo ` 'Lipstick Vogue '' with its crazy bass , weird synth noise and fine drum treatment .	1
With 'This Year 's Girl , ' Elvis Costello takes the 3 minute pop song and makes it into an art form . Nothing about the album is revolutionary on the surface , but each song is dexterous and complex within its own simplistic framework . The melodies never feel calculated or mechanical despite how expertly they are crafted . Each note that Costello sings seems like the natural progression from the previous note . Track 7 , `` Hand in Hand '' is a particularly good example of Costello 's fluidity as a songwriter . There was a time where I literally listened to this song on repeat over and over . `` You Belong To Me '' and `` This Year 's Girl '' are sugary pop on the surface , but over repeated listens , they 're marked by an incredible attention to melodic detail.The lyrics are witty and thematically hit upon the notion of fleeting coolness . Costello seems jaded by how hipness corrupts . He cynically sings about Chelsea , radio , and `` paradise '' and the sad notion that love is as vapid and fleeting as the culture of models or celebrity . Costello 's raspy but superbly endearing voice convey this edginess and disenchantment without coming across as pretentious . It 's interesting that this album still seems so hip because , at least I interpret it , it is an indictment of hipness.The production is pitch-perfect . It was released in 1978 , but it could have been released yesterday . That 's how fresh this album is . The harmonies are there , but they 're not syrupy . And the band : the Attractions brings an energy and musicianship that is uncharacteristic to an album that is so songwriting-focused . `` ( I Do n't Want To Go To ) Chelsea '' has one of the best and most driving drumbeats in a pop song . So does `` No Action , '' the album 's fantastic opener . The keyboard work throughout is also stellar , though it may take a little while to get used to that cheesy organ sound.This Year 's Model is definitely one of the best albums , the more endearing because of its outward simplicity and accessibility . It is a work of craft , sincerity , and vision . I love it .	1
In my quest to redisover the bespectaled one , I found a used copy of reissue 1 of Elvis ' second album - if you know anything about the latest record biz reissue craze , it 's that they keep remastering and reissuing some classic albums over and over again in slightly different forms ; for Elvis he is on his third round of reissues , but I 'm just buying used for now . This Year 's Model found our boy a tad more angry than on his debut and with the help of newly recruited the Attractions , he found some keyboards and jumpy punk rock . Arguably , the roughest and loudest of Elvis ' albums , featuring the cynism and adorable aggravation of Elvis , the album contains some of my favorite Elvis songs ever like `` Pump It Up '' , `` Little Triggers '' , `` ( I Do n't Want to Go to ) Chelsea '' and with this re-release , the single `` Radio Radio '' . If you have n't started investigating early Costello yet , I may have to stop talking to you ... next on our Elvis list is what will probably be my favorite Elvis album Armed Forces if for nothing other than I think `` Oliver 's Army '' is the ultimate Elvis song .	1
This album is absolutely perfect . Every song is great in every way ; the songwriting , musicianship and attitude are all just right and compliment each other perfectly . Elvis Costello may be dignified and old now , but anybody who 's heard this album knows just how punk he was back in the day . Just listen to the lyrics on `` Lipstick Vogue '' or `` No Action '' ... you do n't wan na mess with this guy . Also , he 's the only person who has EVER looked good in those glasses .	1
What you have here is Elvis at the top of his game , both in song writing , and musically - making this release a classic and essential recording.Following on the heals of a smashing debut , this release proves that Elvis was no passing fad , but rather a powerhouse that would help shape the face of contemporary music !	1
Though it was his second studio album , it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album . & quot ; Radio Radio , & quot ; & quot ; This Year 's Girl , & quot ; & quot ; The Beat & quot ; and & quot ; I Do n't Want to Go to Chelsea & quot ; were some of the top songs of the new wave . They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago . It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do & quot ; Radio Radio & quot ; on SNL , backed up by the Beastie Boys ! If you 're wondering when Elvis was actually & quot ; cruel , & quot ; listen to this masterpiece !	1
In truth , I 've only been exposed to ten or eleven of Elvis ' 30+ records . Some are very good . Some are very bad . Still others are just okay . But This Year 's Model beats 'em all , except possibly its sequel , Armed Forces.The first thing you may notice about this album is the difference in bands . Clover , Costello 's collaborators on My Aim Is True ( his third-best ) , were just another bar band . Not the Attractions . The Attractions were an anaglam of punk , New Wave and a bit of funk ( listen to Bruce Thomas ' bass , and you 'll know what I 'm talking about ) . They 're also far more fierce . They do n't just rock , they rock with a vengeance . And everybody adds something important : Bruce and Pete Thomas give a strong , supple , funk-rock rhythm section ; Steve Nieve , weird , sometimes cheesy keyboards . And Elvis of course gives the VENOM.Then there 's the songwriting , which is even sharper than it was first time out . The melodies are always strong , whether the song itself is great ( the Beatles-like No Action ; the cynical This Year 's Girl , lightspeed Lipstick Vogue ) or just okay ( Little Triggers , Hand in Hand ) . But even the just-okay songs are listenable . And the lyrics . Remember how I talked about venom ? It 's all over the place . You 've got your big , bad , funky anti-hendoist classic Pump It Up ( with the ultimate shout-along chorus - arena-ready , but in a good way . And that bass solo ! ) , the nervy , paranoid , very underrated Beat ( which I think is my favorite on the album - I love the chorus and Neive 's keyboards ) , the unforgivably nasty , take-no-prisoners attitude of This Year 's Girl ( Based on the Rolling Stones ' Stupid Girl , which it manages to one-up in the anger department ) ; the aforementioned Lipstick Vogue , which again spares nothing in putting down an ex-lover ( `` Sometimes I almost feel ... just like a human being '' - great , GREAT lyric ) , and my second-favorite , ( I Do n't Want to Go to ) Chelsea , where Costello unloads all his ire against vanity . And it 's funky , with Elvis almost rapping over the tight groove . Love it . Oh , almost forgot the Spector-esque protest Radio , Radio . WHAT A SONG ! While Costello was mad with everybody , he decided corrupt , payola-influenced DJ 's would be another valid target . And while it 's essentially whining , who can argue with the brutal lyric `` They say you 'd better listen to the voice of reason/but they do n't give you a choice because they think that it 's treason '' ( or something like that ) ? Love the video , too . I 'm not the kind who sits around watching MTV or VH1 - I saw it at a Hard Rock Cafe - but it was amazing , just so unpretentiously fun - look at Steve Nieve in the background , totally making a fool of himself . ( It 's worth noting that , right afterwards , GN'R 's pompous , unintentionally hilarious video for Estranged came on - no need to ask which one I prefered , I hope ) . More to the point though , that 's a hell of a video.And this is a hell of an album . Like My Aim is True and Armed Forces , it 's all the Costello a beginner needs , along with a compilation of some kind .	1
i had been in a deer hunting accident . i awoke in a hospital and down the hall a boombox was playing this album very loudly . i knew everything was going to be okay .	1
It 's easy to see why this is usually listed as among the best albums of the 70 's . Coming off a very decent debut album , few could have been ready for this brilliant follow-up which reminds me a lot of Tom Petty 's best work with the Heartbreakers . The musicianship and songwriting has improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the Attractions as well as Costello himself imcreasing in confidence and maturing in ability . The sound quality of this remastered version is also brilliant and together with the wonderful mini-lp sleeve design which includes all the lyrics in English and Japanese as an insert make this the best version of this album that is out there at the moment . Highly recommended !	1
If only for the great bonus live disc . I am sure they could have just released the concert on its own and sold it out many times over . Like another reviewer suggested , this is even more thrilling than the El Mocambo concert disc , but they could 've fixed that also by releasing the entire Mocambo show , un-edited . Setlists being similar , we probably do n't need both , but heck , Elvis could release them anyway . A whole passel of live show releases would be nice , for that matter ... Docked one star only because the bonus material on the first disc has already been reissued .	1
Ca n't disagree with anyone here , except to question the notion of EC coming even slightly below Presley and the Beatles in the ol ' pantheon of rock gods . In my opinion , he crushes both of 'em . Rrrgh ! My favourite Costello album still has to be Armed Forces , but this is almost as breathtaking , particularly after the maddeningly inconsistent My Aim is True . To be fair , there is n't a whole lot of difference between the songs , musically -- loud'n'ferocious is pretty much the consistent thread throughout -- but that matters not a whit while the thing is playing ( very loudly , one would hope ) . Is it possible that the second & quot ; Capital punishment/She 's last year 's model & quot ; in ... Chelsea is the single most ferociously-delivered couplet in rock 's history ? Yes , I rather think it is . But that 's just the tip of the non-proverbial iceburg , as everything here rocks full-tilt . Some of the bonus tracks , naturally , are n't awe-inspiring , but RR is good , as is the Mick Jones-featuring Big Tears . And the demo of Greenshirt , while not necessarily better than the & quot ; finished & quot ; version on Armed Forces , is quite an interesting take on the song -- very minimalistic ; much less orchestration . Who cares ? I like 'em both ! 'Cause Elvis is God , and if you do n't own this album , you will be forever damned to wander a nightmarish musical wasteland ! And I mean every word of that !	1
If you are in a party mood , this is definitely a record to play . The variation between tracks is not that great but that is not the most critical issue hear because most of the songs are really good . The extra tracks add soemthing sepcial especially the last three acoustic ones as I never pictured Elvis as an acoustic artist . He does quite well in that realm . However , Pump It Up , Lip Service , and No Action are my three faves on this one . Elvis really puts alot of effort into this one and that will make it a good deal for most record collections .	1
The concert on disc 2 and the 8 bonus tracks on disc 1 are quite the deal - could 've been a whole album set by themselves . The concert stuff on disc 2 smokes . What an energy - what you 'd expect from a rowdy rock n roll crowd from the late 70s and it 's cool to hear a younger Elvis interacting with them and hearing them fuel his performance as well . He really puts a fire into the performances and all the instruments and everything just has the best of live energy.Having gotten into Costello 's later stuff first ( When I was Cruel era ) , `` This Year 's Model '' never completely hooked me , but this set is the way to go if you want to explore cause it gives you the studio album first , puts you through some demos and obscure cuts after that ( some of which are as good or better than the cuts on the original album ) , and then when you 're wondering how well you enjoyed the album , you throw on disc 2 and you get the whole thing again live into the bargain , and it 's a hands down top-notch show that ought to renew your whole respect for the album and the heady year of 1978 .	1
Costello 's first album , MY AIM IS TRUE , was perfect . His second album , THIS YEAR 'S MODEL , is even better . On this album , all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut gets released . Just take a look at the song titles . This album is very much about sex . Fortunately , Costello is literate enough that he does n't have to stoop to using graphic language . Instead , he uses all sorts of similies and metaphors . This album just explodes with energy . Also , this album serves as a wonderful transition from his first album , MY AIM IS TRUE , to his third album , ARMED FORCES .	1
Many people seem to regard This Year 's Model as the best Costello album out there . I agree with most of this opinion , but naming it `` his best '' neglects his other important works . Elvis Costello 's first 6 albums ( excluding Almost Blue ) work as an all-for-one/one-for-all outfit . But even so , I 'd personally place This Year 's Model as the initial masterpiece that sets the wheels of Costello 's career in motion.After his first record , Costello came up with a set of songs that were even faster , more aggressive and cerebral . This Year 's Model could be represented as Elvis ' epitome of anger , and his most `` New Wave '' album out there . This is also the first album which gives full credit to `` Elvis Costello and The Attractions '' , the most explosive combo to come out of the pub rock scene.If there is something that this album lacks is a passive mood ; every song is bold , outspoken brutallity in the most fashionable way . The first four songs show off these characteristics ; weather it 's the smashing feeling of `` Pump It Up '' or the flow of rythm in `` This Year 's Girl '' .Initially , I felt that the album started to mellow at the beginning of the second half - maybe because of the great punch the first half of the record gives off . But if you get to listen to it a couple of times completely , all of the songs get stuck in your memory . `` Lip Service '' and `` Lipstick Vogue '' are great examples of this.The instrumentation of This Year 's Model is flawless ; loud but precise guitars , mood setting drums and the best use of moog/organ synthesizer I 've ever heard in a rock album . The lyrics also come at their finests ; the rhymes are mesmerazing and accurate . There is not one element of this album that I do not enjoy except maybe the song `` Little Triggers '' which I usually skip.As any other good album , it invites you to listen to it over and over again ; it has the perfect timing for it to be memorable but not tedious . It also leaves you hungry for more Elvis Costello material , which as I stated on the beginning of this review , you are going to require !	1
Though Costello 's debut gave the first peak at his lyrical and singing voices , it was & quot ; This Year 's Model & quot ; that really found the punchy electric presentation that brought it home . The key difference is the Attractions. & quot ; This Years Model & quot ; packs as much punch as anything that came out in the so-called New Wave . Costello 's biting lyrics and stinging vocals and guitars are perfectly matched by the Attractions . From the very opening of the first track , & quot ; No Action & quot ; , Costello 's quiet intro line is kicked into drive from the very first beats of Pete Thomas ' drums , and stepped into overdrive when Steve Nieve 's and Bruce Thomas add their keyboards and bass . It was as though Costello 's songs had just been waiting for this treatment . Nick Lowe exacts the punchiest possible sound out of the band , as they string together gem after gem.Costello and crew may have extended or refined the sound on subsequent albums , but the sheer brashness of their invention shines through every track of & quot ; This Years Model & quot ; in a way they would never be improved by repetition. & quot ; This Years Model & quot ; ( which has the original British running order ) features 6 bonus tracks , including the singles & quot ; Radio , Radio & quot ; and & quot ; Big Tears & quot ; , the soundtrack cut & quot ; Crawling to the USA & quot ; , early versions of Armed Force 's & quot ; Greenshirt & quot ; and & quot ; Big Boys & quot ; . Well worth the upgrade for those who have the original vinyl or non-bonus track versions of the CD .	1
Pop rock at its late 70 's heights shows a thinking man 's Bruce Springsteen continuing to harness amazing energy and tight interplay out of proportion to many of his peers , furthering an already torrential amount of praise only after this sophomore release . Undeniably rock-solid , but only a handful of entries sound entirely brilliant .	1
Elvis Costello / This Years Model ( RYKO single CD - 6 bonus tracks ) : This Great album is made even greater on this RYKO single CD release . Early Costello is great fun and great writing . Call it ` New Wave ' or ` Punk ' or ` Larry ' , it is just good music ! This one gets Five Stars ( RYKO gets Six Stars )	1
Costello 's second album continues in the same vein as his debut , angry tales of love , lust , and sheer pent up frustration . Dominated by Steve Nieve 's organ , this CD is more polished than Costello 's debut , but it feels a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release . Despite this the songs still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone 's music . & quot ; Radio , Radio & quot ; may be one of the greatest songs ever about the idea of & quot ; popular music & quot ; and its effect on us all and the double play of & quot ; The Beat & quot ; and & quot ; Pump It Up & quot ; sums up teen years pretty well . Costello is a truly original talent and this CD shows him during the early years , still coming to grips with many of the same ideas and fears that faced his liteners . This review is of the original American recording )	1
Declan Patrick McManus ( as he was known to his parents ) is a genius . This album , released in 1978 , was his second album , and his first with his backing band The Attractions . What a mighty fine album it was back then . And what a mighty fine album it is today.Being a huge Elvis fan ( I 'll confess , I 've even bought a pair of prescription glasses which are Elvis-esque ) , choosing my favourite Elvis album is like trying to choose a favourite child . I know this is a typical album review cliche , but it 's a serious dilemma , simply for the fact that he has released so many brilliant albums . Imperial bedroom , Trust , King of America , all superb albums in their own right.I see This Year 's Model as Elvis ' real debut album . His debut & quot ; My aim is true & quot ; had its fair share of superb moments ( Red shoes , Alison , I 'm not angry ) but I always felt it was a practice for what he achieved here . Even though this is Elvis ' heaviest and most punk-influenced album , his music does n't fit into the category of traditional punk . For a start , Elvis can sing . His lyrics are highly original and out of this world . He has a vision . He knows what he wants to say and he says it.Did I mention how good it all sounds ? & quot ; The beat & quot ; is one of Elvis ' most infectious pop-punk offerings . & quot ; Living in paradise & quot ; starts with one of his best guitar riffs and only goes up from there . & quot ; Lip service & quot ; is foot-tapping heaven . & quot ; This year 's girl & quot ; has one of Elvis ' best sentiments in a perfect 3 minute pop song . And I have n't even mentioned the brilliantly executed singles & quot ; Pump it up & quot ; , & quot ; ( I do n't want to go to ) Chelsea & quot ; and the superb stand-alone single & quot ; Radio , radio & quot ; which has been added as a bonus track on the re-issue of this CD.Who needs Elvis impersonators ? The real Elvis is alive on this album , and he has never sounded better .	1
The first three albums by Elvis Costello are not only his three best albums ever -- -they are three of the finest albums released by any artist of that era . While `` My Aim Is True '' stands as one of the greatest debut albums ever , I feel that his next two releases , `` Armed Forces '' and `` This Year 's Model , '' were even better than his first excellent work . `` This Year 's Model '' is the peak of Elvis Costello 's angry and cynical lyrical database , with fast , raucous music that ups the intensity like only Elvis could . When I think of the numerous punk groups of that era that I enjoyed like Black Flag , Sex Pistols and The Dead Kennedys , I take the odd step of lumping `` This Year 's Model '' in with the same sarcastic emotion backing the music . While the abovementioned Punk groups may have marketed themselves to the kids who fancied themselves raw , gritty , and streetwise , Elvis seemed geared toward the everyday middle-class Joe who , despite no torn jeans or Mohawks , still possessed that bitterness toward commercialism and the rat race.This album has classic Costello rants that range from relationships gone sour to the greedy corporate world , with some songs like `` Living in Paradise '' seemingly combining both . The tunes grow increasingly intense with each track , with `` Hand in Hand '' and `` Lipstick Vogue '' grabbing most of the glory in the second half of the album . No resting , no misleading Guajardian twists , just sharp music and seething lyrics . `` Radio , Radio '' is the appropriate finale of `` This Year 's Model , '' which is a loud , fast , break-free tune that totally bashes the formula based model of commercial radio . I remember when this song was released , and how much I loved it every time I heard it played on one of the same commercial radio stations he was thumbing his nose at ; it was like hearing an employee cursing out his boss and receiving a promotion for it.Elvis Costello has since released quite a diverse array of music since `` This Year 's Model . '' Some of it I love , some I do n't get ... but there is nothing quite like his first three albums . If you want to buy a `` Best Of '' Elvis Costello compilation , then STAY AWAY from his `` Best Of '' compilations . Buy his first three releases instead , because they truly are the very best of Elvis Costello .	1
Listening to This Years Model after 22 years ( gasp ! ) , one is struck by how current and urgent it all still sounds . The lyrics are so sharp and the songs are so well structured that I am reminded of Cole Porter . I do n't think Elvis Costello ever topped this , even though he came close so many times . Insight , anger and humor are combined into his unique style that cuts through all the hypocrisy in the world like acid poured on metal .	1
My Aim is True was a promising debut , but This Year 's Model , Elvis Costello 's sophomore effort and first album with long-time backing band the Attractions , is an all-out stunner . Everything on this puppy , from the songs to the performances to the cover art ( just look at that sneer ! ) drips with the aggression , menace , and black humor that have become EC trademarks.For one thing , the Attractions rule . The band packs a sonic punch that Clover ( the group that backed Elvis on My Aim Is True ) simply could n't muster . They 've got a raucous , full-bodied sound that bridges the gaps between punk , new wave , rock ` n ' roll , and even 60s garage rock . Steve Nieve 's freewheeling keyboard playing is the ideal partner for the compact snarl of Costello 's guitar chords , while Bruce Thomas ' nimble bass lines duck , weave , and squirm beneath them . Pete Thomas ' drumming lends the appropriate sense of straight-ahead urgency to the whole thing , while giving the proceedings a sufficiently rockin ' backbone . Thanks to the Attractions , these songs have a certain bite that was buried on My Aim Is True.Of course , it does n't hurt that Costello 's songwriting is absolutely stellar , He may look like a harmless fellow on his album covers , but his lyrics are anything but : the guy writes with a poison pen , flinging venom-dipped darts in every possible direction without ever missing his mark . His unapologetic cynicism is matched by his dark sense of humor and deliciously twisted worldview.All of it comes together on `` No Action , '' the album 's breathless opener . At just over two minutes in length , it 's a juggernaut of warped fifties melodies and pummeling guitars . Costello 's vocal is both cheeky and bitter , as he spews forth a series of withering putdowns at some special someone who probably deserves every word of it . `` Hand In Hand '' and `` Lip Service '' are equally spiteful tales of derailed romance , and `` Living In Paradise '' ups the ante with its depictions of wanton betrayal and relentless paranoia- and it has a cheerful , bubbling melody ! `` This Year 's Girl '' matches a leering , halting musical assault with lyrics that take a sharp stab at celebrity culture , and `` Lipstick Vogue '' is pure amphetamine sleaze . `` Little Triggers '' is a broken doo-wop ballad essaying a crumbling relationship with enough bitter disillusionment to last a lifetime . `` You Belong To Me '' is a gleefully sardonic look at male aggression , and `` Pump It Up '' is a rollicking party song ... with lyrics about the worthlessness of parties . `` Night Rally '' is a dark , atmospheric track that sees Costello flirting with images of fascism and revolution . `` The Beat '' ( possibly my favorite track here ) is tale of sexual frustration that brims with raw aggression and nervous energy . I 'm also in love with the stunning `` ( I Do n't Want To Go To ) Chelsea , '' which uses a taut , crawling , ska-influenced groove to slowly build tension , while Costello 's lyrics are pure claustrophobic sexual paranoia.So , a masterpiece then . Get it .	1
Elvis costello is my favorite singer ! And this is a classic album . I love it so much . Here 's my favorite songs : No action , Radio Radio , the beat , crawling to the usa , ( I do n't want to go to ) chelsea , this years girl , and big tears .	1
After scoring success with his debut album My Aim Is True , Elvis Costello wasted no time in recording a follow-up . This Year 's Model takes everything that made his first album great and multiplies it several times over . The catchy melodies and intricate wordplay remain firmly intact but they 're given an extra dose of energy by EC 's famous backing band The Attractions , composed of Bruce Thomas on bass , Pete Thomas on drums , and Steve Nieve on keyboards . It 's a firecracker combination that does n't let up for even a second during the album 's 39 minute duration . `` No Action '' opens the record with such intensity that it 's almost exhausting just to listen to . Elvis begins by snarling , `` I do n't wan na kiss you , I do n't wan na touch/I do n't wan na see you 'cause I do n't miss you that much . '' Every member of the band comes in at full-throttle and it 's a perfect slice of punk energy that demands your attention and leaves you feeling like you just stepped off a roller-coaster when it ends just two minutes later . I ca n't think of a better way to introduce The Attractions and it lets you know immediately that this album will be louder , rougher , and more intense than the first.The record contains a couple well-known hits , most notably `` Pump It Up '' , which everyone has heard at some point . Even by today 's standards it still sounds fresh and energetic , making it a well-deserved classic in Costello 's vast catalogue . `` Radio , Radio '' was a controversial diatribe against corporate radio and its predictable `` play it safe '' attitude toward music , while `` ( I Do n't Wan na Go to ) Chelsea '' rides a killer guitar riff that firmly ingrains it in your mind after just one listen . `` The Beat '' and `` Little Triggers '' are both prime slices of pop while `` Hand in Hand '' and `` Lip Service '' are trademark Costello songs whose dark lyrics are cleverly disguised by an upbeat melody . `` Living in Paradise '' is one of my favorites and finds Elvis in a state of jealousy and frustration before concluding , `` You better have your fun before it moves along/And already you 're looking for another fool like me . '' Perhaps The Attractions ' finest hour comes in the form of `` Lipstick Vogue '' . Pete Thomas ' drums open with a furious solo and intensity that only heightens as Steve 's organ chimes in as the song blazes by with a punk ferocity that 's impossible to ignore . Every track here is impressive and there 's not a trace of filler or wasted space.It would have been hard for any artist to follow My Aim Is True and Costello took a big risk by going with a louder and more forceful sound . However , it works perfectly and there 's no denying that The Attractions are a major key to this success . They take Costello 's songs and elevate them to incredible heights . Each musician is amazingly skilled and they all get equal chances to shine here . If Costello 's first album proved him to be a naturally-gifted songwriter then This Year 's Model proved that he was here to stay and was n't afraid to take his sound in new directions . His first album was stellar and this one , in my humble opinion , is even better . Do n't miss it .	1
I 'm so sick of packing for college , I go back on saturday . I really need a break . Ahh , nothing like cdnow reviews to kill time.Anyway , I 'm living proof that this album is an alltime great enjoyed by people of all ages . I love it , my friends love it , my friends parents love it . Every song is hummable and instantly burrows its way deep into your head where it wont come out for weeks . On top of that , this is a lyrical masterpiece only topped by my Aim is true ( who else would use the term rhythmically admired ) . It may not be as diverse as the later albums but its our last chance to hear good old-school hard rocking elvis . This should be considered required listening for any rock mucic fan . Do yourself a favor and buy this and if you already have it buy it for someone who doesnt .	1
Elvis Costello-This Years Model *****The toss up between the bug two . By the big two I mean Elvis Costello 's two biggest albums , his debut My Aim Is True , and his sophomore effort , This Years Model and which is better . Many will tell you his less famous albums which he realesed after This Years Model were his best . But really I have never understood why with Costello everyone insists on comparing all his albums and constantly ranking them , honestly the man has never mad a bad record . His band , The Atractions is one of the best punk/new wave/post punk bands of all time . His song writing is simply put , prolific . As a guitar player he is fantastic as well , and as for This Years Model , the album is incredible.It was his second album realesed in 1978 this brit managed to realease two of the greatest albums in rock history with his first two at bats . Songs like 'Lipstick Vougue ' evoke images of The Replacements , The Romantics , Clash , and John Lennon . Sexy , comlicated , angry , and somehow meloncolly all at the same time . 'Pump It Up ' is the deffinition of new wave . 'Hand In Hand ' is touching while the reggea influenced ' ( I Dont Want To Go To ) Chelsea ' is both loose and fun , and at times disturbing . Known for his brilliant imagry in his lyrics , songs like 'This Years Girl ' 'Little Triggers ' and 'Night Rally ' dont dissapoint . The albums big hit single , well maybe not big but still hit single 'Radio , Radio ' is a classic and propelled this album and The Atractions to major success and right afterward Costello threw it all away to be true to himself , which I will always take my hat of to him for that as long as I live.The bonus disk which comes with this particular issue is a must have for those who are die hard Costello fans , but not one I would recomend to the average fan.So is This Years Model better then My Aim Is True or any of Costellos other albums ? Does it really matter ? well no it does n't but to answer the question , I must give my opinion and say that this is his most focused album and also his most asseble and varied , but in my opinion this is only his second best album . My Aim Is True is far superior even though This Years Model is a fantastic album !	1
This Year 's Model is definitive Elvis Costello . It 's the hardest rocking of all of his albums , and each song is a triumph of the now venerable songwriter . This album features all the classics : the stream-of-consciousness ` Pump it Up ' ; the brilliant ` I Do n't Want to Go To Chelsea ' ; the chilling ` Night Rally ' ; and ` Radio Radio ' . This album exemplifies how good Elvis can be - it is the best thing he 's ever made , and lays the foundations for a lot of the contemporary punk/pop music around today . Perhaps the best feature of This Year 's Model is that it 's a rock album with brilliant lyrics . Costello is known for his lyricism , and This Year 's Model , in my opinion , shows Costello at his lyrical best . Each song is like a poem , in that the lyrics are complex , deep and meaningful . This album is an integral part of any Costello fan 's collection , and is also perfect for anyone wanting to get a feel for what his music is like . A must buy .	1
elvis costello is never easy to pin down . he 's a punk , a crooner , a folkie and a jazzman all at once . one thing is certain , he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter , with a healthy pop sense . before costello branched out into other styles , his main focus on the punky side of pop . and this is his most defining moment in that era . each song on here crackles with the tight energy associated with punk , but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore . moreover , the songwriting is just too clever to ignore , further removing `` this year 's model '' from the general english punk movement . elvis was always too civilized to be chaotic and angry , more of a crossed up lover than anything else . this year 's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone 's collection .	1
Elvis 's first disk with the Attractions ( Steve Nieve , Bruce and Pete Thomas ) burns brightly even today . The songwriting is wonderfully acerbic , the band sound is stripped down to a live feel , and each musician kills . A must own !	1
Elvis Costello 's second album , `` This Year 's Model '' has received the re-release treatment before , most recently in 2001 , but this truly must be regarded as the ultimate 30th anniversary deluxe reissue treatment.CD1 ( 23 tracks , 70 min . ) first brings the original album , and what a delight it remains 30 years later . It almost sounds like a greatest hits album in and of its own , with classics like `` Pump It Up '' , `` ( I Do n't Wan na Go to ) Chelsea '' and `` Radio Radio '' , but the non-single tracks just sounds as good in retrospect ( such as `` No Action '' , `` You Belong To Me '' , etc. ) . There are 10 bonus tracks , including delightful b-sides like `` Big Tears '' , `` Crawling to the USA '' and `` Tiny Steps '' . Several other tracks are repeats from the 2001 re-release , including the delightful alternate version of `` Chelsea '' .CD2 ( 17 tracks ; 63 min . ) brings the complete show of the band at Washington 's Warner Theatre , and what an absolute delight that is . This was recorded in February 1978 , a couple of months before `` This Year 's Model '' was released , and the set mixes then-old ( from `` My Aim Is True '' ) and then-unheard ( from the upcoming album ) tracks , and it is just fabulous . Costello and his band are at their absolute best throughout . The highlight for me is the expanded ( 6 min . ) version of `` Watching the Detectives '' but there is n't a single weak moment on here , and any serious music fan will want to have this , both for the quality of the concert and for its historical value . Not to be missed .	1
I happened upon a leftover copy of the Rykodisc re-issue of This Year 's Model after it had gone out-of-print one day at Borders . Happy I had found this hard-to-find gem ( this was a while before the new 2-CD re-issues ) , I purchased the album and popped it in my car stereo.Costello opens the disc proclaiming & quot ; I do n't wan na kiss you , I do n't wan na touch & quot ; before the Attractions explode into a fit of pop-punk rage . I was blown away . The production was crisp , rich , and full of unbridled chaotic energy . Even when Costello slows it down on this album ( & quot ; Little Triggers & quot ; ) , the result is no less energetic or passionate . Other such classics include & quot ; Pump It Up , & quot ; & quot ; I Do n't Wan na Go To Chelsea , & quot ; and & quot ; This Year 's Girl . The Attractions are a much stronger band than Clover , who accompained Costello on My Aim Is True , thus making This Year 's Model the stronger album ( although My Aim Is True is still classic ) . The bonus tracks are also nice including the indispensible & quot ; Radio , Radio , & quot ; a biting , vicious attack on radio.This is essential listening . Please purchase .	1
This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True , in my opinion . The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling . It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible Armed Forces masterpiece.There is even a reggae beat in ( I Do n't Want To Go To ) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers . My favourites on the original disc are the up-tempo Pump It Up , You Belong To Me and the poignant This Year 's Girl , plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics . Night Rally is somewhat dark and disturbing.The second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased tracks , demo tracks , live and alternative versions . Not all of these alternate takes are as gripping as the familiar versions but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile , demonstrating various facets of his extraordinary musicianship .	1
This Year 's Model was Elvis Costello 's second album and his first with the Attractions . Mr. Costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock , but unlike most punk bands who were unskilled musicians that thrived on high energy , he possessed a rapier pen and an ear for melody . The album opens with the fierce `` No Action '' that in fine punk form clocks in at less than two minutes . `` This Year 's Girl '' is wry take on the fame machine . `` The Beat '' has a catchy organ riff and is about the tried and true subject of self-gratification . `` Pump It Up '' is a fiery track as is `` Lip Service '' . `` ( I Do n't Want To Go To ) Chelsea '' has a manic verve while `` Little Triggers '' slows things down . `` Radio Radio '' is the most famous off the album , but the album 's best track is `` Lipstick Vogue '' . The song has a thumping bass line that shuffles along until a frenzied close . This Year 's Model gave further proof that Elvis Costello may well be the king .	1
I note there is some debate here about where the two most famous Elvises rank in the rock pantheon . One thing 's for sure , only one of them was a songwriter.Elvis Costello 's 1977 debut album heralded the emergence of a major new talent , and helped save music from languishing in a sea of mediocrity . With some honourable exceptions ( Neil Young comes to mind ) , most of the readily accessible music ( i.e . radio ) around in the mid-70s was shocking , almost as bad as the clothes . I now realise that is the reason why we schoolkids all had to go back in time to find something we actually liked . Disco was anathema , to the boys anyway . The Sex Pistols were a revelation , but to we aspiring musicians they could n't play to save their lives . The Pistols were historically important and fun , but as far as genuine talent goes just do n't stack up . ( And , as I heard someone admit recently , they scared us callow suburban kids to death ! ) When I heard 'Chelsea ' , I felt that here at last was something worth listening to.And so it turned out . This , the follow-up to Costello 's impressive debut , cemented his reputation as a first rate singer-songwriter , if that 's the right term , and left his contemporaries , The Jam and perhaps The Clash apart , looking very sick . Like Paul Weller , Costello managed to fuse a punkish attitude with a pop sensibility , delivering a satisfying cocktail of great melodies and a hard edge . Curiously , in later years they both shelved that edge temporarily so as to indulge their passion for American-style crooning . As with the debut , This Year 's Model is chock full of powerful three-minute gems with great lyrics ( & quot ; sometimes I think that love is just a tumour/ you 've got to cut it out & quot ; ) that stick in your head . The Attractions provide frenetic and fantastic backing ( particularly on 'Lipstick Vogue ' ) for Costello 's clever , insightful , and uncannily infectious songs , and producer Nick Lowe transfers all the excitement to disc with aplomb.British pop or new wave or punk or whatever you want to call it at its very best .	1
I put that as the review title so , people would n't get confused . There are a million special edition versions of this CD , but mine is just the basics . Which is suprisingly okay , given that this is a whole lot of excellent music . I only knew like half the songs on here , but the songs are all pretty good and balanced . I also partly picked this up , because a lovely female friend of mine thinks Mr. Costello is the best musician ever . If you 've never heard Mr. Costello , he sort of seems comical . The best way to describe what he sounds like is Tom Petty mixed with Devo . Actually , I 'm not saying anything bad about him . If you are getting into his style of music , then get `` My Aim Is True '' or `` 13 Steps Lead Down '' along with this disc . Those are good for , if you know his music , but have n't really listened to entire CDs yet . Well , this CD itself is all great songs . The sound quality is also , fantastic considering the age of the recording and the fact it 's not remastered .	1
Costello 's second album , This Year 's Model , took the potential shown in 1977 's classic My Aim Is True and ran with it . Elvis Costello 's punk sensibility , melodic yet tight guitar , and sharp political commentary was now paired to a great backing band , the Attractions ( Steve Nieve on keyboards , Bruce Thomas on bass , and Pete Thomas on drums ) . Far from a sophomore slump , This Year 's Model might be Costello 's best release , and has probably aged better than anything else he 's done.In punk fashion , Costello 's songs are short and forceful , hovering right around 2-3 minutes . However , do n't expect Clash or Sex Pistols-like aggression and buzzing guitars . Costello 's early work is about as `` rock 'n ' roll '' as one can get -- melodic , tuneful , and irresistable . Costello 's acerbic and humourous lyrics comment on a great many things -- the fashion industry on This Year 's Girl , Orwellian paranoia on Living In Paradise , and a pan of commercial radio on Radio , Radio ( made famous by Elvis Costello 's controversial guest spot on Saturday Night Live ) .If you can enjoy Costello 's quirky vocals ( I happen to really like them ) than This Year 's Model will definitely have appeal . Punkers looking for something different will probably really like this album . His other early albums ( My Aim Is True , Armed Forces ) are in a similar vein and also worth purchasing.Note : For the most part the Rhino reissue is really nice , with great liner notes penned by Elvis himself and one of the best remasters I 've heard in recent years . However , was the bonus disk really necessary ? Big Tears and Stranger In The House could have been included on the first disk as bonus tracks , while the rest of the bonus material is made up of middling demos and live stuff that is only of interest to completists . All the bonus disk does is jack up the price of the album . Not a big deal , but more thought should 've been put into this .	1
Costello 's second album , and his first with the Attractions , is his most & # 34 ; punk & # 34 ; -not in any I-hate-cops sense but in his emotionally explosive writing and his backing bands vicious gallop .	1
If you love music you must obtain this cd period . Every cut is fantastic . Standouts include Pump it Up with its throbing punkish traits , Lip Stick Vogue with its defiently witty lyrics `` Sometimes i almost feel like a human '' , Living in Paradise with its full bodied sound , Radio , Radio `` You better shup up or get cut out '' , a live version of NEAT NEAT NEAT , i could list every trac the cd is that good . It was a important album when it came out giving early clues to who the true king of rock and roll is ... a man named Elvis after all . WARNING dont buy this album unless you want to be blown away with an album from 1978 that is as fresh today as it way when it was the day it was pressed into an LP . An essential album not only of Costello but of Rock .	1
Edgier than both & quot ; My Aim is True & quot ; and & quot ; Armed Forces & quot ; , this is perhaps the greatest album of the punk/new wave era of the late '70s . With the addition of the extra tracks , this album has become ( in '70s terminology ) an excellent & quot ; double album & quot ; -- without a loser in the bunch . Elvis ' best ! -- Classic	1
The merits of this album need not be discussed here . This Year 's Model has been widely regarded as a rock classic for over twenty years now . What does need addressing , however , is the sound Rhino has acheived in rendering this recording on cd.The 'remastering ' game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results . Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics . Lucky for us , that 's hardly the case with Rhino 's treatment of Elvis Costello 's back catalog.This Year 's Model is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns . The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly . It is as if the Attractions have set up shop in your living room . Seriously , the immediacy of this recording is so impressive that I had to play it on the cheapest stereo in my house just to make sure I was n't imagining it.Revisit a classic and hear what you missed the first time around . This Rhino series will be the death of our pocketbooks .	1
If `` My Aim Is True ( With Bonus Disc ) '' landed on the music scene like a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit , `` This Year 's Model '' was the explosion that came after . Elvis ' first album with the Attractions more than lived up to its predecessor , in that having a working band behind him matched the music to the blunt force of the songs.Once again , it is the stark voice of EC that opened the album as he ominously intones `` I do n't wannna kiss you , I do n't wan na touch . '' When the players kick in , it 's a whole 'nother world from `` My Aim Is True , '' and for the first time , `` new wave '' had a front man . Before this album had been released , one of the central songs had made headlines . Elvis ' broadside at narrow-format broadcasting , `` Radio Radio , '' was performed in such a bizarre fashion on Saturday Night Live that he was effectively banned from the show for almost a decade and made this ( then ) seventeen year-old a fan for life . That performance sealed a decision for me to get into radio and make artists like Elvis accessible to listeners . When I was fortunate enough to tell him this many years later , Elvis kindly autographed a ragged poster of `` Armed Forces '' `` Do n't blame me . `` Personal nostalgia aside , fourth CD version `` This Year 's Model '' contains all the songs that comprised the original US and UK versions and the original UK artwork . These are some of the songs by which EC is measured , like `` Radio Radio , '' `` Pump it Up '' and `` The Beat . '' The Attractions ' playing was melody driven in addition to frenetic , a perfect compliment to Elvis ' brilliant lyrics . And it was already becoming apparent that keyboardist Steve Nieve was becoming an architect of what American ears would identify as `` punk rock . '' The remainder of `` This Year 's Model '' provides some hot songs that proved what this band of raving 20 somethings were capable in their rock and roll youth . This was the second of Elvis ' `` Angry Young Man '' trilogy and it is a perfect moment .	1
Rhino Records and Elvis Costello deserve high praise for this re-release . This two cd set contains the original album on the first disc and a second disc of outtakes , live versions and an odd couple of songs- all of fairly high quality . Accompanying the two cds is an essay by Elvis Costello commenting on the songs and the history behind their inclusion or exclusion in the case of the second cd.This Years model features a young Elvis Costello fresh from his Saturday Night Live `` Radio Radio '' era . The cd is full of quirk energy , clever lyrics and youthful anger . From first song to last there is n't a bad tune . The additional cd contains the lost `` Big Tears '' which Costello explains should have been included in the original album . Also in the second cd are live versions and a cover of the Damned `` Neat Neat Neat '' . This album and the half dozen or more to follow were among the most influential music being made by the Punk/New Wave . Great stuff .	1
I love this album ... but I will defend the rights of anyone to hate it . On paper , this whole concept should n't work . The beat is slow enough to appear hesitant . The guitars are strumming one chord off a Velvet Underground album . But by god , they captured a mood perfectly - & quot ; Listen The Snow is Falling & quot ; says it all . Galaxie 500 's & quot ; On Fire & quot ; has better songs , but this album is their most individualistic statement . Perfect summer listening .	1
I 'll grant that the sound quality is pretty bad , and it 's not their best album ( that would be & quot ; On Fire & quot ; ) . But beating up this album seems kind of distasteful to me , sort of like beating up a beautiful , defenseless animal .	1
at it . And so begins `` 4th of July '' , probably one of my favorite Galaxie 500 lines ever , next to `` I stayed @ home on the 4th of july , and i pulled the shades so i did n't have to see the sky , and i decided to have a bed in , but i forgot to invite anybody '' Only Dean Wareham 's fractured genius can paint a picture of isolation and self-doubt in this way , and his detached storytelling verses remind me of `` The Gift '' in a sillier setting . `` Sorry '' has this cool dreamy haze going on , as does `` melt away '' , and `` king of spain pt . 2 '' with its delicate percussion and waves of guitar gently drifts along . Find your own classics , own this lp . I ca n't speak for the reissue because I have the rough trade orig .	1
I must admit that it took me many listens to This Is Our Music before it truly sunk in as a piece of slow-moving dream-pop genius . Galaxie 500 create a lush epic where guitars both acoustic and electric swirl together in a gorgeous haze . The record opens with the incredible & quot ; Fourth Of July , & quot ; which for a long time ruined the album for me . This song is perhaps Galaxie 500 's strongest , and to me , everything that followed just could not hold a candle to it . But after a while , and after getting heavily into the work of My Bloody Valentine , Slowdive , The Velvet Underground , and Low , the other songs on the record began to show themselves as unique , brilliant entities . & quot ; Hearing Voices & quot ; and & quot ; Spook & quot ; are surreal pop tunes , while the superb & quot ; Summertime & quot ; and a cover of Yoko Ono 's & quot ; Listen , The Snow Is Falling & quot ; are lavish guitar epics that give Dean Wareham a chance to let loose while all the sounds build to a monumental crescendo . If you decide to explore this record by Galaxie 500 , do not let initial disappointment scare you away . Like all great records , This Is Our Music takes time to infiltrate one 's consciousness as a piece of extraordinary artistry .	1
Though This Is Our Music was the last album by Galaxie 500 , the end of the band had been unfolding for quite some time , with several of these songs sounding much like apologizes from Dean to his young mates Damon and Naomi . I 'm not sure that he knew what he was apologizing for , I think that he just knew that things were n't right , and did n't know what to do about it , other then to leave the band to save himself.While the album still maintains that luscious mix of extended washes and reverb , both the sound and the lyrics are distantly moving in the direction of what Luna would soon be presenting . All of the songs are the stuff of legend , from their haunting cover of `` Listen , The Snow Is Falling , '' to the mysterious `` Melt Away , '' the utterly brilliant `` Sorry , '' and `` King Of Spain , '' a surrealistic acid drenched vision of `` what could be '' ... `` if only . '' Seldom is a band able capture such raw honesty and remain in tact . This Is Our Music is like that break up talk , where fingers are pointed , where the `` old always , '' `` the never happened , '' and `` I 'm giving back all that you gave me '' take place ... only Galaxie 500 manage to do it with style , sliding things in through the backdoor , and filling the room with atmospheric trigers to draw out the emotions we all seek to hide away from everyone , especially ourselves.This Is Our Music is one of those albums that gets better with each listen , the reason being that they 've taken all they 've learned , giving up a brand new vision , applying all their hearts and souls in one last endeavor , not to prove anything to the world ... but to each other.For those of you who are as taken with Galaxie 500 as I , and have a compelling need to be a collection completist , Rough Trade included the bonus 45 rpm single `` Tugboat '' as a one sided record in randomly selected early vinyl packages . There is a round sticker on the front of these albums which reads `` I.N.D.I.E.P.O.O.L Includes Limited Bonus Single . '' Really , it 's actually a one sided single 45 rpm , the reverse side is blank ... now how cool is that treasure.Review by Jenell Kesler	1
You can feel the passion in Bruce 's music as he talks and sings about a world that is n't always that pretty . He is not afraid to be himself , and let his own style flow. & quot ; Pacing the Cage & quot ; is particularly soulful.Bruce will probably be writing and producing music into his 70 's ... ca n't wait for more CD's.JM	1
Bruce Cockburn has been the Don McLean of Canada for four decades and this is his best album . I highly recommend it to anyone who loves rock and roll . Lady Di loved him ! ! !	1
The world of Charity of Night seems one of fear and blindness , of mob hits ( `` Charity of Night '' ) and prison , whether of the heart ( `` Pacing the Cage '' ) or of metal ( `` Night Train '' , `` Birmingham Shadows '' ) , of police states and dissidents . But the lyrics and the music itself points to a hope beyond the darkness , although certainly one of Cockburn 's intentions is , Brecht-like , to create enough angst in us to not forget that there is a world rife with ... .well , what shall we call it ? Terror ? Sin ? Bad Guys ? beyond our speakers . Bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting . A jewel among the Cockburn collection .	1
Bruce is from Ottawa , although a major part of the early days and his management company are focused on Toronto . Celtic-Islamic ? What ? ! ! ? Cockburn 's guitar sryle is blues-jazz based with a strong roots element to it , but I 've never thought of him as Celtic , and certainly where Islamic came from , Allah only knows . Can he please be called quintessentially Canadian , which should mystify the great labelizers of the music world enough to give Cockburn the room he needs to create extraordinary music.Those quibbles aside , this is rightly one of BC 's absolute gems , particularly this far into his career . There is a wild range of emotions running through these songs , and Bruce 's fretwork ( I still ca n't believe celtic-islamic ) is dazzling , Allah and Ossian be praised . The chugging train rhythm of the opening track sets an authentic roots tone to a deeply personal statement , and back up vocals from Jonatha Brooke and Ani De Franco give this CD an urgency . `` Pacing the Cage , '' written in the dismal environs of Philadelphia , is as dire an assessment of fate as I have ever heard . It absolutely breaks your heart . `` Coming Rains '' rejoycefully rebounds the spirit , and `` Birmingham Shadows '' is one of those brilliant Cockburn epics , part poem , part lyric that hint at a love , perhaps illicit , at least dangerous , yet determined to flourish and become consummated regardless of the potential for oppression . `` Mines of Mozambique '' returns Cockburn to the political arena . Throughout these 9 songs , Cockburn presents intoxicating landscapes and passionate human dramas . He is far and away one of the very greatest of North American writers and a crafter of melodies that live with the listener a very , very long time.Cockburn is his own man , certainly an exitentialist and christian kind of hero , and as he addresses his topics , he very willingly breaks the bonds that any label might impose upon him . You would be better served taking the man on his own merits . These merits are extraordinary . This is one of his very best collections .	1
Wheras this album primarily focuses on 2-3 minutes songs , typical of Brit-pop at this time Elvis & The Attractions second album together is really works best when taken as a whole.No it 's not conceptual and the music does n't exactly flow together in any particular way . Nonetheless the sound does n't alter from song to song . The 13 songs included here generally place the focus on Costello 's new musical mission ; a digestion of contemporary pop of the 60 's and 70 's from The Beatles to ABBA , whom were both huge inspirations to this music.Says quite a lot for a genre that at this point is literally railing against `` phony Beatlemania '' ; I guess at least this guy say past the commercial irony of it all and how both of those previously mentioned influences impact on early British New Wave rock . Sure enough `` Accidents Will Happen '' , the hit `` Oliver 's Army '' , '' Busy Bodies '' , '' Big Boys '' and `` Goon Squad '' all have a similar structure.All are a slightly more full bodied pop variation of the more basic impact of his debutMy Aim Is TrueorThis Year 's Model . They key to this album is how , even in it 's similar moments this album is very highly transitional . Any alligiences that Elvis might 've owed musically to the punk era began to erode here and the sound moves closer and closer to `` poppy sound'.Which is pretty strange because the lyrical subject matter could n't be any more punky ; the power struggles of militarism in society.The album title is not a misnomer.Nevertheless there are some musical changes of pace that indicate something new is on the way ; the arrangement of `` Green Shirt '' could definately be described as psychedelic while `` Mood For Moderns '' , '' Sunday 's Best '' and `` Two Little Hitlers '' have a very pronounced soul leaning , with the kick and syncopation and the drums and all especially . `` ( What 's So Funny ) About Peace , Love And Understanding '' , a Nick Lowe tune , is the most obviously punl/new wave song here and the hardest rocking . I would'nt qualify this as Costello 's GREATEST album-in some ways it 's not very diverse and result is a lot of songs that kind of sound alike . But it 's one of his strongest early albums outside his debut and one well worth getting into .	1
I really love this album from beginning to end . I 'm surprised too , I was n't going in expecting Elvis Costello 's style to appeal to me for whatever reason . I was wrong . I guess I assumed he wrote nothing but ballads . Nope ! In fact I 'm reading right now that he had a country phase in the early 80 's which is alarming to me , and I imagine old school Costello fans were probably in shock over THAT career direction . `` Accidents Will Happen '' contains a very appropriate introduction that gives off the same new wave/refreshing vibes that the opener from Blondie 's Parallel Lines does . I like how the verse melody contains Costello 's trademark voice sung in a ballad way but complimented with an upbeat chorus . Strange , yet fascinating combination . `` Senior Service '' contains an upbeat rhythm for its entire 2 minutes or so . `` Oliver 's Army '' makes me think of Dave Edmunds . You know , the guy who did `` I Hear You Knocking '' ( though I know him better for several other songs- hint hint , pick up his 2-CD Anthology collection ! ) Of course Dave was probably influenced by Elvis Costello 's style and not the other way around . Either way I LOVE the verse melody . `` Big Boys '' finally indicates to me that Elvis ' style is that he likes to take elements of old school rock ( late 50 's and early 60 's precisely ) and *completely* revamp that style to fit the new wave period of the late 70's/early 80 's music scene . It just so happens Elvis is *really* good at it so just about every song here is memorable . I even hear Tom Petty mannerisms in this track ( `` Big Boys '' ) similar to `` Refugee '' and `` American Girl '' . `` Green Shirt '' has an unusually groovy verse melody that almost sounds melancholy but ... it 's not . Just gives off those kind of vibes . I 'm already convinced this man is a genius the way he can write highly memorable vocal melodies and makes them *work* no matter how he goes about writing them . That 's a rare talent that Jeff Lynne from Electric Light Orchestra apparently has , but not just anyone can write music in such a way . `` Party Girl '' is n't one of my favorites but I like the way the vocals sail hypnotically during the final minute . `` Goon Squad '' has an offbeat verse melody with a chugging rhythm giving it distinction . This song is clearly *awesome* in every conceivable way . `` Busy Bodies '' is a love song ... of sorts , haha . Actually it captures the southern California beach scene perfectly ( such as the ones in San Diego , where yours truly has been ! ) One of the few songs where the lyrics are discernible . `` Sunday 's Best '' has a bouncy , circus-like rhythm and melody . Not sure what to make of it other than another Elvis Costello experiment . Not a favorite but hardly terrible . I wish the guitar solo at the very end lingered several seconds longer though . I certainly sense that the lyrics are meaningful but making out the words Elvis is singing is hard enough , let alone the meaning behind them . `` Moods for Moderns '' is short and catchy ... nice and effective ! Before the first note of `` Chemistry Class '' I knew it would remind me of an actual chemistry class and ... yes , the piano , slow-moving rhythm , and Elvis ' vocal tricks all take me back to high school . Just great ! Are YOU ready for the final solution ? `` Two Little Hitlers '' has a rhythm pace that makes me think of a slow scroll through the park . The chorus is really good though.Well I had no idea Elvis Costello was anywhere *this* good . He has a knack for writing irresistibly catchy vocal melodies and the late 70 's was exactly the right time for Elvis to arrive on the scene .	1
While dismissed as Costello-Lite by some , this is arguably EC 's masterpiece . While retaining the feistiness of his first two albums , Armed Forces showcases Costello 's evolving prowess in crafting really good pop ( ular ) songs . 'Oliver 's Army ' and 'What 's So Funny ... ? ' shine here , but there are another half dozen or so excellent cuts.The Armed Forces bonus disc is likely the best in the Rhino reissue series . Alternative versions of 'Busy Bodies ' , 'Accidents ... ' and 'Goon Squad ' are interesting . 'Stranger in the House ' and scorching , live performances of 'Lipstick Vogue ' and 'Mystery Dance ' are classics.Excellent value here at $ 14.99 .

Elvis Costello is one of the music world 's smartest artists . He also has a gift for finding the greatest musicians . The bassist , Bruce Thomas , is the most innovative rock player I 've ever heard . Elvis ' thoughtful lyrics are perfectly suited to his driving band.Unlike most artists , Elvis Costello has an excess of ideas in most songs . He also writes far too many songs . The extra tracks written at the same time are very good and are thankfully included here . Hats off to Rykodisc for treating this artist with the respect he deserves by reissuing these recordings properly . Other record labels should learn alot from them . [ DW ]	1
Whoa , this totally rules . I wo n't say if it 's better than This Year 's Model or not , but I love it . Sure , it covers the same ground as the first two , but it 's pretty well a perfection of Costello 's mix of Stax-Volt licks , raw punksih energy , weird keyboards and paranoid lyrics . The singles ( Oliver 's Army , Accidents Can Happen , a cover of Nick Lowe 's ( What 's So Funny 'Bout ) Peace Love and Understanding ) are all the best of the album , but listen closely to other songs : the brutal Senior Service ; paranoid Goon Squad , satires Green Shirt and Big Boys ; the bouncing , ironic Sunday 's Best ; and the sardonic , unsparing reggae ballad Two Little Hitlers . And Costello 's signature sneer is in full force , which certainly rules.I do n't think every track is great per se , but there 's a minimum number of duds : Party Girl and Busy Bodies are far from Costello 's greatest contributions to rock , but they 're tolerable . Highly recommended .	1
Coming off the very good second effort of `` This Year 's Model '' , `` Armed Forces '' represents a slightly more mellow Elvis albeit with the same biting , hard-hitting lyrics . The synthesizer comes more into prominence on this album which sees a departure from the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers'-type sound of the previous album and the sound is less edgy . Although not quite as good as the second album overall , this third album is no slouch either.This version of the album which comes in a mini-lp sleeve design which has an almost origami type cardboard outer cover which contains a booklet with both Japanese and English lyrics as well as 4 picture postcards has one of the best album covers I 've ever seen ; the artistic representation of a herd of elephants is simply stunning to behold . The remastered sound quality is very good too.This is a real treat for all Elvis Costello fans and is certainly a collectors ' item .	1
At the time of its release I liked a few songs but didn ` t appreciate this album as a whole . Bought it recently because of the few good tunes I remember liking only to be surprised at how good the other tunes are . This relates especially to what used to be B-side material when records were the music media ; notable tracks being Sunday ` s Best and Two Little Hitlers.I recently read that Costello listened a great deal to ABBA shortly before recording this album . This is evident in the fluency of the songs , many very catchy tunes that is maybe disguised by the more organic production style . The style of singing by Costello is marvelous , a very descriptive way of expressing the words as in `` ... add to your collection '' in the brilliant Accidents Will Happen . The texts are , by the way , well worth going through with a booklet in hand while listening.A highly recommendable album that has aged well , a must have for anyone liking Elvis Costello .	1
Costello 's first album , MY AIM IS TRUE , was perfect . His second album , THIS YEAR 'S MODEL , was even better . His third album , ARMED FORCES , is even better than his second . What we have on this album is that Costello has reached full maturity as a writer , singer , and , in general , as a human being.Lyrically , these songs are about politics . Look at the song titles . Costello makes all sorts of political references in his lyrics . Some of them I understand the meaning of , and some of them I do n't . I do n't mean that I ca n't understand his singing . Quite the contrary . Costello is one of the most easy to understand singers that there has ever been . Instead , what I mean is that I simply do n't understand some of the political references that he is making . Nevertheless , I am able to understand his passion , bitternesss , and anger . Also , this album features the best lyric writing that Costello has ever done . In my opinion , the lyrics on this album are better than anything that Bob Dylan has ever done.In order to fully appreciate this album , I think that it needs to be viewed as the final entry in the trilogy that consists of Costello 's first three albums . ARMED FORCES represents the peak of Costello as a writer and singer . Also , the music here is performed exceptionally well . The keyboards and drums and everything else are all played to perfection . ARMED FORCES is one of my five favorite albums of all time .	1
Costello 's signature airtight pop-rock is wrapped even tighter with his third , AF . Although a bit of over-effort takes away from a little memorability , the disc sounds about equal in quality with his previously two universally praised albums , if anything supplementing the raw energy with compositional agility .	1
This album could very well be the culmination of everything Elvis Costello would ever be ; bombastic , tender , thoughtful , political , sullen and completely unmerciful . I was fortunate enough to witness the Armed Forces tour and was completely overwhelmed with volume and attitude for the one hour Costello gave his audience . The opening song of & quot ; Goon Squad & quot ; will forever reverberate in my skull . This happened at a time when Elvis Costello literally ran neck and neck with Bruce Springsteen as the & quot ; King & quot ; and the & quot ; Boss & quot ; duked it out for the 70 's hottest songwriter accolade . Unfortunately , Costello 's stock has fallen and is now relegated to playing theater shows and hall dates with Burt Bacharach before pipe smokers while Bruce still packs the arenas with his over exuberance . And in some ways , after reviewing Armed Forces again , the listener realizes that Costello trapped himself in a seventies time warp , with his over emphasis of the Vox Farafisa organ and a weak snare sound . Still , the artist that is Costello comes through and his domination of the period is easily understood . Senior Service , Goon Squad , Two Little Hitlers and Chemistry Class ( where Costello immortalizes himself with the punishing line & quot ; You 've been around so long but you still do n't know what to do.. & quot ; ) demonstrate the well roundness and helter skelter manner that has became his songwriting trademark . The almost sad fact about Costello is his music often times just does n't hold up anymore , sounding somewhat dated and dusty . But blame it on a new wave mentality and crank up the volume , because when Elvis Costello puts forth , it 's at least a more than admirable effort .	1
Elvis Costello and The Attractions / Armed Forces ( Rykodisc - 8 bonus tracks ) : Armed Forces is a fun and essential album in the Costello collection . A great one . This great album is made even better by this great bonus tracks CD from RYKO.Armed Forces gets Five Stars . The Rykodisc version gets Six Stars .	1
I heard this album when it first was released and was totally impressed . I had to go and buy the two that were released prior to this one and have bought each new realease that followed . Although I 'm not crazy about `` Almost Blue '' , `` Painted from Memory '' or that album with Sofie Von Otter . ( Sorry Sofie , your a terrific singer ... . ) The rest have been great and I still think that Goodbye Cruel World is terrific . I played it a lot when it was first released and still listen to it.The review from above : '' Armed Forces was the last title in a trilogy of albums that rank with the greatest three-LP series in pop-rock history . In retrospect , it also now appears to be the one on which the young Costello 's pop tendencies peaked , right before they began to `` mature '' and grow less accessible . `` What about `` Get Happy '' ? ? ? I thought that album was very accessible ! ! !	1
I bought this album the week it came out , and as a high school tenth grader and aspiring guitarist/ pop songwriter it was the wisest purchase I could have made . This is a recording that shaped me musically in just so many ways . Elvis in his early days ( first 5 or 6 albums ) was the man as far as lyrics go . No one else could ever be this clever with words . The Attractions , especially Bruce Thomas on bass ( one of the best in pop ) were the perfect band for Costello . I see the live EP ( At Hollywood High ) which accompanied the original LP release has been added as part of the bonus cuts ; long overdue , and that 7 inch was such a bad pressing . This release is indescribably essential for any young aspiring modern tunesmith .	1
While his previous album ( This Year 's Model ) was a jugular-grabbing blast of new wave sneer , Armed Forces is a sumptuous musical buffet . Although Elvis ( and the Attractions ) still have an obvious affection for all things mean and rockin ' , this album is just as informed by pop , soul , and disco as it is by rock and punk . The arrangements are often lush and spacious , casting aside the breathless , compressed fury of This Year 's Model in favor of a more textured and intricate approach . Thankfully , Elvis Costello is a great , versatile songwriter and the Attractions ( Elvis included ) are a great , versatile band , so it all works incredibly well . The lyrics revolve around Costello 's favorite topics : Bitterness , jealousy , paranoia , fascism , cynicism , and of course , love . The result is a more varied and sensual ( if not necessarily better ) album than its predecessor , and a major step forward in Costello 's artistic development.Armed Forces opens with the beautiful lament of `` Accidents Will Happen , '' which sees Costello contemplating the death of a relationship while a dreamy piano-driven melody twists around behind him . `` Oliver 's Army '' is a lush , candy-coated gem ... with lyrics about military propaganda . Sandwiched in between these two classics is the hyperkinetic , unrelentingly vicious disco-punk of `` Senior Service , '' which sees some ambitious young hothead gleefully contemplating a violent coup . There 's also the pained , prematurely sober `` Party Girl , '' and the tense throb of `` Green Shirt . '' `` Moods For Moderns '' marries an infectious melody to a stomping rhythm and soul-inflected vocals , while `` Sunday 's Best '' is a sharp , bitterly satirical , and unsettlingly catchy classic . `` Two Little Hitlers '' brings together the album 's twin themes of political and emotional oppression , portraying interpersonal struggles as violent confrontations between megalomaniacs , and vice versa . Great melody , too ! Yet another fantastic addition to the Costello catalogue , if y'ask me .	1
By 1979 it seemed that Elvis Costello was incapable of writing a bad record . With two successful albums under his belt expectations were obviously high . Spending a good amount of time on the road , EC and The Attractions were a tight unit that had only improved over time . This album 's original title was going to be Emotional Fascism but was later changed to Armed Forces and the title could n't be more perfect . Not only does the album deal with global and domestic turbulence ( mostly in the form of dysfunctional and unsatisfying relationships ) but the title also works as a metaphor for the band themselves . They 're tight , precise , and darn near flawless in execution.Like his two previous albums , Costello opens with a number that immediately grabs you in the form of `` Accidents Will Happen '' . It still remains one of his finest pop gems and it 's a personal favorite of mine . Right way it 's apparent that this record features a more pop oriented sound than its predecessors and Elvis makes it sound easy by churning out one catchy song after another . `` Oliver 's Army '' was a well-deserved hit and Steve Nieve makes this track what it is . His furious piano line is captivating and appealing , carrying the song on a wave of pop melodies that has to be heard to be fully appreciated . `` Party Girl '' and `` Big Boys '' continue the trend with bouncing melodies and Costello 's brilliant lyrics . In fact , Armed Forces might just be his one of his finest lyrical ventures to date . The wordplay , hidden meanings , contradictions , and sense of unease are all tied into the record 's unifying theme : that military struggles and relationship problems can be seen as one and the same . It 's a bleak picture but the writing is so strong and the songs are so much fun that you do n't feel guilty about singing along to a song that states , `` I want to chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket . '' Obviously it 's not all meant to be taken seriously and Costello does a great job of mixing themes and messages in such a way that you never know if he 's referring to political or personal power . Unraveling the lyrics is part of the fun of his writing and this album is chock full of those moments . `` Green Shirt '' is a simple number that 's complimented nicely by Pete Thomas ' snare rolls and Nieve 's signature keyboard playing , while bassist Bruce Thomas gets a chance to shine on `` Busy Bodies '' and `` Moods for Moderns '' . `` Two Little Hitlers '' is another dark theme where Elvis describes two people in a relationship who are constantly trying to dominate each other : `` Two little Hitlers will fight it out until one little Hitler does the other one 's will . '' His pessimistic view of relationships is in full force here but you ca n't help but appreciate his brutal honesty at examining the darker and seldom seen aspects of relationships and power struggles . The closer `` ( What 's So Funny 'Bout ) Peace , Love and Understanding ? '' is a memorable cover of a song by producer Nick Lowe . To this day EC 's version is still the most famous and well-known , taking the irony of the song 's content and giving it a serious delivery that 's both funny and a little unsettling as well.Armed Forces , along with My Aim Is True and This Year 's Model , caps off as one of the best rock trilogies in history . Elvis still remains a great songwriter and has gone on to deliver many other masterpieces . That being said , it 's hard to deny that in 1979 he and The Attractions were at their peak . Their playing is nothing short of phenominal and Costello 's songwriting was branching out into more complex and sophisticated territory . It 's a slice of pop perfection from beginning to end but it also ended up threatening to put Costello into a box that would have stifled him creatively . Fortunately he knew what he was doing and his next album would prove to be both a bold and successful experiment . Armed Forces is a powerful reminder that Elvis and his army were here to stay .	1
A definite high point from the EC `` Golden Age '' , 1977-86 . EC gives due notice of his ambition , and the Attractions respond in kind with a highly stylized , nuanced tour-de-force that still hits where it hurts . Not unlike the woefully underrated Trust . Although the `` Golden Age '' contains a few missteps ( Almost Blue , King of America , the 2 notorious `` L & W '' albums ) , this is prime-time , `` Prince Charmless '' EC .	1
On his third album , Costello 's lyrics are just as sweaty , cynical and paranoid as ever , but the music was opening up very steadily . No one would confuse this with the sort of songs he was releasing ten and fifteen years from now , but there was an unmistakable sense of flowering pop . In fact , there 's hardly any hint of his ahead-of-its-time post-punk style on here ( excepting the lyrics , of course ) .But `` Armed Forces '' does n't suffer from it ; in fact , its very trademark transition is what makes it rank nearly on par with his first two near-masterpieces . `` Senior Service '' and `` Accidents Will Happen '' are the two best , but check out the R & B ; funk of `` Moods For Moderns '' and the sharp lyrics and attitude of the potential-disaster-turned-marvel `` Party Girl . '' Although he 'd rarely be as good as this again , he out-lasted some of his populist influences ( the deadly punk movement and Buddy Holly ) , and not just because he managed to , um , live.Best cuts : `` Senior Service , '' `` Accidents Will Happen , '' `` Moods For Moderns '' `` Party Girl , '' `` ( What 's So Funny ` Bout ) Peace , Love and Undersanding , '' `` Sunday 's Best , '' `` Oliver 's Army , '' `` Green Shirt , '' `` Goon Squad ''	1
Elvis Costello 's third album , `` Armed Forces '' is , like all his early albums , inspired and full of fine songs . Nick Lowe produced Costello 's first five albums and thus he played a big part in securing Costello artistic and commercial success . In contrast to the raw and slightly punky sound of the first two albums a more produced and polished sound characterizes this album.You might thus well fear that Costello 's music would lose some of the edge that made him interesting and relevant in the first place . This is by no means the case , partly because his songwriting on this album is so strong , probably the most consistent of any of his numerous albums.Songs like `` Accidents Will Happen '' and `` Oliver 's Army '' with its Abba sound are well-known classics , but several of the lesser known songs also have a durability that makes them great listening still and songs you may feel like singing along with . `` Busy Bodies , '' `` Two Little Hitlers '' and the magnificent `` Chemistry Class '' are among my absolute Costello favourites . In fact there is only one or two songs on this highly successful album which do not quite hold level . `` Moods of the Modern 's '' has never really been my cup of tea , and `` Goon Squad '' is a rather ordinary rocker.As an added bonus , this edition features Costello 's version of Nick Lowe 's legendary `` What 's So Funny About Peace Love and Understanding '' - a song originally found on Brinsley Schwarz 's last album.If you think you could settle for just one Costello album , `` Armed Forces '' would be a good choice .	1
This disk represented a radical change for Elvis Costello , as he and the Attractions moved from the bare raw sound of `` This Year 's Model '' toward more layers and orchestration . Elvis states that they were listening to ABBA on the bus , but do not hold that against them . The cascading piano and layered keys on `` Accident 's Will Happen '' and `` Oliver 's Army '' still spit with bile of the angry young man . Sparse arrangements , like `` Moods for Moderns '' , `` Senior Servitude '' , and `` Green Shirt '' are mixed in , giving the disk a complex series of shifting moods . Nick Lowe 's influence , as demonstrated by `` Two Little Hitlers '' ( Nick had recorded a tune called `` Little Hitler '' about the same time ) as well as Elvis ' definitive cover of Nick Lowe 's `` What So Funny ( About Peace , Love and Understanding ) '' shine throughout the release . Listen to the complicated word play and lyrical mastery throughout the disk . A must have !	1
With Nick Lowe producing , Armed Forces turned out to be an album of very catchy tunes , which masks the acerbic tone of the lyrics.The arrangements are especially great on songs like Busy Bodies , Green Shirt and Big Boys . My favorite track is the lilting ballad Oliver 's Army , but every single song has a unique pop appeal.Costello is amongst the most literate and versatile of rock musicians and especially on this album , the tight writing and clear melodies are prominent , whilst The Attractions must be the best band he ever recorded with.The new tracks include alternate versions and live recordings , demonstrating his magic as a performer . Armed Forces is a classic of late 1970s punk rock , but has always been accessible to pop fans and timeless in its melodious appeal .	1
Pop Kulcher Review : It 's hard to pick a favorite Elvis disc : his debut , My Aim Is True , was a great ( but rough ) blend of punk 's energy and traditional rock stylings ; Imperial Bedroom was the work of a mellowed , mature songwriter ; and everything in between was an evolution of sorts . I happen to be loyal to Armed Forces just because it is so tightly packed with great pop/rock tunes , from his cover of Nick Lowe 's & quot ; ( What 's So Funny 'Bout ) Peace , Love & amp ; Understanding & quot ; to his anti-war anthem & quot ; Oliver 's Army. & quot ; Not a dull moment in the set . The Attractions are at their best , their tight musicianship meshing perfectly with Elvis 's well-crafted tunes . Of his many great albums , this one does the best job of bridging Elvis 's angry young punk sensibilities with the more restrained melodrama which would come to dominate later albums . And the folks at Rykodisc have worked wonders with the sound , while adding numerous bonus tracks .	1
sinking like robert smith , still as good ... it 's elvis costello gone totally nuts ... now he does n't snarl or gnash his teeth so much ... i hope you 're happy now ... i think he 's starting to mean it .	1
Let 's think about this : the first three Elvis Costello albums were released in succession , with a year for all of them being recorded . They are all the same quality of songs , with minor upgrades in technique across the year . I am not implying that any one is better than another one . They are a good set of albums for the music poetry lover . In fact , the best course of action , would be to just buy all three . I find them complementary as well as , music for the times ! This review has nothing to do with the lovely female friend I mentioned in my last EC album review . That 's really my opinion .	1
... and pay attention to Elvis . It is packed full of great pop/new-wave/punk tracks . This album made it clear that Elvis it a great , unique talent , and that he could consistently write songs of uncommon quality . This album probably formed the basis ( or rocket booster ) to his subsequent song writing career . This genre is not one that I am normally drawn to -- but these are great songs . Good album cover too ( the original vinyl album had square color post cards inside and a strange and annoying 4 fold opening system ! ) . Oliver 's Army and Watching the detectives were hit singles from the album , but ever song on the album was good enough to be a single -- a rare feat .	1
`` Armed Forces '' was Elvis and The Attractions ' claustrophobic pop masterpiece , loaded with melody and paranoia , fueled by cramped touring vans , hotel rooms and long stretches of listening to ABBA , Kraftwerk , Bowie and the Beatles while driving between gigs . It was also the last of the Elvis albums that mirrored the tightly wound image/cliched `` angry young man '' singer-songwriter of the new wave world . It also happens to be one of the most indispensable albums of the 70's.Songs like `` Oliver 's Army '' and `` Two Little Hitlers '' brimmed with neo-fascist imagery and highly charged sexual/emotional content , yet flourished with pop-hooks . `` Accidents Will Happen '' portrays a barely apologetic philanderer as he tries to explain the infidelities of his life , and uses one of early Elvis ' frequent descriptions of romantic partners as a `` victim . '' ( Think of how many times that word appears on his first three albums . ) Many of the songs bear unmistakable ominous threatening qualities , like the roar of `` Goon Squad , '' the hushed fear that underscores `` Green Shirt '' and the implied threat of `` they took me in the office and told me very carefully , the ways that I could benefit from death and disability '' ( from `` Senior Service '' ) .Nick Lowe deserves a good deal of the credit for keeping this album in check ( and when is he going to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ? ! ? ! ) . It is likely his pop sophistication that gave some of `` Armed Forces '' levity in its darkest points . It is also Lowe 's one song - and the first cover to appear on a proper EC album - that brings the relentlessly downward outlook to a more optimistic close . `` ( What 's So Funny About ) Peace Love and Understanding '' was the kind of song that , once Elvis claimed it as his own , provided a banner to his part during the formation of Rock Against Racism.Unfortunately for this reissue , Rhino 's 2002 double CD issue was also the CD that most justified Rhino 's double disc reissues of Elvis ' work . `` Armed Forces '' is the kind of album that more than holds its own as a singular entity , and the Ryko release that tacked the bonus selections on the same disc distracted from that sense of `` piece '' to me . So to have some excellent material on a bonus disc is just cream on the berry . Especially since it included the entire `` Live at Hollywood High '' recording as opposed to the three song bonus vinyl that was included in the original album . If it was possible to add a bonus star to an already 5 star album , Rhino managed that trick . That is the essential `` Armed Forces . '' I understand that the rights to the EC CBS years catolog have turned over once again , but the double CD is really worth seeking out .	1
One of Costello 's richest , most diverse albums , Armed Forces stands as a masterpiece full of rich melodies and witty songwriting . It 's also a strong rock album that does n't shy away from controversey . Although mired in controversey himself at the time ( he got into a fight with Stephen Stills and his band over nasty comments about Ray Charles -- it was Costello idiotically provoking a musical rival ) , Costello proved that he was n't the racist he was accused of being and , in fact , apologized for the impetuous , stupid comments.Costello was mistakenly identified as a `` racist '' because of this incident . Many of the songs ( particularly Oliver 's Army ) reflect the exact opposite . Regardless , the brilliance of the writing and production along with the sharp performances make this a classic worth keeping . This edition of Armed Forces is n't a cheat ; the second disc alone has more than enough material for a new album . It includes most of the Hollywood High show ( previously available as a three track EP ) , as well as , such minor classics as Tiny Steps . Also included are a number of alternate versions of classic songs and b-sides issued with the original singles.The sound quality is comparable ( if slightly better by my estimation ) . The value added portion of the program is the stunning live tracks from Hollywood High on the second disc . There 's also extensive liner notes explaining both the circumstances that went into the writing and making of the album . The lyrics include alternate lyrics as well for some of the demos .	1
Maybe it 's because I grew up around country music that I find so much in this album to like.It 's ... ..kind of a good/not-so-good thing really . In the early 1980 's Elvis & The Attractions were doing really good and doing a lot of growing musically . By the time this came out Elvis got the idea in his head that his next move would be to record in Nashville . Okay on the surface this is n't exactly something you 'd expect.But hey let 's face it : Elvis Costello is n't ( and was n't ) someone given to punk clishes so it 's best to expect the unexpected . Where an album likeArmed Forcesis great it 's really what you 'd expect from Costello . Here he bought in Doobie Brother pedal steel player John McFee and proceeded to record a dozen tunes by people like Hank Williams , George Jones and Gram Parsons . Okay so ... .we have Elvis doing an album of country covers but it really does n't end there . William 's `` Why Don ' You Love Me ( Like You Used To ) '' is given a revved up modern rockabilly treatment and ... ends all too soon . And besides that `` Sittin & Thinkin ' '' and `` Honey Hush '' rock out pretty hard really ; they 've got the country feeling but that brash new wave attack.So it 's all a good mixture . There is one thing about this album that I do n't know if will be to everyone 's taste.As the title suggests most of these songs do tend towards twanky Nashville fare with a lot of tales of drinking and broken hearts.In short , the country music clishe . So ... ... .are we getting Elvis trading in one clishe with another ? Not really.He gives these songs a very sincere rendering and even if his whole additude is usually as angry and pointed as they come , he somehow manages to convey the depressing , bluesy outlook of some of these tunes with a dry eye.This version of the CD is a country oriented live set from Aberdeen.These are songs that did n't appear on the album and are a pretty good bonus.Okay so this album derailed Elvis 's career and always gets either terrible or overly complimentary reviews.So I 'll say it 's not perfect but , the album itself is worth your time if you are an open minded Elvis Costello fan .	1
I love this release by Elvis . I take it as a tribute to the singer/songwriters that inspired him . The selections and arrangements make this a solid country venture for Mr. Costello !	1
I think this is an album where either you 're into it , or you are n't -- it is n't an issue of whether it 's a `` good '' record , or a `` bad '' one . As a fan of Costello 's early work , as well as a fairly well-informed country fan , I 've found this to be an album that 's grown on me over the years . He knew what is was doing , and he did it well . ( DJ Joe Sixpack , Slipcue Guide To Country Music )	1

For all you Costello completists out there , DO NOT toss your Rykodisc copy once you get this new Rhino version . There are two `` Live in Aberdeen '' tracks on the Ryko pressing that did not get carried over onto the new one.As for the record itself , when I first bought the vinyl 20+ years ago , I knew very few of the songs and had none of the original versions . Now I have almost all of them , as well as a deep appreciation for country music . I have Elvis and my wife to thank for that !	1
First off I love the Warning ! label in the liner notes : `` This album contains Country & Western Music & may produce radical reaction in narrow minded people '' . Further more , I 'm afraid I disagree with any previous reviewers who cite this is the 1st misstep in a career that was consistantly on the rise . On the contrary , I think Almost Blue was the 1st time Costello completely stumped his audience . He 's certainly done it a few times since.It takes real balls to put your own stamp on a Hank Williams tune . Albeit , a relatively obscure one . Opening with `` Why Do n't You Love Me '' Costello & company immediately put a spin into their own conceit . Throwing themselves into the proceedings with the same hyper , punked out abandon found on This Year 's Model . This is your 1st indication that this is n't going to be your typical Country standards album . Or at worse a joke.Fact of the matter is , he truly goes for the throat on this one . His take on `` Sweet Dreams '' may make Patsy Cline fans cringe in their beehives , but any Gram Parsons affecionado will appreciate Costello 's heartfelt renditions of `` Hot Burrito # 1 ( I 'm Your Toy ) '' or `` How Much I Lied '' . Both are just as touching as the originals , sung as if he 'd written them himself . `` Good Year For The Roses '' was the big surprise hit on this album . In England at any rate . Personally , I never get sick of hearing it . And I love the original.As bonus discs go , Rhino & Mr. Costello have once again given you an all too generous assortment for your buck . Infact , there 's more than twice as many tracks than on the original album . It starts off with his legendary duet with George Jones on `` Stranger In The House '' . It does n't disappoint . Followed by an even odder pairing with The Man In Black . I wo n't comment on the results , but the moment is to be cherished.Besides some live tracks from his infamous gig in Aberdeen , there 's not one , but 2 chilling versions of Leon Payne 's `` Psycho '' . Where others have milked the tune 's black humor for all it 's worth , Costello wisely takes it all too seriously . A welcomed restraint that will send a shiver up your spine . Best version I 've ever heard . I ca n't believe they left it off the album.The bonus disc also features some very touching versions of `` Too Far Gone '' & `` He 's Got You '' . Not to mention real gems like `` Wondering '' & `` Blues Keep Calling '' . His version of `` I 'll Take Care OF You '' is to die for . Then there 's `` Your Angel Steps Out of Heaven '' . I 'll bore you if I go on ( if I have n't already ) .Many Costello fans will begrudgingly look on this as a novelty , but far from necessary in terms of their collections . The superficial masses will cast this aside without a 2nd thought . But for me it tops flawed classics like `` Punch The Clock '' , or his overrated Burt Bacharach album for that matter.In fact , having been a longtime Costello & ( not so lately secret ) Country fan for years , I breathed a sigh of relief when this originally came out . Ofcourse , it did n't set the world on fire & I had to keep my dirty little secret to myself . But without a doubt , Almost Blue is one of the most interesting records of Costello 's ongoing career . For my money , it 's certainly one of the most rewarding reissues in this Rhino series . As much as I 've always loved this album , truth be told , it 's the bonus disc that sends this into the 5 star mark . In other words , I 'm happy to have bought it again .	1
After releasing the brilliant Trust in 1981 Elvis Costello wasted no time in releasing a second album that same year . Elvis had made it clear through his work that he was no stranger to experimentation and reinvention , yet few could have seen this record coming : a cover album of classic country tunes . It was a gutsy move that , despite the mixed results , gave us another side of Elvis Costello that would manifest itself on many future recordings . Costello had toyed with country sounds on previous records , especially on My Aim Is True , but this album found him taking it on full-force.All 12 cuts on this album are covers and , although done well , they 're not as interesting as his original material . Still , there are some fine performances from EC and the Attractions . There are some energetic numbers like `` Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ) ? `` , `` Honey Hush '' and `` Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down '' . These are a lot of fun but some of the slower tracks work too , especially `` Success '' , `` Sweet Dreams '' , and `` How Much I Lied '' . However , the real standout here is his fantastic and delicate cover of Jerry Chestnut 's `` Good Year for the Roses '' , first made famous by George Jones . Costello 's cover is incredible and after seeing him perform it live a few years ago I 've grown to love it even more . If there 's one reason you should buy this album it 's purely for that track alone . The others are well done but that song is easily the highlight.There 's really not too much to add because since these songs are covers there are no lyrics or classic Costello melodies to delve into . In some ways that 's the records biggest flaw : it 's Elvis but without a lot of the charm and sophistication that accompanies his other albums . Almost Blue is by no means a bad record ; in fact , for people who are n't fans of country ( like me ) this is a great place to start . It 's old-school but never in-your-face or obnoxious . The performances are tight and it 's evident that Costello not only knows more about country music than many of today 's country artists but he respects it and loves its storytelling and melancholy themes . It 's just Elvis having fun covering some of his favorite country songs ; no more and no less . It 's not a place for the newcomer or casual fan to start but if you 're in the mood for a different side of Elvis then it 's worth hearing every now and then .	1
Costello 's country excursion works well because of the excellent songs he chose . His voice is suited to the genre and the Attractions give it all they 've got , supported by some brilliant Nashville musicians like John McFee on lead and pedal steel guitars , and Tommy Miller on violin . This enhanced album includes a wealth of extra tracks , mostly live versions.The fast paced Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used To Do ) sounds more like early rock 'n roll than country to me , whilst Sweet Dreams is done with feeling and lots of soul . Success is a gently lilting ballad with lovely piano.My favourites are the buoyant Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down , the moving Colour Of The Blues , this slow version of Too Far Gone , and especially the bittersweet Good Year For The Roses , a brilliant interpretation.Costello 's country excursion reminds me of another highly successful country album by a UK artist , Marianne Faithfull 's very authentic Faithless ( also available as Dreamin ' My Dreams ) . Almost Blue obviously wo n't appeal to all Elvis Costello fans , but I find it a pleasure to listen to and a worthy contribution to the genre .	1
It 's funny to see how ALMOST BLUE still divides Costello fans after all these years . I remember seeing a documentary produced for British TV ( Melvyn Bragg 's `` The South Bank Show '' ) that chronicled Costello and the Attractions ' Nashville adventures . Producer Billy Sherrill , after displaying a lot of initial skepticism , responded to Elvis ' pumped-up version of `` Why Do n't You Love Me Like You Used to Do ? '' with a reaction like -- `` Now we 're getting somewhere ! That 's why I took on this project ! '' ( Elvis meanwhile had confessed to the cameras how nervous he was about going into the studio and letting Sherrill hear what he and the gang had done to the track . ) Detractors aside , ALMOST BLUE holds up as a classic collection of country covers -- packed with more drinking and heartbreak than most pasty punk rockers could endure -- and the first of many ( mostly ) successful musical digressions in Costello 's illustrious career.Standout tracks : `` Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ? `` ) , `` I 'm Your Toy , '' `` Brown to Blue , '' `` A Good Year for the Roses , '' `` How Much I Lied . ''	1
Pretty much every rock fan knows about the the early history of Elvis Costello ... fromMy Aim Is Trueto whatever he happens to have been doing in the last decade from collaberations with Burt Bacharach and Allen Toussaint to one ( or two maybe ) classical projects . Either way around it this one seems to have gotton away from me.I had no idea he recorded it , none of the songs seem at all familiar and it looks like I am definately not the only one who feels that way . So whatever : Costello was obviously pretty content at this point to hang on 180 here because this album doesn look or sound like any Elvis Costello & The Attractions album before it . If you want to make the obvious Beatles comparasin ( it 's one worth making though ) you could look at his previous albumTrustand this as being like theRevolver [ UK ] andSgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Bandof his career : both these albums found Costello following the same musical path with a very gradual transition from 3 minute pop to something more psychedlic.Had it all been done ? No-this was very very different . With this album Elvis achieved something that was not only thought next to impossible , with some strong exceptions but that would help influence the world of Brit-pop for decades.He was able to integrate the concept of psychedelic effects into songs that were not only very strong but under 5 minutes . The last four songs on thealbum ( as well as the percussive opener `` Beyond Belief '' ) , '' Pidgin English '' , '' You Little Fool '' and especially `` Town Cryer '' give you lot 's of strings , leslie amp echoes here and there-the works . But in the hand of new producer Geoff Emmerick it 's not very clished ; you never know what 's coming next . On the other hand there are some moments where other styles tried on earlier albums really come into great focus . `` Shabby Doll '' is a great song ; very soulful and very funky , especially the bassline at the end.If the previous album had Elvis Costello 's singing was going too in new directions this really takes the cake ! Up and down , from song to song he is leaping into this ... really very sexy high alto.I would'nt call it falsetto as it seems very natural . `` Almost Blue '' is ... .just beautiful.It 's the title of his very last album but this torchy jazz ballad is definately one of his unsung classics.Same goes for the soulful `` Human Hands '' . `` The Long Honeymoon '' , '' Kid About It '' , '' Little Savage '' ... .well many of things songs are able to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative . So sure it 's forgotton and I 'd bet some people give this a good review simply for that purpose : that just because an album is obscure then it 's got ta be good . Well that is never entirely true but this is a very strong exception to the rule , as well as being the best place to find the groun zero where post-punk pop met up with ... .well where the music 's gone pretty much today in a lot of ways .	1
Double-dipping is okay , I suppose . Normally I 'd be vehemently opposed to `` triple-dipping '' ( re-re-releasing an artist 's work ) , but since most of my Elvis Costello CDs were stolen last year , Rhino 's reissuing of the entire EC catalog is a welcome idea to me , and one that is accomplishing the seemingly impossible task of improving on Rykodisc 's similar reissue project.Rhino is apparently reissuing Elvis ' entire recorded output ( unlike Rykodisc , he 's not just reissuing the Columbia years ) , and releasing them three at a time roughly twice a year ( in no discernible order , it seems ) . The best thing about Rhino 's project is that every release is a two-disc package , with all the bonus material on disc two . This makes for quite a lot of bonus material . `` Imperial Bedroom '' was a higly welcome reissue . I first bought the vinyl copyof this masterpiece in 1986 , then I bought the Columbia CD in 1993 and the Rykodisc version in 2000 . It seems like the fourth time 's the charm.For those of you not familiar with this album , it was released in 1982 to wide critical acclaim . The lush production and strong songwriting make it , in my opinion , one of Elvis ' best and most certainly his most intelligent . The album 's been a part of my life for 16 years and I know the thing backwards and forwards . The moody `` Beyond Belief . '' The epic , beautiful `` Man out of Time . '' The latin-tinged , accordian-fueled `` Long Honeymoon . '' Steve Neive 's psychotic orchestrations on `` ... and in Every Home . '' And that 's just part of side one.The Rhino disc two is a veritable treasure trove for anyone interested in this album . There 's tons of alternate , early versions of oterwise great songs , giving them an intersting new edge . `` Kid About It '' is pared down a bit . `` Little Savage '' is given an R & B-ballad ; shot in the arm . `` Beyond Belief '' was originally named `` The Land of Give and Take '' with slightly different lyrics . `` Town Cryer '' is given a fast-paced disco treatment , making it sound like an Abba song ( that description may sound like sacrilege to an EC fan , but believe me , it sounds great ) .There 's lots of stuff that was also featured on the original Ryko bonus track section , like the cover of Smokey Robinson 's `` Head to Toe , '' the gleeful , upbeat `` I Turn Around , '' and the unused waltz-like title track ( a lot of this stuff is also familiar to long-time fans in the form of various B-sides and compilation albums , like the excellent `` Out of Our Idiot '' collection ) .Die-hard EC fans from back in the day will be in heaven , rediscovering this classic in a new light . New EC fans will also be very happy with this purchase . I ca n't imagine anyone not liking `` Imperial Bedroom . '' Rhino 's version makes ignoring this classic even more of a crime .	1
The true test of good Costello is ... do you find the songs running through your head hours later ? With this album , I find one whole side buzzing in my head - the second . ( In CD land where there is no sides , this means songs 8 and up ) . & quot ; Pidgin English & quot ; has one line that slides so gracefully over one held synthsizer note that it 's unforgettable . You 'll know what I mean when you come to it . Keeping the songs short , yet substantial , Costello works as if he were writing for 78 's , and the sound resembles that somewhat . Lots of piano . Yet not really nostalgic either . I do n't find the first side as compelling , and yet & quot ; And In Every Home & quot ; is so charming that it almost redeems it . Timneless All in all , this is the one Costello album with an infinite Sell By date .	1
Elvis has long admitted to being a Beatles fan , of course ( going as far as calling them the greatest band ever in Rolling Stone ) . And this is the closest he got to embracing the Fab Four 's occasional dipping into `` classical rock '' ( that is , rock influenced by classical music - I 'm not trying to invent a new phrase for `` classic rock '' ) . The result is an odd , but mostly satisfying effort . I say `` mostly '' because sometimes he goes totally overboard in places , making You Little Fool , Town Cryer , Pidgin English and ... And Every Home sound treacly , overloading them with harpsichord , strings , Baroque piano , flutes , clarinets , bassoons , lutes , hautboys , kazoos ... ( okay , I made a couple of those up ) .Overproduced ? Well , yeah . But that 's part of its charm , I guess you could say . And more often than not it 's a classic : Take the cynical Beyond Belief or the ballads Almost Blue and Man Out of Time . Shabby Doll , Tears Before Bedtime and The Long Honeymoon ( which has the only accordion part I 've ever heard that I can honestly say I like ) are n't as prominent as those three , but they have the same feel and are just as good . And Costello 's lyricism and immortal melodicism are diminished.However , there are at least two better Costello records out there . Maybe three . My favorite Elvis albums are the first three ( and this one ) , and I can honestly say at least This Year 's Model and Armed Forces ( and probably My Aim is True ) are better . So this is quite good , but do n't start here .	1
This , together with `` Next Year 's Model '' are my two favourite Elvis albums and this album is probably the best representative of his later works and is a creative highpoint . This version has been very well remastered for a brilliant sound and the mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself with both the Japanese and English lyrics included as an insert.Bearing little resemblence to his early punk days , the tracks here are a lot longer and take more time to develop . I do n't know where Amazon got its track information from but believe me , this album only has the first 15 tracks that they listed . However , this is still overall a brilliant album with every track worthy of being on a best of compilation album of Elvis Costello . My favourite track which was also a small hit single is `` You Little Fool '' but others like `` Town Cryer '' and `` Man Out of Time '' are also standout tracks.If you are looking for the best of Elvis ' later and earlier works , look no further than this and `` Next Year 's Model '' .Highly recommended .	1
Ah , the CD age ... who 'd ever thought that when I excitedly picked up this album in the summer of '82 , that I would purchase it four , count 'em , four more times ! OK , the second time I puchased it WAS spur of the moment - there I was eating at the Hibachi , a great Japanese restaurant in Kansas City , killing time by treating my taste-buds before seeing Elvis at the Starlight Theater in the summer of '83 . All of the sudden in walks ... Elvis Costello with his entourage ! Did I know that Elvis loved good Japanese food ? Well , of course , but who 've thought it ? Anyway , after a moment of excited discussion on the strategy of approaching E.C . for his autograph with my then-wife Diane and her brother Jeff , it was decided that Jeff and I would run to the nearest music store to procure a couple of Elvis albums and Diane would keep him at the Hibachi , using any charms necessary . Jeff bought a copy of his latest , Punch the Clock , while I purchased the Masterpiece ? , Imperial Bedroom . We arrived back the Hibachi , our food getting cold on the table , while E.C . was quickly consuming his . We ate quickly , while deciding how we were to approach the man . During this unending dicussion , Elvis and entourage got up to leave ... and we paniced , allowing E.C . to walk on by without a word . However , Bruce Thomas noticed the albums on the table , and stopped Elvis and motioned back to us . Elvis grudgingly turned around and humored yet another starstruck fan . We did have a short conversation , he signed the albums , and left . Yep , still have my autographed Imperial bedroom , never played.Half a decade later , Columbia issued I.B . on CD , and I , absolutely believing that ANYTHING on CD would sound better than its LP counterpart , purchased it immediately . Then came the 90s and the `` remastered reissue '' madness . Rykodisc acquired E.C.s Columbia catalog , and reissued this one in 1994 . Did I have to have it ? Absolutely ! AND it did sound considerably better than the Columbia release , AND it had NINE `` bonus '' tracks . Well , I finally could stop spending money on this album , right ? Wrong . Barely 7 years pass and Rhino , the King of reissues , gets hold of Elvis ' ENTIRE back catalog . I resist buying E.C.s albums YET AGAIN until this one comes out . This time there is an entire bonus disc that has 23 bonus tracks ! That 's just insane ! So , I shell out to buy this album for the 5th time ! Is it worth it ? Well , the remastering differs only so slightly from the Ryko remaster , just a litte more of that crispness that Bill Inglot is so known for . The Ryko remaster is a bit subtler , and for this album I think I prefer it . But I 'll state again , the differences are all but un-noticable , so if you 're buying this hoping for some remarkable sonic upgrade , you 'll be disappointed.But the bonus stuff is a different story . If you 're an Elvis fan , these tracks are both entertaining and illuminating . Different lyrics , different arrangements . Really makes one appreciate the final product all the more . Ex-Beatles ' engineer Geoff Emerick gets it all right , with plenty of Beatle-esque orchestral touches at all the right places . A masterpiece ? Well , yes.And this has GOT to be the LAST reissue , right ?	1
Listen to the opening lines of `` The Loved Ones '' and you hear Costello at his best . Snappy lines , sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit . Then we hit the piano `` noodling '' and the song starts to drift away from me . The CD is filled with moments like this ; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments . Stripped down , this is some of Costello 's best stuff ; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect . But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song , I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose . This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine , but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM .	1
There 's not a whole lot to add to the previously posted reviews . In spite of Columbia 's audacious `` Masterpiece ? '' ad campaign at the time of the original LP 's release , Imperial Bedroom is probably worthy of being called a masterpice . If nothing else , it was dramatically different from just about everything else that came out in 1982.The sound quality of the Rhino reissue is perhaps a tad fuller than the Ryko reissue , but the differences are mostly subtle . The extra bonus material mostly serves to illustrate why the `` alternate '' versions did n't make the album , though it 's great to finally be able to hear the sped-up version of `` Man out of time '' that survived as the intro and outro of the album version.Oddly enough , even the expanded liner notes do n't reveal too much more than the notes for the Ryko edition , which were already longer than those Costello penned for most of the previous Ryko reissues . Still , if you 've got the Ryko reissue of Imperial Bedroom , the new liner notes do make a good case for picking up the Rhino edition .	1
Almost 27 years since its initial release , I find I keep coming back to this album . I must confess , it was the 1st Costello record I bought ( we 're talking 1985 here ) & it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish & abandon . In short , it made a fan out of me.Among Costello devotees there is obviously a healthy , ongoing debate as to which albums deserve `` classic '' status . By & large , most agree Imperial Bedroom is on that list . The Costello admirers who hoist their fickle disdain on the likes of `` Man Out Of Time '' are few & far between . The fact that legendary Jazz trumpet great , Chet Baker covered `` Almost Blue '' to his dying day might also make one think twice as to it 's merit.A lot of ink has been spilled on the `` Beatlesque '' production , courtesy of Geoff Emerick ( The man who twiddled the nobs on a little album called `` Sgt . Pepper 's '' ) . But one thing that seems to set Bedroom apart from its predecessors is the fact that this is an album Costello pretty much composed on the piano , rather than the guitar . More than anything that preceded it , Cocktail Lounge Cabaret & Rogers & Hart musical stylings take precedence over 1-2-3-4- Rock & Roll . All of which , might just account for any cries of `` he 's lost his edge '' .Yet , regardless of the lavish , chirpy production or the absurd `` Gershwin '' comparisons Bedroom received , the sentiments of the songs are as dark & jaded as ever . Here domestic unrest meets morning-after malaise . The infectious `` insult & flattery '' of `` Beyond Belief '' soon gives way to the eviscerating self-portrait of `` Shabby Doll '' . The best way to sum up might be : all the strings in the world could n't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.Personally , I do n't find a single dud among Bedroom 's 15 tracks . And while , `` Man Out of Time '' & `` Almost Blue '' are usually on any given Greatest Hits compilation , lesser known greats like , `` Human Hands '' & `` Pidgin English '' need not be overlooked.For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery , Costello 's liner notes reveal it actually took 3 Attractions to play the 1 accordion on `` Long Honeymoon '' ... One to hold it in place , another to work the bellows , while Steve Nieve played the keyboard . So perhaps Punk is not dead after all.Despite this little footnote , Imperial Bedroom is without a doubt one of Costello 's most elegant & concise albums . I suppose a case could also be made for it being one of his most self-obsessed . But for me , he rises above the fray of his own self-conflict in a way we all can relate to.While a bit of a flop in its day , Columbia advertised the album with one word : `` Masterpiece ? `` ( much to Costello 's embarrassment ) .For this discerning fan , the answer is simple : Yes .	1
Here it is : Elvis Costello 's magnum opus and arguably his finest album . Imperial Bedroom is a sprawling and epic piece of work that finds Costello at his creative and contemplative best . It 's an ambitious effort that , thanks in large part to Beatles producer Geoff Emerick , succeeds on every level and it took Elvis Costello and the Attractions further than they 'd ever gone before.The first striking thing about this album is the sound itself . It has a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately draws you in . The songs have much more breathing room and feel more laid back than they did on any previous EC album ; there 's no doubt that Emerick is responsible for this . He takes Costello 's songs and gives them a life of their own while still allowing Costello and the band to work their magic . It 's slick and more restrained with a gentle warmness that flows effortlessly through every song . `` Beyond Belief '' is another gem in a long line of great album openers and immediately the album 's production sets in , giving the song a wide-open atmosphere while making it intimate at the same time . The poppy `` Tears Before Time '' immediately follows and gives keyboardist Steven Nieve a chance to shine with some unique sounds . This is really an album where he gets plenty of time in the spotlight , both on the keyboard and as a conductor and arranger for the various string arrangements sprinkled throughout the record . The soft accordion and piano melody of `` The Long Honeymoon '' is a perfect companion to Costello 's lyrics , a story about a young wife who 's waiting for her husband to call or come home , yet ca n't bring herself to actually pick up the phone and face the fear that he may be having an affair with her best friend . It 's the kind of twisted tale only Elvis can weave so eloquently . `` Almost Blue '' is one of Costello 's most famous songs , a gentle piano ballad with a smoky blues feel . The fanfare trumpets of `` ... And in Every Home '' completely take you by surprise but they fit the song so well that they quickly feel second nature and it 's one more nice production touch that sets this album apart from anything Elvis had recorded before . The fast-paced `` Little Savage '' is an exhilarating ride while `` The Loved Ones '' contains a lyric revealing the original title for the album : `` PPSILOVEYOU '' . The album 's closer is the beautiful `` Town Cryer '' , complete with Nieve 's delicate piano and a soaring orchestra that brings the entire album together and leaves an indelible impression.I have to save a paragraph for the album 's true highlight and one of the most devastating songs in EC 's library : `` Man Out of Time '' . What 's really interesting is that the track both begins and ends with an earlier and rougher version of the song . These bookends take you by surprise because the final cut of the song is sandwiched in the middle and is far superior and much more polished . The pop melody is incredibly bright and catchy while the words paint a picture that could be as autobiographical as they are allegorical . The entire album should be heard from beginning to end but if you absolutely must hear only one track from the record it 's this one , without a doubt.Despite the fact that it was met with some commercial and critical indifference upon the time of its release , Imperial Bedroom has gone on to become one of Costello 's most beloved and acclaimed albums . From its glossy production to its colorful cover art , everything about this record is sheer perfection . The Attractions are flawless as always and Costello 's words and music are a bit more open and optimistic , which results in a fresh experience that is n't easy to forget . All 15 tracks flow together effortlessly and the whole album should be heard from beginning to end . It 's like a movie where every scene is important and to not see the whole thing would greatly hurt the experience . In fact , this album is my second-favorite EC album , only behind All This Useless Beauty . From an artistic standpoint this may just be his brightest and best.This is one of the most stirring and beautiful records of the past 50 years . Own it , hear it , and experience it time and time again .	1
I had some trouble sharing others ' enthusiasm for `` Imperial Bedroom '' when it was first released in 1982 . The album was , of course , in many ways a return to Costello 's original starting point , after the , for me , very disappointing `` Almost Blue '' album . Compared to `` Trust '' and `` Get Happy '' , though , the numbers are generally more produced , and stylistically the album spreads out over many genres.However my original appeal against `` Imperial Bedroom '' was that I thought there were only few really good tracks . Later , I have had to revise my opinion , because there are actually more great songs.I remember that the only tracks that really made an impression on me were `` Shabby Doll '' and `` Long Honeymoon '' . I still think well of `` Shabby Doll '' , while `` Long Honeymoon '' has not lasted for me . On the other hand , there are a handful among the other songs that stand out positively . `` The Loved Ones '' is a catchy song that well could have stemmed from Costello 's perhaps best album `` Armed Forces '' . The same description could fit `` Little Savage '' which probably is my favorite track on the album . `` Man Out of Time '' , `` You Little Fool '' and the somewhat heavily-produced ballad `` Town Cryer '' also stand out.There are also a couple of real disappointments . The two Dusty Springfield pastiches `` Almost Blue '' and `` Kid About it '' can be hard to swallow.Conclusion : In several ways an uneven album that contains fine numbers , but which as a whole does not measure up to Costello 's best . To be fair , It should be mentioned that Costello vocally is on top and he shows great versatility .	1
As others have written here , this is the album that bridges Elvis v1.0 and Declan v1.0 . Whether it 's the masterpiece where black and white turns to color ( i.e . The Beatles ' Revolver ) is often debated . For my money , this is the best that Elvis/Dec would do for at least the next 15 years - his subsequent work , IMHO , being dabblings in this genre or that.This would have been 5 stars , but my ears are STILL bleeding from the horrible , early digital on the original release mastered on the `` CBS Discomputer . '' Rhino has done an admirable job of de-digitizing this album .	1
I was a new EC fan a few years ago , coming in with 1996 's & quot ; All This Useless Beauty & quot ; and hanging around since then . A longtime manic fan gave me two words of advice : & quot ; Get 'Brutal Youth ' and 'Imperial Bedroom ' ! & quot ; I did.Great songs here with & quot ; Man Out Of Time & quot ; and & quot ; The Loved Ones & quot ; being my favorites . The liner notes are wonderful as are the extra tracks . ( This of course is in reference to the 1994 Demon re-issue . ) Wonderful .	1
I remember reading an interview in 1982 where Elvis Costello expressed his desire to have someone like Frank Sinatra cover his tunes ( as opposed to Linda Ronstadt ) . Out of that urge came IMPERIAL BEDROOM , and it shows wonderfully . Whether Elvis Costello was simply maturing or just displaying a side of his songwriting talent that he had to suppress for so long , I could n't say . But IMPERIAL BEDROOM was certainly an ambitious and far-reaching album . & quot ; Man Out of Time & quot ; , & quot ; Shabby Doll & quot ; and & quot ; Beyond Belief & quot ; are incredibly brilliant compositions that , frankly , stunned me back in 1982 . I could n't get over the mix of sophistication and drama in these melodies . While I knew Costello was incredibly talented , I honestly did n't know he had such range.I do n't think that Ol ' Blue Eyes even bothered to listen to anything on this album -- seriously doubt it . But for my money , just for the first few songs alone , this cd is worth every penny .	1
Costello wanted his music to be as complex as his lyrics ( which increasingly documented marital tension ) . So for his seventh album he and Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick experimented with an adult sonic palette ( accordions , Mellotron , horns ) that highlighted grown-up stress and sorrow .	1
When `` Imperial Bedroom '' first hit the shelves , critics were falling over themselves with superlatives . Even Columbia 's `` Artist ... Masterpiece ? '' ad campaign was begging the question . Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello 's neck since `` My Aim Is True ? `` The answer was yes ... and no.Granted , hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome , rich sound , more than any other album in EC 's discography . The expansiveness paid off right from the album 's opener , `` Beyond Belief . '' Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts , Elvis ' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early `` punks '' of the period . ( Think of how closely Joe Jackson 's `` Night And Day '' and The Police 's `` Synchronicity '' followed . ) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements . The high pitched strings that slip out of the album 's fade to `` Town Cryer '' were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section , as I recall.Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did , each song was tinkered and toyed with till ( as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc 's demo versions ) they barely resembled their original ideas . It made the original album 's side one a song suite of near `` Sgt . Pepper '' proportions , with the standout of `` Man Out Of Time '' marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new . His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of `` Almost Blue '' reset the boundaries of compositions in 1982.Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when `` Imperial Bedroom '' first came out , one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with `` serious music '' than to the obvious merits of Elvis ' songwriting prowess . The debt to Tin Pan Alley ( `` The Long Honeymoon '' ) is truly there . But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello , and a line like `` In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman 's shoes '' would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross . I 'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind `` Shabby Doll . `` In short , the dark and introspective `` Imperial Bedroom '' was a turning point for Elvis , final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80 's . It was likely the best album of 1982 as well .	1
I 've always thought `` Imperial Bedroom '' to be Elvis ' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphones a la REM 's `` Up '' . I 'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuances are even better enjoyed this way . Elvis ' songwriting on `` Imperial Bedroom '' was at it 's most crisp , witty and insightful . Every track on here is a true jem ... a shining jewel . Well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc . Some of these songs made me cry then and still resonate now . I 'm glad I saw him on the `` Imperial Bedroom '' tour and glad I have this CD ! I still get a kick out of how one track bleeds into the next with assorted yelps and screams . And the lyrics ... my God ... at his peak Elvis really was brilliant !	1
Hailed by Columbia at the time of its release as a masterpiece and trashed by many critics expecting business as ususal from EC & The Attractions , Imperial Bedroom stands as a pivotal album in EC 's career . Why ? Because he created a diverse musical experience echoing everything from the Tin Pan Alley gaints to his British music idols ( most notably The Beatles ) . It 's technicolor production and sweeping lyrical themes make it one of the top 100 albums of all time . Imperial Bedroom along with This Year 's Model , Armed Forces , Blood & Chocolate and King of America represent early Costello at his best ; intelligent , witty and musical adept at adopting a number of musical styles.This reissue has stunning sound , complete liner notes by EC , complete lyrics as well as a second disc that includes the bonus tracks from the Ryko release . Add to that the alternate takes , demos and you have a reissue worth having . Price as a single disc collection , Imperial Bedroom is well worth purchasing again just to have all the extra	1
The mix sounds a little different for this edition -- which is something I have n't quite made up my mind about just yet -- but the real find here are the rare tracks found on the bonus disc , which range from brilliant ( an early , more vemonous take of `` You Little Fool '' ; a completely altered `` Little Savage '' ) , to weird-but-enlightening ( `` The Land of Give and Take '' ; rough , early run-throughs of `` Man Out of Time '' ) . All things considered , this is essential listening for the Costellophile and a great way to kill a few hours . Or years .	1
One of the saddest looks a person can make is when they are miserable and they try to come off like they 're happy . Goodbye Cruel World '' , with it 's `` happy '' pop production values and the desperately sad lyrics not to mention how Elvis Costello sings them puts him playing the part of the sad clown ; there to entertain us , but the pain inside is to tough to hid . That is what makes this album better than what most have come to judge it as . EC still does n't like it , but that makes sense since he was miserable when he made it.Take the opening song and the main single off the album , `` You 're Not the Only Flame In Town '' - the song is a duet loaded with irony right down to the fact that two men are singing it . This is one song that should have been as it is on the bonus disc , a lament . But ! Strangely it works in the kind of way that it 's lament is ridiculously guarded by two guys having a party with happy saxophones ! Love Field , the best song on the album is so beautiful and mournful right down to the 80 's production . The song gives poignancy and purpose to any guarded feeling on the album.Other gems like Home Truth , Inch By Inch , I Wan na Be Loved , and Joe Porterhouse for the most part I was not particularly impressed with at first ; those songs have grown on me because there is a strong emotional expression that is coming out of them . They are all songs looking for human connection and the 80 's production sheen just makes the the album feel that much more tragic.The bonus disc is quite good . I would n't say it is better than or even competes with the original album though . I do think tracks like Turning the Town Red , and the Madness cover Tomorrow ( just another day ) , as well as the aforementioned alternative of `` You 're Not the Only Flame In Town '' are fantastic ( interesting side note : `` Tomorrow '' is backed by Madness who Elvis Costello was producing at the time ) . The demo 's of the original tunes off `` Goodbye '' show bare versions of what were the final outcomes but they are n't really that different in melody or delivery.I think the main thing that kept me from liking this album immediately was I was expecting at least another `` Punch The Clock '' - but it is definitely not that . Yet I kept coming back to it ! It is a very good album that should be re-evaluated by any Elvis Costello fan or anyone interested in getting into Costello 's pop albums .	1
After hearing this it still boggles me that even Elvis himself considers this his worst album . From what I heard from Amazon reviews I went in expecting to hear something that sounded more like Harold Faltmeyer or something with a lot of drum machines and other mid 80 's clishes . And being a lover of 80 's pop I know there is such a thing as taking it too far.That goes for any decade.But not to be a..well revisionist here I have to say I was more the pleasantly surprised . This is along with the previous recordingPunch the Clockone of my two favorite releases by Costello . The 13 songs presented here have a very alive tone to them , topped with the same tasteful , creamy 80 's soul/pop-jazz polish as the last album . The one difference is that every song features that sound ; this does n't sound like a spiky new-wave effort in the slightest . That beside the point there are a handful of great songs that are hugely HELPED by the production ; '' The Only Flame In Town '' , '' Inch By Inch '' and `` Worthless Thing '' are all excellent tunes in and of themselves , with a lot of jazzy , funky groove in them that add more then a fair share of bite . `` Sour Milk-Cow Blues '' ... ... okay it does have a Huey Lewis-ish flavor but again , from this view that is not a bad thing.There are a number of ballads too of course , great as well from the simple style of `` Room With No Number '' , the soulful `` Love Field '' and my favorite `` I Wan na Be Loved '' ; this is my favorite contribution of Costello to the Brit-R & B ; scene since his work on the previous album , the delayed beat and the mildly psychedelic bit in the chorus create a unique sense of atmospherics that really make it great to hear and hear how everything comes together by the end . `` Peace In Our Time '' is at least one song pretty much everyone can agree is plain great-there 's no question who it 's about and there 's no irony lost when Elvis declares Reagen an `` alien in the white house '' considering the now deacessed ex president was once posed on a tabloid cover with a cardboard standup of a space alien.As with any Elvis Costello album there tend to be an awful lot of songs-some great , some pretty good but the fact is if your good with albums such a Tears For FearsSongs from the Big Chairor XTC'sOranges & Lemons , both recordings that blended contemporary rock-soul-pop with jazz and psychedelic influences then you will have your mind as open as possible for the music you 'll find here .	1
... .I 've always liked this album . Mostly because I thought the songs were great . sure I was n't crazy about the production , especially `` The only Flame in town '' , which I thought was embarrassing . That being said , the new extra disk of demos and a few leftovers prove that I was right.Elvis is a terrific song writer even with bad production and more often better than most others , even on his worst ( supposed ) record .	1
`` Congratulations ! You 've just bought our worst album ! '' This pessimistic phrase opened the liner notes of a reissued copy of this CD many years ago . Apparently Costello 's view has n't changed too much with subsequent remasters and re-releases . It 's no surprise , especially considering that many fans and critics tend to view this album as his weakest work as well . With tension arising between himself and The Attractions , not to mention the collapse of his first marriage , Goodbye Cruel World is about as bleak as it gets . Many of the lyrics do n't even try to hide this and Elvis readily admits that he took a decent bunch of songs and ended up completely missing the mark with them . It 's a bleak picture but I personally believe that Costello 's being a bit hard on himself . This album certainly is n't his finest work but it has enough gems to warrant a few spins and even ownership for the dedicated fan.The opener `` The Only Flame in Town '' ( complete with a guest appearance Daryl Hall ) is coated with 80 's cheese but it 's so catchy and fun that I do n't even care . If you can get past the dated production it 's a solid track that does exactly what it 's supposed to do . Using the same producers who had worked on Punch the Clock , Costello 's songs feel a bit too slick this time around and many of them lack the personal grittiness stylistically that the lyrics need to really be effective . `` The Deportees Club '' , `` Sour Milk-Cow Blues '' , and `` I Wan na Be Loved '' are n't bad songs by any means but the overdone production robs them of the intimacy and storytelling finesse that they appear to be going for . Granted , `` I Wan na Be Loved '' is a cover but it still could have used a bit more raw intensity . In the end that seems to be the album 's biggest flaw : a batch of personal and dark songs that feel too polished and overdone to really hit their mark.However , there 's still plenty to like here . `` Home Truth '' is a great number about falling out of love with someone you 've admired for years and there 's little doubt that Elvis ' divorce played a large part in the song 's influence . `` Inch By Inch '' and `` Worthless Thing '' are both solid pop numbers that have enough hooks to keep you coming back for more while `` Room With No Number '' is more reminiscent of Costello 's earlier work on Trust and Armed Forces . `` Peace in Our Time '' is a decent closer to the record and `` Love Field '' features some nice synth effects that manage to hold the song together in an interesting structure . The real gem here is `` The Comedians '' , a song that Roy Orbison would later make famous thanks to his impeccable interpretation . It 's a bright spot and a tune worth pursuing.The biggest problem with Goodbye Cruel World is that it just feels unfocused . Is it a pop record , a soul record , or something else ? It 's difficult to tell and ultimately I think that 's what hurts it the most . The Attractions feel underused and simply play their parts without much distinction or vigor . The problems in Costello 's personal life obviously took their toll but I 'm happy to say this record is n't as bad as many will lead you to believe . I was pleasantly surprised upon hearing it to find that I liked a majority of the songs and over the years it 's grown on me even more . I 'll even go so far as to say that I do n't even think it 's his weakest album and I 'm glad to see that there are other fans out there who appreciate this album for what it is . It 's not his best work but even subpar Elvis Costello is better than what many artists can put out on their best days .	1
I came to work with the intention of writing an embittered and overly-angry review regarding the negative reviews , but I 've since calmed down.A lot of people do n't like this album . I can sort of understand why , and then again I really ca n't . The production ? Personally , it 's fine . It actually sounds like the first four They Might Be Giants records ( which is not coincidental -- six years later , the same production team would produce the massively popular `` Flood '' album ) , excluding the intentionally overproduced `` Only Flame in Town '' and `` I Wan na Be Loved . `` Speaking of `` The Only Flame in Town '' -- nice as an eighties pop confection , but I 'll only listen to it when no one else is around or while wearing headphones . The sax intro does permanently date the song , unfortunately . ( Not to mention a quasi-duet with freakin ' Daryl Hall . ) The other super-produced song , `` I Wan na Be Loved , '' is actually quite excellent . Your liking of it will be based on how much you like synth noises and drum machine beats.The rest sounds like a lesser `` Armed Forces , '' frankly . It 's not as good as most of his other albums , but it 's not bad *at all* . It 's sequenced nicely , and after the opening track , I never feel like skipping any songs . And the songs are amazing ! `` Home Truth , '' `` The Comedians , '' `` Worthless Thing , '' `` Love Field , '' `` The Great Unknown '' -- all rather excellent.I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who thinks so highly of this much maligned album , but I certainly feel like it . Please , if you such people exist , write a positive review on here so I wo n't feel so lonely.Even Costello hates this record , which made me want to hate it so bad , but I just ca n't .	1
`` Goodbye Cruel World '' is routinely dismissed as the worst release from Elvis Costello , even by the artist himself . I 'm not sure if I would rank it at the very bottom , but it definitely is weaker than most of his catalog , although I 'd argue that even mediocre Costello is still pretty damned good . Indeed , there 's much quality work here . Unfortunately , as others have noted , the production ( by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley ) is simply terrible , displaying the worst kind of 80s excess . Langer and Winstanley had produced Costello 's prior record , `` Punch the Clock , '' which yielded one of Costello 's biggest U.S. hits , `` Everyday I Write the Book ; '' their production more or less works there . Previously , they were best known for producing most of Madness ' hits , and they brought some of that everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-ska approach here . `` The Only Flame in Town '' is a lovely song buried under layers of tacky 80s production - a squealing sax , overly loud vocals , and a scarily aggressive xylophone ( ! ) . It was the only ` hit ' in America , peaking at # 44 on the Rock Chart . `` Home Truth '' is a gorgeous song but as with so much of the material , it needed to be quieter . It would be stunning with an acapella opener , or even a subdued piano accompaniment . `` Room with No Number '' is one of the worst victims of overproduction , with an extended musical break section so frantic it could play in a Looney Tunes . A highlight is `` I Wan na Be Loved , '' by obscure 70s R & B ; group Teacher 's Edition , which served as the second single ( peaking at # 25 in the UK ) . Costello 's vocals on this song are beautiful and emotional , although even this song gets marred by a screeching sax solo that would sound more at home on a Whitney Houston singe . I also like the lead single , `` Peace In Our Time '' ( it only peaked at # 48 in the UK ) ; it does n't have a particularly memorable chorus , but it is relatively understated compared to the rest of the record.As always , Costello 's lyrics are clever and insightful . The playful `` Worthless Thing , '' for example , crackles with irony : Oh , I wish you could see/ quite how much you could mean to me/ you worthless thing . Really , there is n't a bad song here - just songs that could be improved with better production . Although , the egregiously loud `` The Deportees Club '' would probably make my list of his weakest songs ( sadly , a stripped down version known as `` Deportee '' is absolutely gorgeous ) . The reissues by Ryodisc and Rhino really illustrate that point via some rather stunning live versions and demos of these songs . Just check out the live version of `` The Only Flame in Town '' for evidence . Fortunately , for his next record , Costello co-produced with T-Bone Burnett , and they turned out what I consider his best record - `` King of America . '' Wherever you rank `` Goodbye Cruel World , '' it 's still a worthwhile effort that offers some enjoyment .	1
Considering what a critics darlingKing of Americawound up becomming Elvis Costello rebounded with the Attractions and original producer Nick Lowe for this album . This is not only very different from the previous album but very different from the last two albums with the Attractions before this . The best I can describe it is as something of a mid 80 's updated mixture of the jerky new wave rhythms of his late 70 's albums and some of the more carefully crafted pop/rock styled music of the early 80 's . Taken individually the songs on this album are all highly melodic , tend towards the upbeat musically and have particularly biting and scatching lyrics even by Elvis Costello standards . One of the great things about Costello is his ability to express emotions such as betrayal , irritation and even anger without resorting to childish simplifications or witless cynicism . Much as John Lennon before him ( perhaps even to a further degree ) Costello can take a negative subject and intellectualize it to such an extent it pretty much becomes a more positive thought or , at least a more setttled one anyway . `` Uncomplicated '' opens the album with a harsh , agitated melody and guitar sound whereas `` I Hope Your Happy Now '' , '' Home Is Anywhere You Hang Your Head '' and even the conveniently possitioned `` I Want You '' all possess the rolling drums , jangly guitars and melodicism of mid 60 's Beatles , part of the classic Attractions sound as it was . Later in the album you hear more elaboratly constructed songs such as the darkly textured `` Battered Old Bird '' and `` Poor Napoleon '' , named after the alias he 'd taken for this albums release . As with the previous album , even though this is more based in modern pop music than that had been this album is still somewhat atypical of much of pop music of it 's time . Because it in many ways anticipates the decades to come this album holds up a lot better in todays environment where with the exception of maybe REM at this point this may have seemed a bit different from most of what was commercially popular . It winds up a solid Elvis Costello/Attractions album regardless and is one of the finer releases from any period .	1
I will defer to all the laudatory comments listed here . I had one observation , however , regarding this new version by Rhino vs. the previous , also-excellent version by Rykodisc.The final track on the Ryko CD was `` A Town Called Big Nothing ( Really Big Nothing ) '' , a wonderful , 5-minute+ little gem originally writen for a Alex Cox film that featured Costello 's father on trumpet.However , it is NOT included on the new Rhino CD . This is a curious and unfortunate omission , so FYI to all who are considering replacing the Ryko 's . Perhaps Rhino will include it on one of the future Costello releases . ( UPDATE : The track never made it to any of the Rhino releases . It now only appears on The Singles Volume 3 set . )	1
'Blood and Chocolate ' is one of those releases that stands up from start to finish but does n't contain any immediately famous songs , or any real Costello standards ( like 'My Aim Is True ' has 'Alison ' , and 'Spike ' has 'Veronica ' ) , but has some of his strongest writing and best material . This album is definitely a & quot ; return to roots & quot ; album , in a way , after releasing & quot ; Trust & quot ; , & quot ; Punch The Clock & quot ; , and & quot ; Goodbye Cruel World & quot ; , all of which seemed kinda polished and & quot ; contemporary & quot ; ( meaning very 80s sounding ) . This is Elvis with his Fender Telecaster and the Attractions playing bitter , angry rock and roll.The highlights of this set are the creepy and almost stalkerish 'I Want You ' , the thrasing 'Uncomplicated ' ( he does the one chord thing better than The Velvet Underground or The Stooges ever did ) , and the carnivalesque 'Tokyo Storm Warning ' . 'Poor Napoleon ' is a hidden gem and so is the rocking final song 'Next Time Around ' . 'North ' is how Elvis reacted to heartbreak and torment in 2003 , and 'Blood & amp ; Chocolate ' is the Elvis of 1986 . It 's amazing how the same man can relate to similar events with such different work . 'Blood & amp ; Chocolate ' is a highlight of Elvis in the 80s , along with 'Get Happy ! ! '	1
A solidly enjoyable return to rock after several years of weirdness . It kind of reminds me of This Year 's Model : four-piece rock with a funk edge and lovably cheesy keyboards . And it 's good . ( `` Uncomplicated '' ; `` I Hope You 're Happy Now '' ; `` Honey , Are You Straight or Are You Blind ? `` ; the jangly `` Next Time Around '' ) . The difference is , there are a few longer tracks that are great , too ( the ominous rumble of `` Tokyo Storm Warning '' ; the torch ballad of sorts `` Home is Anywhere You Hang Your Head '' ; the possessive `` I Want You '' , a slow , creepy build-up of a song ) . And Costello 's undeniable songwriting skills make even weak songs like `` Blue Chair '' ( stupid harpsichord ... ) and the rather unspectacular `` Crimes of Paris '' . Other than `` I Want You '' none of these songs are exactly classics , but it 's an all-around good album , though the fourth extended track ( `` Battered Old Bird '' ) is a bit much , and the spaced-out intro to `` Poor Napoleon '' annoys me . Still , a very respectable album , one of Costello 's best .	1
blood & chocolate . knife fights & the easter bunny , indeed . my mother warned me about mr costello . she said his music would lead me to acts of depravity . so i consulted our pastor , and he more or less said the same thing . but i bought the album anyway . i bought it and i listened . i listened and i listened . then i took my sweaters to the goodwill and got myself shabby , but cooler looking clothes . I 'm ruined !	1
Originally released in 1986 , this is generally known as the Elvis Costello album that returned to the sound of his excellent 1978-80 era recordings with the Attractions . Listening to the CD is somewhat different from the LP . In many cases , artists ( and perhaps even record companies ) sequenced LP 's to deliver a certain impact . In the case of 'Blood and Chocolate ' , the first side ( Tracks 1-5 ) was the edgier of the two . All you need to do is listen to the first song , & quot ; Uncomplicated & quot ; , and you get the message . That is followed up by one of my favorite EC songs , & quot ; I Hope Your Happy Now & quot ; , which I would rate as one Elvis ' best . This song is great because the lyrics and melody recall the heyday of 'Armed Forces ' , but also show a certain evolution of both Elvis and the Attractions . Next is & quot ; Tokyo Storm Warning & quot ; , which for some reason was marketed at the time as the main single off of the album . Ending the first side was the great & quot ; I Want You & quot ; . Some major emotion on this one . Even after multiple listens it never gets old . From that point on the rest of the tracks are on the lackluster side . Most are solid if not spectacular , although the second to last track , & quot ; Poor Napoleon & quot ; , kind of drags things down . For this reason I would rate the album at four stars . Put into the context of the time , 'Blood and Chocolate ' was a refreshing listen after the puzzling post-1981 output that was 'Almost Blue'+'Imperial Bedroom'+'Punch The Clock'+'Goodbye Cruel World ' and the Attraction-less ( except for one song ) 'King of America ' . The second disc also contains some excellent material such as & quot ; Seven Day Weekend & quot ; , & quot ; Baby 's Got A Brand New Hairdo & quot ; ( another song that recalls earlier recordings ) , and the previously unreleased & quot ; Leave My Kitten Alone & quot ; .	1
Quite . I Want You is just incredible . It just sends chills down your spine every time . Of course , we ca n't ignore the greatness of Battered Old Bird , Tokyo Storm Warning , or Crimes of Paris either . And then there 's Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind ? , probably his single most straight-ahead rock song . Greatness abounds , even amongst the bonus tracks -- despite Costello 's less-than-enthusiastic summings up of them in the liner notes , Seven Day Weekend and Baby 's Got a Brand New Hairdo are nice , rockin ' , little numbers ; I even like the goofy spaghetti-westernness of A Town Called Big Nothing . There are a few tracks that are n't altogether awe-inspiring , but they are the minority -- most of this album rocks . And , I would like to point out , my copy came with a cool seventy-minute promotional interview CD . Sweet !	1
This , along with Imperial Bedroom , is my favorite Costello/MacManus album ( I actually prefer his real name , Declan MacManus ) . I have loved the fact that Costello has changed over the years , trying ever musical style known to man , writing probably around 1000 songs or so , and has never really made a godawful album ( Goodbye Cruel World , generally considered his worst album , has some good tunes on it ) . Declan released 2 albums in 1986 , King of America ( another masterpiece ) , and this one . This one is much rawer and more powerful . The opener , Uncomplicated , is superb . The next one , I Hope You 're Happy Now , is cool , too , but the 2 masterpieces are Tokyo Storm Warning , a breathless , amazing piece of wordplay and music , and the song I Want You is one of the best songs about love ( and anger ) I 've ever heard . Costello has been really amazing throughout his career . He can still turns the anger on , but it never defined him as an artist or as a human being . He 's not stuck in arrested development , like some rockers can be . He continues to grow as an artist . He may have started out as a punk , but he is n't a punk , and honestly , never really was . He has a ton of depth that really comes out in his music . Declan rules ... For the record , the name `` Napoleon Dynamite '' was a pseudonym used by Declan on this album . It was appropriated for the movie years later , even though the director claimed he never heard of this album ( which I doubt personally ) ...	1
Back in the early 80 's as an unsuspecting teenager who 'd heard `` Opportunity '' off of Get Happy on our then excellent AAA station , K-99 ( r.i.p . ) , I ordered Get Happy and Armed Forces when my sister and I convinced our parents to join the Columbia record club ( basically a rip-off , but oh the music I discovered ) . From that point forward I was an E.C . fan . Cue forward a few years as a junior in college and this album is released to little press or fanfare but I think , what the heck , I 'll check it out . At first I was disappointed . Not quite as hooky or instantly `` gettable '' as some of Costello 's older material , it 's one that over time has grown to be my favorite . While musically it may be less accessible ( at first ) , lyrically it is Costello with his finest , most caustic , biting wit expressed in screams and shouts that make you feel like your in the recording booth with him . `` Blue Chair '' is probably one of my favorite Costello songs , ever , and that 's amongst many others I could throw in that . Once this album grabs you , you will feel emotionally wrung out every time you listen to it - use headphones for full effect .	1
Welcome to `` the place where they take your spine & turn it into soap flakes '' .Costello has always been angry , he built his reputation on it . But on BLOOD & CHOCOLATE , all kid gloves are off . Those great pop hooks & bitter turns of phrase are there , but here he deliberately keeps things as ugly as possible . Playing almost in mockery of stuff like `` Oliver 's Army '' . It 's the sonic equivalent of burning oneself in effigy . Smothered in decidedly claustrophobic production , the whole album sounds like a bar brawl in a broom closet . `` Uncomplicated '' clangs in like a ringside bell . One immediately gets the sense that everyone 's playing in the dark , pissed as hell , determined to beat any semblance of melody into a pulp . Steve Neive hits the Wulitzer like a drunken carny . Pete Thomas seems to be pounding on the decapitated heads of those he hates . As if in spiteful opposition , Bruce Thomas plays as if he 's creeping up to push the shiv in . As for Costello , he gleefully lives up to the self-deprecating nickname `` little hands of concrete '' , spitting out his lyrics as if he could n't stand the taste of them.Throughout , they seem intent on flogging the same dead horse , especially the likes of `` Tokyo Storm Warning '' & `` Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind ? '' Elsewhere , the atmosphere could only be described as perverse.A major highlight is `` I Want You '' . Easily one of the creepiest & most powerful songs he 's ever recorded . I suppose the whole album could be summed up with the lines , `` the truth ca n't hurt you , it 's just like the dark/ it scares you witless but in time you see things clear & stark '' .The most epic number has to be `` Battered Old Bird '' . Despite it 's maudlin tone , never has the boardinghouse come so close to Bedlam . The characters are more like inmates from an asylum than tenants . He 's never recorded anything like it.As for the bonus disc , 3 tracks stand out among the debris . Costello 's fondness for Burt Bacharach is obvious in `` You 'll Forgive Her Anything '' . A vastly superior take than the one found on the Ryko reissue . There 's also a furious assault on `` Leave My Kitten Alone '' that puts the Kojak Variety version to shame . Lastly , a lost classic can be found in `` New Rhythm Method '' .In the liner notes Costello confesses that B & C sounds like a bitter 33 year old divorcee 's answer to THIS YEAR 'S MODEL . It also could be considered the sound of Costello not only breaking up with The Attractions , but with himself as well . One listen to later albums like BRUTAL YOUTH & USELESS BEAUTY & it 's evident they were far more than a mere backing band.This album is definitely not for beginners or fickle fans who could never get beyond the first three albums . It 's his TONIGHT 'S THE NIGHT or SONGS OF LOVE & HATE . Separating the connoisseurs from the tourists .	1
This is a good album . My favorite songs are : I want you , Battered old bird , Tokyo storm warning , blue chair , and I hope you 're happy now . It 's one of my favorite elvis costello album ! I 've seen him in concert twice and both times were amazing.BYE !	1
Elvis Costello 's second record of 1986 is a stark departure from the first , King of America . Blood & Chocolate is a rollicking and ferocious effort in the vain of his earlier albums like This Year 's Model and Armed Forces . For anyone who wondered if Costello had lost the edge and spunk that made him famous to begin with , one listen to this record left little doubt that he had n't completely disposed of the anger and energy that made his first albums so compelling.The Attractions make a welcome return and tensions in the group were at an all-time high . In fact , this would be the last album that Costello would record with them for nearly a decade . The unrest is evident in the songs , which are loud and have a `` live on the floor '' feeling . There 's little polish or double-tracking , just pure rock n ' roll at its finest . `` I Hope You 're Happy Now '' , `` Honey , Are You Straight or Are You Blind ? `` , `` Crimes of Paris '' and `` Blue Chair '' are all great rock songs that perfectly capture the sound that Elvis had perfected so well . The six minute `` Tokyo Storm Warning '' tells the story of a dazed and overwhelming trip through the famous city and it chugs along at a relentless pace that never lets up . `` Uncomplicated '' is a nice way to open the album and it contains the memorable line `` When you 're over me there 's no one above you '' . Classic.Many of the song titles reveal the hurt and anger that still seemed to be boiling over from the last couple of years . `` Home Is Anywhere You Hang Your Head '' and `` Battered Old Bird '' are both crushing and beautiful pieces of work that are as haunting and unsettling as they are catchy and exciting . `` Poor Napoleon '' features a neat arrangement while `` Next Time Round '' closes the record with a more optimistic , if somewhat pensive , viewpoint . However , it 's `` I Want You '' that brings the whole package together . It 's absolutely devastating in its simplicity and bite , a true work of genius that still remains one of his most beloved and acclaimed compositions . It starts off with gentle vocals and guitar before gradually building and then fading out once again . It 's epic and deserves to be heard , even though it may take a few listens to fully grab you and sink in.Blood & Chocolate is one of the angriest and loudest albums Costello 's ever made , yet it 's just honest and tender enough to keep its humanity . The lyrics in particular are rough and full of venom , almost as if Elvis turns the gun on everyone he knows before eventually turning it on himself . No one is safe and it only adds to the passion of this recording . 1986 seemed to be the year when every Costello fan got their wish ; they got the quiet and experimental side of EC while also getting a stripped-down rocker full of angst and energy . For Costello to release not one but two classics in the same year is a true testament to his vision and talent as an artist . This is a must-have for rock fans and Elvis completists alike .	1
After a couple of years of more subtle work , Elvis Costello reteamed with the Attractions for a fierce , angry release , Blood & amp ; Chocolate . With producer extrodinaire Nick Lowe again manning the board , Mr. Costello spewed forth venomous songs based around his recent divorce . & quot ; I Hope You 're Happy Now & quot ; sums up the overall tone of the album . & quot ; Tokyo Storm Warning & quot ; is a blistering extended jam , while & quot ; Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind ? & quot ; is a frenetically paced rocker that harkened back to the band 's late 70 's sound . & quot ; I Want You & quot ; is a song that conveys Mr. Costello 's longing for his lost relationship . Despite the overall angry tone , the album closes with & quot ; Next Time Round & quot ; which shows a more wizened man that will learn from his mistakes .	1
this album romps around and bangs keys but is most notable forI Want Youa most stark tightjaw tingling song young man i do believe you 're dying	1
After the extremes of `` King Of America , '' `` Punch The Clock , '' and `` Imperial Bedroom , '' Elvis Costello made what he probably suspected people would conceive of as a typical `` Elvis Costello and the Attractions '' album . Nick Lowe came back on board and they threw subtlety to the wind for `` Blood And Chocolate , '' Elvis Costello 's angriest album since `` This Year 's Model . '' Fueled by his recent divorce and a few rancorous Hollywood romantic disasters , Elvis himself described the inspiration for most of this material as `` Messing up my life so I could write stupid little songs about it . `` `` I hope you 're satisfied with what you 've done . '' That opening line sets the tone of `` Uncomplicated , '' and the oncoming barrage for the album . EC unleashes wave after wave of vitriol backed by The Attractions ' and Lowe 's artful distortion . The distorted sound matches the emotional content of many of the songs , and one of Elvis ' most brilliant performances of all time is here . On `` I Want You , '' he drags you into a hellish confrontation that moves at half the album 's general pace . With more than a passing nod to John Lennon and The Beatles ' song of the same name , Elvis vents with derisive passion , till the sounds slowly drop away and with little more than the sound of him deeply breathing the title over and over , the song comes to a close . `` I Want You '' is reason enough to have `` Blood And Chocolate , '' but if you need more , there 's the bizarre Dylanesque travelogue of `` Tokyo Storm Warning . '' Next to `` Hurry Down Doomsday ( The Bugs Are Taking Over ) '' from `` Mighty Like A Rose , '' it 's one of EC 's weirdest songs and contains the wonderful line about the `` Japanese Jesus Robots telling teenage fortunes . `` Perhaps it 's in the fact that the recording of `` Blood And Chocolate '' was done as quickly as possible with as few takes as necessary , but for the most part , this was Elvis most relentless CD since `` This Year 's Model ( With Bonus Disc ) . '' Just do n't let that stop you from getting this CD ... it 's a boxful of some very angry candy .	1
As an EC fan ... this is possibly the most punk album by the punk/new wave pioneer . True , it came out in 1986 , but it 's a raw , live-in-the-studio ( mostly ) rock band playing songs ... It works , better than he thinks it does.Hard driving , desperate rock and roll from EC and the Attractions . Steve Nieve 's organ punctuates madly and cascades it 's way over Bruce Thomas 's bass lines , creating a melody like a disastrous waterfall that pours over Pete Thomas 's rock solid drumming.The result is a discordant , spartan proceeding that has some of EC 's best songs and the Attractions ' best playing . Words : : Well , here 's a boy if ever there was/Who 's gon na do great things/I guess that 's what they all say/And that 's how the trouble begins/I 've seen them rise and fall and through their big deals and smalls/And he better have a dream that goes beyond 4 walls . `` Lyric brilliance , vocal emotiveness unrivaled by a damn good soul singer , and awesome musicality..buy it or die trying ... fantastic album.And the bonus CD ... WELL ! Great stuff , alternate takes of album tracks ( that make me trust EC 's judgement ) and some demos , and some B-sides ... WELL ! A non-fan does n't need any of it , but for someone who has followed a career , it 's invaluable ... luckily , RHINO is not charging for the second CD..buy them , realize them , enjoy them ... this is songwriting at it 's best ! Trust me ... .this is worth your time .	1
One of Costello 's most riveting albums , Blood and Chocolate is n't quite as consistent as earlier outings but is , nevertheless , one of his most powerful . One could argue that , emotionally , it 's one of his most personal albums as well . This is about as raw as EC gets.The remastered sound is great and the booklet very informative ( much more so than the version released with the Ryko reissue ) . Is it worth picking up again ? Frankly , yes because of the second disc . While EC has relocated the bonus tracks to the second disc , he 's also added a handful of previously unreleased or rare tracks that make this an essential edition to any fan.The Attractions have never sounded this brutal before . The songs are direct and played without the flourish that one had come to expect from the band.A quick note for fans -- the initial batch release has the discs mislabeled . The & quot ; bonus & quot ; disc is actually B & amp ; C. This is also the case with Brutal Youth ( another underrated album in EC 's catalog and , yes , essential ) .	1
Man this is one great blues guitar album ! It may be listed under Albert Collins , but this is a true collaboration . Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums . All three share in the vocal duties and the guitar solos . No one plays over each other - it 's a great collaboration that results in a great album . Just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store . Buy it and enjoy .	1
It 's nothing short of awesome to hear these three guitar greats come together . Albert Collins was one of the BEST blues guitarists in the world . Any recording which features him is going to be worthwhile . Robert Cray is very good too and has a wonderful voice . Johnny Copeland contributes some nice vocals and guitar licks , but I 'm not as familiar with him as I am Albert and Robert . There are only two downsides to this wonderful CD . First , the sound quality is n't as good as it could be . It definitely sounds its age . I know that Alligator is not a huge record label , but it would be nice if they could remaster and rerelease some of their titles such as this one . Second drawback is that the album is too short ! It 's so good that you do n't want it to end . It 's not much longer than half an hour . But it is good stuff . If you like guitar-based blues , BUY this CD !	1
Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland were two of the pioneers of Texas blues , and major influences to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan . These two guys work their magic on this CD , and bring on a young bluesman named Robert Cray . These guys just seem to have fun with this CD , never trying to outdo each other . Great riffs in the leadoff track & quot ; T-Bone Shuffle & quot ; , harmonica on & quot ; Bring Your Fine Self Home & quot ; , lyrics in & quot ; Black Cat Bone & quot ; ( hear Johnny Copeland yelling & quot ; Hey Albert ! & quot ; ) and the last track & quot ; Blackjack & quot ; where each does a tremendous guitar solo . Cray , of course , is now a major talent in his own right , and Johnny Copeland lives on in a way in his daughter Shemekia Copeland 's music , but here is a playful , low-key yet powerful , piece of work from some of the masters of electric blues . Highly recommended for serious blues fans .	1
Showdown is one of the top two or three blues guitar collaborations of all time . Albert Collins , Johnny Copeland , and Robert Cray , all on one record ? Unbelievable . But that 's what happened , and the result was magic.All three get a chance to show their chops , and all three were on top of their blues guitar game recording this record . The energy , skill , and unbridled joy at performing with talented musicians always brings the best out from other talented musicians . Every cut is excellent.It 's a shame that Showdown could have been repeated more often than twice . Both Collins and Copeland are gone , leaving Cray to find other blues greats to jam with , but we will always have Showdown to remember when .	1

Showdown album The elder statesman and leader here is the irrepressible Albert Collins , whose guitar sound and unique approach to the blues has been bending ears since the '50s . Showdown CD music Johnny Copeland , the `` Texas Twister , '' an early disciple and longtime friend of Collins , is also here , showing he 's moved well beyond Collins 's early tutelage . Showdown music CDs The youngest gun is Robert Cray , another musician Collins took under his wing ( some 15 years after he first met Copeland ) . `` Showdown is what it is all about , three blues masters squaring off , going toe-to-toe , this is a dream come true for blues-guitar fans.Collins , the ICEMAN , Copeland the WILDMAN and Cray the fulcrum , the balance between the three . Every song is a triple lead break challenge and each artist is up for the battle.I love this album , there is not one bad cut in the lot . Each of our three legends have their own commanding styles and showcase them while trading shots back and forth.An Instant Classic.Check out more Robert Cray classics like `` False Accusations '' , excellent .	1
Hank Williams , Jr. has to be one of my very favorite country stars . All of his songs are always excellent . This CD includes all of his best tracks . My very favorite is his '79 number 1 , `` Family Tradition . ''	1
Even though trendy folks like Gretchen Wilson and Big And Rich are abusively gripping to his coattails , you have to remember that Hank , Jr. was n't always the popular kid on the Nashville schoolbus . It took them years to recognize him as a true performer who stood on his own . Perhaps it was having to deal with the shadow of his father , or just that Nashville did n't want him to be a popular act , Bocephus never received his due until he was well into his career.Hank , Jr. remedied the problem of being the outcast in Nashville by doing what so many artists ca n't do : be himself . Sure , he 's loud , a little too honest , and just a flat-out hellraiser , but that 's what folks like to hear . That 's what has staying power.This disc , which features Bocephus ' biggest hits from the late 70's/early 80 's , is loaded with enough attitude to shake up even the biggest poser in Nashville . Things open up with `` Family Tradition , '' the song that is a legend unto itself in bars and honky-tonks across the USA . Next we have `` Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound , '' `` Women I 've Never Had , '' and seven more instantly recognizable hits . My personal favorites include `` Texas Women '' ( maybe 'cause I married one ) , and `` Dixie On My Mind . `` The biggest song on this disc has to be `` A Country Boy Can Survive . '' It 's the song that has spawned countless arguments over what would happen if the world fell apart tomorrow . It has empowered the good , bad , and ugly of the rural world . It makes city boys quiver in their metrosexual underpants . In short , it is one of the most popular songs ever put out there . It 's influence is still felt today in acts like Montgomery Gentry and even Kid Rock.In closing , buy this disc if you want real rebel country . Folks who like music by artists like Waylon Jennings will probably like this . Also , youngsters who enjoy Kid Rock need to check this out since without Hank , Kid Rock might have turned out to be another Vanilla Ice.Give Bocephus his due , he 's an integral part of the Country/Southern rock genre .	1
Hank Williams , Jr. 's Greatest Hits ( 1982 ) is the one album no fan of `` Bocephus '' should be without . This is the best music from Hank 's glory days in the late 1970s and early 1980s.The album has been certified quintuple platinum , and one can only imagine how many times Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound has been played on juke boxes in the bars of America ( I 've contributed to that number a few times myself ) . Getting drunk is a major theme here , and Hank mentions Jim Beam , the Kentucky bourbon , in about half of the songs.His dad , Hank Williams , Sr. , is mentioned quite a bit here , too . Stepping out from beneath his dad 's huge shadow had been something of an obsession for Hank , Jr. for most of his life . He was only three when his famous father died in the back seat of a Cadillac on the way to a New Year 's Day show in 1953 . After being taught to play guitar by Johnny Cash and piano by Jerry Lee Lewis , his mother ( Audrey Williams ) took him on the road to sing his dad 's songs . After a near fatal fall from the side of a Montana mountain while climbing in 1975 , and two years of recovery time , he and friend/mentor Waylon Jennings produced an album of Hank . Jr. 's songs called The New South . Done his own way , the album was a real turning point for Hank.Hank Williams , Jr. 's Greatest Hits includes one of his dad 's songs , Kaw-Liga , and Hank , Jr. gives it the full-on southern-rock treatment.Waylon sings backing vocals on Texas Women , Hank 's celebration of the Lone-Star beauties . A Country Boy Can Survive is a 4-wheelin'/huntin'and fishin'/outdoors partyin ' anthem for country boys and girls everywhere.Old Habits is a slow sad song about being left behind , and Dixie On My Mind is a southern-rocker about being stuck in The Big Apple and wanting to get back home.Women I 've Never Had is a Dixieland music celebration of all things Hank , and All My Rowdy Friends ( Have Settled Down ) is a famous-friends-name-dropping lament of the `` no-one-left-to-party-with-blues '' . The autobiographical Family Tradition is Hank Williams , Jr. 's signature song.So do n't ask me , Hank , why do you drink ? Why do you roll smoke ? Why must you live out the songs that you wrote ? Stop and think it overTry and put yourself in my unique positionIf I get stoned and sing all night longIt 's a Family Tradition !	1
this is perhaps some of his best work . I have enjoyed the evolving styles that Jr. has continued to develop throughout his musical career .	1
` Joan Baez Vol . 1 and Vol . 2 ' are incredibly evocative of a particular time and Zeitgeist in American popular music . Listening to them now , it is humbling to think that it has been over forty years since I first bought these Vanguard albums which , according to a ` Time ' magazine article of the time , turned the very small folkie recording company into a pretty important recording company , just in time to be in on the 1960 's music explosion . The buzz at the same time was that in spite of her success , Vanguard could not convince Baez to do more than one album a year . She and the folk music scene in the early sixties were still a major topic of conversation in sophisticated circles . One of the most prescient statements I ever heard was from my German professor 's opinion , expressed in the Fall of 1963 that the American folk music interest would not survive the arrival of The Beatles . In most ways , I think he was very , very right in that Baez ' versions of old English ballads and material from Folkways did not survive the British invasion . Instead , this musical revolution plus the target rich landscape of the mid 1960s spawned a great generation built on the legacy of Woody Guthrie instead of ` Childe 's Ballads . This was lead by Bob Dylan , Phil Ochs ( the much missed Phil Ochs ) , Tom Paxton , Richard Farina and many more . Ms. Baez jumped on this bandwagon , primarily as a consort to Mr. Dylan , but not until she left us with these really remarkable renditions of historical music.Contrary to what you may believe from the title , these two albums were first published about a year apart , with titles even more modest that Ms. Baez ' contemporary , Barbara Streisand . As I am not an expert on old English folk music , my best comparisons for Ms. Baez performances are , in fact Ms. Streisand on the one hand and the English Jacqui McShee ( female vocalist for The Pentangle and The John Renbourn group ) on the other . While Ms. McShee does a great job when she does the same material , I think Miss Joan sets the standard with her crystal clear , vibrato free voice . Baez also does better on this material than her principle competitor ( on Elektra ) , Judy Collins . On the other hand , when I compare Joan to Barbra , I feel there is just something missing in Joanie 's interpretation . Aside from having a great set of pipes , this , of course , is one of Streisand 's strong points as she gives dramatically different takes on some old chestnuts such as ` Happy Days are Here Again ' . And yet , Ms. Baez justly famous crystal clear voice gives performances of these songs you will find nowhere else.It is highly unlikely that the contemporary music audience will again support an act doing this material . And , I do n't think it 's because of a ` been there , done that ' reaction . So , dig into these old albums with both arms and enjoy them , for they are both great and an important part of popular music history .	1
I do n't suppose there are too many folk enthusiasts out there who are also audiophiles - besides myself , of course ! - but this CD is a godsend to both camps . It 's been too long since Baez 's much-lauded & quot ; achingly pure soprano & quot ; sounded this good.The songs themselves need no introduction . This is as traditional as traditional music gets , and Baez gives it a very traditional treatment , accompanying her singing only with a guitar or banjo , or not at all . If this spare production does n't suggest itself for digital remastering , the results are stunning all the same . Every note of the fast and intricate guitar fill-in on & quot ; Lonesome Road & quot ; and the banjo solo on & quot ; Pal of Mine , & quot ; among others , rings with a clarity that was n't technologically feasible when this album was originally released in 1961 and which was n't attempted on any previous reissue . Baez 's vocal performances , if possible , sound even better as well . The three & quot ; bonus & quot ; tracks , while unnecessary given the improved quality of the more familiar songs , are nonetheless welcome . The gorgeous & quot ; I Once Loved a Boy & quot ; is a particularly pleasant surprise , but all three fit in well alongside the bulk of the album - an unusual case of bonus tracks improving a familiar album rather than hindering it.Even if you think you know these songs by heart , this collection is essential to any fan of '60s folk music in its purest form . Even vinyl-purists owe it to themselves to hear this .	1
Ms. Baez has a pure , crystalline voice that is an instrument unto itself . You will know what I mean when you hear her sing `` Waggoner 's Lad '' without accompaniment . This is quickly followed up by some achingly beautiful folk songs , such as `` The Trees They Do Grow High '' , `` The Lily of the West '' , and `` Silkie '' . Wham Bam ... before you know it , you are hooked ! This extraordinary CD originally ended with `` Plaisir D'Amour '' , which is a beautiful love song and , sung by Ms. Baez , one that will not be easily forgotten . This released , which has remastered the original recording , now has three additional bonus tracks that are pleasant additions to an already marvelous musical experience . This is simply a wonderful CD , and if you are not already a fan of Ms. Baez , it will quickly make you into one . She is , undoubtedly , a national treasure .	1
And just as essential . I believe that Joan 's first three albums were her most astoundingly successful of her entire career and many of the songs she sang on this album were sung by others as well , Peter , Paul , Mary , Mary Hopkin ... to name a few . Highly recommended .	1
Listening to `` In Concert '' today , I am struck by Joan Baez 's keen ability to interpret these beautiful folk songs . She truly was in her element . More than that `` achingly pure soprano , '' she was able to convey the drama , the pathos , and the sheer longing of the lyrics . Just listening to her performance of `` Matty Groves , '' I can get so drawn in to the song that I can visualize the proceedings . She was also a very accomplished and talented guitar player . Joan Baez had a tremendous impact on American popular music and you can hear why in this recording .	1
This is a live concert recording , so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowds . It is quintessential early Joan Baez , simply strumming her guitar and singing folk songs that she loves . It was recorded at various concerts during her tours in August 1962 and October/November 1963.Her clear , sweet soprano is exquisite , and her choice of these thirteen folk songs should satisfy the most ardent purists . Truly , hers is the voice of an angel . For those of us who grew up with the music of Joan Baez , this recording is a glorious trip down memory lane.The quality of this cd is what one may expect from such an early , live recording , as it suffers from an occasional lack of clarity and from a slight variance in volume from song to song . Still , this is a cd that all devoted fans of Ms. Baez will want to include in their collection , if only for her wistful rendition of `` What Have They Done To the Rain '' .	1
Joan Baez ' third album `` In Concert Part One '' remains the quintessential album of the 1960s folk revival and stands on its own as a remarkably beautiful piece of music . Although recorded in the 1960s , its atmosphere is surprisingly dark and haunting throughout and satnds up very well to almost a half-century of time.Baez ' beautiful voice was at no point so intense or powerful as it was on `` In Concert Part One '' . On some songs , such as `` Gospel Ship '' and `` Kumbaya '' , she is truly tearful yet sings with a beauty so genuine it will live in your mind forever after one or two listens . Although her version of `` Matty Groves '' does not quite match the astonishing rendition fromLiege and Lief , it still tells a brutal tale . Malvina Reynolds ' `` What Have They Done to the Rain '' , on the other hand , was Baez ' first move into the realm of the protest song yet is remarkably touching and intimate with its simple yet powerful metaphor of the grass dying from poisoned rainwater.The dark , despairing imagery is blackest on `` House Carpenter 's Daughter '' , `` Geordie '' and `` Copper Kettle '' , which are further proof of the amazingly touching yet beautiful imagery of traditional folk that proved the richest of veins for such artists as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span during the 1970s.All Joan Baez albums up to the oft-misunderstoodBaptismare worth owning , but there is little doubt `` In Concert Part One '' is the finest hour of her career . Anyone interested in traditional folk song should own this album .	1
I love hearing Joan in concert-what a voice ! Really great songs sung here-and unlike modern day live albums-there isnt a lot of repeats so you 're not buying Joan Baez Vol . 1 or Vol . 2 again-just live-not like that at all !	1
Oh this is so beautiful - the songs , the respectful audience and her pristine evocative voice ! There 's an almost gospel-like quality in the songs Kumbaya , Gospel Ship and the eery Lady Mary , while the Portuguese song At & eacute ; Amanha is an uptempo , singalong ditty and Pretty Boy Floyd soars above the clouds . This is pure poetry , infused with a spirit of transcendence . A very sensitive and moving listening experience .	1
Time was , when this document of a 1962 Baez concert was released , that a musician could go on stage , armed with only a guitar and voice , sing songs that required listening and involvement by the audience -- and be successful . While that time may seem long ago and far away now , this first volume of & quot ; Joan Baez in Concert & quot ; proves that once upon a time , such things were possible.One thing you might notice as soon as you listen to the release : there are no annoying hoots , hollers , yells , whistles , etc. , etc. , as Baez sings , or as she quietly prepares to play . One thing you will most certainly notice is the incredible quality of Baez 's voice -- it was one of popular music 's great instruments , producing bell-like tones of absolute purity . And finally , you will notice the quality of the material . Baez 's love of songs that extend back in America 's and the world 's history is evident in her interpretations of much-sung tunes such as & quot ; Black Is the Color & quot ; and & quot ; Babe I 'm Gon na Leave You. & quot ; Lest you think you are buying a hoary disc filled with dated protest songs , be assured that & quot ; In Concert & quot ; contains very little overtly political material . In fact , the only pure protest song , the excellent & quot ; What Have They Done to the Rain & quot ; is as much poetry as protest . And another of the disc 's high points , the moonshine tune & quot ; Copper Kettle , & quot ; leavens the performance with a dose of good humor.This is music for quiet , reflective moments , a commodity in short supply today .	1
`` Gospel Ship '' is just a brief , traditional hymn , but it was the first Baez performance I ever heard and led me to become a fan . This collection has that one , and a nice mixture of the traditional folk songs which helped her get started near Harvard in the late 1950 's , and a few more contemporary pieces . I have been quite disappointed in this artist 's efforts over the past decade ... but my , oh my , few folkies ever had a better FIRST decade .	1
Joan Baez/ In Concert part 2 : Where Part 1 had Joan doing an excellent job on the traditional Folk catalog , in Part 2 she introduces us to some obscure little songwriter going by the name of Bob Dylan . In this album she does another excellent job on the traditional cuts but nobody sings a Dylan Song better than Joan Baez and here we have her singing `` Do n't Think Twice '' and `` With God on our Side '' . This is a great CD . Highly Recommended .	1
This cd is quintessential early Joan Baez , simply strumming her guitar and singing folk songs that she loves . All but one of the tracks was recorded at various concerts during her tours in August 1962 and October/November 1963 . The sole exception is & quot ; We Shall Overcome & quot ; , which was recorded at Miles College , in Birmingham , Alabama.This cd is even better than Joan Baez In Concert Part 1 . The selection of songs is better , as it contains more traditional folk songs , a fact that purists may wish to note . These songs serve to showcase her sweet , clear soprano to perfection . Moreover , her affection for this repertoire is evident in the feeling she evokes with her exquisite singing of these songs . This is particularly notable when she sings & quot ; Once I Had a Sweetheart & quot ; , & quot ; Jackaroe & quot ; , and & quot ; Queen of Hearts & quot ; .Ms . Baez also sings two songs in Portuguese , & quot ; Manha De Carnaval/Te Ador & quot ; , one of the most beautiful and haunting songs on this cd , as well as the traditional & quot ; Nu Bello Cardillo & quot ; . She also gives her own rousing interpretation to a perennial country favorite , & quot ; Long Black Veil & quot ; .The cd also contains two Bob Dylan songs , the popular & quot ; Do n't Think Twice , It 's Alright & quot ; , as well as & quot ; With God on Our Side & quot ; . The latter track , one of Dylan 's best songs , is done ample justice by the moving interpretation by Ms. Baez . It is one of my favorites tracks on this cd.This is a live concert recording , so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowds , as well as some crowd interaction and participation . The audience joins Joan Baez in singing & quot ; We Shall Overcome & quot ; .	1
Joan 's voice couldnt fail during this period and this album contains many famous songs , Once i had a sweetheart , do n't think twice its alright , etc . I believe Marianne Faithfull was very inspired by this album at the time . A must have !	1
At the start of her career Joan Baez 's pure , soulful voice was the signature of the early 60 's folk movement ; it is perhaps best displayed on this album and on Vol . 1 of the same . There is a special magic in her voice , her guitar and the response of the appreciative audience . The Portuguese song on this album , Nu Bello Cardillo , is touching but not as memorable as Ate Amanha on the first volume , while there 's a lovely tremulous quality to her voice in the Dylan song With God On Our Side . My favorites on this second volume include the sorrowful tale of The Long Black Veil and the traditionals Hush Little Baby and Battle Hymn Of The Republic - the audience participation on the Hymn is very poignant and moving , and turns into a rousing spiritual experience . I personally prefer the first volume since more of those songs have personal meaning to me , but this folk classic is also an enduring treasure .	1
My theory is that the great young performers burst onto the scene with their pentup perceptions of the world gathered in their formative years that explode in their earlier works.Then their styles mature , settle down and sometimes grow or not.Often their best work IS their first ones.This phenomena exists in the career of Joan Baez as much as anyone.When I was going to school ( UC Berkeley ) in the early 60s two women I was close to played the guitar and were inspired by Joan Baez , who I had never heard of before.It must have been common among a certain set of young women who idolized Joan , who was n't much older than they.There are 5 cds one can consider to sample this period.There is one called Early Joan Baez , a 2 cd set . This has all the songs from her first four albums , two of which are quite obscure.These were followed by two concert cds containing many of the same songs , of which this is the best.Both concert cds have some of the same songs.This one is the expanded version of the original vinyl . `` Chrystaline '' is the word often used to best describe her voice , especially at this early age.She was influenced by the folk scene of course , particularly by Pete Seeger , and incorporated Scottish and English ballads as well as American folksongs from Appalachia and elsewhere.I recall 40 years ago a friend and his wife telling me they cry when they hear these songs.After all these years , in which I have n't listened to these songs much , they retain their power.Three Dylan songs appear on this concert album.The next album is Farewell Angelina , which I believe has 5.Dylan 's original liner notes appear as a long poem.In Whitmanesque fashion but more obliquely he conveys the effect Joan had on him , he with the gruff voice and representing nearly the opposite of her sensibilities in many ways.He wonders how truth can come out of such purity . He had assumed truth comes out of only roughness and ugliness.Though they were romantically enmeshed , the interplay between their musical personae was complex - a dance of opposites but sharing a deep sympathy for the human condition .	1
This bluegrass homage to Bob Dylan is surprisingly lively and fresh and ( oddly enough ) one of O'Brien 's best , most straightforwardly bluegrass-y solo albums . Scott Nygaard , Jerry Douglas and others pitch in on this good-natured album , spearheaded by the longtime Hot Rize mandolinist , who has since gone on into more high-concept blue/newgrass terrain . Here , O'Brien connects with Dylan 's original old-timey influences , straightening out some of the kooky kinks Dylan had put into folk music , back in his 'Sixties heyday , and transforming classic tunes such as & quot ; Maggie 's Farm & quot ; and & quot ; Tombstone Blues & quot ; into straightforward , galloping bluegrass breakdowns . Nice to hear this music coming full circle back to its roots !	1
No one ever pretended Bob Dylan had a pretty voice , but he did do definitive versions of his songs . So why should we pay money to hear a bluegrass artist do covers that sound markedly different from Dylan 's originals ? Because the real magic of Bob Dylan 's music is that it is so malleable . Every important song he wrote has more than one meaning , more than one interpretation , and his body of work has been a gold mine for intellectual musicians looking for a strong voice to adopt.Mercifully , Tim O'Brien avoided the best-known Dylan tunes like Blowin ' in the Wind or Mr. Tambourine Man . This is n't just a greatest hits retrospective ; it 's a cohesive artistic statement , like Blood on the Tracks or John Wesley Harding . One could imagine Dylan himself running Tombstone Blues up against Farewell Angelina , mustering little-known pieces like Oxford Town to keep the listener 's attention through the middle portion , and crowning the sequence with Forever Young and Lay Down Your Weary Tune.Yet for this artistic integrity and loftiness , it 's still an album you can listen to more than once . The bouncy upbeat tunes on most of the tracks carry you along easily , and even when the pace slows on songs like Wicked Messenger or Masters of War , the flawless ensemble playing and clear vocals make you want to continue listening.This piece is a worthy addition to the body of work of Tim O'Brien , but it 's also a wonderful statement for Bob Dylan . And it 's a highly pleasing , satisfying addition to the CD collection of any fan of either artist .	1
The world worships the ground Bob Dylan walks on . Gee , what 's wrong with me ? I do n't ! But I 've tried . My trials have led me to Tim O'Brien , who has interpreted Bob 's songs through bluegrass . I 'm not working for Bobby 's farm no more ... but I might be working for Tim .	1
The purchase of this CD , I unashamedly confess , came from my Dylan curiosity . Having had 'Lo & Behold ' from McGuinness/Flint/Coulson & Dean devote an entire albumn to some of Bob 's less well known 60s material , what could a bluegrass boy come up with over similar terrain ? Well , nothing as bluesy as the aforementioned , successful translations.But the answer is absolutely thrilling . I never tire of O'Brien 's treatment of these songs , 'Farewell Angelina ' , the rap version of 'Subterranean Homesick blues ' , the whacky , 'Man Gave Name To All The Animals ' , and a definitive version of , 'Forever Young ' . The whole CD is an infectious pleasure . He mentions the possibility of taking a second bite at Dylan 's catalogue & I hope the response to this effort encourages that . Subsequently , I followed his musical course back to Ireland , on 'The Crossing ' , which is every bit the equal of 'Red On Blonde ' ; a superlative set of original , traditional , and borrowed material . Joining him on this course , amongst a host of legendary folk musicians , was Paul Brady . Not an Irish blood relative , but a musical one to be sure . It struck me what accord O'Brien 's sweet tenor has with the Brady I first heard in the late 70s before he shifted from singing , pretty much , traditional or traditionally-inspired songs . What company !	1
This album was NOT Tim O'Brien 's attempt to make Dylan 's music more pallatable ( which seems to be what some reviewers are saying ) , but rather & quot ; to find a batch of Dylan tunes that could be given an old-time string band treatment & quot ; as he explains in his liner notes.A couple nights ago I saw O'Brien perform at a bluegrass festival in Lincoln . While his set was dominated by material from his two recent Celtic-influenced albums ( 1999 's The Crossing and 2001 's Two Journeys ) , he performed two songs from Red on Blonde : & quot ; Senor ( Tales of Yankee Power ) & quot ; and & quot ; Subturranean Homesick Blues , & quot ; the latter which he introduced as a kind of bluegrass rap complete with Mark Shatz 's ham bone body percussion . [ I also used the opportunity to get an autographed copy of this album . ] Are O'Brien 's treatments of these songs an improvement upon the originals ? I do n't think that was his intent -- and in the end does it really matter ? O'Brien says in his liner notes , & quot ; It 's one more chance to survey Dylan 's output and hopefully enjoy it in a new way. & quot ; If you enjoy old-time music with lots of mandolin , fiddle and banjo , you 'll enjoy this heartfelt offering . O'Brien also hints at a & quot ; Volume Two & quot ; -- I ca n't wait . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
When I bring up Jayo to a lot of my friends , they asked me `` Damn , what happened to him ? '' With the rapper from San Diego , signing a deal with Def Jam , he was able to release his debut album `` Take A Ride '' . We all know how Def Jam treats west coast artists , so I 'm pretty sure that there was n't much behind this album . To me , I find Jayo to be a rapper who talks about what he has been through . Most of his songs are about how he has gotten into jail and ran the streets of San Diego , all backed by some great west coast production that was popular around the time the west coast hit it 's peak in 1994/'95.Most of these tracks Jayo rarely switches up his subject matter , so expect a lot of gangsta topics on the majority of the tracks . `` The Loc Is On His Own '' & `` I'ma Keep Bangin ' '' are all dedicated to his lifestyle that he lives . The production on the latter song will keep you interested . `` Sherm Stick '' is the tune to the old R & B ; song `` Come And Go With Me '' , as Jayo rhymes about getting smoked out . `` Brothas & Sistas '' ( or track # 7 ) was one of the singles for this album and rides a heavy basslines and synths thats cool . `` Ca n't Keep A Gee Down '' is another banging song to ride to . Further on the album , the short song `` Do n't Call Me A ***** '' is dope . `` They Got Me On Medication '' is a standout in my opinion . `` Funk 2 Da Head '' is my favorite track , as Jayo flows perfectly with the dope beat . `` Take A Ride '' sounds decent , but not a standout . A couple of filler tracks in the middle of the album , like `` ***** I 'm Through '' , but that does n't make the album bad.Overall , excellent album from Jayo . His rhyme style is great in my opinion . This album has that southern Cali vibe that many people who are fans of gangsta rap would appriciate . The next albumWhatcha Gon na Do ? would follow up three years later ( which is a little more commercial , but great ) , and is worth picking up as well .

Jayo Felony 's 1995 debut album is a west coast classic , one of the most overlooked masterpieces of g-funk and a personal favorite of my collectoin . Unfortunately , this album also displayed Def Jam 's complete ineptitude to promote west coast artists ( just ask Richie Rich , Twinz , The Dove Shack , WC , South Central Cartel , or even Warren G ) . What 's so great about this album is that Jayo is much more insightful than the average g-funker . He 's a true lyricist , but his subject matter really sets him apart from his west coast contemporaries . He has beef with the legal and prison system , and on many tracks he vents out his frustration with the law and incarceration . His tales of street crime , penitentiary life , and loneliness are really engaging and interesting , as a rapper Jayo constantly demands and maintains your attention . His flow really helps this too , he 's got a lazy and conversational delivery that makes his raps feel more personal . He switches this up sometimes , almost singing a few hooks . But the production is also spectacular . It 's so focused , especially because there 's not a single guest verse or appearance on the whole album . The music has deep bass , but the instrumentals are a little more stripped down than most of the g-funk coming out at this time . It 's not so woozy and computerized either , it has a great feel and is often upbeat and very catchy . The dark , gloomy funk enhances Jayo 's portrayal of a grim world where penitentiary stays are punctuated by gang violence and drug abuse . This album has absolutely no weak tracks , the consistency is something rare in this genre , and that 's what makes `` Take a Ride '' such a classic . Even the skits are relevant and entertaining . While this album is still available ( unlike his other two ) , I consider this a must have , and this is an awesome , underappreciated classic.Following the intro , the first song is `` The Loc Is on His Own , '' a nice cut . This song is slow and funky , and the lyrics are some of the best . Jayo recounts the difficulties with contacting and connecting with his friends and family following incarceration , it 's conscious and an interesting take . He also drops some raw philosophy on the jail system . `` I'ma Keep Bangin ' '' is faster and bouncier , the production is very nice and Jayo holds your attention with his rough profiles of urban life . `` Homicide '' is pretty laidback , Jayo shows true lyrical talent on this track . The nice `` Love Boat '' skit serves as an intro to this album 's classic single , `` Sherm Stick . '' Over a sunny , head-nodding beat , Jayo laces a smoking anthem with a great hook and verses . I also really like `` N ... s and B ... s , '' another excellently produced track , and `` Ca n't Keep a Gee Down '' continues the roll of funky , upbeat tracks with intense lyricism . My favorite beat here is found on `` B ... I 'm Through , '' which musically is the finest track . The woozy , bumping beat has awesome instrumentals and a great hook as well . `` Penitentiary Bound '' is awesome . On this song , Jayo tells the story of a parole violation that led to incarceration , and he explores injustices in the system . The short yet inspiring `` Do n't Call Me N ... '' is a real highlight , and my favorite song comes next , `` They Got Me On Medication . '' Jayo 's delivery on this song is totally on point , and the production is excellent . He tells stories about hood life and insanity with the law , leading to the awesome hook . `` Funk 2 da Head '' is appealing but not outstanding , and the album finishes with the title track , an incredibly catchy and upbeat west coast anthem.It 's embarrassing that an album so great both lyrically and musically could have gone so under the radar , but the combination of lack of promotion and a flood of g-funk albums in '95 made this one of the year 's slept-on gems , just like BG Knocc Out & Dresta'sReal Brothasand Twinz'Conversation . Jayo is one of those rappers that seems to have been on the verge of stardom at one point , but for whatever reason it never really happened for him . Regardless , `` Take a Ride '' is the album that was the first to put San Diego on anybody 's hip hop radar . Fans of west coast rap will love this , and anybody can appreciate the emotional lyrics and funky beats .	1
I do n't know what to make of Def Jam signing dope west coast acts and then pretty much hanging them out to dry . If you look at the Def Jam catalog during the mid-nineties , you 'll find potent albums from the likes of Warren G , South Central Cartel , Dove Shack , Jayo Felony , and quite a few others . I 'm not saying these artists are the best the west have to offer , but they were very promising prospects at the time . Think about the promotion these artists got -- or did n't get . It 's not a coincidence that the Cali artists got no shine on Def Jam or Def Jam West . Anyway , this album is tight . Smoothed out , funky beats ... passionate lyrics that speak on bangin ' , slangin ' , & maintainin ' ... I mean , you ca n't help but feel Jayo when he speaks . Even the interludes/skits have a place on this LP ( unlike a lot of albums that come out nowadays with highly unnecessary skits ) . If you 're expecting a lot of that rapid fire/choppy flow stuff that he does today , you may want to look for later releases -- this is basically just Jay puttin ' it down gangsta style.As far as flaws , there are n't many . There are a few joints that I did n't particularly feel , but I would n't necessarily call them bad songs -- `` Homicide '' , `` They Got Me on Medication '' , and `` B**ch I 'm Through '' are the songs that I speak of.Def Jam 's decision to totally ignore albums from their west coast signees should be viewed as nothing less than their attempt to disembowel the west when they were in a position to remove the east coast from their top spot . I ca n't think of any other reason for them to ignore great albums like this one and the other bangers that I mentioned earlier . The beats are tight and Jayo has a flow unlike most that you will find out there . There simply should 've been more done on Def Jam 's part . Take A Ride is a vintage mid 90 's rap album that should be looked into . I recommend adding this album to your collection if you can find it.Standout Tracks : Ca n't Keep a Gee Down , Do n't Call Me Ni**a , Sherm Stick , I'ma Keep Bangin ' , Ni**as and Bi***es , Penitentiary Bound , and The Loc Is on His Own	1
Jayo felony 's debut album , Take a Ride slams and satisfies from start to finish . He is raw and rugged throughout . The beats here are hard core G-Funk , with vicious and rapid fiery flows . Songs like `` I'mma Keep Bangin , '' `` They Got Me On Medication , '' `` The Loc is On His Own , '' show cases his hard , but unique persona . He put San Diego on the map , and shows no mercy !	1
This album is a str8 Classic , the three best traccs are Homicide ! ! ! , Bitch I 'm Through ! ! ! , & Penitentiary Bound ! ! ! .One of the Classics from the west , you can play this album from start to finish from The Loc Is On His Own 2 Take A Ride .	1
This dudes flow and lyrical prowess is truly amazing . He reminds me a bit of Rakim.The pro-black , Nation of Islam type lyrics are not enough to bother me either . His anti-white lyrics are overshadowed by his gift on the mic and the hard-hitting , funky as hell beats behind him.Cop this CD if you are into politically conscience , rapid fire flow lyrics , with some amazing beats . This is one of the hottest CDs that you 've probably never heard .	1
How did I find out about Paris ? I was up north and I went to FYE and saw his second album ( Sleeping With The Enemy ) staring me in the face . I picked it up , listened to it , and fell in love with the whole album . I bought the rest of his albums from Amazon and lets just saw I dont regret buying them at all . If you love political hip hop then you must support Paris . Listen to this album and you 'll see why he was intentionally kept away from us . Standout Tracks : SCARFACE GROOVE , THIS IS A TEST , PANTHER POWER , BREAK THE GRIP OF SHAME , WARNING , EBONY ( this color called ebony ) , BRUTAL ( somewhat sounds like LL in the second half of this track ) , THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT , THE HATE THAT HATE MADE , MELLOW MADNESS ( on a jazz tip ) , I CALL HIM MAD ( DJ Mad Mike was on fire ! ! ! ) , ESCAPE FROM BABYLON and WRETCHED . Filler : NONE ! Bottom Line : Paris gives you what you want from this excellent debut . Political and social commentary just the way you true lovers of hip hop like it . Make this album a definite part of your collection .	1
At a time when Almost all West Coast Rap was about gang-banging , cars , etc . Paris took it to another level . His `` Panther Power '' showed that the ideology of the Black Panther Party was far from dead in Oakland . Paris , Public Enemy , Boogie Down Productions , and X-Clan represented the level of Black consciousness in Hip-Hop in the Late 1980 's and Early 1990 's . This is a underrated album .	1
Just read this morning that Paris was shot and killed . Came here to check out the artist , because I 'd never heard of him . What a shame ; this is a must have for the collection .	1
Paris is one of the many hip-hip artist from the early 1990 's that didnt get alot of airplay , and mainly sold records on word of mouth . Let me tell you that even though Paris 's other releases are n't as strong as this , `` The Devil Made me Do It '' has flavor that most hip-hop has lost today , and that is dealing with racial tensions , political issues , and Black History ( ex..Black Panthers ) The beats are also mind blowing , and this album is very Hard for the time that it was released . Even though the album is somewhat dated , it still is a treasure , and I hope people that are infactuated with todays hip-hop could take a few steps back and pick up an album of such importance . This CD belongs in EVERYONES collection . Its that good ! ( i only gave if 4 stars because even though it is a classic , there are some poor filler tunes here ) ENJOY	1
After getting his major debut in the group The Madd Circle , with west coast rapper , WC , Coolio came out with his solo debut It Takes A Thief back in 1994 . His debut was able to blend in with the popular west coast rap scene around that time . Here Coolio takes you through a tale of stories before he became a recording artist . The album 's concept is interesting , but at the same time , gets kind of repetitive . But the overall product is highly enjoyable for one fan to like.With the lead single `` Fantastic Voyage '' , Coolio creates a track for one to bounce to . `` County Line '' , and `` Mama I 'm In Love With A Gangsta '' , he rhymes about being broke and being locked away for some time . The latter track features up and coming rapper Leshaun ( you might recognize her from LL Cool J 's `` Doin ' It '' ) who drops an okay verse . Further down the album are tracks like `` Can-O-Corn '' , and `` Sticky Fingers '' where he reminisces over times he used to shoplift to get by in life . The album 's title track is one of the biggest highlights on the album as Coolio tells stories on how he used to rob people for their goods . `` N Da Closet '' is another standout , as he explains about the effects of his drug habit . The end of the album `` I Remember '' is another great track that features J-Ro from the Alkaholiks , and Billy Boy.Given that this is an excellent album , Coolio missteps on such songs like `` Ghetto Cartoon '' , and `` On My Way To Harlem '' . Both tracks are one of the few that failed to standout in my opinion.Overall Coolio 's debut was a great album . Coolio sounds very motivated and hungry as he strives to keep his lyrical content above the average . I enjoyed the content that he placed here on this album , and it will keep a listener interested . Given that this is out of print , and only sells for a penny , this is one purchase I would recommend , especially those who are new to Coolio and are on the fence about his material .

It 's the Hip hop 's hair doo master Coolio on a debut album , my locc Coolio went from B.G . to Locc'sta from Compton , CA aka the CPT . Like I said on my review from Gangsta 's Paradice , Coolio be blowin ' on some Indo or some other type of funky gangee , because Coolio was the locc who released the ultimate house party groove Fantastic Voyage by far Coolio 's dopest hit , County Line is a far out Dope song by my locc , Ghetto Cartoon is a funny cartoonished song with funny lyrics , and my locc has another good one called Ugly Bitches , what ! ? It 's a true song by my locc Coolio .	1
This album absolutely kicks the snot out of 95 % + of the music to come since . Picking highlights for this album is difficult but here 's a couple : Ghetto Cartoon : Coolio gives you a rather twisted urban fairy tale featuring all the WB and Disney characters , hilarious and deft.Gangsta 's Paradise : The title track to a major movie , and one of they very few rap songs that goes for 'haunting ' and achieves it.Mama , I 'm In Love Wit A Gangsta : Told half in telephone conversation and all in style.Just buy the album already .	1

Gangsta 's paradise ( the song ) still is one of my most played songs in my car . There are several other noteworthy songs too . With all the new rap CDs on the market now-a-days , sometimes it is just nice to kick back and listen to one of the classics .	1
Now , I 'm not a big Coolio fan . But I 've just always liked the song & quot ; Gangsta 's Paradise & quot ; . Even though that 's the initial reason I bought the album , there are many more good songs on it . I like the song & quot ; Ghetto Highlights & quot ; almost as much as the title track . & quot ; Sumpin New ( 1,2,3,4 ) & quot ; is a pretty catchy tune I used to hear at roller skate places a lot . Those are my 3 favorite songs , but I also like the songs & quot ; Kinda High , Kinda Drunk & quot ; and & quot ; Exercise Yo ' Game & quot ; . The only reason I took off a star is because since this is an edited album , there are a couple of songs that could be good that are edited so much , it takes away from the songs .	1
This cd is pretty tight but it got way overplayed . Gangsta 's Paradise , Too Hot , Exercise Yo ' Game , Smilin ' Bright As The Sun & Sumpin ' New are some tight songs but after hearin 'em on the radio all day everyday you start to not like them but I listened to this the other day and after not hearing it for a while I rembered how it was a good cd.CPT	1
I since download every song that was on this CD . Coolio puts it down right here by mixing R & B ; , funk , old-school and some gangsta like can make it sound of 2day 's West Coast gangsta rap leaders Dr. Dre , Snoop Dogg , MC Hammer , N.W.A. , Eazy-E , The D.O.C. , Warren G , Tone Loc , Young MC , 50 Cent , G-Unit , you name it.We definitely know the song he 's best known for which is `` Gangsta 's Paradise '' . I was only 10 or 11 when this came out before the controversy between the East Coast and West Coast rap feud they had goin ' on since I watch the Behind the Music interview on Biggie Smalls aka The Notorious B.I.G. , P. Diddy , etc.This is definitely goin in2 my collection alongside Dr. Dre 's The Chronic , 2Pac 's classic All Eyez on Me , The Notorious B.I.G . 's Ready to Die and Life After Death , Nas ' Illmatic , N.W.A . 's Straight Outta Compton , Twista 's Kamikaze , Big Pun 's Capital Punishment , Queen Latifah 's Black Reign , etc .	1
As a child , Coolio was a B.G . LocC from Compton , CA . Although Coolio ran with the Compton Loccs , Coolio had troubles fitting in with his school mates , and at the age of 17 Coolio got into the Crack-Cocaine game . Although Coolio may not of been as sucessful as Eazy-E , Ice Cube , Dr. Dre or Snoop Doggy Dogg , Coolio 's 1996 album Gangsta 's Paradice is a West Coast Highlight . Best hit defiently is the hit song Gangsta 's Paradice , though another song that should of been a hit is Cruisin ' . Sumpin ' New is another good hit by Coolio , and a good House Party song is Kinda High Kinda Drunk.Coolio 's best are 2 , *3 , 4 , *5 , 6 , *7 , *10 , 12 , 13 , 16 & 17 .	1
If there is a rap classic , Gangsta 's Paradise would be on the list . I gave this CD as a Christmas stocking stuffer . A young friend asked me about it and wondered where he could get CD . I found it on Amazon . It was a joy to see his face when he pulled it from his stocking . A song like Gangsta Paradise is timeless . The struggles are still there .	1
Coolio came out again in 1995 with the hit `` Gangsta 's Paradise '' on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack . He then released his second album taking the same name . This album has some special meaning for me . It was only the second rap album I bought ever . The album is a fun pop-mainstream-style album full of great production and beats , and some nice rhymes by Coolio . Beatwise , the album is full of that Cali G-Funk courtesy of `` Wino , '' Vic C , and many lesser-known producers , way too many to list here . `` Gangsta 's Paradise '' is obviously a hit , but there are many other classics here too . `` Is This Me '' is hella twangy feat . Rated R from Thug Life discussing the hold the streets take on people who get caught up in that life . Coolio shows some love and respect for the women on `` For My Sistas . '' `` Sumpin ' New '' is just a plain good time at the club over a bouncy P-Funk sampled type beat , as fun as `` Fantastic Voyage '' from 1994 . `` Get Up Get Down '' features longtime homie WC and homegirl Malika . The beat is smooth and swingin . `` The Revolution '' is hot with a bouncy lowrider beat dealing with social issues . `` Bright As The Sun '' is a track where the imagery brings up a helicopter ( ghetto bird ) has its bright lights searching for him over a woozy , twangy beat . I love `` Exercise Yo ' Game '' with Coolio trading spits with Kam , E-40 , and 40 Thevz , which has an oddball , but phat beat . I love the hooter and licqor joint `` Kinda High Kinda Drunk '' with another odd but tight beat . Coolio has some positive messages in many tracks . He has fun , but he also can bring up some serious , often sad , imagery on tracks like `` Geto Highlites '' which is basically what it is , runs like a news report in parts of the songs . The album brings back memories of growing up for me . I see many hating on the album for being too pop , but I disagree , it is a nice album regardless .	1
Thanx to this Musical Blockbuster , her voice is forever engraved in my mind , and what a Great Voice it is.It 's a Club/Dance album , and a well crafted Pop album at the same time . Songs here have Irresistible Melody Hooks , Beats , and Nice Synths ; Lyrics are sometimes a little simplistic being about Love , and a bit Repetitive.This album had quite a rotation on my CD player in mid 90 's and my repeat button was working some overitme on many tracks here ! So this album always takes me back to that time.This album was produced by Berman Brothers ( who produced Real McCoy , and She Moves ) . Most songs here were written by them and Amber MC Cremers.Songs range from Fast EuroDance songs with great Techno Beats , typical Berman Brothers stuff at that time . These are:1 . `` This is Your Night '' 2 . `` Move Your Body '' 8 . `` Hold My Body tight '' 9 . `` Can You Feel The Love '' 3 . `` Color Of Love '' 6 . `` Push It to the Limit '' The two remixes were nothing special though.Now there are also some really nice slower songs on this one , and these are very Soulful:4 . `` You are the one '' .5 . `` One More Night '' - a Beautiful slower song , for a slower dance.10 . `` Losing Myself In Your Love '' - written by Joel kipnis.12 . `` This is the Right Time '' - prduced by Junior VasquezAnd there are also some covers on this CD that are OK : '' Being with You '' '' Let It Rain '' Overall this is a Great , Melodic , and Soulful album that will pick up your spirits anytime . A Must-Have , if you like Commercial dance music ! Thank You .	1
This album is quite bouncy , fun , friendly and good . While I would n't call it & quot ; Techno-techno & quot ; it certainly is dance , which , as the catagorization would lead one to belive , will certainly get you dancing . Euro-pop rules and so does Amber , who is a quite a talented woman ! This album is : Reccomended !	1
Back in the mid to late '90s when I was still in college , I was a big fan of euro-pop music . One of my favorite euro-pop artists was Amber . I loved her first two albums . Her debut album `` This is Your Night '' was an album chockful of some of the catchiest pop songs I had ever heard . I especially loved the singles `` This is Your Night '' ( which was found all over various dance compilations at the time ) and `` Colour of `` Love '' . I especially loved the second single `` Colour of Love '' , probably because it did n't get as much as airplay as `` This is Your Night '' which quickly got overplayed . `` This is Your Night '' is n't completely flawless . Some of the songs were really silly lyrically like `` Move Your Body '' , `` Push It to the Limit '' , and `` Hold My Body Tight '' . If the silly , cheesy lyrics were n't enough , I was n't that big of the songs that had a more of an r & b influence like `` Move Your Body '' but then again I did like `` One More Night '' . My favorite song on the cd has to be `` Can You Feel the Love '' . I just love the synthesized beats and the melody of the song . It still remains as one of my favorite songs by Amber to this very day . Even though my taste in music has changed , I still enjoy listening to Amber from time to time to break the monotony .	1
If You like Amber and do not have this album you need to get it immediately . It is a great work out cd , which will have you pumped from beginning to end . Alot of the songs have the Title Traks beat and energy , in my opinion this Cd is better than the second she released and I like that one too .	1
Amber 's debut album was a clear example of how can a dance album could be consistent and provocative well done . Produced mainly by The Berman Brothers , `` This Is Your Night '' became a cherish house dance album for any club lover . The best track are the ones that falls in the cliche of topic song in club anthemic tracks like `` This Is Your Night '' the title track has become one of the representers of the 90 's dance music , almost available in any dance collection that it 's out there . It 's obvious what the hit was all about , the thing is that the song , worked , works , and will work , a great dance tune , `` Colour Of Love '' was a more pop in tune oriented , very cheesy , but still danceable , `` One More Night '' sad that the hit dance version it 's not available in the album , since it 's one of the best hits of Amber . The slower ballad soulful version it 's included here , not bad , but not good . Still the lyrcis own that magical message . `` Push It To The Limit '' it 's a euro-dance track repetitive but it just infatuates you , great tune . `` Being With You '' it 's another pop tune , average . `` This Is The Right Time '' Junior Vasquez put his hands on this , a great midtempo dance track , `` Let It Rain '' very nice slow jam , a very emotional one . Above all Amber debut album feature a moving dance club reacord , that would be remember as a move foward to Amber since she keep a consistent career in the dance club after this album , and is one of the most recognized voices in America 's joints .	1
( this album accually gets a 4.5 from me , but The Misfits are too good for me to give anything under a 5 ! ) Earth AD/Wolfsblood is awesome , but much different from anything that The Misfits have EVER done before . Many of these songs are extremely fast . Nothing else was as fast or brutal before this album , and nothing else is as fast or brutal today . But it 's very good . It contains some very superb Misfits songs , like Earth AD , Devilock , Death Comes Ripping , Green Hell , Mommy Can I Go Out And Kill Tonight ? , Demonomania , Bloodfeast , We Bite , and my personal favorite Die Die My Darling.If there 's any bad thing about this album , it 's these three songs : Wolfsblood , Queen Wasp , and Hellhound . They 're not bad songs at all , but they all sound exactly the same and IMO , they 're kinda boring . I do n't hate em , they 're just not favorites . They 're average.So , if you 're looking for a punk/metal album with an extreme amount of originality , go for this ! ( hell , buy all their albums ! ) It 's dark , creepy , brutal , and will leave you bleeding and in stitches and begging for more .	1
I ca n't stop listening to these songs ( especially 3,4,5,6,9 and 12 ) . Help me .	1
This album is fast hard core punk with catchy melodies . Different line-up from Walk Among Us . Of course Glenn is singin ' , Jerry Only is on bass , Doyle on guitar and Robo ( from Black Flag ) on drums.Highlight of the album is Die Die My Darling ( another song that was covered by Metallica ) .	1
Say what you will about & quot ; Static Age & quot ; or & quot ; Walk Among Us & quot ; ; & quot ; Earth A.D. & quot ; , the final album from the Danzig-era Misfits , is the quintessential punk/thrash album of it 's time . Featuring the best drumming of the Danzig-era Misfits ( let 's be honest , the drumming has always been kind of lackluster , but that 's besides the point ) , and a harder edge in terms of attitude and vocals ; & quot ; Earth A.D. & quot ; is nothing short of pure energetic ear candy from start to finish . Featuring classic tracks like & quot ; Green Hell & quot ; , & quot ; Die , Die My Darling & quot ; , and the title track ; plus fan favorites like & quot ; Devilock & quot ; , & quot ; Death Comes Ripping & quot ; , and & quot ; Mommy , Can I Go Out & amp ; Kill Tonight ? & quot ; ; & quot ; Earth A.D. & quot ; is not only a must have for any and every serious Misfits fan , but an excellent introduction for new fans to the band . Metallica 's covers of & quot ; Green Hell & quot ; and & quot ; Die , Die My Darling & quot ; are nothing compared to the originals .	1
Earth A.D. is probably the heaviest , most aggressive recording The Misfits have ever released . This CD features their famous song `` Die Die My Darling '' , as well as many other great songs . `` Wolf 's Blood '' is a twisted portrait of a man who is transforming into a werewolf . Danzig 's howls of pain and aggression are amazing , and the frantic guitars and drums in the song make it a favorite . `` Queen Wasp '' and `` Earth A.D. '' are very heavy songs , although those two tracks in particle do n't have great sound quality . Right after this album was released , thrash metal was unleashed in the world of Rock . Coincidence ? Perhaps , but this CD obviously had to have some influence on the artists of the category . Pick this one up today .	1
I went and bought this cd and I was not dissapointed with it at all . I heard very good things about it and I rushed out to get it as soon as I could . In my opinion , it is one of the greatest MISFITS cd 's ever made ! Every song on it is no less than perfect , such as , & quot ; Earth A.D. & quot ; , & quot ; Die die my darling & quot ; , & quot ; We bite & quot ; , & quot ; Wolfs blood & quot ; , & quot ; Blood feast & quot ; and many more ! If your a real die hard MISFITS fan like me than go out and get this cd . It is a classic in my book ! !	1
With this Misfits offering you can see where Glenn Danzig was heading , musically and lyrically . Actually you can look at it as his first solo album ( then again he likes to credit all albums he 's associated with as solo albums ) . No two Misfits albums sound alike , but this one is the most off-the-track they ever got ( excluding the new albums ) . It really does n't sound like the Misfits at all , but it does retain that catchiness we all love . The sound quality of this album is rotten ; It sounds like the recording equipment was located a block away from the band , and buried under the ground ( I originally heard this on cassette when I was 14 , imagine how much worse the sound quality was on that ! ! ) . This makes the lyrics completely undecipherable ( it helps if you have the box set which contains the lyrics ) , which gives you the unique opportunity to make up your own . `` Got A Potato ! ! Green Hell ! ! '' However , this album is good and should be added to your collection . Unfortunately it 's way too short ; After you start it up , do n't leave the room to grab your Cafe au lait and a bundt cake or you 'll miss it .	1
Before I purchased this album , I was a massive fan of both the Misfits and Slayer . When I had read that Slayer and other similar thrash metal bands were greatly influenced by this album , I knew I had to hear it . When I finally got it , I sat down and listened to it . I knew I was going to get something different . But this different ? The sound was way too murky , even so for an 80s punk album . It was fast without having what I felt were cool riffs that Slayer had . It just was n't as catchy as both of the Misfits ' `` Collections '' . I felt cheated , and did n't listen to it for a while . I decided a week later to give it another listen . I felt it was actually decent crossover punk , much better than it sounded originally . Still , I did n't think it was great . Than I listened to it again . It was angrier than the other Misfits stuff and much more serious . However , it was catchy . Great stuff to slamdance to . I listened to it again , and realized it was a great if different hardcore punk album . Definatly a must for fans , as it is the Misfit 's best studio album outside of `` Walk Amoung Us '' .	1
Brand X is the progressive jazz/rock fusion group that Phil Collins played drums for in the late 70 's during his breaks from Genesis . Although there 's no question about Phil 's awesome drumming with Genesis , Brand X allowed Phil to *really* cut loose on the drumkit , free-form style . In fact , Phil felt that he had so much freedom playing with Brand X , that he momentarily considered leaving Genesis . As Phil himself put it , & quot ; Genesis was the wife , and Brand X was the mistress , and I just wanted to take my clothes off and live a bit ! & quot ; However , Genesis started to loosen up musically around the late 70 's , toning down their art-rock leanings and going more towards the rock mainstream , which ultimately convinced Phil to stay with the wife and say goodbye to the mistress.But Phil did record four studio albums ( plus a live album ) with Brand X between 1976 and 1980 , and he also toured with the band in 1979 ( though Brand X would carry on , off and on , through 1997 ) . The group 's first album , & quot ; Unorthodox Behaviour , & quot ; is a stunning debut disc . Phil , guitarist John Goodsall , bassist Percy Jones , and keyboardist Robin Lumley have musical chemistry that 's simply explosive . & quot ; Nuclear Burn & quot ; is just as barnburning as it 's title suggests , & quot ; Euthanasia Waltz & quot ; is a sparkling laid-back jam , and & quot ; Born Ugly & quot ; is funky with a capital F. Also groovy are & quot ; Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Running On Three , & quot ; the title track is a steady , assured rocker , and the closing & quot ; Touch Wood & quot ; is a samba-flavored beauty . Goodsall delivers some fiery guitarwork , Jones is a monster on the bass , Lumley 's keyboard-playing is superb , and , of course , what needs to be said about Phil 's drumming -- -he 's fantastic . I wish more people knew about Phil 's work with this outstanding fusion band . Like I 've always said , Phil Collins is first and foremost a *drummer* , and if Genesis and Phil 's solo work ca n't convince his detractors of this , then his astonishing playing with Brand X most certainly can . Not only that , but Brand X -- -Goodsall , Jones , Lumley , and Collins -- -were simply an awesome band . & quot ; Unorthodox Behaviour & quot ; is a terrific debut album from one of music 's best-kept-secret groups . Definitely start your Brand X collection with this one !	1
The thing about Brand X , I mean besides it having caused me to take back all -- well , most , anyway -- of the nasty things I 've said about Phil Collins over the years , is that their virtuosity as players is not just self-serving masturbation . These guys ARE virtuosos , but they use their skills to make really awesome music which serves the listener . I bought a few Brand X records ( yes , records ... . on vinyl ) , decades ago and the music is on my iPod today . If standing the test of time is one measure of good music , then this is good indeed.And , let 's face it , for many like myself , this band turned the Phil Collins legacy from the lame , forgettable pop stuff he churned out like a placebo factory , to `` Holy crap ; this guy is a seriously talented player '' . `` Unorthodox Behaviour '' and `` Morrocan Roll '' are my favorites , though all of the Brand X releases are enjoyable .	1
I had this record back in the seventies and will be buying it again ! One : You will be astounded by what an excellent drummer Phil Collins is ! Two : Goodsall and the rest of the players on this record are astounding.Three : This will still sound fresh today ! Nothing cliche ' on this record.This Brand X is just plain good , supurbly executed Jazz/Rock/fusion ! To be honest this one is sooooo good , there is nothing else that Brand X ever did that even came close . Awesome Spin !	1
Brand X truly marked the spot on `` Unorthodox Behaviour '' , their first album . This group showed they could meld their unique style of intricate jazz with an over the top , baroquesque flavor of progressive rock , which , when these two genres meet head on , make for an interesting listen . After having already spent a few years with Genesis , Phil Collins most likely felt his drumming style within that particular group was lacking the type of creativity he demanded ( although you have to admit his drumming on the Gabriel-era Genesis albums is nothing short of spectacular , either ) . With Brand X , he could now show off his creativity in a unique style all his own , and it definitely shows in Collins ' first outing with the band . His fast-paced drum rolls , present in such tracks as `` Nuclear Burn '' and `` Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria '' are a real treat to the ears ( ear candy , if you will ) , and should n't be taken at `` face value '' , if you 'll pardon the expression . `` Born Ugly '' is anything but ( ugly ) , and has a rather charming and mysterious quality to it , nonetheless . Percy Jones 's bass playing is also mind-blowing . One listen to the CD 's title track , and you 'll see ( and hear ) what I mean . The title track features a unique and different side to Brand X , in that they can really funk out with great timing and precision . What 's more , guitarist John Goodsall brings some of his Average White Band influences to `` Unorthodox Behaviour '' as well , which adds yet another multi-dimensional side to this band . This AWB-influenced sound can be found in a fair number of the tracks here , including `` Nuclear Burn '' and `` Born Ugly '' . Robin Lumley 's keyboard and piano playing carries with it such depth and magical stardust wizardry , and is the perfect crowning touch to Collins ' , Goodsall 's and Jones 's `` unorthodox '' jams - the cherry on top of the tasty , proverbial sundae , if you will . Phil Collins ' exquisite drumming intricacies , as featured on `` UB '' , can also be felt on his next two releases with Genesis : `` A Trick Of The Tail '' and `` Wind And Wuthering '' - moreso on the former than the latter ( although `` UB '' came out immediately after `` ATTOT '' , but `` UB '' was recorded just before `` ... Trick ... `` , as the dates in both the `` UB '' and ( UK edition ) `` ATTOT '' CD booklets will attest to that fact ) . Brand X 's next effort , `` Moroccan Roll '' , would prove to be a weaker effort compared to `` Unorthodox Behaviour '' , most likely as a result of the band 's `` incoherent noodling '' on that particular release . As far as `` UB '' is concerned , not only does `` X '' unanimously mark the spot , but is guaranteed to come out in the wash stain-free as well , even after repeated spins !	1
For those of us who thought Phil Collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture , think again ... that was back in the early 80s when I heard this.. it is mastery distilled	1
Although these blazed progressive jams can lack a bit of central melodic structure , this is rambling of a high order , as this very talented side project proved supreme at offering just that- a full throttle off-ramp of intelligent and intense musical quirk .	1
I have been listening to the English jazz rock group Brand X for a long time now and this was the album I started with . This 1976 debut by the group is fantastic and presents a neat twist on the jazz rock theme . That is , while the band is largely indebted to the breakneck tempos and thunderous volume of groups like the Mahavishnu Orchestra circa 1971-1973 , I can also hear traces of the English Canterbury bands and experimental composers like Brian Eno ( most likely stemming from the involvement of Phil Collins and Percy Jones on Brian 's Another Green World album from 1975 ) .The lineup on Unorthodox Behaviour includes Phil Collins ( drums and percussion ) , Robin Lumley ( keyboards , synthesizers ) , John Goodsall ( electric and acoustic guitars ) and Percy Jones ( fretless electric bass ) .Like many of the jazz rock musicians these guys were world class musicians and possess dazzling technical skill . Of course as a huge Genesis fan I was especially pleased by the presence of Phil and he demonstrates throughout why he `` was '' considered to be among the finest drummers in rock . As a bassist myself , I have always liked Percy Jones - he has a very distinctive style that at times , seems like he is completely out of control . I am also happy that he does not use the fretless bass in a traditional sense , i.e. , glissandos and instead plays the instrument as if it were fretted . John Goodsall is a criminally underappreciated guitarist and his approach is largely indebted to the style of virtuoso John McLaughlin ( from Mahavishnu Orchestra ) .Musically , this album presents a heady blend of wild , full-throttle jazz rock , some quieter experimentation highly reminiscent of the music off of Another Green World , and aspects of the Canterbury style . There are nice dynamic contrasts ( including nice acoustic sections ) and the compositions are very interesting - in this respect , I wish that the keyboardist had more of a presence . Although not something I normally discuss when reviewing an album , there were moments when I actually found myself tapping my foot - particularly on the more `` swinging '' pieces . Phil was instrumental in this respect and as he was so fond of saying , really `` got behind '' these pieces and simply grooved . The album closes on an interesting note with the quiet , earthy textures of Touch Wood.This reissue features pretty skimpy liner notes and while the overall sound quality is excellent , there was some slight distortion on the drums , particularly when Phil is smashing away on a `` China-boy '' type cymbal . Indeed , when Phil really gets cooking on the lower kit ( bass drum/floor toms etc ) I can also hear some slight distortion . Apart from my nitpicking however , this really is a well-recorded album.All in all , this is an excellent example of jazz rock fusion that is different from the standard jazz rock affair and is very highly recommended . Another cool ( and recommended ) album is Another Green World by Brian Eno . Although very different than the music on Unorthodox Behaviour , the album features great interplay between Phil and Percy on a few tunes .	1
Life is not without ironies and this album confirms again one of rock 's most interesting ones . As if his work with Genesis were not proof enough of his musical talent , Phil Collins ' drumming in this album is bound to leave most drummers and non-drumming music fans speechless , as he glides through the tracks of this album by Brand X , his side project in the late seventies.One could think that something just went terribly wrong with Phil , causing him to throw his musical creativity down a deep hole when the eighties kicked in , and throw himself in the hands of commercial pop and musical recycling for a very long embrace that sadly lasts to this day . In any case , there 's plenty of musical testimonies to what his musical genius was for a good decade and so , and his works with Brand X is one of them.Brand X is the brainchild of Phil Collins and Atomic Rooster 's guitarist John Goodsall ( same band where Emerson Lake and Palmer 's Carl Palmer came ) , and in spite of what you 'd be inclined to think , their contributions were not the only brilliant moments of this -by most considered their best- album . 'Unorthodox Behaviour ' bridges the gap between jazz fusion and prog rock in a way that is unbelievable , walking a fine line ( invisible , some might argue ) without tumbling , and maintaining a cohesive and well crafted sound that gives the album a well deserved five stars .	1
Like many people who grew up in the 80s and early 90s , the name Phil Collins automatically conjures images of a mega-popstar playing very radio-friendly music . I only learned about Brand X later on , and at first had a hard time believing that this music was performed by the same guy who is also resonsible for `` You 'll Be In My Heart . '' Yet so it is , and it 's a tribute to Mr. Collins 's versatility and overall musicality . There are few musicians today who could bridge the gap between almost-jazz-prog-fusion and mega-hits so the existence of this disc is much to Mr. Collins 's credit.As for the recording at hand , it 's wanky music nerd material in the first degree . Collins was performing in a then-semi-popular style known as jazz-rock fusion , which was probably officially started by Miles Davis in the late 60s when electric instruments and a more aggressive , rockish beat were incorporated into jazz performances . The style spread to other bands often comprised of Davis alums , such as Chick Corea 's Return to Forever , the Joe Zawinul/Wayne Shorter vehicle Weather Report , John McLaughlin 's Mahavishnu Orchestra , Herbie Hancock 's Headhunters , Tony Williams 's Lifetime , and so forth . Stacked up against these other fusion bands , Collins and crew really hold their own . The music here is full of interesting twists and turns as well as complex interplay , furious drumwork and lightning guitar runs that shine with technical prowess . It sounds a bit dated as does any jazz-fusion of that era , with a distinctive `` 70s '' sound to it . However it also feels very much like a predecessor to today 's `` math rock '' which occupies a niche in the alternative rock or metal world . As stunning as it sometimes can be , it also is likely to be almost impenetrable to many people , pop fans especially . Those who know the Collins that most of us do would probably have a hard time getting their heads around the idea that this is the same guy who created all the hits.This is n't for everyone and is worth a listen before you buy if possible . But for those interested in the genre or in understanding why Mr. Collins is recognized as one of the great drummers of the rock era , this is a good place to start .	1
This IS possibly the best Brand X album that features Phil Collins drumming on it . The whole album front to back is packed with some incredible jams and solos . Song in which stand-out on this album are & quot ; Born Ugly & quot ; , & quot ; Euthanasia Waltz & quot ; , and & quot ; Unorthodox Behaviour & quot ; . If you like Jazz , Rock or if you even like to Funk you 'll definitely dig every inch of this . Another album to check out is entitled & quot ; Marscape & quot ; which is technically the first recordings of Brand X before they recorded under that name . The album is extremely hard to get a hold of in this country . If you ever come across it on vinyl it 's definitely worth picking up . For me it 's the start of the Brand X trip . It was recorded under John Lancaster and Robin Lumley but includes John Goodsall , Phil Collins and Morris Pert .	1
Everytime I hear this music , it always turns me on.The smoking performance of the menbers of Brand x is my appetite for music.This will cut you like a knife and into pieces .	1
In the mid seventies jazz-fusion was at it 's peak and there was no shortage of quality records being released . For me , one of the fusion bands that stood out was Brand X . Their music was captivating , all band members were tremendous talents , but most importantly , they had an original sound . Thirty years after it 's release , this debut disc still is amazing and would be a great introduction to this band . John Goodsall shreds with the best of them but his soothing guitar work is just as striking . The chirping tones that Percy Jones creates on his fretless bass are unmistakable . Robin Lumley enhances it all by playing the perfect keyboard riff at the right time , and Phil Collins , on a break from Genesis , laid down some exciting drumming , maybe some of the best he has ever done . Enjoy .	1
1979 's `` Product , '' the fifth album by Brand X , sees the very-welcome return of Genesis drummer & singer Phil Collins to the fold after a one-album break ( Phil was busy with Genesis the previous year , so Chuck Burgi stepped in on the drumkit for Brand X 's 1978 release , '' Masques '' ) . `` Product '' also sees Brand X swell up into an eight-man line-up , not only band veterans Collins , John Goodsall , Percy Jones , Robin Lumley & Morris Pert but also keyboardist Peter Robinson , bassist John Giblin , and Mike Clarke ( though I do n't have the info on what Clarke plays on the album , and my CD booklet does n't say , either ) . I suspect that Brand X named this album `` Product '' because the band were trying for a more radio-friendly feel with this release , even including two `` proper '' songs with vocals & lyrics ( 95 % of the band 's music , I 'd say , is strictly instrumental ) . But there 's no need to be put off by this , because `` Product '' is a great disc , featuring the group 's incredible knack for whirlwind , progressive jazz-rock fusion & musical chops . The two songs with lyrics , `` Do n't Make Waves '' and `` Soho , '' are both very rockin ' , and feature excellent vocal performances from Collins ( `` Soho '' was even released as a single -- -a rarity for Brand X -- -but it did n't go anywhere ) . I also enjoy the expert jazz-rock of such tracks as `` Dance Of The Illegal Aliens , '' `` Algon , '' the great grooves of `` Wal To Wal , '' and the ferocious instrumental `` And So To F , '' penned by Phil Collins himself ( who totally outdoes himself on the drumkit with this one ) . The music is terrific , and the band 's performances are mindblowing . It 's another winner for Brand X ! I 'm very confident you will enjoy this `` Product . ''	1
I do not know much of Brand X 's work except what I have heard from & quot ; Missing Period & quot ; and & quot ; Livestock & quot ; , both very fine fusion recordings.As a fan of progressive rock and fusion ( in that order ) , I loved this album immediately , since it has the progressive & quot ; hooks & quot ; - weird time signtures , dreamy interludes , machine-gun staccato runs , interesting compositions with emphasis on group improvization , rather than long self-indulgent solos.I wo n't hide that I love the vocal tracks , since the harmonies remind me of Genesis . First off , the album includes the wonderful piece & quot ; ... And So To F ... & quot ; This song alone is worth getting the album - it 's great symphonic progressive rock at its most glowing , although somewhat simplified - I am listening to it now , and I can not believe that it has not gotten any airplay , it 's just so uplifting and melodic . It has Phil Collins written all over it , although ironically , he does not play on it ( ? ! ! ) and the guitar work is absolutely delectable . But enough on that . The other tracks are excellent , especially & quot ; Dance Of The Illegal Aliens & quot ; which is simply on fire , & quot ; Not Good Enough & quot ; spills over with great ideas , & quot ; Algon & quot ; is progressive & quot ; chop-o-rama & quot ; that could make Yes or U.K. green with envy . & quot ; April & quot ; is a bit of ambient diversion , but tastefully kept to a short 2 minutes , and & quot ; Wal To Wal & quot ; sounds like the band walked offstage during a live performance , and let the rhythm section relax and have a bit of fun with the drum machine.Just think of it : this is 1979 , when most prog bands , including Genesis were caving in to blatant commercialism , these guys held fast to progressive ideals ! The comparison with & quot ; Lounge Jazz & quot ; in the other review is absolute rubbish . The criticism was perhaps inspired by & quot ; Rhesus & quot ; , which is a lighter , salsa-like tune with some cool jazzy guitar soloing , this is lean and mean progressive stuff , with no slack whatsoever .	1
This 1979 release is my favorite Brand X album . While it features the astounding playing that characterized the output of the band , there are also a few progressive rock/pop tracks with vocals that round things out nicely . Product is a diverse album and along with the prog/pop , there are atmospheric passages , high energy prog instrumentals , and above all else , mind-blowing jazz rock instrumentals that feature daunting meter shifts and complex ensemble work.There is a large cast of musicians on this album ; indeed it seems like there is a different lineup on every tune . On drums there is Genesis drummer Phil Collins ( vocals on two tracks ) and mind-blowing ex-Herbie Hancock virtuoso Mike Clarke . Mike 's drumming on Not Good Enough - See Me ! is astonishingly intricate . There are a few bassists as well ( John Giblin and Percy Jones ) . The bassists do a fine job although they seem to simply imitate Jaco Pastorius at times . John Goodsall ( guitars ) , Morris Pert ( percussion ) , and Robin Lumley/Peter Robinson ( keyboards , synthesizers ) all turn in fantastic performances , although the keyboards are a little too buried in the mix for my taste.The tracks on Product are all very good , yet are fairly different from one another . There are the progressive rock/pop tracks with Phil on vocals ( Do n't Make Waves/Soho ) , the proggier instrumental tracks that would not have been out of place on a mid-late 1970s Genesis album ... And so to F ... ( written by Phil ) is a good example , then there are the standard jazz rock instrumental rave-ups . Lastly , the `` jazziest '' track on the album is Rhesus Perplexus . If I had one complaint though , it is that some of the tracks have an unfinished feel to them - the bass guitar driven track Wal to Wal is a good example . This really is minor though when you consider the high caliber of the musicians and the interesting compositions.While this CD has not been remastered , the sound quality is pretty good . Although the liner notes are nothing to speak of , from what I can recall from a billion years ago , my LP was not so hot either.All in all , this is a great album by Brand X that shows them mixing aspects of progressive rock into the jazz rock format . As a long time fan of both progressive rock and jazz rock , I found a lot to like here . Recommended .	1
I was n't really sure what to expect when I got this one . I was impressed by the musicianship- the guitarist is awesome . Jazz/Fusion is not always my cup of tea but this one held my interest . Phil sings on 2 song which makes it even more interesting . Overall , I would recommend .	1
No , Crises simply can not stand in the same league as Five Miles Out or anything from the Tubular Bells-Fives Miles Out period , but it 's certainly leagues better than that underwhelming Discovery disaster ! Much , much better . I guess perhaps it 's my fault for going into Discovery before Crises . Not that it matters *that* much , and in fact I guess you can say I saved the better album ( this one ) for last.Anyway the title song is 20 minutes of ... well , perhaps `` adventure '' really *is* the only way to describe it even though it should never be placed in the same category as the multi-part masterpieces from previous Oldfield recordings . No , it 's not *quite* as great as the 24-minute masterpiece `` Taurus II '' from Five Miles Out , but I would n't say it 's a huge drop in quality either . It sounds significantly more mainstream however , which hurts it slightly . This means had it been shortened into an edited version , it 'd fit in with , say , Pink Floyd 's A Momentary Lapse of Reason and I would n't know the difference.Anyway perhaps my favorite part is when the rhythm picks up around the 4:30 mark . It resembles the early 80 's version of the Moody Blues a little bit , and that can only be a good thing . Unfortunately all the compliments in the world ca n't help the fact that the vocal melody is sort of well , not very appealing . Alright , it 's not THAT bad . I simply prefer my Oldfield experience to not include vocals . Then again , the vocal melodies on Platinum were pretty awesome but that album added a lot more creative and diverse ideas than this one ( added more by *far* in fact ) . The mediocre way the lead singer sings `` Crises , crises , you ca n't get away '' is the worst part of the piece , but the next set of vocals ( `` the watcher and the tower , waiting hour by hour '' ) is more pleasant.The final 10 minutes is a bunch of really dated 80 's instruments that feel soulless and cold by todays standards , but luckily the fact they 're melodic saves the day . At least for this album , even though I disagree with Oldfield 's choice of arrangements , at least he had the good sense to lay his ideas down as interestingly as can be . Overall , I 'm pleased with `` Crises '' . Of course now we have the rest of the album to review ... '' Foreign Affairs '' is pretty bland though . Generic pop songs is NOT Mike Oldfield 's forte . At least anyone who 's heard his classic stuff should understand this point of view . Decent female vocals by Maggie Reilly , but certainly nothing that blows me away . These vocals border on nursery rhyme-like and I 'm pretty sure Oldfield 's core audience is n't the children ! `` Moonlight Shadow '' is not related to Cat Stevens `` Moonshadow '' in case anyone is wondering ( you 're probably not ! ) Pleasant , actually highly enjoyable new age folk-ish vocals . You see it 's the instrumental sections that make Mike Oldfield so wonderful . This ? Well , it 's just pleasant pop/rock . Not fitting for Oldfield 's style . `` In High Places '' features vocals by the legendary Yes man himself Jon Anderson . I 've never been a fan of his robotic vocals , but he 's normally able to make up for that with a decent vocal melody from time to time . There was actually a 6-album stretch from Time and a Word to Relayer when he was downright awesome in fact . However 80 's Yes is low on my list of favorite rock arists that made the transition from the 70 's to the 80 's , and a really bare and lackluster song like `` In High Places '' is the reason why . If there 's a melody here , it 's really hard to make it out.WHAT THE ? ! ? ! Roger Chapman of Family fame sings on `` Shadow On the Wall ! '' Alright , his presence alone makes up for any flaws the album may have had , haha . Sorry , I 'm a BIG Family fan and obviously very excited and surprised to hear him perform on a Mike Oldfield album ! By default I love this song the most . : ) No it does n't *really* make up for the other less than stellar moments . `` Taurus 3 '' is a short acoustic instrumental that totally reminds me of picking flowers with Martha Stewart ! Not bad but of course , `` Taurus II '' eats this puppy alive.Overall , a decent album . The flaws are few and far between , but they 're noticeable from time to time .	1
Crisis being Oldfield 's 1983 release and his 8th album and contains the well known track `` Moonlight Shadow '' which is such a great track . Other great tracks are `` Shadow on the Wall '' , and `` In High Places '' . The main track sounds like a bit like Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk and is very experimental . We get some great linernotes but no lyrics but a list of whom plays what on each track . The cover is quite odd but I like the photo of Oldfield in the booklet . 4/5 .	1
another landmark album by Oldfield . he really was on top of his game at this time , with 5 miles out and crises arguably his best efforts . a must have if you like Oldfield .	1
Of course , Mike Oldfield is probably best known for the long-form works he pioneered in the 1970s , beginning with & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; . And on here , half or so of this release is taken up with one such work , the title track & quot ; Crises & quot ; . Instrumentally , this piece recaptures the musical drama that was the spark in those earlier long works , but ... sigh ... I find myself wishing that the vocal here was n't present . The music is so powerful and evocative that it really proves more of a distraction . The second half of this contains some of Oldfield 's shorter songs . & quot ; In High Places & quot ; and & quot ; Foreign Affair & quot ; are interesting , mantra-like pieces , with vocals from Jon Anderson and Maggie Reilly respectively . And & quot ; Taurus 3 & quot ; is a short guitar and flamenco-stomp workout that hearkens back to Oldfield 's & quot ; QE2 & quot ; release . But & quot ; Shadow on the Wall & quot ; is ... oh , I hate this track . I 'll admit it . The vocal is in a very dated-sounding and overwrought late-prog style that really grates , and the piece overall just sounds weak to me . But that 's the sole clinker here . Still , it 's not the real back-to-form release ; that would come later on , as Oldfield would revisit his old & quot ; Tubular & quot ; turf on & quot ; Tubular Bells 2 & quot ; , and then follow this with the amazing and beautiful & quot ; The Songs of Distant Earth & quot ; . I 'd rank either of those over this one , and also & quot ; QE2 & quot ; , & quot ; Incantations & quot ; , & quot ; Ommadawn & quot ; , and of course , & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; . But this is one to get after those , to be sure .	1
First song , 20 minutes & quot ; Crises & quot ; is as good as & quot ; Tubular bells & quot ; . The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part . The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song & quot ; In high places & quot ; is sang by Jon Anderson ( I just ca n't resist him ) . I did not know it was Oldfield who did & quot ; Shadow on the wall & quot ; , a song that I liked a lot back in early 80 's . Well , it is on this album . & quot ; Taurus & quot ; is a excellent accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women 's voice .	1
Nothing like getting hooked on a song when it first comes out , and sticks with you afterwards . I 've been a fan of Mike Oldfield ever since I heard & # 34 ; Tubular Bells & # 34 ; , and continue to be now . In the past few years , many of Oldfield 's iconic albums have been remixed and remastered by Mike himself , to include box sets with the original versions along with updated remixes of the original , as well as a DVD with a discrete 5.1 surround mix of the album . I make no secret of the fact that that 's why I buy these box sets . & # 34 ; TB & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Ommadawn & # 34 ; are among my favorite albums , and when & # 34 ; Crises & # 34 ; was released , with its hit single & # 34 ; Moonlight Shadow & # 34 ; ( sung by Maggie Reilly ) , I bought it immediately.The opening title track is one of Mike 's long-form tracks , and comparing the original CD with the stereo remix shows several differences that some people on a website I frequent panned vehemently . I actually liked the reworking , and even said so on that site . One of the things Mike did was to expand the intro of & # 34 ; Shadow & # 34 ; , which I found interesting . The sound of the 5.1 remix brought the textures out even more . My feeling is that Mike would n't have undertaken this project if he did n't think he could improve on the original mix , to make it fit more into the vision he had for it . I think he succeeded . This set is not cheap , but it 's worth every cent in my opinion . I encourage the listener to go into it with an open mind and form their own opinions .	1
Crises is my favourite of Mike Oldfield 's eighties CDs . As with its direct predecessor , it contains one long piece which took up the whole of the first side of the original vinyl and a set of shorter tracks , five in this case , on the second side . The shorter songs on the earlier albums were often a lot weaker than the longer pieces . Partly that was because Oldfield 's musical style was not transferring well to shorter pieces but also , the lyrics were often quite dire.Experience clearly helped a lot but also collaboration with other musicians . On Crises , the most notable name is Jon Anderson of Yes who is creditied with lyrics and vocals on one song & quot ; In High Places & quot ; which really sounds as though it could have come from a contemporary Yes album.The opening track , & quot ; Crises & quot ; is classic Oldfield music and in places harks back to his first album & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; so fans will reconise the motifs and see how he takes them forwards in a more rock based style.Moonlight Shadow is Oldfield 's finest short song . The great lyrics of this dark lament really give Maggie Reilly a proper showcase for her fine voice . Also , on this track we get to find out that Oldfield really can play a proper blues style guitar sole . It 's one of those songs that everyone has heard which stays with you for a long time.This is probably the best introduction to Oldfield 's later output for anyone who knows him only as the & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; man .	1
Pure and simple . I 've listened to Oldfield since 1973 and this release is worth every penny . Just the live video footage of the band performing Crises live at Wembley in 1983 is worth the purchase . An amazing moment captured in time . Wow !	1
Side one consists of a full intrumental and side 2 a selection of songs with one instrumental ( Taurus 3 ) .At the time of release Crisis was 10 years after Tubular Bells and was used as a bit of a celebration of Mike 's official decade in the music business . The opening bars reflect this with a reworking of the Tubular bells piano riff , albeit , very synthetic sounding.The instrumental 'Crisis ' itself is the usual mix of tones and melodies that only Mike can concoct . His obsession with sound technology at this period is very apparent but makes for really interesting listening . There is a heavy use of synthesizers and I feel that this album was the turning point in people 's perception of what Mike Oldfield is as a musician . His first instrument is , and always will be , guitar but people seem to think he 's a virtuoso keyboardist.Taurus 3 is an instrumental that displays his amazing skill as an acoustic guitarist . I 've known several people listen to this track and not realise it 's Mike playing ! ! ! They just think he 's a keyboard man ! ! ! READ THE INSTRUMENT CREDITS ! ! ! Jon Anderson , Michael Chapman and Maggy Reilly are the vocalists used on various songs . 'Moonlight Shadow ' being the obvious one to note . Simon Phillips does an incredible job on drums and co-production with backing from bassist Phil Spalding , keyboardist Micky Simmonds ( Rennaisance ) and Anthony Phillips ( early Genesis ) on guitars.Overall , this CD does stand out as one of Mike 's classics and should be a definate purchase for any fan .	1
this reminds of the old days.the really old dayswasted years .Maggie something sings Moonliht shadow , the biggest summer song ever .I think 1983.this is an album to fall in live with .side A is instrumental.side B is not .	1
Last week I wrote a lengthy review for `` Taurus II '' and completely criticized every single aspect of it but now , a week later , I 'm playing it again and for some unexplainable reason now I absolutely LOVE it . How does that happen ? Obviously I did n't get it the first time around and I 'm sorry about that . I should have given it a few more chances to make sense . Well I can *promise* you , I now love it to pieces.I suppose I was originally confusing a lack of original ideas for 80 's production values . You see , a part of me just did n't want to accept the way Five Miles Out *sounds* even though I can think of about a thousand other 80 's albums that sound significantly more dated and cheesier than this one . I guess the one complaint that still holds true is that some of these ideas are a few minutes too long , but it 's not enough to fault it . No way.Just for a few laughs , I 'll leave my original review up so you can read it . Here it is.Sorry , but the 24-minute borefest that is called `` Taurus II '' just does n't get the job done for me , and is without a shadow of doubt , a major disappointment . I 'm shocked too- I was expecting an entertaining album , but I guess I now know what happens when you dig a little *too* far your favorite artists discography- you 're bound to come across some lackluster albums from time to time.However , there 's an even bigger issue- Mike Oldfield seemed to lose his ability to write memorable instrumental passages . The actual notes are extremely ordinary and generic , and this is completely unacceptable , especially when we recall that back in the 70 's Oldfield was writing groundbreaking and adventurous music that took your mind to new worlds.Tubular Bells through Platinum was a nearly flawless stretch of recordings . What happened ? Why is every single note of `` Taurus II '' so unspectacular and contrived ? Many of the themes are overlong too , such as the Irish influences , and the part where the female singer takes over about 8 minutes in . These two portions of the suite are particularly boring.The nursery rhyme around the 12-minute mark is a total disgrace , but I 'll take it over the horribly generic Irish theme that unfortunately makes another return . After that , the song just dissolves into pointless and barely audible noodling . If not that , it tries to sound more important than it really is simply but repeating the same few notes over and over with no imagination or creativity making it , you know , *adventurous* . The female chant at the end is more hopelessly pitiful generic songwriting . I do take a slight interest in the guitar solo at the very end though.I can only recommend Five Miles Out for those who absolutely strongly believe that Mike Oldfield can do no wrong .	1
Not Mike 's best album , but certainly a very good one . The second part of Taurus here is one of his better epic-length compositions , here reprising at the start the original chord progression from Taurus I , but played on different instruments . It goes above and beyond the scope of the first however , across the path of it 's 25 minutes . Family Man follows , a track he co-wrote with a bunch of other people , and definately a different one for Mike . It 's almost like a standard rock/pop song , fused with his own guitar and instrumentation . ( It later became a hit for Hall & amp ; Oates . ) The remaining songs are decent enough , but do n't really hold up to the standard of the opening epic . Still , an Oldfield fan will want this album for it alone , in addition to the adequate tracks that fill out the album .	1
first album I ever heard that uses bagpipes for rock music ( even though it is only a few bars on the title track ) , well before Rod Stuart made it popular . a must have for your record collection .	1
First , for the most-detailed review of this CD , see the earlier one by a reviewer named Adrian , who pretty much nails the concept , themes , and motifs.That said , I would add that I 've thoroughly enjoyed Five Miles Out because Mr. Oldfield has brought some talented folks into the studio to augment his own talents . As a result , the sound is richer and fuller than his one-man-band efforts from the earlier stages of his career.Maggie Reilly , who has graced many recording by Mike Oldfield as well as Jack Bruce , really shines with her soaring vocals . The trio of Morris Pert , Tim Cross , and Rick Fenn -- -who anchor Oldfield 's recordings throughout the '80s -- -create a solid , seamless backdrop that keeps Mr. Oldfield tethered to the music.Two long tracks , Taurus II and Orabidoo , consume most of the CD , but the title track Five Miles Out , a haunting tale of a doomed aviator , and the radio friendly Family Man , may be the two that embed themselves deepest into your auditory memory tracks.If you have not really listened to Mike Oldfield 's vast body of work , or perhaps too quickly banished him on the basis of his earlier efforts , than either this CD or Crisis are recommended access points .	1
after more sober and celtic influenced & quot ; Qe2 & quot ; mike rearanged his style adding a lot of heavy guitars and hard drumming and returned with & quot ; FIve Miles out & quot ; - propably his best album from eigthies.the opening almost half hour long & quot ; Taurus II & quot ; is a suprising continuation of QE2 main long track. & quot ; Taurus II & quot ; starts with a heavy main guitar riff and eveloves suddenly into great progressive rock suite with celtic elements , disco beat and a lot of great drumming.it is one of the best Mike 's moments in his whole career. & quot ; Family man & quot ; is a ironic fast catchy pop song ( Maggie Reilly on vocals ) that was a big hit across the europe - later covered by Hall and Oates synth pop duet. & quot ; Orabidoo & quot ; is another great hypnotic track with a transe drums and vocoder voice singing mysterious lyrics about flying over Katmandu.the coda with piano riff repeated by other instruments is one of the most moving and exciting melodies from his longer tracks. & quot ; Orabidoo & quot ; ends with irish song sung by Maggie. & quot ; Mount teide & quot ; is nice instrumental with lovely guitar solo.drums played by mr.Palmer from Emerson , lake and palmer band ! ! ! finally the title song & quot ; Five miles out & quot ; .intriguing sytnh-pop hit.Maggie 's sweet voice sings along with more agressive and angry Mike 's singing ( i always wondered why he is singing so rarely , he is a really good vocalist ) .title song is based on Taurus II guitar riff and features some amusing parts ( Mike 's growling voice - & quot ; lost in static 18 ... & quot ; ) but also very pathetic and memorable chorus.one of my favourite songs.The album is one if his most extraordinary and interesting items from discography.Mike creates here really rich and colourfull paintings using a lot of instruments and of course his beloved electric guitar.an album which you ca n't leave behind !	1
propably mike 's bet from eigties ... the 25 minutes long & quot ; Taurus II & quot ; is amazing with it 's heavy sound and sudden changes , & quot ; Family man & quot ; is still a rocking hit , & quot ; Orabidoo & quot ; hides an endless emtions and & quot ; Mount teide & quot ; and title track are still gems.nothing more nothing less.a masterpiece !	1
Look at the album cover , folks ( the one that 's NOT the remastered copy with the nighttime setting of a mountain or whatever ) . Mike Oldfield trimmed up , cut his hair , and went in a really uncool direction by sporting the bland and nerdy `` look at me , I 'm sophisticated , take my music even *more* seriously ! '' look . Bad Mike ! He did n't need to resort to that , especially since the music on this album is n't really any different from his previous albums . Alright that 's not true . It 's slightly different.Basically what Mr. Uncool Oldfield did for Incantations is take his typical style ( a style I 've always questioned how original it really is since , you know , Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream were around before Tubular Bells ... and basically Incantations is yet another continuation of Tubular Bells because it 's not *that* much different , might I darn well add ! ) and drag out his songwriting WAY WAY WAY longer than necessary . Do n't believe me ? Just go to your favorite website ( hopefully amazon , hehe ) and find out that the album only contains four songs , and each one is over 15 minutes long . Holy moly , baby ! Okay , so now you 're definitely thinking `` Well , just because the length of the tracks has been extended compared to previous Oldfield outings does NOT necessarily mean he 's taking repetitive ideas and using them the entire time ! '' but the thing is ... that 's exactly what he 's doing . These songs *are* repetitive . Of course they 're also incredibly melodic hence my 4-star rating ( if no melody could be found , you really think I 'd give it 4 stars ? Get the heck out , babycakes ! ) '' Part One '' is the best . It 's awesome . It 's better than awesome it 's ... clearly in a category of awesome that has yet to be achieved by any other artist before or since , hehe . The chorus is really magnificent too and the arrangements that flow in the background are just gorgeous . I 'm mainly referring to the flute . Oldfield brings new life to that thing . We must show our thankfulness towards Mike for that one . Thanks big man ! He makes the flute sound like I 've just connected in a spiritual way with the seagulls . I 'm not exaggerating with that comment either . `` Part Two '' has a WONDERFUL intro that reminds me of the Renaissance Fair and a mysteriously quiet instrumental portion soon after that contains a beautiful melody but then ... Mike Oldfield gets this silly idea to bring his sister into the recording studio . Sisters and brothers hate each other so I 'm not sure what she 's doing here ... alright alright , sometimes they pretend to love each other when they 're parents are around . That 's cleary the case here because she sings like , only two vocal melodies and it takes an ETERNITY to get through both of them . Her voice is pretty good and reminiscent of Annie Haslam ( from Renaissance fame , a band that 's almost as good as Oldfield 's best stuff ) but we 're loyal amazon buyers and we need more substance ! `` Part Three '' is super terrific for displaying a lengthy guitar solo that is most certainly not repetitive . Much appreciated , Mike ! You 're the man , yo . The disco-like rhythm near the end has musical ideas that lean heavily on late 70 's progressive rock techniques actually , such as something the band Yes would be doing at the time Incantations hit the market.Now listen carefully . Bring your ears up to my lips so you can hear me ( do n't worry I do n't have bad breath ... ever since I got a rotten tooth pulled last year ) . Despite the entire album being overlong , guess what ? It 's NOT a major distraction . While it 's true this album was criticized back in the late 70 's when it was first released , time has been kinder than a man handing out free hamburgers to a homeless family on Christmas morning in the Dallas area ( and in a tough economy , that 's really freakin ' generous ! ) and well , the songwriting is honestly quite good.Oh , and I hate to break the news to ya in such a somber way , but I was kidding about `` Part One '' being my favorite track . My favorite song is actually probably ... er , whatever the name of it is . The final track ! `` Part 4 '' . Oh yeah , how could I forget ! It goes through a series of exciting musical arrangements , and only a few of them repeat too much ( such as the xylophone section ... er , vibraphones ! ) Say what you will about heaven , but these vibraphones take me there . I can feel God right here in the room with me and I like it . His guitar work is really impressive throughout too . I admire a guy like Mike . Though repeated listens reveals a style of guitar soloing a weeeeee bit on the predictable and uncreative side , but well , it SOUNDS good so yeah , we 'll leave it alone in its nice and comfy environment . By `` predictable '' I mean when the moment calls for it , it 's like Mike just says `` Alright , it 's time to lay down some guitar work '' and then makes the guitar solo flow sort of , well , sort of predictably . Beautiful guitar sound though , that simply can not be denied . Only a heartless Tin Man would deny it.Overall , if you do n't pick up this album ... well truth be told , you should pick up the first three Oldfield albums first because they 're better , but do n't you even think about skipping over Incantations . You 'd have no idea what you 're missing , that 's for sure . Of course that saying `` You have no idea ! '' really is obvious anyway , is n't it ? Of course you have no idea having not actually HEARD it yet . Duh ! Anyway , yeah , Incantations . Good album .	1
OK , here 's the deal . Up until this point , much of Oldfield 's work has been based off of the ideas he explored on & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; : extended rock-based work , which elaborated on the ideas in something of a classically-inflected manner . On & quot ; Incantations & quot ; , the tables get turned . This work is much more of a proper _classical_ piece ( in fact , for all practical purposes , it follows 'proper ' symphonic form ! ) which utilizes some rock ( mainly instrumentation ) elements . And musically , this work actually fits in more with works by composers such as Philip Glass , Steve Reich , or John Adams ; it 's worth noting that Oldfield , on his next album , would even include a Philip Glass 'cover ' . This is a tremendous jump forward from the previous three albums , although Oldfield does presage what he 's doing here , to some extent , on & quot ; Ommadawn & quot ; . My suggestion , therefore , would be to go and listen to & quot ; Tubular Bells & quot ; or & quot ; Ommadawn & quot ; first , make sure you 're down with some of the work of the composers mentioned above , _then_ pick this one up ... and what 's up here should sink right in . All that aside , this is perhaps one of the best works of classical 'minimalism ' ( which is what it more or less belongs in ) , easily on-par with the work of other 'serious ' composers , and which actually manages to extend the cellularly-based minimalist concept into lusher , more complex territory . John Adams would later get the kudos for doing this , but Oldfield was there some time before him with this work . IMHO , one of the great 'missing masterpieces ' of this style of music ... deserves a _lot_ more attention , but in its right context .	1
I really do n't know why but I feel like you ca n't listen to Incantations once and voice your opinion . It is almost like travelling to some exotic vacation spot far away . Even when you are already there it still takes you a couple of days before you really get there . Not only because inside your mind often you have not quite left your own place yet , but it just takes some time to get to feel the culture , the language , to figure out nature . Listening to Incantations is a very similar experience for me . When I travel there I am prepared to stay in for at least a full day , otherwise I do n't see a point . If you think such requirement is ridiculous and you would not be interested in such exercise I have a feeling that you will not like this music either . However , if you do listen to this album on repeat for a day you will know exactly what I mean and will most likely chose to extend your experience . It is truly magical in a way.Mike Oldfield became famous at the age of 20 after the release of his record breaking Tubular Bells created by rock instruments applied in a classical format . I guess his timing was perfect and revolutionary , allowing him to expand the horizons of the exploding progressive rock . To be very honest I liked Tubular Bells but not as much as the following it 1974 album , Hergest Ridge . However , in 1975 after the death of his mother Mike had created a piece of music so special that 35 years and thousands of albums later Ommadawn still is and always will be one of my most favorite albums . Perhaps the fact that I like listening to progressive rock as much as I like listening to ambient , electronic , world , modern classical and ambient jazz music makes me feel that way about that magical , tribal , acoustic , electronic masterpiece . Then , after that powerful release Mike Oldfield waited three years prior to releasing this album , Incantations in 1978 . It was a long wait well worth it for many of us.Incantations are constructed of 4 length-wise fairly even parts of close to 20 minute each . Strength-wise I think that first and last parts are the best and the second is the weakest one . If you find it problematic getting through some of this music you might as well just play part 4 for a while . That is where all plots Mike develops throughout this amazing mathematical equation of a creation come to completion in a spectacular interchangeable way . Structurally Incantations are quite an architectural achievement . I will let Mike explain : ` I wanted to have some magical things in there , so I decided to try using real instruments where I could , real strings and a real flute in the beginning . I 'd never orchestrated my own string section , so I thought I 'd give it a try . I had a string section of about eighteen players and had them in my studio . With that in place I set about working on this really complicated musical sequence . It went sequentially through every key in the musical scale . It was a Frere Jacques kind of round , but the longest anybody had ever written as far as I know . The whole thing was really complicated . If you listen to it carefully , you realize that it is two parts that cross over and take about two minutes to get round . By some fluke I found the right notes to start the second part , twenty-five and three quarter bars in , all with different time signatures in each bar . Later I got Pierre Moerlen ( of Gong ) and his brother Benoit to play it , with two interlocking vibraphones . With this magical mood that I wanted to capture , I decided on the title Incantations quite early . The original plan was to get some real incantations ; magic spells and chants , rather than making them up . ' You get the idea . Mike Oldfield was in charge of his project completely consumed by it and could afford to do it right . This music came out of a real battlefield and it came in stages . He got it started and when the first part was ready he played it to his record company executives who came to the meeting already thinking about switching gear and jumping on the punk rock wagon exploding at the moment . They did not like the music which they thought was bad for their image at the time . That realization was a huge blow to Mike and the reason why I think the second part of Incantations was such a struggle for him.Spiritually Incantations are extremely intriguing and as powerful as Ommadawn is . Ommadawn is like a scream of the 22 year young man jumping into the waterfall of tremendous loss and mental breakdown noticing that the beauty of his creation keeps him floating safe from harm . Now , 3 years later a 25 year old man is fighting a battle with demons surrounding his own self . Mike Oldfield approached this creative moment from many different planes . He listened to a lot of religious music at the time but he also was in need of getting himself drunk to sleep every night . This music is not just titled Incantations . This was Mike 's real incantation at the time . And now it is with us .	1
while on his first three albums ( & quot ; ommadawn & quot ; , & quot ; hergest ridge & quot ; , & quot ; Tubular bells & quot ; ) Mike was practising his folk-rock-progressive style , here he creates a real Rock symphony.77 minutes ( & quot ; ommadawn & quot ; was lasting 36 minutes ... ) of a huge and bombastic rock-opera based on a poems of Ben Johnson and Longfellow ( english 18 century poets ) and his own experiences ( in the time Mike had gone though Exegis therapy because of his psychical problems ) .Whole album sounds much different than anything he had made through the next years of his career.Guitar that was so charactereistic in his earlier records is hidden here on second plan.Massive choir , orchestral arrangments , synths and opera sounds are dominating in & quot ; part 1 & quot ; and & quot ; part 2 & quot ; .they all give album a bit Film music or classical music taste.During last 8 minutes of & quot ; part 2 & quot ; Maddie Pryor ( from Steelaye span band ) is singing the & quot ; Hawaiatha & quot ; poem with the background of Jabula african drums band and etheric vibraphone part ( Pierre morlen from Gong , he will collaborate with Mike in the later years too ) .This part is hypnotising listeners because of monotoic Vocal intonations and very spiritual atmosphere ... but i save all the honours for & quot ; part 3 & quot ; and & quot ; part 4 & quot ; which are in my opinion one of Mike 's finest instrumental works in in his whole Career. & quot ; Part 3 & quot ; starts with a cheerfull Fanfare medieval motive ... but suddenly starts the maginficent long Guitar solo section ... African tribal Drums are again on background along with gentle Bass riff and synths ... the raw and moving Gitar solo is one of hte moments that can brought tears into your eyes because of a imposible beauty that lies underneath it.later staright to the end & quot ; part 3 & quot ; goes into the nice seventies rocker with nice drums and guitars ... & quot ; part 4 & quot ; is much more experimental - etheric and mysterious Vibraphone part dominates here ... i have to mention also the another tribal drums section with a rhythmical Bass guitar riff and charming Guitar solo ... the ending is a All time Oldfield Classic - Maddie Pryor singing & quot ; ode to diana & quot ; along with a bit christmas-like melody.guitar solo is wonderfull ... ..This is definitly a magical album ... takes you to a different world of ancient tribes and distant planets ... it is one of the most impressive and timeless instrumental albums ever ... 77 minutes of pure pleasure.definitive must have for all rock fans !	1
I never fail to take this album with me when visiting family on the shores of Lake Superior . I usually put it on just as I hit Hwy 17 , the music mirroring the Canadian landscape as we approach those legendary shores . There are some wonderful themes here , and while they may outstay their welcome a little ( the condensed live version on Exposed may be more immediately appealing ) , they are never less than engrossing , with Maddy Prior 's contribution an inspired choice . Is it his best ? Probably not ( I listen to Five Miles Out and Crises more ) , but there is no better album of Mike 's at evoking what it was meant to.ExposedMike Oldfield / Crises	1
This is difficult.When a piece of music is so dear to you , it is very difficult to write an objective review.Music like Mike 's , I feel , is always a journey . It all relates back to those 70 's concept albums that many people , now , find inaccessible . Yes this is a long , mainly instrumental , album but captures every element of Mike 's genius . Dynamic , classical , ambient , melancholy . It is part of a class of music that was allowed to be produced in the 70 's . Some may call it self indulgent meanderings . Is not music , by nature , a selfish thing ? On the & quot ; Essential Mike Oldfield & quot ; video ( 1979 ) he explains that the majority of the work is based on one chord , used mainly as an ascending series of notes . I was astounded when I realised this . I could hear this throughout the piece and it made it much more enjoyable to listen to . ( The pop version of this is & quot ; Guilty ! & quot ; ) People call Mike a musical magpie or whatever and compare this piece to Phillip Glass ' works or any other minimalists . I believe Mike creates a very unique and innocent style of music . Ultimately this is a very melodic piece and yes it does involve repetition but this proves to be hypnotic not boring ( there 's a fine line for some people here ) . The use of arppegios in cycles , undulating bass riffs , sparkling synth lines , muted , staccato strings underpinning the main theme , like a never ending circle.A journey that never ends . Life.Anyway , the closing part of side one is one of the greatest pieces of music written by Mr. Oldfield . If you like the elements ( passing of the seasons , a roaring sea , autumn etc . ) and you are a sensitive soul ( hippy ) then lose yourself in Incantations and you will return feeling human again !	1
No matter what you feel about the Danzig phenomenon or where you stand in relation to stripped down guitar ... Simply put , this is just a damn fine , energetic , frenetic , unself-conscious rock n roll masterpiece ! So , whether you have the hoodie or not , whether you put the patch on your backpack or not- I do n't know you , kid , and I do n't care . Going on almost 27 years after they hashed this moster out in the studio , This Misfits album is one of the best of the late-70 's , call it whatcha will , fearless , boundless , badass music . So pick it up , turn it up and grin real big as you stomp around your bedroom , spazzing out like you never would at a show , yelling , `` I got somethin to say-ay ! I killed your baby today ! `` ... It does n't matter much to me ... Yeah	1
I own every Danzig-era Misfits release and to me this is hands down the best one of them all . A solid album with 17 awesome tracks plus a bonus track of studio screw ups . Every song on here is a great listen plus the sound quality isnt that bad compared to his other recordings . There are alot of reviews claiming Walk Among Us is there defining masterpiece but I disagree ; its great but not as great as Static Age .	1
This album is what so many bands today try to be ... an actual punk band . The Misfits were one of those rare groups that , even though there were only three-chords , they were awesome chords , and they made some of the best music I have heard.I have recommended this album to many people who think that Good Charlotte and Simple Plan are 'what punk rock is all about'.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY CHEAP IMITATIONS !	1
As my title implies , this is the Misfits ' 2nd best ablum overall ( right behind Walk Among Us ) , and it definitely a must-have in any respectable punk collection . This album is very very different , but extremely good . Instead of the more & quot ; punk & quot ; sound of Walk Among Us and Earth AD , Static Age leans more towards a slow , stripped down kind of rock 'n ' roll style . The songs are n't played very fast , and there are n't a lot of Danzig 's famous & quot ; Wooooahooooahs & quot ; s , but still , I consider this album essential . The songs are nice and rockin ' and are always a good listen . The only reason I do n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes it seems to drag . The song & quot ; Come back & quot ; lasts about 5 minutes and does n't really seem to get anywhere . However there are plenty of good songs ( & quot ; Bullet & quot ; , & quot ; We are 138 & quot ; , & quot ; Last caress & quot ; ) that totally make up for the one stinker . Here 's how I rate the songs:1 . Static Age ( 3/5 ) : A bit too slow , not one of the album 's high points.2 . TV Casualty ( 4/5 ) : A similar sound to Static Age , but better . Cool lyrics.3 . Some Kinda Hate ( 5/5 ) : One of my favorites . Catchy as hell.4 . Last Caress ( 5/5 ) : An undisputed Misfits classic . Awesome lyrics , catchy as hell . Been covered by Metallica and NOFX.5 . Return of the Fly ( 4/5 ) : Cool song about a horror film.6 . Hybrid Moments ( 4/5 ) : Sounds similar to Return of the Fly . I like Glenn 's vocals on this track.7 . We are 138 ( 5/5 ) : Another Misfits classic . My favorite track off the album . It gets stuck in your head like you would n't believe.8 . Teenagers from Mars ( 5/5 ) : Another classic . Just plain awesome . & quot ; We 're teenagers from Mars , and we do n't caaaare ! & quot ; 9 . Come back ( 2/5 ) : Only skippable track off the album . Drags on for too long and does n't seem to get anywhere.10 . Angelfuck ( 4/5 ) : Cool song with cool vocals.11 . Hollywood Babylon ( 3/5 ) : Ehh , not the best song they 've ever done , but still good.12 . Attitude ( 5/5 ) : I LOVE this one . Superb vocals.13 . Bullet ( 5/5 ) : Another classic . Possibly the most irreverent song ever written.14 . Theme for a jackal ( 4/5 ) : Uses a piano , and makes for a cool sounding song.15 . She ( 4/5 ) : Just a good song.16 . Spinal Remians ( 4/5 ) : Ditto17 . In the doorway ( 5/5 ) : This one 's really good . It 's hard to explain . It 's just awesome.Bottom Line : If you 're into punk at all , get Walk Among Us , then buy this .	1
This are the first recordings of the first real Misfits line-up ( Glenn Danzig-vocal , Jerry Only-bass , Franche Coma-guitar and Mr.Jim-drums ) . All the material recorded in just few takes.Here you 'll hear original Attitude , that is covered by Guns 'n ' Roses ( Spaghetti Incident LP ) and Last Caress ( which was covered by Metallica ) . Glenn 's singin ' is amazing.Whole album is included on Box Set , with exception of two songs : Spinal Remains and beautiful In The Doorway .	1
Review no.88.Recorded in 1978 , but not released until umteen years later.Looks to be the band 's fifth effort.One could say that 'Static Age ' was the definitive punk/metal cross over.Featured on this seventeen track disc are three new tunes , which are actually pretty good , '' She '' , '' Spinal Remains '' and `` In The Doorway '' .Some of the other tunes I thoroughly enjoyed were the title cut `` Static Age '' , the ass kickin ' `` T.V . Casualty '' , '' Teenagers From Mars '' and `` We Are 138 '' .Should appeal to most fans of Black Flag , Circle Jerks , Fear , Minor Threat and The Cramps ( now you 're taking ! ) .A should-have .	1
Misfits-Static Age *****Personaly I think that Static Age is far better then Walks Among Us , which for some reason is concidered to be the bands all time best album from the Danzig era when I think it is by far the worst . Static Age contains numerious classic songs from the band , the production on the album sounds the best out of all of them because Walk Among Us is too over done . And the feel of the album is just better . 'Some Kinda Hate ' 'Last Caress ' 'Return Of The Fly ' 'We Are 138 ' 'Teenagers From Mars ' 'Hollywood Babylon ' 'Attitude ' 'Bullet ' and 'She ' are all here , and these songs are on their best of disc , Misfits.Combining lyrics about horror-movies and comic books , the Misfits got it right . Some concider them hardcore punk , well not exactly . They are too mellow . But they sure have the spirit of The Ramones and that is reason enough to check out the band . If your the sort of person that does n't like best of 's or greatest hits then stay away from the Misfits disc and start with their albums . Static Age is the perfect place to start .	1
First of all , to the reviewer who said that this album has nothing on artists like Blink 182 or Good Charlotte , you should check to see if your brain is functioning . `` Static Age '' , one of the Misfits ' most well known works , is pure punk pleasure from start to finish . Glen Danzig 's howling Elvis Presley/Jim Morrison-esque voice is just great to listen to as the Misfits take rock back to it 's roots with simple chords and melodies combined with Danzig 's toungue in cheek B-movie inspired lyrics . Standout tracks , like the title track , `` Last Caress '' , `` Return of the Fly '' , `` We Are 138 '' , `` Teenagers From Mars '' , `` Hollywood Babylon '' , `` Attitude '' , and `` She '' are revered classics , and proof why this band has had an overaching legacy from 1977 to the present .	1
Glen Danzig and his friends have simply made the best punk cd ever . And it would be this cd . I guess I 'm not too much into the politics of punk , but this is a truely great cd . With its cheesy B-Horror movie lyrics , traditional punk riffs , and 50 's esque vocals , this band is , in general , just a fun band . They are by far the # 1 Halloween band ever . They do n't care what anyone really thinks , so they basically do whatever they please . Some people may be offended by some of their lyrics or something , but oh well . Glen Danzig should have never left this band , or they would be by far one of the most respected bands ever . Wait , they already are !	1
This album still sounds so good . The songs are simple but driving with great rythm lines and great drumming . Mr. Danzig has recently in my opinion entered his fat Elvis mode ( if you get a chance , you should watch the online video of him getting punched out for being an insufferable jerk ) , but there is no question as to the brilliance of his vocals on this album . His voice ( to continue the analogy ) sounds like a possessed Elvis . It 's amazing . Angry but in tune . Static Age is much more in the punk vein of the Ramones , and less like bands the Germs or Black Flag , which Earth A.D. sounds more like . The songs are all great sing alongs . Anthems even . I suppose his lyrics are n't for everyone , but I personally view them as ironic in that sort of dark humor kind of way . Even if punk is n't your normal cup of tea , you should still give this album a try .	1
This is about as punk rock of an album as you can make without a Guitar in sight . But then again , there are touches of Ben Folds ' sweet sorrowful side too , which makes it a little less punk.Standout tracks include Underground , Philosophy , and Boxing , though all of the tracks have a potential difference to them . Underground starts with fantastic and humorous intro , then kicks into some friendly , happy keyboarding ... Boxing is a sorrowful tale of a man at the end of his career , looking back on whether or not he 's proud of himself or not . It 's a touching and bittersweet tale and shows a little of Ben Folds ' great story telling ability.Overall , Ben Folds is an AMAZING piano player ( and completely nuts live ) . The songs transcend & quot ; piano music & quot ; and this album has a fun , youthful tone to it , which seems to be a rarity in & quot ; piano music & quot ; as well.If you 're a little bit alternative , then this is a must own album .	1
`` Hand me my nose ring ! Can we be haaappy ? Show me the mosh pit . Can we be haaappy ? WE CAN BE HAPPY UNDERGROUND ! `` By far the greatest album released by Ben Folds Five . It is great from start to finish . It 's so melodic and harmonious that it blows my mind . You wo n't be disapointed ! A couple of my favs are : `` Philosophy '' & `` Underground '' .Enjoy ! ! !	1
If you are n't familiar with the band they consist of a piano/lead singer ( who 's name is Ben Folds ) , a bass , and drums . They have a very unique sound , and they all came out of heavy metal bands ( weird , huh ) . This album gives me the feeling that this is the real , raw Ben Folds . Before the crazy success of & quot ; Whatever and Ever Amen & quot ; due to the song & quot ; Brick & quot ; . My favorites on this CD are & quot ; Jackson Cannery & quot ; , & quot ; Alice Childress & quot ; , & quot ; Underground & quot ; , and & quot ; Boxing & quot ; . If you bought Whatever and Ever Amen I highly recomend you experience this side of Ben Folds Five , and if you are just looking for a great album with a fresh sound , this is it .	1
Well , this is it kids , a trip back in time ... before the & quot ; Whatever & amp ; Ever , Amen & quot ; days , there was an album simply called & quot ; Ben Folds Five & quot ; . It was good . Very good . Too bad they wouldnt put & quot ; emaline & quot ; on it , because it is a terrific song , but despite that omission , it is *Still* a GOOD album . If you like Ben Folds 's stuff , you should pick this up . Pick it up if you 're not . Buy it . Enjoy it . Love it , it will love you back , i promise . OK , this reviews is n't so good , i know . Maybe its because I had all the songs downloaded before i bought it , and denied myself the glory of enjoying it as a whole , but regardless , It IS A GOOD ALBUM . Buy it , for me & amp ; Ben .	1
I have everything Ben has ever done since this album ( with the 5 , by himself , with the Bens , etc. ) . This is still my favorite collection of Ben Folds tunes ever . Of course I will always have a place in my heart for Whatever and Ever Amen ( I listened to it literally 1000 's of times after it was released ! ) but this is the disc I can go back to and listen to all the way through any time ( Whatever and Ever has some definite slow sections ) . This first eponymous CD is filled with great songs ... every single one a `` keeper . '' `` Jackson Cannery '' , `` Philosophy , '' `` Boxing , '' `` Uncle Walter , '' `` Underground '' ... great songs to drive around in your car and rock out to . These guys were so good ... I like Ben 's solo work , of course , but the Ben Folds Five were the greatest .	1
The first CD put out by Ben Folds Five is the beginning of an era . True , it may not have the same sound as & quot ; Whatever , & quot ; but I assure it is still the masterwork of Ben Folds . As readings about the album shows , Ben mixes from the best , taking the styles of Gerscwinn , Jerry Lee Lewis , and even Little Richard . This is a fun album to listen to . Ben puts forth an amazing amount of feeling through his intriguing lyrics and style of play . Try it out , I am sure that you if you are a fan of the piano , you will be a fan of this album .	1
An energetic raw introduction to this eccentric trio . An unusual combo of piano & amp ; vocals ( Ben Folds ) , bass and drums works surprisingly well , with Folds hammering-chords more than compensating for the lack of guitar.Many pianists will be trying to play his cunning riffs ... Put this in the car and you 'll soon be bashing the dashboard rather than playing air-guitar at the traffic-lights . Whilst their later offerings have been more polished ( and with the exception of & quot ; Whatever and Ever , Amen & quot ; less satisfying ) , none have been as frantically engaging and down-right fun as this little stormer.A perfect summer record - crank it up , open the windows and find new friends . Everyone seems to like this stuff , but they do n't know who it 's by . Educate them !	1
Ben Folds can write a rockin ' pop tune . One after another . This record straight-up rocks . I ca n't imagine how anyone could not like this music.Look , I like all kinds of music . I listen to a lot of jazz and twentieth century classical music . I listen to a lot of avant garde and avant-rock ( big Mr. Bungle fan and all that entails ) . However , that does not mean that I have my head up my ass . I recognize a perfect pop song when I hear one . `` Jackson Cannery , '' `` Philosophy , '' `` Alice Childress , '' `` Underground , '' `` Uncle Walter , '' `` Julianne , '' `` Sports and Wine , '' are just a few examples of Ben Folds ' uncanny ability to craft one perfect hook after another.The band is tight and Robert Sledge 's bass tones are fantastic . He adds so much with just a subtle change of timbre . Do yourself a favor and buy a real rock record .	1
I recall hearing this and thinking Ben 's voice was n't so good , but that the piano rock of it was really fun . Okay , this album is n't as good as Whatever and Ever Amen ... but why would you choose to have just one ? That 's like picking a favorite Beatles album and saying you do n't need the rest . This is more straight ahead `` punk rock for sissies '' album than any of the follow ups . It 's a great album. [ ... ]	1
Most people who got into this CD got into it thanks to Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen , Ben Folds Five 's popular 1997 release . Whether that statement is true or not , you ca n't get past the fact that this album is an impressive one . All the songs are very , very good ; and a few of them qualify as some of the best unheard songs ever ( i.e . `` Philosophy '' or `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' ) . I actually believe , despite what others may think or say , this self-titled debut is better than Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen . There 's no doubt that `` Brick '' is Ben Folds Five 's best song ; I ca n't challenge that . But overall , I was more impressed with this release as a complete album . It has some of Ben Folds ' most carefree lyrics , but emphasizes the piano better than any of their CDs . Here 's a quick rundown of the 12 songs.The first song also happens to be one of the best : `` Jackson Cannery '' . I 'm not sure if it 's a personalized song , but shouts the line ` big brother got the keys / and I got Jackson Cannery ' ; some bitterness towards a brother or not it 's still a joyous song . `` Philosophy '' is certainly a song that should not go unheard . It is an excellent song , perhaps the best on the CD and best of Ben Folds Five . Its ending is awesome ; from the jamming on the piano to the ` 1-2-3-4 ' chant ( somewhat uncharacteristic of BBF ) that leads right into `` Julianne '' . `` Julianne '' is one of those ` I'm-over-you-and-loving-it ' songs . Hand 's down , it 's my favorite song on the disc . It starts brilliantly : ` I met this girl / she looked like Axel Rose ' . It could be dubbed as annoying , since the end hangs onto the ` anne ' a bit too long . But nonetheless it 's an exceptional song ; one that should n't go overlooked . When it comes to `` Where 's Summer B. ? `` , there is not much that can be said . The B stands for been , but still you may not get into this one as easily as the previous three . Also , I 'm not quite sure if summer is a person or the just season ; it 's hard to tell . `` Alice Childress '' is probably the low point of the CD . The lyrics seem to flow through the music in a way that 's not all that pleasing . Yet it 's definitely not bad . `` Underground '' has a fantastically bizarre start ; one that 'll make you wonder what the heck they 're talking about ( ` hand me my nose ring / show me the moshpit ' ) . But it develops into a truly good track after about 35 seconds . It 's pretty much a song about being different ; nothing more , nothing less . `` Sports & amp ; Wine '' is another weird-starter . It 's a fast-paced song , and to be honest I usually skip over it -- only to get to `` Uncle Walter '' . Which is probably Ben Folds Five 's most heard of unheard song ( if that makes any sense ) . I think we all know that scornful relative who tells bullcrap stories and is a bit uncomfortable to be around . It 's a very likable song . It uses some entertaining lyrics and good music to really stand out as a hit on the second half of the CD . Along with `` Uncle Walter '' , `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' is another admirable track . And as I mentioned above , it 's one of the best songs BBF have ever produced . Enough good can not be said about the song ; the lyrics , again , are genius and hilarious at the same time . The song `` Video '' also could be considered a low point , but once more it 's not bad at all . It 's an average tune , but does have some good lines . I think , when we come to the final two songs , it 's safe to say Ben Folds Five saved their best for last . `` The Last Polka '' and `` Boxing '' are both distinguished songs . There 's not much to `` The Last Polka '' , but its simplicity is what adds to its endless greatness . If you liked Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen 's `` Fair '' , then you will simply love it . It 's a good song , and much different from the closer , `` Boxing '' . Again , I do n't think Ben Folds ever took up boxing or deemed it to be a career choice , although he did almost enlisted in the army ( `` Army '' ; on The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner ) . But that does n't matter . And its finish really leaves you feeling pleased with the entire album ; as the fading piano will take your breath away.Ultimately , you will have no trouble loving this CD . Ben Folds Five struck gold ( although not with some reviewers ) with this 1995 debut statement . It may not be a perfect 5 stars , but it is more than just plain four . I 'd give it around 4.5 . And although Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen may be what put them on the map ; just remember where their road to success began . Which is right here . With tracks like `` Philosophy '' and `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' , you have songs that could 've easily become big hits . And with `` Julianne '' and `` Uncle Walter '' , you have two songs that have become many fan 's favorites . So do n't miss out on one of the better CDs in the piano-based music industry . It 's extremely amazing and does not deserve the horrid title of a forgotten debut album .	1
The consensus ( which happens to be true ) is that Sinatra 's best period was the middle one , the years he recorded for Capitol Records , 1953-61 . His best Capitol material was the recordings he made with Nelson Riddle as arranger . Finally , Songs for Swingin ' Lovers , from 1956 , is with good reason considered to be the finest Sinatra/Riddle Capitol album , at least of a swinging , non-ballad sort . Personally , A Swingin ' Affair , recorded later the same year but released in 1957 , comes so close that it depends on which I 've listened to most recently . Certainly , if you want to convince someone that , despite his boorish personality and many musical compromises , Sinatra DID sometimes record worthwhile music , you 'd do well to play them Songs for Swingin ' Lovers . This is also the album that fans most often throw on the stereo when they do n't want to pick nits about production , arrangements , vocals , or song selection . Everything came together perfectly -- -Sinatra was at his vocal peak , in simpatico settings , interpreting some of the best songs of Tin Pan Alley , and brimful of confidence and spotaneity . There 's just the right mixture of tenderness and swagger ; listen to the rendition of & quot ; I 've Got you Under My Skin & quot ; , which counts as one of the four or five best Sinatra performances on record . & quot ; You 're Getting To Be A Habit With Me , & quot ; & quot ; Too Marvelous For Words , & quot ; & quot ; I Thought About You & quot ; , & quot ; Swingin ' Down the Lane , & quot ; & quot ; Anything Goes , & quot ; & quot ; How About You ? & quot ; -- -so many of the songs here are top-drawer , both as songs and performances , that it 's mind-boggling . And there are a lot of them too -- -15 songs in all , uncommonly generous for the early LP era . Too generous for Capitol , which released mutilated versions of this and other Sinatra albums ( Swingin ' Affair also initially sported 15 tracks ) amputating several songs from American pressings for decades . The true , original versions of these masterpieces were only available as imports form British EMI until the CD editions came out in 1987 . Now I read from some of these Amazon reviews that these albums have suffered a further indignity by being reissued in & quot ; remastered & quot ; editions that sound terrible . I thank God that I finally bought a CD copy of SFSL a year or two BEFORE the botched remaster was dumped on the market . It 's a sad and frustrating development , but much as I 'd like to blame Capitol , I think we have Sinatra 's daughter Tina to thank for this . She has control of the estate , the business , and most importantly , the music . I 'm sure that when the decision was made to dun the public with a remaster of Frank 's albums , Tina left no corner uncut . What a shame.So get the OLDER CD ( with the black left border ) , or get a used British EMI vinyl pressing , or get a beat-up fifties copy , or get a tape of this from a friend . Accept no substitutes , for in it 's original , unabbreviated , un-20-bit-botched configuration , Songs For Swingin ' Lovers is nonpareil .	1
Five stars is n't sufficient for an album that contains & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin , & quot ; one of the great vocal tracks sung by anyone . Many consider this song Sinatra 's greatest and Nelson Riddle 's arrangement is nothing short of electric . This is an album where you can put it on , hit play and never fast forward , all the songs are eminently Sinatraesque and every single arrangement has a touch of genius.Frank 's phrasing is ( as always at this stage of his career ) letter perfect . Listen to & quot ; It Happened in Monterey ... & quot ; never a particular hit , Frank rarely sang it live , but who cares ? It 's immortalized here , forever.If you love Sinatra , you will already have had this on vinyl and cassette ( maybe even eight track ) . If you 're new to Frank , do n't hesitate one moment : grab it and listen to it for the rest of your life .	1
Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra does n't appeal to me as much as his darker side does , there 's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing , and the Voice delivered a tune -- virtually any tune -- better than jsut about anyone , save Ella Fitzgerald.And , while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me , & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin & quot ; is perfection , & quot ; It Happened In Monterey & quot ; shimmys seductively , and Sinatra 's quiet approach to & quot ; Anything Goes & quot ; is charming .	1
My Dad was a Sinatra fan . We twice thoroughly enjoyed watching a tape I made of a PBS Great Performances broadcast of Sinatra 's best television appearances ( sadly unavailable on DVD ) . My own appreciation of Sinatra has grown over the years . When our library purchased this CD , I was eager to audition it.I agree that Sinatra was at a peak vocally when he recorded this album . Some of his live performances are more loose , but in later years his voice was not up to par . It 's a matter of taste . I am perfectly happy with the subtle yet expressive variations that Sinatra uses to perform these songs , many of them classics.I was less happy with the Nelson Riddle arrangements . They seem excessively busy . They call attention to themselves when they ought to lay back and let the focus be on the soloist , i.e . Sinatra.Riddle infuses his charts with little ornamentations , flourishes that strike me as a bit hokey , even clownish at times -- invention and variety for its own sake , rather than supporting and deepening the underlying rhythm , chord structure , and melody of the composition . My description here perhaps makes them sound a little more annoying than they actually are . Certainly some songs on this album evidence these flaws more than others . I am far from having encyclopedic knowledge of the big arrangers of the era gone by , but I 've heard many by Claus Ogerman , and as a point of contrast , I think he was more serious and at the same time laid back in his charts . Here again , it is a matter of taste . I thought the orchestra called too much of the wrong kind of attention to itself too often on Songs for Swingin ' Lovers.In the final analysis , with great songs and Sinatra himself in great form , I still have to dock one star off a perfect five for the arrangements , which distract me from time to time with their obtrusive , pointless , sometimes silly little flourishes.On the topic of sound quality , although I have not heard the original CD release , the remastered version truly does sound sub-par . Sinatra 's upper registers , brass , strings , all seem to suffer from some subtle distortion that smudges detail and creates a sort of odd , artificial electronic haze . Really , hearing-impaired people should not be involved in mastering classic albums . Whoever did the job on Songs for Swingin ' Lovers should probably be doing something more suited to his talents , like driving a cab . Although it is hard to put your finger on it exactly , there is something most definitely `` wrong '' with the sound . I 'm fairly familiar with what recordings from the mid-50s sound like , and I ca n't believe the original master tape of this Sinatra record ever sounded as bad as this . I may buy this album -- its reputation as a classic is deserved ( with my reservation about the arranging ) -- but if I do , I will seek out the early release , not the later remastered CD .	1
The fourth of the Sinatra-Riddle LP 's on Capitol , and an incredible collection . The '87 CD reissue sounded great , as did the Gold Ultradisk that is reputed to be *the* gem in the Ultradisk catalogue . This latest digital remaster is apparently not up to those sonic standards , unfortunately . This is particularly disheartening , given the beautiful recording quality of these 1950s Capitol master tapes . The soundstage that the earlier discs can produce lends a clarity and power to Nelson Riddle 's arrangements that is truly breathtaking.Remastering aside , this is still a landmark recording . The liner notes peg the feeling of this collection quite well : & quot ; bright , insouciant , urbane , witty , colored with the smoky pastel hues and easy , buoyant rhythms of jazz. & quot ; This collection is a textbook of Sinatra 's free and easy stylings , obviously well-read by the likes of Harry Connick , Jr . Nothing points this up more clearly than the first track , & quot ; You Make Me Feel So Young , & quot ; which Connick has & quot ; borrowed & quot ; verbatim from this recording.Sinatra 's voice still has a very youthful edge to it , but he 's clearly in the prime of his stylistic control . It 's the best of both worlds.The fifteen tracks include many excellent standards , all given the Sinatra- Riddle treatment . Personal favorites include & quot ; You 're Getting to be a Habit With Me & quot ; & quot ; Love is Here to Stay & quot ; & quot ; I Thought About You & quot ; and & quot ; How About You ? & quot ; One of the recording arts and sciences greatest achievements .	1
I 've heard , and ( here ) read , countless bashings on the re-issue of Sinatra cd 's . Many complain of everything from sound quality to packaging . To be honest , if you 're out buying Sinatra on CD , you 're already compromising . A CD is , by definition , a compromised version of the & quot ; original , & quot ; so get over it ... 20-bit or no 20-bit . Get a life , and stop pretending you have such a golden ear.I own countless Sinatra 78 's ( yes , for a wind up Victrola dating 1906 ) , and numerous original Sinatra LP 's . Likewise , I own dozens upon dozens of Sinatra cd 's , both & quot ; original & quot ; ( yeah , right ) and & quot ; re-issued. & quot ; I own copies of cd 's that have n't yet made it to & quot ; re-issue. & quot ; In this list are some Frank 's best ( i.e. , & quot ; When No One Cares & quot ; and & quot ; Nice and Easy & quot ; ... and , maybe , for much later-era Frank & quot ; Cycles & quot ; ) . And to be honest , as cd 's go I ca n't tell much of hell of difference between the old cd 's and the & quot ; new & quot ; cd 's outside of packaging . AND that 's being played on a Bang and Olufsen with Bose Acoustimass speakers . So , as a helpful pointer , disregard all further talk on & quot ; sound quality. & quot ; Now , on to this release.This one , in short , is amazing . It captures a jovial Frank , full of spring ( and , to be trite , swing ) . Yes , the version of & quot ; I 've got you under my skin & quot ; is one of the best I have ever heard . Bar None . Period . But , I 'm partial to ANYTHING by Cole Porter , so perhaps I 'm biased.Definitely , when I 'm not focused on the down-and-out Frank ( a side I think I like far too much to be healthy ) , I reach for this one . Next to this , & quot ; Come Fly with Me , & quot ; & quot ; A Swingin ' Affair , and & quot ; Come dance with me & quot ; are sure-fire solid-senders.But to be sure , if you have to get only one of the brightly-swingin Sinatra discs , get this one .	1
This is arguably Frank Sinatra 's best album . It features great `` swingin ' '' arrangements of love songs by Nelson Riddle . And Sinatra was at the top of his game as a singer of popular songs at the time . This is one of the `` must have '' albums for any Frank Sinatra fan . I have the 24 KT Gold Plated edition of this CD , which is nice , but I ca n't really say it sounds any better than the `` regular '' version of the CD .	1
Songs for Swingin ' Lovers is probably at or near the top of anyone 's list of Sinatra albums , one of the best popular vocal albums of the past 100 years . On this album more than any others , we find a perfect set list , arranged by Nelson Riddle , performed by Sinatra at his vocal peak . The album has no weak moments . From the opener , 'You Make Me Feel So Young ' through the end , tempos vary , but all songs belong right where they are , so much so that for me it is awkward to hear some of these classics out of the context of Songs for Swingin ' Lovers . While critics and Sinatra fans love to critique albums and performances endlessly , this one remains something of a Sistine Chapel.Highlights are legion , but no one would argue with 'I 've Got You Under My Skin ' , which finds FS ' soaring vocals rivaled only by Milt Bernhart 's riveting trombone solo , said to be the most famous solo ever recorded by this instrument . 'Too Marvelous for Words ' and 'You Brought a New Kind of Love To Me ' have Sinatra in an audibly exhuberant mood . 'It Happened in Monterey ' may be one of his best recordings ever , with lyrics excelled only by the Voice and the Arranger . As if Sinatra 's vocals were n't enough , Riddle 's orchestrations deliver the right amount of interest and harmony and never get in the way.As with In the Wee Small Hours and A Swingin ' Affair , the five-star rating is moot -- even the most casual or indifferent listener will take notice of this high watermark of 20th century music . There is nothing 'old ' or 'quaint'-sounding about Songs for Swingin ' Lovers . Be warned , however , that you will probably find almost anything recorded lately to be like cooking sherry after a taste of vintage Sinatra/Riddle.In 1956 , Capitol ( and everyone else ) was producing monaural recordings , but the fastidious attention of Capitol engineers resulted in mono recordings that put many early stereophonic efforts to shame . I own the original CD version ( 1987 ? ) , so I can not address the reported problems with the remastered version , but without question this album should be in everyone 's music library .	1
You know , if so much material these days is coming out with explicit lyric warnings , why not put reproductive warnings on Frank Sinatra 's music ? Frank claims that the `` wee small hours '' album is partially responsible for the baby boom era , I think this one was a major contributor too . Listening to these gems always gets me in a good mood , an ever-pleasant reminder that any season is a good reason for makin ' whoopee .	1
Songs For Swingin ' Lovers is , like SInatra 's other classic albums from the same period , without question one of the greatest moments in the annals of pop music . It 's a record that radiates pure , unadulterated joy , a set of gorgeously sculpted musical constructions that defy both time and gravity . Frank sounds positively jubilant here , attacking classics like `` You Make Me Feel So Young , '' `` Love Is Here To Stay , '' and `` I 've Got You Under My Skin '' with passion and grace . The selection ( not to mention Nelson Riddle 's brilliant arrangements ) is a glorious affirmation of the Great American Songbook , displaying a golden age of American pop in all its jazzy , swingin ' glory . The arrangements are both lush and light , sumptuous sound labyrinths that swing with the energy of a thousand moonlight serenades and champagne coated New York reveries . This is pop music as it was meant to be heard , full of palpable emotion and wonderfully wrought melodies , without an ounce of prefab conceit or commercial calculation . This is an absolute masterpiece of American music , and the kind of record that everybody , music nut or otherwise , should own . That includes you , bub !	1
If we are talking about essential Frank Sinatra albums for a music collection , the first one would have to be 1954 's & quot ; In the Wee Small Hours , & quot ; a superb collection of ballads that helped establish the former bobbysoxer heartthrob as the premier saloon singer of his generation . But I would argue that the second album on that list should be 1955 's & quot ; Songs for Swingin ' Lovers , & quot ; in which Sinatra and arranger Nelson Riddle go in the opposite direction , providing a stellar collection of pop standards reinterpreted for the crooner who was becoming a damn fine singer.Several of the songs , such as & quot ; Pennies From Heaven & quot ; and & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin , & quot ; actually predated the start of Sinatra 's career , but in the case of the latter Sinatra provided what is arguably the definitive version of the Cole Potter classic and the song that in retrospect defined Frank Sinatra as the premier vocalist of the 20th century ( sorry for that gross understatement , but you get the idea ) . The zesty tone for the album is established with the opening track , & quot ; You Make Me Feel So Young , & quot ; while other great tracks if you had to be picky would be & quot ; You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me & quot ; and & quot ; Too Marvelous for Words. & quot ; All of these songs give you the undeniable sense that Sinatra is just having a great time singing each and every one of them . Riddle 's arrangements , done with a core rhythm section and a full orchestra , are the key to unlocking the door to musical greatness and are as fine as anything he ever did for Sinatra or anyone else . Part of the problem is that nobody really remembers what most of these songs sounded like before Riddle and Sinatra reworked them into the songs we know today . I may well change my mind tomorrow , but today I would make the case that & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin & quot ; is the greatest Frank Sinatra song .	1
Probably my favourite Sinatra 's album . Released in 1956 . Arrangements are done by Nelson Riddle and songs are fabulous . Here you can hear such great songs like on of his biggest hit , Cole Porter 's I 've Got You Under My Skin , Gershwin brothers ' Love Is Here To Stay , ... Pennies From Heaven was a big hit for Louis Prima , Anything Goes ( another Porter 's composition ) for Ella Fitzgerald , ... This is one of his best albums ( and not only for Capitol Records ) .So , lay down and enjoy this fabulous set .	1
Frank Sinatra polished and perfected his style and expertise to incredible heights by the 1950s . Songs For Swingin ' Lovers demonstrates how Frank Sinatra could deliver a song beautifully and masterfully . The liner notes correctly state that by this point in his career Frank had `` learned to tease and twist a vocal line without violating its integrity . '' Moreover , Nelson Riddle ably assists Sinatra by providing sublime musical arrangements for all the songs on this CD . Frank and Nelson make each song so beautiful that you would swear you were hearing these songs for the very first time ! There is a freshness to each number that stuns you . Excellent ! The CD opens with the Frank Sinatra signature song `` You Make Me Feel So Young . '' Frank 's voice has matured into a strong , masculine and potent force that could caress a song or belt it out depending on how Sinatra thought it should be performed . The big band arrangement by Riddle shines , too . This track alone is worth the entire cost of the CD ! `` It Happened In Monterey '' follows ; this song has a beautiful intro by the musicians and Sinatra sings this number with all the panache of the most consummate professional ever ! `` It Happened In Monterey '' explores a romantic affair that may well have been Frank 's one true love even if he was already committed to another woman.Other great classic numbers on this CD include the playful `` You 're Getting To Be A Habit With Me ; '' `` Too Marvelous For Words '' which deals with the joy Frank experiences with his new lover ; `` Pennies From Heaven '' with its great orchestration and the amusing song entitled `` Makin ' Whoopee '' by Donaldson and Kahn . `` Our Love Is Here To Stay '' gets the super-duper romantic treatment from The Chairman Of The Board ; Riddle 's arrangement helps to make this number an instant Frank Sinatra classic . `` Anything Goes '' again demonstrates the magic Sinatra and Riddle infuse into a song to make it so very special.The CD ends with `` How About You ? '' written by Lane and Freed . Sinatra asks his new love if she likes all the same pleasures in life that he values so much . `` How About You ? '' also draws you in so that you experience the irresistible temptation to listen to the entire CD all over again ! The liner notes boast great cover art and the song credits are provided , too . Pete Welding contributes an essay about the work that Sinatra and Riddle did together.Sinatra fans should consider this CD to be a `` must-have '' for their collection ; and people who enjoy classic pop vocals will treasure this album , too . If you enjoy this CD I highly recommend other Sinatra CDs . Diehard Sinatra fans will also want to get Frank Sinatra : Vegas which features four CDs and a DVD as well.Thank you , Frank and Nelson ! ! ! !	1
What can anyone possibly add to the Sinatra conversation ? For most men , living one of his lives would have been sufficient . But for `` The Chairman , '' the Greatest Entertainer of the 20th Century , reality and myth have fused to forge a reputation that long ago escaped the gravitational pull of mere mortality.The `` facts '' alone are as daunting as they are unassailable - more Billboard placements than Elvis , The Beatles and Michael Jackson combined - the highest grossing entertainer of all time by a factor of 3x - Oscars , Emmy 's Grammy 's - a parade of the most beautiful women that ever lived - consigliere to the Kennedy 's and the Giancana 's and , for good measure , on the seventh day he transformed Vegas from a sandy rat trap in the Nevada desert to the 'rat-packed ' , `` What Happens in Vegas ... . '' entertainment mecca that it is today.So with all of that back-story clogging the narrative the logical question should be - was his singing really as good as your older relatives claim ? The short answer is - it was better ! There 's a reason Sinatra turned from a noun into a verb and on his 1956 masterpiece , Songs For Swingin ' Lovers he proves why.Swingin ' Lovers is Sinatra in full measure - sublime vocals , impeccable phrasing and , a songbook that cherry-picked the best from the legendary mid-century song-smiths . With Nelson Riddle at the controls , Sinatra chilled , belted and crooned his way through the best of the Gershwin 's , Cole Porter , Billy Rose , Whiting & Mercer - just to mention a few heavyweights lending support . It is almost impossible to listen to the record and not wish you were knocking a few back at Toots Shor 's watching Frank and his entourage hold court . This is definitive Sinatra and pure proof why men become legends and legends become myths.ESSENTIAL for every collection .	1
Frank Sinatra is a One OF a Kind Artist.His Voice is TImeless.You can Never Get Enough of The Genius & amp ; Quality that was His Tones.Together with Nelson Riddle they create this Very Essential Recording.The Arrangements & amp ; Production are Top Notch here.What A Great Musical Force !	1
Many people under the age of 50 probably have an image of the older Frank Sinatra , belting out & quot ; New York , New York , & quot ; or clowning with Sammy , Dean , and Joey in some Rat Pack picture.One listen to & quot ; Songs for Swingin ' Lovers , & quot ; however , it quickly becomes obvious that Frank Sinatra was more than just an aging lounge singer , and this album is one of the landmark albums of the 20th century.From the beginning chords of & quot ; You Make Me Feel So Young , & quot ; which opens the albums , Sinatra and arranger Nelson Riddle are in prime form . The hits keep coming , & quot ; It Happened in Monterey , & quot ; & quot ; You 're Getting to Be a Habit With Me , & quot ; & quot ; Pennies from Heaven , & quot ; & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin , & quot ; & quot ; Makin ' Whoopee , & quot ; & quot ; Anything Goes , & quot ; etc . Sinatra 's singing is impeccable and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra swings.This album , along with Sinatra 's & quot ; A Swingin ' Affair , & quot ; are generally regarded as among his best , and among the top albums of all time . These are the first of the & quot ; concept & quot ; albums , and , along with & quot ; Sings for Only the Lonely , & quot ; provide examples of why Sinatra was considered one of our most important artists . If you like music , any kind of music , then you need to have these in your CD library .	1
`` Listening to the marvelously sympathetic , effortlessly swinging orchestrations Riddle provided the singer on these selections , it 's easy to understand why the album is rightly considered one of their landmark achievements - as satisfying today as when recorded 30 years ago , and just as fresh-sounding - and why Sinatra described Riddle as `` the greatest arranger in the world . '' ~ Pete Welding ~I concur with Frank Sinatra when he described Nelson Riddle as `` the greatest arranger in the world . '' I would say that these two musical icons belonged to MAS ( Mutual Admiration Society ) -- both had nothing but deep admiration for each other 's creativity in their respective art , and they brought the very best in each other . `` Songs for Swingin ' Lovers ! '' is a true representation of one of the many superb albums they recorded together.Do n't miss out on his ear-catching interpretations of fifteen gleaming standards enhanced by Riddle 's sublime chart arrangements , to name a few , `` You Brought A New Kind of Love To Me , '' `` Too Marvelous for Words , '' `` Pennies From Heaven '' and `` Love Is Here To Stay . '' Do n't look any further , the best versions are here for your pure listening delight . And for something special , please listen closely and focus your ears to the Chairman 's heartfelt reading of Frankie Laine and Carl Fischer 's gem of a song , `` We 'll Be Together Again . `` `` Someday , some wayWe both have a lifetime before usFor parting is not goodbyeWe 'll be together again '' When it comes to Frank Sinatra , one can go and on using all the superlatives to write about his recordings , his music and his one-of-a-kind artistry , but mine will remain candid yet nifty ... suffice it to say that this is one of the finest recordings of all-time . I enjoyed listening to it and I 'll endlessly spread the word that this gem of an album is worthy to every Sinatra collector.With my heartfelt recommendation .	1
For sheer joy and energy , this is Sinatra at his apex . Every song is excellent , with crystal-clear sound , brassy horns , top-notch Nelson Riddle arranging , and Sinatra at his vocal best . This album is often listed as one of the top 100 albums in any genre ever made , in often eclectic lists including everything from the Beatles to Nirvana to Miles Davis , John Coltrane , and the Beach Boys . And though it 's hard to narrow it down to one album , this is in my opinion Sinatra 's best . The songs are upbeat , and there is no way one can listen to this album without feeling better about life.I have this on both CD and vinyl . The sound quality on the CD is clear and sharp .	1
I own several Sinatra albums , but this in my opinion is the best of them all . Released in 1956 , it features arrangements and orchestra led by Nelson Riddle , who I feel was the best arranger of them all . There are many other Sinatra albums that come close , `` Come Fly With Me '' `` Come Dance With Me '' , `` A Swingin ' Affair '' , `` Come Swing With Me '' and most all the Capitols are excellent , but this one overall is the one I keep coming back to . If you love the great American Songbook , you 'll love this one . My faves `` You 're getting to be a habit with me '' , `` You make me feel so young '' `` I 've got you under my skin '' and many others . The remastered sound makes it an absolute must purchase . Mickey Mantle had his peak year in 1956 with 52 homers while batting.353 . Mr. Sinatra also had his peak year as well with this one . If you only have one Sinatra album , ( outside of greatest hits compilations ) it 's got to be this one .	1
This was my introduction to Sinatra , thanks to the rave reviews it received from Downbeat critics and readers upon its release in the fifties . It still holds up as Sinatra 's best-balanced , most polished swing album , the standard by which his later versions of the same songs can be compared . This is not to say that the interpretations he gives here are the definitive ones : some listeners may prefer later , looser versions of & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin & quot ; or & quot ; Pennies from Heaven. & quot ; But without this album it 's pointless to judge the later versions -- by Sinatra or anyone else . With this album Sinatra , more than any other male vocalist , showed what distinguishes a jazz singer from a pop crooner .	1
This album was recorded in 1956.It could have been recorded today , next year , or in 2021 . A totally unique musical experience for any novice . Now for the youth set , maybe & quot ; Come Dance With Me & quot ; would be a better pick , since that has more supercharged rhythm , and possibly a tighter band.But & quot ; Swingin Lovers & quot ; ( recorded several years earlier ) probably has greater all around appeal.There are some strings here and there which give the tunes depth , and at times a sense of mystery even . Specifically , my favorites are & quot ; Under My Skin & quot ; ( obviously ) , & quot ; It Happened in Monterey ( terrific buildup ) , & quot ; I Thought About You & quot ; , and the underrated & quot ; We 'll Be Together Again & quot ; which has a terrific brass and strings battle , featuring the solo trumpet chirping of & quot ; Sweets & quot ; Edison. & quot ; Makin ' Whoopee & quot ; should be heard by any soon-to-be ex-bachelor with a sense of humor. & quot ; DEvil Moon & quot ; , & quot ; Love is Here to Stay & quot ; , and & quot ; Pennies From Heaven & quot ; are given the Definitive Sinatra-Riddle teamwork.All in all,15 super classy swingers , with only 2 that may not be up to par , but that leaves 13 all-time , definitive Sinatra recordings , which for an original recording might make the record-books !	1
These recordings are now nearly fifty years old , but they contain an excitement that does n't diminish with time . Following quickly on the heels of his success with IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS , a 40-year-old Frank Sinatra teamed up once again with arranger/conducter Nelson Riddle and created what is arguably his best album of a stellar career . Sinatra is one of those artists that each generation rediscovers for itself . As an aging Baby Boomer , I hope that audiences will continue to listen to the Beatles a hundred years from now ; but I KNOW they will be listening to Sinatra -- class simply never goes out of style ! If you own only one Sinatra album , this is it . ESSENTIAL	1
I downloaded this MP3 as the Deal of the Day on February 14 , 2011 , despite some concerns about the sound after reading the 1-star reviews about the bad quality of the 1998 remaster . I am listening to it with good quality headphones , and the sound seems clear and well defined to me.I have n't heard the previous remaster the other reviewers are talking about . Maybe a side by side comparison would make it clear why they hate this remaster . However , as someone coming to this recording cold , with no reference except a memory of listening to the old LP version many years ago , it sounds pretty good.The album itself is excellent , an upbeat , romantic follow up in 1956 to the beautifully depressing 1955 release `` In the Wee Small Hours '' . Sinatra released a lot of great concept albums in the 1950s , and this is one of the best ! .It 's number 306 on Rolling Stone 's list of the top 500 albums of all time . Not that that should really matter to anyone , but it is a good indication that the record has some street credibility among reviewers who think about these things . Lots of standards people will recognize without simply being a string of `` greatest hits '' . Highly recommended !	1
Normally I am a ballads type of person . I especially Love hearing a balld sung by Frank Sinatra . I approached thia album with a slight bit of trepidation . Would I like an album made up entirely of swingin tunes instead of ballads.What was i thinking ? ! Silly me.Songs for swinging loversis n't just a good Frank Sinatra album it 's in my opinion one of his bests . The opening track you make me feel so young sets the tone for the entire album ; upbeat , vibrant and of course swinging . Frank is in fine form as he belts out a slew of standards as if he 's written them . His phrasing excellent , his tone impeccable and THAT VOICE ... My comments would be incomplete without saying something about the arrangement by Nelson Riddle , a long time Sinatra conductor and arranger . His lush arrangements fit perfectly with Sinatra 's voice . They both seem to be working on the same wave length . My Faves are It happened in monterey , Too marvelous for words , I 've got you under my skin , I thought about you and we 'll be together again but the entire CD is great . Essential for Sinatra fans .	1
What else is there to say ? Sinatra was never in better voice . Song selection superb . Accompaniment perfect . One of the finest LP 's ever made , and just as good on compact disc , if not better .	1
Not as energetic as my other favorite bebop pieces , but still very engaging , great solos . A *very* solid jazz album if there ever was one . Highly recommended .	1
Cut in 1958 for the Blue Note Lable , Somethin ' Else is one of the all time great jazz albums . The personnel features Cannonball on alto , Miles Davis on Trumpet , Hank Jones on piano , Sam Jones on bass , and the great Art Blakey on drums . It may say Cannonball Adderly on the album cover , and have Miles Davis listed as a sideman , but this has the feel of a Miles Davis album all the way . The selection of material and the musician 's laid back approach , tempered by the contrast of Mile 's simmering mute with an expressive firey second horn , here the exuberant Adderley , are trademarks from this era of Davis ' career . Regardless of who led the session , it is one any fan of jazz simply must have . It is one of those rare albums that is immediately accessable , and you can tell you will be listening to repeatedly from the first note . Every track 's performance is a highlight , but Cannonball 's playing is particularly inspired , especially his soulful blues soaked soloing on Dancing in the dark , and boppish flight on One For Daddy-O . Miles is dramatic , soulful , vulnerable , and sultry all at once . His muted playing on the first two tracks is simply sumptuous , with his open horn solo on One For Daddy-O and his & quot ; call and response & quot ; exchange with Adderley at the end of the title track being truly inspired . Hank Jones contributes a flawless hard swinging piano . Taking every note he is given and making it count , Hank makes his accompaniment as well as his solos sound as if he is playing them the only way they possibly could be . Art Blakey and the underrated Sam Jones are water tight in support , with Blakey unusually restrained throughout the album , his only solo space on the album 's final track . At the end of One For Daddy-O we hear a puckish Miles ask producer Alfred Lion , & quot ; Is that what you wanted , Alfred ? & quot ; , and then some I 'll wager . This is an album that will appeal to the jazz novice and the aficionado alike , if you do not have it , buy it , you wo n't be dissappointed .	1
A great disc by a great collection of musicians . Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others , specifically Miles Davis , yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his . 'Autumn Leaves ' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all . 'Love for sale ' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it . I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon ' but I 'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon ' on the back of the jewel case . A great introduction to Adderley 's work . Highly Recommended .	1
If you like jazz , if you love jazz , or if you are only getting introduced to it , this album belongs in your collection . It features an all-star group of performers ( anchored by the greatest artist of them all , Miles Davis ) and it is truly unforgettable . Worth every penny !	1
This album is a jazz classic and deservedly so . Only the title track lags a bit , but the others all soar . `` Autumn Leaves '' is a gem , and Cannonball 's feature on `` Dancing in the Dark '' is magnificent : I 've listened to that track at least a thousand times over the years , and everytime it moves me . A must-have CD .	1
Just one of the best jazz albums ever recorded . Lineup : Cannonball Adderly , Miles Davis , Hank Jones , Sam Jones , Art Blakey . Reminds you of the '27 Yanks , a murderer 's row of great talent . Great companion to the Miles Davis Kind of Blue album , another one in the top ten .	1
If you like Kind Of Blue , you are in for a real treat here . Adderley , Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own . The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus . Adderley 's joyful sound and Miles 's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album . Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves , since Miles 's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful .	1
I have this in SACD , and the RVG Edition , and a new copy , this is for a gift for someone who hears this at my place and loves it , I can send them away with a great recording . I was very lucky to have an aunt who instilled in me a love for jazz at a very young age . She like Clifford Brown fell victim to autos , which could have been safer , for the speeds they could attain.My loss was a family loss , Clifford Brown was a loss to jazz and music in general . I was lucky and was exposed to so much music , I moved from the Philadelphia area to the East Village in the 60 's to be closer to the music scene.I would not hesitate in suggesting this to anyone , it is a part of jazz history.There are recordings that no matter how many times you hear them they will fill you with something new . Music like this has an appeal that draws you out of yourself and into the artist 's vision . Good listening	1
As of now 36 customer reviews and an average of 5 stars . Something tells me this is a jazz classic ! The featured quintet is a who 's who of jazz greats , check it out . The music stands on it 's own merits and would pass any blinfold test by unknowing ears as to it 's authenticity and maybe even as to who is playing . Of course on the opening notes of the standard `` Autumn Leaves '' any jazz aficionado would recognize the essence of the cool Miles Davis 's licks . Another standard featured , `` Love For Sale , `` made famous by Lady Day is more uptempo , not as melancholy as Billie Holiday 's version and dispalys a more swinging interpretation . The title track `` Something Else '' walks the tightrope between hard bop and cool jazz with an affirmative rebirth . Nat Adderly is adept and versatile on this disc , showing his ability to integrate and utilize superb and diverse musicians for a cohesive uniform sound throughout the disc . The bonus track `` Bangoon '' is a lost treasure revived from the vaults and given the masterful treatment by Rudy Van Gelder . The disc has been remastered to beyond perfection and includes original liner notes and an additional essay by Bob Blumenthal that compliments the original . Great timeless music that has been given the sonic once over for the digital age . Highly recommended to any jazz collection .	1
Whenever I need a lift , this is a good choice to provide one . This is also one of those CD 's that , when I 'm facing my music collection and not sure what I 'm in the mood for , this is one of my `` default '' CD 's . ( The others areJazz in SilhouetteandBilly Taylor Trio . ) You just ca n't go wrong when Miles Davis is involved , and Adderley brings a whole new dimension to the definition of a small horn section . Blakey 's unmistakeable ferocity in driving the tunes provides a great backbone for the other musicians to build on , and each listening brings its own indescribable pleasure . I would say this is a CD that should be added to the collection of any serious jazz fan , and it would probably be a good choice for someone looking to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection .	1
Conventional wisdom holds that this is a Miles Davis album , and that is pretty much right - it 's an album led by Miles Davis , under Cannonball Adderley 's name , set up to showcase the altoist who had just joined Davis 's band . You can hear plenty of fine playing by Cannonball , but it 's in Davis 's world - the earthiness of many later Cannonball recordings is n't present.The similarities are particularly obvious on the classic interpretation of `` Autumn Leaves '' and the Davis original `` Somethin ' Else '' . `` Love for Sale '' was recorded under Davis 's leadership 3 months later , with Cannonball present , and it 's interesting to compare the two approaches . ( I prefer the Davis version , but they are both superb . ) Some people go further and compare this album to Kind of Blue . Yes , there are some similarities , particularly in the mood , but the `` cerebralness '' of the later album is largely absent on Somethin ' Else . Hank Jones and Art Blakey have a very different , more conservative feel than Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb . And the funky `` One for Daddy-O '' , a Nat original and the one tune that really screams `` Cannonball Adderley album ! `` , would n't really fit in on a Davis album , much less Kind of Blue.Overall a great album , and essential for most jazz fans .	1
Somehow I 've managed to listen & play jazz , but missed out on this album . Cannonball steals the show . But just listen to who he had for backup : Miles Davis ( tpt ) ; Hank Jones on piano ; Sam Jones on bass & the great Art Blakey ( remember the jazz messengers ? ) on drums.One critic said that Miles trumpet sounded shrill & tinny , but I do n't agree . I think the guy was just used to hearing him with a mute . You might like to get a CD called `` muted Miles '' but I have it & still do n't agree . BTW there is on this Blue Note reissue a bonus tune called `` Bandgoon '' about 5 minutes long , the last cut . Everybody gets into the act here . Miles , Cannonball , Blakey , Hank on piano . The only one who does n't solo is the bass player.As for the tunes , you 'll recognize `` Autumn Leaves '' & `` Love For Sale . '' But improvisers just `` play the changes '' & Adderly does a beautiful ballad . Like the jazzers say , `` Anyone can learn how to play fast , but it 's the guys who can do a great ballad that separates the men from the boys . '' I highly recommend this CD .	1
This was one of my favorite albums during my early middle school years . I listened to it virtually every day for months on end . There 's no surprise why ; Miles is at his best on this record and Cannonball , who is surprisingly less eminent here , still sounds great when he does play . Hank Jones was always a wonderful , tasteful pianist and here there is no difference . Art Blakey keeps a great beat throughout . & quot ; Autumn Leaves & quot ; is classic Miles Davis with his harmon mute , right up there with & quot ; Blue In Green & quot ; , & quot ; Bye Bye Blackbird & quot ; , and so many others . Cannonball sounds great here but Miles truly steals the show . The same thing happens on & quot ; Love For Sale & quot ; , which was a tune that became a standard part of the late 50 's repertoire for Miles and company . Hank Jones really gets into some good stuff on his piano solo , especially his introduction . Cannonball only solos once but it 's fire , and Miles and Hank take the rest . On the title track , Miles and Cannonball collaborate brilliantly on a tune where they trade parts of the theme . The results are great . Great soloing . The best part is that Miles shows that his chops have really skyrocketed nailing some nice High F 's and the like . & quot ; One For Daddy-O & quot ; is a slow blues where Cannonball really pulls out some of his best playing . His amazing technique tears through the heart of the blues and Miles plays a great solo as well . It 's a classic blues . On & quot ; Dancing In The Dark & quot ; , Cannonball solos wonderfully on this tender ballad and it remains tasteful throughout . Miles returns for a playful & quot ; Allison 's Uncle & quot ; to close out this album.This is an under-rated classic . Any fan of the Miles Davis Quintets and Sextets of the 1950 's will love this album .	1
As all concur this is a great jazz CD..know that the bonus track Alison 's Uncle on an earlier remasterered edition was exchanged for Bangoon on this edition of CD..I guess the better sound here and different track will increase copies sold ... why both were not included on this CD is beyond me..The down side ofperfectionists .	1
One of the best recordings in Jazz 's long history was made when five of the premire musicians of Jazz , Miles Davis , Cannonball Adderly , Art Blakey , and the other greats got together for this landmark recording . From the first song & quot ; Autumn Leaves & quot ; to the last song & quot ; Bangoon & quot ; , each and every song on this showcases the brilliant musicianship and uniqueness that this quintet had . Miles Davis on his unique and brilliant Trumpet , Cannonball Adderly on the Sax , and Art Blakey on the Drums , as well as the other greats on this show their fantastic style excellently . This timeframe of Jazz ( mid 1950 's to early 1960 's ) produced some of the absolute best recordings that Jazz ever offered.Something Else is a perfect way to introduce a person who never listened to Jazz to the fantastic , complex sound of the Jazz world . In my opinion , this is an album ( CD ) that every Jazz enthusiast MUST have in their collection , it is that brilliant and fresh and can be listened to with enjoyment over and over again . Well worth 5 stars and more !	1
This is simply one of those amazing recordings that just about everyone can agree on labeling a CLASSIC . And if any jazz recording truly deserves this description , it 's `` Somethin ' Else '' . It is my second favorite jazz album of all-time ( right behind `` Kind of Blue '' ) . The way Miles and Cannonball play off of each other is truly somethin ' special . It 's like watching an old William Powell - Myrna Loy movie , or Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen play basketball , two artists who seem to not only know the other like the back of their hand , but also seem to be able to feed off of one another , not so much in a competitive way , but more of a playful , venerating one . The result for us of course , is magical ! This classic is a perfect example of why art is so important in today 's society . I can be having the absolute worst day of my life , however as soon as I come home and turn a CD like this one on it 's almost as if my troubles seem to vanish within minutes . Try to it sometime , and see if I am just throwing out b.s . hyperbole . If you are a jazz fan and this does n't do it for you , then I do n't know what to recommend besides maybe some wine or opium . It would be like a classic rock fan who does n't like `` Revolver '' or `` Dark Side of the Moon '' . You might get a few fickle jazz fans out there who prefer different cups of tea , but for the most part ( as you can also see by the five-star Amazon rating ) this one is a no-brainer as most jazz zealots will agree.This album is just over 43 minutes of pure bliss . Everytime I play this one I enjoy it more than the time before . And what 's really ironic is the fact that everytime I play it I think the opposite - that I am actually going to be sick of the CD by now because of the many times I 've already played it . That Miles Davis sure had some kind of run during 1958 and 1959 . Has anyone in the history of music ( the Beatles included ) contributed more in nearly a two year span than this man ? Along with `` Somethin ' Else '' and `` Kind of Blue '' there were also `` Milestones '' , `` Sketches of Spain '' , `` Porgy and Bess '' , etc ... Not too shabby to say the least.So please , if you are new to jazz music , make this purchase right away . It 's not just about Miles and Cannonball , the rest of the quintet , the outstanding rythm section - Art Blakey ( drums ) , Sam Jones ( bass ) , and Hank Jones ( piano ) - all give inspired performances . I have never heard Art Blakey so restrained , but it works to perfection on this recording and his performance was perfect for it 's subtle , yet soft nature ( yes , drums can actually sound serene ) . This one deserves to be in it 's own category - 6 STAR REVIEW !	1
Due to his contractual restraints with Columbia , Miles Davis was forced to record this album under the guise of it being a Cannonball Adderley project . This is then a Cannonball session in name only . Clearly this work follows along the same lines as Kind Of Blue , Miles 's other masterwork also recorded in that bumper-crop year of 1958 . Hank Jones employees the same light minimalist touch on piano as Bill Evans signature work on Kind Of Blue . And , Miles and Cannonball interweave extraordinary melodies on standards & quot ; Autumn Leaves & quot ; , & quot ; Love For Sale & quot ; and & quot ; Dancing In The Dark & quot ; . This great ensemble work , along with the incomprable recording and production skills of the inimitable Rudy Van Gelder make Somethin ' Else one of the premiere post bop recordings of all time .	1
Before I launch into opinions that reflect my personal tastes more than being objective and factual , please take the time to listen to the sound samples on this page . They will convey what this album is about in richer detail than my weak writing skills.This album has a quality that sends chills every time I listen and soak in the way Miles ' trumpet is buoyed by Cannonball 's rich tone from his alto . I also think that the incredible rhythm section comprised of Hank Jones on piano , Sam Jones on bass and Art Blakey on drums is perfect for this session . I am especially impressed with the way Blakey - also known as the volcano - laid back and played with delicacy and beauty.I love this album on a number of levels ranging from the sensual rendition of Autumn Leaves to the final track - Bangoon - that is up tempo and swinging . That track was not on the original album , but it 's inclusion for this reissue is a nice treat.For my fellow jazz historians and hard core fans this album is also interesting because at the time this was recorded on March 9 , 1958 , Adderley was a member of Miles ' quintet , but on this album is the session leader with Miles as a sideman . And it works because you can clearly discern the difference in the way Cannonball approaches songs from the way Miles would . Cole Porter 's Love for Sale is a good example.A few final notes for the hisrorian : this was recorded in Rudy van Gelder 's Hackensack , NJ studio on the date noted above , and was released later in 1958 as Blue Note 1595 .	1
As I 've said before , I 'm not a particularly erudite jazzophile , I just appreciate a well-paced , melodic , and soulful jazz set when I hear it . And this record is superlative . Cannonball 's LP , seemingly centered around the masterful phrasings of Miles , brings some great musicians together . Each of them leave an indelible mark on this record , but never at the expense of the whole . In my mind , & quot ; Autumn Leaves & quot ; and & quot ; One for Daddy-O & quot ; are the standout tracks.Along with & quot ; Kind of Blue , & quot ; & quot ; Giant Steps , & quot ; & quot ; Moanin ' & quot ; and & quot ; Time Out , & quot ; ( among many others ) , this is an essential jazz record , not because Ken Burns or anyone else says so , but because it 's evident from the first listen . Go ahead and get it .	1
I genuinly agree with the 5 stars given to all the editions of this MARVELOUS albums ( one of my favorite modern jazz albums I 've heard so far ) ... I would just like to add that I agree with those who are of opinion that Miles , although officially the sideman on the Cannonball date , is actually the main star , with the glorious rhythm section contributing at least as much ( if not more ) than the official leader ... Do n't get me wrong , Cannonball is great , but it is the lyrical trumpet of Miles Davis that galvanizes and organizes the group ( `` Autumn Leaves '' ! ) , and even on the funkier performances of the album Miles is equal to the funky Cannonball , with the Joneses and Blakey working beautifully together ... .	1
There is n't much to say about this one . This is jazz anyone could like and it 's possibly Cannonball 's best . My earlier review must have vanished , as I have had this album for decades .	1
The first time I heard this cd , what may have struck me most was how & quot ; close & quot ; the music sounds . I listened to this cd in headphones the first time and I think the only way I could have felt closer to Cannonball , or the only way his tone could have been richer is if I had been there in the studio standing five feet away from him when this music was being recorded.Now aside from that , the playing is wonderful . I just got this recently and it has become my favorite Cannonball album . Being the standard that it is , AUTUMN LEAVES has been played thousands of times by most every jazz musician at one time or another but the version on this cd is just so special . Even if I disliked every other track I 'd still feel as if my purchase of this cd was worth it just because of the beauty of this AUTUMN LEAVES . I 's been said that this is a Miles Davis album with Cannonballs name on it . I do n't believe that for one minute . This is a great band but I think overall , it will be the beauty and soul in every note that Cannonball plays that will leave the biggest impression on you . No , Cannonball was n't the most innovative and groundbreaking alto player in history but he was certainly one of the best . He played from the heart and his tone is just indescribably perfect , and it is captured in all it 's glory on this cd .	1
The album can be added to the canon of great Miles Davis masterpieces from the '50-'64 period . Cannonball - his name is not because of his size , but his huge appetite , he was first nicknamed `` Cannibal '' and it was later changed to `` Cannonball '' . Cannonball played on many of the best Miles Davis albums , including `` Kind of Blue '' . Miles returned the favour and almost steals the show here.Miles hauntingly beautiful trumpet , with Harmon mute , in `` Autumn Leaves '' is the best version of the song Miles ever put to record . It has a charming intermittent deep echo on the trumpet and sax . Miles played `` Leaves '' faster elsewhere ( the more he played standards , the faster he did them , or so it seems . maybe he got bored ) .The sax and trumpet duets on `` Love for Sale '' are happy and enthusiatic , with intricate complex interplay from the leaders . This song is also improved here with a slower tempo Miles and Cannonball used elsewhere.On `` One for Daddy-O '' Cannonball 's sweet alto plays the most memorable bluesy , jazzy solo of his career . Miles plays an energetic response , but this one is Cannonball 's show.Miles , in his gravelly voice , asks Alfred Lion `` is that what you wanted , Alfred '' and echo of the same question he asks Teo Macero on the Columbia album from the same period.Then they have fun with `` Dancing in the Dark '' . It almost has a tongue in cheek quality.Great album , great recording ( for the time ) . Highest recommendation .	1
This is one of my favorite Jazz Cds of all time . The beauty of the opening lines of Autumn Leaves will just knock you out..guaranteed . Miles Davis is unbelievably cool on this recording and Cannonball 's Alto solos are stunning . Sam Jones and Art Blakey provide a powerful bottom to all the cuts and the piano of Hank Jones is understated and tastefull . What an incredible performance ..every cut is a gem . Deserves 10 stars .	1
This is a very nice CD . It has more of a feel of a Miles CD than some of Cannonball 's other work ( my favorite CD is & quot ; Live in San Fran & quot ; . Like the other reviewers , the CD is worth buying for & quot ; Autumn Leaves & quot ; and & quot ; Love for Sale & quot ; .	1
I ordered the RVG Remaster without realizing I had the previous edition ( remastered by Ron McMaster ) in my collection . An A-B comparison reveals that the previous edition has depth , subtlety , dynamic nuance , with the opening rhythmic figure by Hank Jones followed by the sustained pianissimo whole notes of Cannonball and Miles establishing an inviting mystique , then building on this mood right up to the first chorus of what is probably the most celebrated recorded version of `` Autumn Leaves '' in jazz . The RVG remaster starts with `` hot '' mics on the piano , then on both horns , with little difference in dynamic extremes . In fact , dynamics , ensemble textures , and stereo separation become meaningless as Rudy seems intent simply on making whatever instrument is temporarily featured as loud as possible . Having been spoiled by the previous edition , not to mention Miles ' sound on his classic Columbia sessions , I ca n't stay with the RVG remaster , though admittedly some listeners attracted to the 1950s hard bop Blue Note sound may react differently.The bonus track on the previous edition is titled `` Alison 's Uncle '' ; on the new edition , it 's `` Bangoon . `` I have hundreds of Van Gelder-engineered sessions past and present and have yet to hear a remaster that is a dramatic improvement ( in the case of `` Somethin ' Else '' the opposite seems true ) . Apparently Blue Note had second thoughts about the project and has passed it on to Concord , though the majors are increasingly pushing downloaded tracks and the bigger profit margins they bring ( no packaging costs , no need to pay writers for liner notes ) . The RVG reissues were at least welcome for assuring the continued circulation of vital music and for the updated , frequently informative and insightful liner notes . Unfortunately , we 've reached yet another stage in the digital revolution . It 's exceedingly rare now to find domestic jazz releases , whether new or reissues , of any sort . Like other collectors , I 've had to look to Spain , Japan , Italy , Germany , Holland , etc . for reissues ( and first-time releases ) of historically significant , indispensable American music . ( I 'm left to wonder if Ken Burns ' absorbing PBS series on jazz merely provoked complacency or , worse , a backlash against the music . )	1
I note that a couple of reviewers are unhappy with the sound of this CD transfer . It did n't sound too bad to me , considering its age , but I take the point about some shrillness , especially in the trumpet high parts . I think too that the timing is short measure for a CD , but I got it cheap , so I ca n't complain ! Otherwise , I loved it . I got because I had been listening to a lot of the Grateful Dead and had come to the conclusion that it it is in some ways a jazz band . So hell , I said , I 'll try the real thing ( my main interest is classical and opera ) . I 'm glad I tried it it -- this disc goes mellow beautifully , and it swings , though not too hard , appropriately . Adderley 's sax is a wonderful soulful sound , and Davis plays inventively and appealingly . Hank Jones is n't featured as much as I might like , but he 's a lucid and witty pianist . The bass and drums are rock solid . The whole thing is just a delight . So why only four stars ? Mainly for the short measure . This should have been combined with another recital .	1
If you know and love Miles Davis from the late 1950s ` Kind of Blue ' period but have n't heard anything recorded under Julian ` Cannonball ' Adderley 's own name , you 're likely to love and appreciate ` Somethin Else . ' It 's the perfect Blue Note companion to KoB and in the same groove , with superlative playing throughout from Adderley on alto sax and Miles on trumpet together with Hank Jones on piano , and a rhythm section made up of Art Blakey on drums and Sam Jones on bass.It 's difficult to pick out highlights on a collection so uniformly excellent , but the 11-minute opener ` Autumn Leaves ' is a true jazz classic which you 'll think you 've always known , so recognisably familiar is the melody . The title track , showcasing the horn interplay between Miles and Cannonball chasing each other all over the scales in an exuberant and up-tempo duet sounds like a cut which escaped from the KoB sessions , and ` One for Daddy-O ' with its slower tempo and stand-out uncomplicated melody also shines . In the sparse , clean and bluesy ` Dancing in the Dark ' we hear Cannonball at his soulful best , his horn soaring with a long , slow-tempo solo over a perfectly understated rhythm.All the playing here is uniformly excellent and the music instantly accessible . There is nothing unnecessarily complex or jarring : you can listen to the album again and again , no matter what you 're doing , though one or two of the numbers are perhaps a little up-tempo for dinner-party background ambience . Overall ` Somethin Else ' is an indispensable jazz classic to which stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best of Miles , Trane or Charlie Parker.The nickname ` Cannonball ' BTW came from a corruption of ` Cannibal ' due to Adderley 's huge appetite for food and habit of eating absolutely everything available at every opportunity , the result manifest in his generously proportioned , rotund and substantial physique . But boy , can he play that horn .	1
A friend of mine who 's a jazz fanatic turned me on to this recording about twenty years ago , and it remains one of my favorite jazz albums from the late ` 50s . Recorded on one day in March 1958 , this session brought together some of the greatest improvisers of jazz . Just a look at the names says virtually all that you need to know ; Cannonball Adderley on alto sax , Miles Davis on trumpet , Hank Jones on piano , Sam Jones on bass , and Art Blakey on drums . `` Somethin ' Else '' finds all players in a relaxed mood , trading riffs on three standards , and ( if you include the CD bonus track ) three original numbers . The session is noteworthy not only because of the remarkable lineup , but because of the warmth that such disparate stylists were capable of generating . Their instinctive trade-offs are subtle and yet intricate , performed with a poise that that contradicts the energy permeating throughout each track . It is low-key and hot at the same time.Adderley was in charge of this session , so the tracks here are accredited to him as bandleader , but they could just as easily have been credited to Miles . Davis plays a major role here , and in fact , he is credited with writing the title track . For all the world , `` Somethin ' Else '' sounds like the missing link between Miles Davis ' straightforward Prestige recordings and his later , ambitious material for Columbia . Any fan of quality jazz music should put this album on their short list of things to own . A Tom Ryan	1
After hearing `` Kind of Blue '' , I was so impressed by Cannonball that I wanted to start getting some of his own albums . All I heard was positve reviews for this wonderful masterpiece , so , of course , I picked it up and was enthralled . This album has the ability to put anyone in a happy mood . I know this because when I first bought this , I was a bit depressed , but that all went away after listening to this album and Dexter Gordon 's `` Go '' ( another Blue Note masterpiece ! ) . I love the way Cannonball and the band ( which includes Miles Davis on trumpet in one of his rare appearances as a sideman , Hank Jones on piano , Sam Jones on bass , and the incredible Art Blakey on drums ) play the over-done standards `` Autumn Leaves '' and `` Love For Sale '' , and make them more exciting than anyone has ever done to these gems . `` Autumn Leaves '' has a very laid-back , but moody feeling , while `` Love For Sale '' swings hard . The title track does an awesome job of showing the formidable solo talents of Cannonball and Miles , and they engage in one of the most amazing interactions in jazz history . `` One For Daddy-O '' , written by Cannonball 's brother Nat ( who appears with him on many sessions featuring Cannonball 's classic quintet ) , is the blues of the set , and the feel is just awesome . Cannonball and Miles always shined on their blues performances and this track is definitely no exception . `` Dancing in the Dark '' is Cannonball 's individual showcase , and boy does this track haunt me ! The way Cannonball handles this often-done standard has the ability to move me to tears . Finally , the track finishes with `` Bangoon '' a Hank Jones original that was n't included in the original album , which provides a worthy ending for an incredible album , which is in my opinion the best album jazz has to offer !	1
Does not grab you like a `` Kind of Blue '' or `` In a Silent Way '' , but it is a popourri of different sounds . All ranging from a ten to an eight . It never fails you , but is more like a playlist than I wanted . Adderley and Miles together have always pulled me in . That is another factor , that I like , it is a good to excellent meshing of styles , that always pleases.The chemistry between Miles and Cannonball is like the Lennon McCartney of Jazz . I only wish these masters had done more material . It is a tremendous prelude to `` Kind Of Blue '' or I would have given it five stars . Maybe it is five stars , but `` Kind Of Blue '' is so well known , even outside of the jazz world . What a listen though . I bet you can not listen to this album without tapping your feet , it is impossible ! ! ! ! ... ... .and that is goooood ! This CD has gradually become one of my favorites . It would definitely be in my top ten . It gets better the more I listen to it . I have heard it compared to the two classics listed above , and I did not agree . After repeated listening , I would have to place it right after `` In a Silent Way '' . It gets that good after repeated listening , my next in line would be `` Red Clay '' by Freddie Hubbard . A CD that has truly been overlooked as a true classic . Classic to me is that Jazz that creeps into your soul and does not let go . I have listened to this CD constantly since I bought it about a month ago .	1
This is a lovely , accessible , balanced collection which shows off Miles and Cannonball at their peaks ( 1958 ) and is a great companion to the more widely known `` Kind of Blue '' . The ten minutes of `` Autumn Leaves '' is achingly beautiful , especially via earphones , but all six selections are just fine , including the `` Alison 's Uncle '' number left off the original vinyl release for lack of playing time . One thing to remember about buying jazz through Amazon or other on-line sources is that a one-minute `` sample '' of a six or ten-minute improvisation can be quite misleading . I was not impressed by the `` samples '' I heard from this disc , but I found a good price and went ahead and bought it anyway . The totality is so much different , and better , than the sampled portions ! The two horn giants here are wonderfully supported by Hank Jones at the keyboard , Sam Jones on bass , and the great Art Blakey on the drums . This is music you 'll find it quite hard to get tired of .	1
Led by the immensely talented Steve Winwood & amp ; Dave Mason , the magnificent rock band Traffic said hello to the world with their 1967 debut album , & quot ; Mr. Fantasy , & quot ; a delicious psychedelic supper of flower-power pop/rock ( the weird cover photo pretty much says it all about the feel of this album ) . The organ is prominent throughout , the sitar makes an appearance on a few songs , and there 's also a few spoken passages as well . In other words , this is a totally far out record , man ! Many Traffic classics populate this disc : the 60 's pop of & quot ; Heaven Is In Your Mind , & quot ; the gorgeous ballad & quot ; No Face , No Name , No Number , & quot ; the Traffic signature rockers & quot ; Dear Mr. Fantasy , & quot ; & quot ; Dealer , & quot ; and & quot ; Colored Rain , & quot ; and the groovy instrumental & quot ; Giving To You. & quot ; The drunken ragtime piano number & quot ; Berkshire Poppies & quot ; is a real hoot , as are the psychedelic pop of & quot ; House For Everyone & quot ; ( complete with wind-up clock intro ) and the trippy & quot ; Utterly Simple. & quot ; Also , this new re-issue of & quot ; Mr. Fantasy & quot ; includes six bonus tracks of songs the band originally released purely as non-album singles , including more Traffic favorites like & quot ; Paper Sun & quot ; and & quot ; Hole In My Shoe. & quot ; Steve Winwood 's voice , guitar & amp ; keyboards are outstanding , Dave Mason 's voice & amp ; guitar are equally strong , Chris Wood plays a mean flute & amp ; saxophone , and Jim Capaldi 's drumming is superb . Traffic remain one of rock 's greatest groups , and they could n't have had a better intro than & quot ; Mr. Fantasy. & quot ; Great stuff !	1
Of all the bands and albums of late that have been given the re-mastering treatment no band has deserved this more than Traffic regardless of the incarnation that you care for ( 1st incarnation w/D.Mason constantly acting as the revolving door , or 2nd incarnation wherein Winwood/Capaldi/Wood were the remaining core ) . Of all of the catalog , either Mr. Fantasy , which is a true masterpiece of the period or the & quot ; Traffic & quot ; self-titled second album , are highly recommended over the current American label offerings.The Remastering of the first two albums was done with such care as to not sound to bright or harsh as digital processing has a tendency to do . & quot ; Heaven is in your mind & quot ; , & quot ; Dear Mr. Fantasy & quot ; , & quot ; We 're a fade you missed this & quot ; , & quot ; Smiling phases & quot ; and & quot ; Coloured rain & quot ; all open up aurally as never before heard . The sharpness of the guitar passage in 'Mr . Fantasy ' especially are worth the price of the listen . Jim Capaldis ' drum kit also sounds more forward in the mix than previous offerings , but the nicest suprise is the general ambience or nuances that were originally recorded into the mix but which were lost to the original vinyl releases not to mention the waste of time straight transfer disc offerings that record companies always seem to offer first.The contributions of four musicians can be clearly heard throughout instead of mush with Steve Winwood clearly crying to be heard over the mix.Buy this and the other import remasters to hear what was really a step ahead in modern music for the times.As an added bonus this particular disc offers both the original English version which was in stereo and the original American version of the album which was in Mono . Rock On .	1
The British version of this CD is called `` Mr Fantasy '' - it has a superior CD sleeve to the US version , but a lot of it is in badly mixed mono and sounds very flat . The same album is available in the US version under the title `` Heaven is In Your Mind '' - it is all in stereo , and sequenced much better - makes a BIG difference - and is far superior to the U.K. version . Both versions are great - whichever one you end up with , you 're gon na love if you like psychedelic music ! Because this album is a psych CLASSIC ! I have both versions and I ALWAYS listen to the US version ( `` Heaven is In Your Mind '' ) because it sounds better and makes more sense the way it is sequenced . I had never even heard of the album until 1 year ago . I investigated this year , and I am SURE GLAD I did ! ! !	1
This cd is a combination of the U.K. release ( mono ) and the U.S. ( stereo ) release of Mr. Fantasy . Very psychedelic in the likes of Sgt . Pepper etc . but also has some jazz funk moments as in track 10 'Giving to you & quot ; .If you like Steve Winwood you will get a huge kick out of this album as it was cut prior to his joining up to form the Spencer Davis Group . A worthwhile purchase .	1
I am spending time filling in the gaps that I missed out on during the 60s and 70s . I grew up with the better known 'John Barleycorn.. ' and 'Low Spark.. ' , but recently ( thanks to the classic 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide ) acquired 'Mr Fantasy ' and their 2nd album 'Traffic ' . Both knock the spots off the later Traffic , and while the critics gave 'Mr Fantasy ' only 4 stars I rate it one of the best albums ever . Two songs on this album , namely 'No name , no face , not number ' and 'Mr Fantasy ' must be amongst the best rock songs ever , ever written ( to say nothing of Steve Winwood 's ethereal singing ! ) . Regarding the issue about the US versus UK versions , I was fortunate to but a recently re-mastered CD that has both on it ! Get that one , then sit back like a happy cat and lick the cream ...	1
I 've always been a big Steve Winwood fan and although I only first heard him during hisArc of a Diverdays subsequent research led me to his early days and this early offering released in the same year as the legendary Beatles'Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( Remastered ) and borrows ideas from that andRevolveryet exudes a very unique vibe of its own . While the presence of Mason 's sitar and Eastern voicings and the psychedelic leanings can be attributed to the Beatles ' influence , this album has a mood of its own and listening to it transports me into an incense-filled room and in fact the music sounds as if it is struggling to break through a thick smoke-filled room to get to your eardrums and yet it is very addictive and holds you spellbound . Whether intentional or a product of less than optimal sound production the effect is quite fascinating making it an overall very rewarding listen.Recorded in mono , the sound quality is a little patchy with some tracks sounding okay and a few not so good with uneven volume levels and varying amounts of muddiness but this is possibly due to a poor master source . Although this mini-lp replica sleeve ( mlps ) release has been remastered and a heroic attempt made to clean up the sound let 's just say that it was n't a total success . Sound quality aside , this is an admirable mlps release coming well designed and assembled though a little difficult to get the cd out meaning you have to be careful not to tear the cardboard but coming with a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese this will satisfy the collectors if not the audiophiles.Overall this is a decent mlps release of a unique 60s classic that rewards repeated listening.Recommended !	1
Whereas this recording is not Traffic 's best work , it is very unique with the blending of many different flute , sitar , harp , organ , and more . Not to forget the superb Guitar work by David Mason . The song arrangements are n't as developed as on the classic John Barley Corn and Low Spark Recordings but the elements of folk , jazz , and rock make this a very listenable record .	1
Traffic started off as an outside project for Spencer Davis Group member Steve Winwood in April 1967 and featured friends Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood . Jim brought along his friend Dave Mason and the group recorded a couple of singles as well as a couple of songs for the movie Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush . The band 's first album , Mr Fantasy was released in England in December 1967 in both Stereo and Mono . This is the stereo version . The band 's sound at this time was very psychedelic and very much in the spirit of Revolver and Sargent Pepper 's . Dave Mason would leave the group by the time the album was released only to return during the sessions for the band 's second album . As was common place at the time , the original English version of the album was changed and renamed Heaven Is In Your Mind , by the time it reached America with a slightly different track list with the band 's early singles added and a couple of album tracks removed . the order of the songs was also shuffled . The band was n't happy about it . The album opens with a great song called Heaven Is In Your Mind and features cool stereo panning between speakers . Berkshire Poppies is great fun and is followed by Dave Mason 's Houses for Everyone . The first half of the album ends with a great sequence of No Face , No Name , No Number and Dear Mr. Fantasy . The second half of the album opens with the Jim Capaldi sung Dealer and is followed by Dave 's Utterly Simple . Steve 's Coloured Rain is another standout and is followed by Hope I Never Find Me There . The original album ends with a great jazzy instrumental called Giving To You . The bonus tracks on this release is the original American Mono mix which was different from both the English Stereo and Mono mixes	1
Mr. Fantasy is a fine cd and I would have given it 5 stars any other time . Until I bought and listened to the 2000 Island remaster of `` Heaven Is In Your Mind '' This is the original stereo american version of the album , and the one , that I have been waiting for for at least 30 years to be released . It has the original american track listing including two tracks that were dropped when they re-released it as `` Mr. Fantasy '' which is the english version ( stereo much less defined ) . I highly recommend `` Heaven Is In Your Mind '' to anybody that grew up in the sixty 's as I did , and remember the superb stereo on the original UA release .	1
Traffic 's first two albums from 1967 and 1968 are both timeless . `` Mr Fantasy '' was their debut ; their second was simply called `` Traffic '' Steve Winwood had left Spencer Davis Group in early 1967 to form a new band with Dave Mason , Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood . Both Winwood and Mason were extremely talented songwriters , and they each wrote a single hit for the band prior to the release to this album . Both great singles ( `` Paper Sun '' and `` Hole in My Shoe '' ) were included on the original US mono-version of the album , which makes up the second half of this CD-releaseTraffic succeded in combining Winwood 's jazzy/bluesy style and Mason 's melodic songwriting style with the new pshychedelic trends of which the band themselves were very much a part of.The album is perfectly produced by Jimmy Miller , and though these recordings are nearly forty years old , they sound as fresh and crisp as ever.Most songs were written by Steve Winwood in collaboration with Capaldi and Wood ; and their songwriting is incredibly inspired . Songs like the opener `` Heaven is in Your Mind '' , the moving `` No Face , No Name , No Number '' , `` Mr Fantasy '' ( terrific guitar solo from Steve ) and `` Coloured Rain '' are classics . They also show a humouristic free and easy attitude on tracks like `` Berkshire Poppies '' and `` Giving to You '' ; which gives the album the variety that is needed to make it a classic.Dave Mason wrote 3 songs , all tracks are fine , but his contributions here are not so significant as on the follow-up album , which included his classics `` Feeling Alright '' and You Can All Join In '' . They are all more or less in the same vein as `` Hole in My Shoe '' , though none of them not nearly as catchy.Before the album was released in the US Dave Mason had left the band ( there were some disagreements over the musical direction ) , so two of his songs were excluded from that release and exchanged with the 4 songs from their 2 singles . This made the American 12 tracks version an even stronger album . The B-side `` Smiling Phases '' was another great Winwood/Capaldi/Wood composition that deserved being included in the first place.There are some interesting differences between the mono and stereo versions . The guitar-solos on the two mixes of `` Heaven is on Your Mind '' are completely different ; funny that they exchanged the great solo on the UK version with an obviously less inspired on for the US release ; could be a mistake ? Minor differences can be on most tracks.Interesting that Dave Mason is n't even credited as band member on the US album cover . Mason returned later to record the follow-up album with Traffic .	1
This disk is famous for the great playing and drug influenced music . `` Dear Mr Fantasy '' , the title cut , features trippy guitar and Steve Winwood 's soaring vocals . `` Berkshire Poppies '' is an obviously a reference to one of the drugs of choice , featuring Winwood 's ragtime piano . `` Dealer '' and `` Colored Rain '' are classic traffic rockers , that showcase the band 's ability to mix winds and woodwinds through their music effectively . Dave Mason 's `` Hole In My Shoe '' is a happier , chemically influenced tune , that shows a lighter side of his writing . In all , it is a period piece , that is different in that the melodies are catchy , and the musicanship great enough to stand the test of time .	1
i prefer the 2nd , eponymous album but this is a fine debut . sure , some of it may not have dated all that well , -but i think that records MUST be rated according to the standards of their time . the extra singles , which are great , show what a superb and multi-talented band traffic was . this was one of the most talented bands of their era , and quite underrated songwriters- mason and winwood were quite a pair . chris wood was one of the best reed instrumentalists in the history of rock music , and capaldi was a steady and interesting drummer . this is one of the best british psychedelic albums of the era . the follow up was vastly different , few 2nd albums of the time are so profoundly unlike the first . i 'd suggest that fans of the 60 's as well as those of winwood and mason 's other projects pick up this fine debut as well as the traffic and john barleycorn lp 's . the third lp , last exit , has a few good tracks but overall its not very consistent . there 's plenty of fine songs by this group , but i do feel that the first , second , and fourth lp 's are the best .	1
Traffic had one of the most original ( and interesting ) sounds in British rock , and not only because of their eclectic musical influences , which embraced psychedelia , folk , jazz , soul , R & B ; , and even classical . Their unique sound was also the result of their unusual instrumentation . While the group went through a number of personnel changes , its constant core members were Steve Winwood ( vocals , keyboards , guitars ) , Chris Wood ( sax , flute , and organ ) , and Jim Capaldi ( drums & percussion ) . With no regular bass player , Winwood often filled in with the bass pedals on his organ . And , while there is no lack of guitars on most Traffic recordings , the guitar is not emphasized or particularly important to the group 's sound . Dave Mason came and went in their early years and , on other recordings , Steve Winwood would switch to guitar , with Chris Wood taking over organ duties . In short , Traffic was anything but your typical guitar-bass-drums rock outfit . And , with `` white Ray Charles '' prodigy Winwood at the helm , and with their willingness to experiment with virtually any sound or musical style , they cut some of the most distinctive and important records in British rock. '' Mr . Fantasy '' was their full-length debut , and ( as it was 1967 ) their most psychedelic release . ( Linda Eastman-McCartney once recounted the story of visiting the group at their Berkshire cottage and playing the Beatles ' new `` Sgt . Pepper '' LP for them to hear , upon which Winwood & Co. were reportedly dismayed that the Beatles had already used many of their ideas for `` Mr . Fantasy . '' ) While the album has many similarities with `` Sgt . Pepper '' ( vaudville brass , '60s silliness , not to mention drug influences ) , it is by no means an imitator of the Beatles ' masterpiece . `` Mr. Fantasy '' is darker ( `` Dealer '' and `` No Face ... '' ) and more blues-oriented ( especially the title track ) . If anything , it is a successful ( though not demonic ) version of what the Stones tried and failed to do with their laughable `` Satanic Majesty 's Request . `` The obvious weakness of this album is the songwriting contributions of Dave Mason . While Mason would soon perfect his George Harrison-style British folk-rock , his work on `` Mr. Fantasy '' ( `` House for Everyone , '' `` Utterly Simple , '' etc . ) simply sounds like that of a [ poor ] Beatle-wannabe . In 1967 , United Artists remedied this problem by replacing a few of his songs with Traffic 's early non-LP singles for the American version of the album.There were , therefore , orginally two different versions of `` Mr. Fantasy '' ( as was the case with most early Beatle LPs ) . However , most recent CD reissues of the album include all the tracks from both versions ( a quick tip : if `` Paper Sun '' is on the CD , you 've got all the tracks ) - so with some creative use of your CD programmer , you can listen to either version - or both.And listen you should , because `` Mr. Fantasy '' is an underappreciated classic .	1
This , & quot ; China & quot ; and the & quot ; Bladerunner & quot ; soundtrack are probably the three pinnacles of Vangelis 's work . And in the manner of the latter two , & quot ; Heaven and Hell & quot ; offers up music which shifts through a variety of moods , styles , and evocations , all handled with a stupendous command of both the studio and the music created therein . The album 's title really sums things up here ; Vangelis takes the listener from both blissful and powerful symphonic visions of heaven , to dark and foreboding views of hell . Even the Jon & amp ; Vangelis collaborative track here , & quot ; So Far Away , So Clear & quot ; , really fits well , in my opinion . But where things really shine is in Part II , where Vangelis shows his command of both some very tranquil and achingly beautiful music based around wordless Greek folk vocals , as well as a couple of sections where his music shows that it can stand up against the likes of avant-gardists such as Kryzystof Penderecki and George Crumb , both of whose musics bear a resemblance to parts of this latter half of this album . So , herein you will find much variety . & quot ; New Age & quot ; ? Uh ... bits of it . Pigeonholing this in that really cheapens it . It 's so much more , and so much more complex .	1
This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is fairly energetic , with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged . Released in 1975 , Heaven and Hell incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound.Vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers , electric piano , acoustic piano , a full drum kit , and percussion . Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir ( conducted by Guy Protheroe ) with Vana Veroutis as the lead female vocal , in addition to Jon Anderson ( vocals/lyrics on Heaven and Hell ( Part 1 So Long Ago , So Clear ) . Vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano . As a huge Yes fan , I was delighted to hear Jon 's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics . As far as the inclusion of the choir goes , I did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording.The Heaven and Hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including Part I ( 21'58 '' ) and Part II ( 21'16 '' ) . In general , the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by Vangelis . Another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages . Of course , my favorite part comes at the end of Part I , which is the 4'58 '' section with Jon on vocals . This short `` song '' is quite moving and uplifting . Movement II is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two . The choir is featured on the second movement , along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis . Part II closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section , which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section.All in all , this is a good Vangelis album and is recommended along with Albedo 0.39 ( 1976 ) ; Spiral ( 1977 ) ; and the excellent Opera Sauvage ( 1979 ) .	1
It is a well-know fact that Yes-frontman , Jon Anderson , attempted unsuccessfully to bring Vangelis into Yes to play keyboards for the band . This was n't meant to happen , apparently , so here you have in front of you the album that contains the sound that Vangelis could have brought into Yes . With a perennial musical struggle between good and evil , the tracks of the album take the listener through a spiritual rollercoaster . Along with his previous work for `` Apocalypse of the animals '' this album lays the groundwork for several of his later works : the more choir-based works , some harmonies to be found in Opera Sauvage ( 1979 ) and even the origins of the theme of Chariots of Fire ! Though it 's not my favorite Vangelis album ( you do n't want to go through hell and back , every time you listen to an album , which tells you that he actually did a great work ) , it is a brilliant masterpiece , deserving a space in the collection of all serious rock collectors ( yes , this is more a rock than a new age album . )	1
Originally released in 1975 , this looks to be his third solo effort - did n't know ( until now ) that Vangelis was a member of the Greek progressive band , Aphrodite 's Child . Had n't heard this CD in ages , as I 've never really kept up with his work that much . Liked this ageless neo-classical / New Age title more so than I remember . Both tracks here - `` Heaven And Hell , Part 1 '' and `` Heaven And Hell , Part 2 '' - clocking in at over twenty minutes each . Jon Anderson ( Yes ) provides the vocals on `` So Long Ago , So Clear '' - a portion of the Part 1 cut , I 'm sure I used to hear that song on late night FM radio many moons ago . Thoroughly enjoyed this CD reissue 's beautiful symphonic passages that manage to take the listener ( s ) by surprize . Should appeal to fans of Patrick Moraz , Yanni , Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield .	1
I finally got this one on CD . It is broken up into 2 incredible movements . And , right in between , like a bridge , is a very moving piece that features Jon Anderson . This is one of his best vocal performances and that 's saying a lot considering his monumental work with Yes . It really makes you hope that Jon and Vangelis work again in the future . And , it also makes you hope that the Squire/ Yes establishment gets Anderson back where he belongs in Yes .	1
It was on this date of October 13th that I wrote my first review on Amazon . And that review was on the RCA import of `` Greatest Hits : Vangelis '' . One album that was represented in that greatest hits collection was this one . His first RCA album commercially successful album called `` Heaven and Hell '' .Realistically , Vangelis only really had one `` hit '' and it was called `` Chariots of Fire '' and it 's not on the greatest hits collection , anyway ... Mind you , though this came out in 1975 , it was not Vangelis ' first album . I understand he 's had solo albums from as early as 1971 . In the late sixties he was a keyboardist for the psychedelic progressive band called `` Aphrodite 's Child '' featuring the internationally famed Demis Roussos . Demis has a fabulous voice even while forcing himself to sing in English instead of his native French . Now as I understand , Aphrodite 's Child came from France , but Evangelos Papathanassiou ( Vangelis ) came from Southern Greece . Aphrodite 's Child had several radio singles in Europe ( unrecognized at all in America ) and it 's really a shame because they put out some fabulous music . Go to You Tube and check out the songs `` It 's Five O'Clock , '' `` Rain and Tears , '' `` The End of the World , '' and `` Spring , Summer , Winter , and Fall . '' You will see a younger Vangelis performing in this talented trio on some of the televised videos available from Europe . They also released a rather controversial album called `` 666 : The Apocalypse of John 13:18 '' . It 's a fabulous double album of subjects of the Book of Revelations put to Progressive Rock.Anyway , this album of `` Heaven and Hell '' features the tracks `` 12 O'Clock , '' `` Bacchanale , '' `` Third Movement ( later became the theme from `` Cosmos '' ) '' , and `` So Long Ago , and So Clear '' which features the vocals of John Anderson from `` Yes '' . Jon and Vangelis has released a few albums together up through the early eighties including the great twelve minute piece called `` The Friends of Mr. Cairo '' , a tribute to the film stars of the thirties and forties.Anyway , this album of `` Heaven and Hell '' represents a introduction of progressive , medieval , and dark cathedral ( chamber-like ) classical music . But , if you do n't like this album ( it is an acquired taste , it took a few plays to grow on me because it was so different than most anything else I was listening to at the time ) , then try two of his other 1970 's RCA releases , like `` Spiral '' , and `` Albedo 0.39 '' . I personally liked these albums more , myself.In comparison by concept and appeal , I 'd play this album during a session where I 'd also play Rick Wakeman 's `` Six Wives of Henry VIII '' , Klaus Schulze 's `` Blackdance '' , and perhaps Mike Oldfield 's `` Hergest Ridge . '' If you know and own these albums , and other similar albums , then `` Heaven and Hell '' will fit right in.If you want to check out another best of Vangelis collection , check out his non-RCA collection called `` Themes '' , which includes `` Chariots of Fire '' and many other familiar themes .	1
This is a fantastic piece of music . Full of power and dynamics . Everything that Vangelis does best . An in your face , electronic/instrumental/choral epic . An absolute must buy for any fan of the genre .	1
... Stryper bowed out shortly after the release of this album , their record label ( Enigma ) having gone bankrupt . .. Ouch . It 's too bad because this is their most developed release , their most mature effort , and their most controversial album.The band itself can explain the controversy far better than I can , but I encourage you to read the book LOUD 'N ' CLEAR by Dale Erickson and Jesse Sturdevant . It sheds a lot of light on the subject . Lyrics were behind the problem as the bands distributors ( BENSEN ) no longer felt that the band was pushing the Christian viewpoint ( s ) . This is clearly untrue from much of the lyrical content on the album-even within the title track itself . Clearly , this album caught Stryper at a tough time when they were struggling with their identity as a 'Christian Metal Band ' . No other band has probably been as pigeon-holed as this one . But for all the controversy , the music remains quite good here . There are a few lapses into the tired 80 's metal cliches , but the album also contains some great tunes like `` Two Bodies '' , `` All For One '' , `` Lady '' , and `` Ordinary Man '' . I can do without `` Two-Time Woman '' and `` Rock The People '' , but I have no MAJOR complaints outside of those . And I have NO complaints with the sound . AGAINST THE LAW is by far the bands best sounding album . Major producer Tom Werman handled the board duties expertly and we end up with the fattest mix of any Stryper release-it 's nice to hear the bass and drums even more up-front . Robert 's kit sounds GREAT . The guitars are THICK . The band even LOOKS tougher in the insert photos ! By the way , the band did not have a say in the cover concept-they hated it . And here for some reason the colors look washed-out . Perhaps the picture is of a [ inexpensive ] re-release of the disc ?	1
This is Stryper right here right now , their only 90s album that sees them much heavier and in your face than their radio friendly 80s period . This is somwhere in between their glam rock early period and the more indulstrial sounds of reborn . I like Stryper 's earlier stuff too it 's very solid and radio friendly and Reborn is a cooler industrial strength version of Stryper . But here they are right here right now as a Pantera like rock band without the spandex and bleached hair , which was taken by some as an abandonment of their Christian beliefs . In reality , heavy metal music was still popular , but the spandex , makeup and bleached hair were passe as Stryper had virtually every 80s cliche in the book . In order to be taken seriously they had to abandon their Christian lyrics and make their music a lot heavier . I had heard of this album it had a cult following , that basically the band had broken up due to record company politics , they were no longer considered cool by the 90s breed of metal fans and moreso those who were still stuck in the 80s . Those who would give this CD less than 3 stars for supposed Christian abandonment in Stryper need to first realize that anything 80s was n't cool in the 90s and most of the 90s was spent making fun of the 80s . And you wanted something right here right now and right here right now you want to be rich , so the spandex glam rock had to go . Record company politics plus the 90s influence . IMO this is their best album and Reborn sounds fresh even a couple years after its release .	1
Ah , Against the Law , the black sheep of the Stryper discography . The Christian metal band surprised a lot of people with their fifth album , which was a pretty big departure from previous Stryper releases . Image-wise , they ditched their famous yellow and black duds and longtime logo in favor of denim and leather and scruffy beards . Musically , the band took even more risks.Stryper had become almost a household name with their platinum-selling 1986 albumTo Hell With the Devil , and their 1988 follow-upIn God We Trustwas essentially a carbon copy of that album ( though in my opinion it had better songs ) . With Against the Law the band dropped some of the heavier , metallic elements , toned down the religious rhetoric and , well , got a bit funky . `` Caught in the Middle '' and `` Rock the Hell out of You '' are old school Stryper metal songs , and `` Lady '' is definitely a Stryper-style weepy ballad , but the rest of the album is a little crazier . Despite its corny message of abstinence ( Christian or not , the lyrics are ridiculous ) , `` Not That Kind of Guy '' is a fun , bass-heavy number , and how about that cover of Earth , Wind and Fire 's classic `` Shining Star ? '' They brought in Randy Jackson ( yes , the American Idol judge ) to funk that one up . Melodic rock super vocalist Jeff Scott Soto even lends a hand on backing vocals.I was a huge Stryper fan as a kid , but have n't given them much listening time since then . When I do , it 's usually this album that gets taken off the shelf . It 's a shame Against the Law seems to be the band 's least loved album , because it may be their most interesting one . This is the album where the band got more creative , more adventurous , and proved that you could make a positive record without making every song a religious statement .	1
First the bad.. This cd misses classic `` Soldiers '' status but only barely.. the 'ballad ' Lady is just too weak , in fact I would give them points FOR leaving it off , but that 's not the case.. Stryper are known for a few things and at least one strong ballad seemed a given , not this time . To me Lady just comes off forced and generic.. which leads to bad news # 2 , this cd just lacks variety . What IS here frackin rocks your darned socks completely OFF but looking at a cd in terms of layers , this is lacking.Ok -- now for the good and the reason I 'm even here.. umm , I 've had this cd for years but only the last couple of days have I noticed how Michael Sweet is a frackin MADMAN on this , he 's balls out on pretty much every song . My voice cracks just THINKING about his efforts . We ALL know Michael is known for belting it out but ... .WOW ... . he is just amazing on this disc ! ! Good news # 2 - did Oz Fox channel Steve Vai on this or is it just me ? ? Good gracious this dude learned more than a few tricks in the 3 years between efforts -- everything from solos to licks are INCREDIBLE.I only recently added this to my ITUNES library after having Soldiers and To Hell for so long.. I do n't know I never thought this cd had the staying power or the chops , well I was wrong , I should have added this YEARS ago -- a tremendous effort from an awesome band , sadly IMO this is the final album of what I consider 'real ' Stryper.Peace .	1
THIS is a great rock album . A little melodic , a little progressive , a little heavy , and a little commercial sounding ( but not as much as the follow up 'Alpha ' ) . Wetton 's voice it so unique and soothing . Great songs . Great musicians . You ca n't lose !	1
before i bought this CD i have never heard of the group before . but they sing heat of the moment . i like this . this is 80 's rock and roll music .	1
In 1982 progressive rock could n't be less popular.Newer rock styles based in punk were in vogue and alot of the prog rockers of the previous decade had gone the way of the dinasaur-literally.That 's why members of three of the most popular prog rock bands came together to form Asia and to make their music work , they chose to blend big arena rock sounds with pure pop melodies and hooks.The result is one of the best first sides any VINYL LP ever had with the first four songs- '' Heat Of The Moment '' , '' Only Time Will Tell '' ( both huge hits ) , '' Soul Survivor '' and `` One Step Closer '' all add up as a perfect example of what style Asia were trying to achieve , and for better or worse paved the way for very similar 'hair metal'-type bands to come.Although as the next part indicates Asia will never be mistaken for heavy metal-most of the songs there showcase themore bombastic side of progressive rock-lack of melody and oftenoverplaying.But on `` Here Comes The Feeling '' the band are back to pop perfect again as on the first songs.Often written off by critics as being too commercial 'Asia ' actually ends up sounding fairly enjoyable in certain sections and , of course Steve Howes wailing guitars , bloated as they can be do convey the point well .	1
I ca n't believe this is 20 years old ! When Asia first came out with this package it really shook up the music world . Every song on this CD can be listened to over and over . It 's rare when 4 & quot ; superstars & quot ; can get together and produce a sound this good . It 's rarer still when they can keep doing it . Asia did n't . After this album they tried to & quot ; cookie-cut & quot ; their songs and they became trite and boring . But for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving . Do yourself a favor . BUY THIS CD !	1
Asia was the first band I called `` my favourite one '' . Via Asia , I got to know my later and present favourite Yes.The influence of Yes shines through in this first album of the band . It is especially obvious in the afterplay to Cutting It Fine.But this is mainly a rock album . Some call it prog rock - who knows why - indeed , it is true that there is more to it than just plain 1980 's rock . It has a touch , it has more soul . It is bombastic rock without even being close to hardrock . Well worth listening to ! My favourites on this debut album are Wildest Dreams , One Step Closer , and of course the first single Heat Of The Moment .	1
This album was huge ( # 1 in UK & USA in 1982 ) & finally gave Wetton a balance of musical & commercial success . It 's an interesting line-up of musicians including Steve Howe - Guitars/vocals ( Yes ) , John Wetton - Bass/lead vocals ( UK & King Crimson ) , Jeff Downes - keyboards/piano/vocals ( Buggles ) , & of course Carl Palmer - Drums/percussion . These four guys made a very powerful album from start to finish & you can hear pieces of Yes & ELP here especially in Cutting it Fine . I especially like here comes the feeling , only time will tell , without you , & wildest dreams . I think the bass lines could 've been more technical as wetton is very capable but he gets the job done . Steve howe is impressive as usual & the production & acoustics of the sound bring out his ability . Downes is good but it would 've been good to hear more of the cp-70 yamaha piano . Palmer is OK but not his best work . There are times he could have done more drum fills & less of the subtle/mystical stuff he was known for in ELP . Otherwise this is a great album & for the time a very powerful musical expression as the teenage synth crap was really taking over the charts . It just goes to show that when the great prog rockers like these guys or genesis or rush do something no one can compete . This is because this type of music appeals to everyone - teens to old folks . This album has stood the test of time commercially & muscially as it has a taste of progressive & pop .	1
Here 's an album that , despitre being disliked by its natural & quot ; early adopters & quot ; ( progressive rock fans ) as well as the mainstream press ( who mistook it for a progressive rock album and exhibited their normal knee-jerk prejudice against that particular genre ) , yet still went on to sell millions of records ! It simply demonstrates that sometimes music stands on its own merit , despite the efforts of some to knock it down.Asia had the makings of a progressive rock supergroup , with veterans of ELP , King Crimson , and Yes making up its membership . Hopes were high among prog fans ( who did n't have much to shout about during the genre 's & quot ; dark days & quot ; of 1982 ) that this band would carry the torch . But when they heard the shorter , radio-friendly songs and & quot ; arena rock & quot ; trimmings they were horrified . It was n't prog , and the shock of that realization was so great that they never gave it a serious listen . To this day , many progressive rock fans unfairly consider Asia to represent the low point of the genre.On the other side , the music press ( who by that time despised progressive rock , largely out of their own ignorance and fear of intellectualism ) branded Asia with their tried-and-true label of & quot ; pretentious & quot ; , based solely on the band 's provenance . Again , they apparently never listened to the music.How can I be so sure that both camps gave Asia a bad rap without giving it a chance ? Simply because it 's great music ! No , it is n't prog , but as a prog fan I stil find much to enjoy here , from the fnely crafted songs to the excellent production , and most of all the superior musicianship ( even if the band is n't really challenged by the material ) . No , it is n't the disco-pop of the late 70s , but if the critics had given it a chance they could have heard the gems contained within.But in the end , the true judges - the fans - won out , and this album became a worldwide sucess . It stands the test of time well , and is highly recommended .	1
As a teen of the '80s , I loved classic rock ( still do ) , including many of the bands that the members of ASIA were alumni of ie ELP , Yes , King Crimson , UK , and others . I saw them on the ALPHA tour , which was before the personel changes started . I love this album possessing the great qualites of the era with great guitar playing , fluid vocals , and cathy rhythms . Prog rock never sounded better or more accessible .	1
This is one of the finest debut cds ever released , right up there with the first cds from Boston & amp ; Foreigner . Not a bad song on this cd , and the group as hard as they tried could , never make another cd , quite this good , they would come close , but would be short of the mark . ONLY TIME WILL TELL , has to be one the best keyboard intros , the first second it plays , you know the song . HEAT OF THE MOMENT , has a well know guitar lick , that any kid then knew . Although Wetton , has never been a favorite singer of my , with Asia , he was just short of great . All four members get a chance to shine in their own right . Every song is a classic on this cd . Even when it was released in the early 80 's , it was called & quot ; dinosaur rock & quot ; , that maybe true , still today , but it beats alot of what has been released in years . If you like good playing , and songs that make sense , this is the cd for you .	1
When this album first came out , I have to admit I was surprised . Some of the tracks were really quite ... dare I say it , catchy . And there was even a Top 30-friendly single on the album ( 'Only Time will tell ' ) . But was n't this Carl Palmer -- he of the 70s triple album and serious devotee of classical percussionist James Blades ? And was n't this also Steve Hose -- he of another 70s triple album and several serious solo albums . And had n't John Wetton starred on the seriously serious 'Red ' in 74 ? How could the three come together yet produce this Adult-Oriented stadium Rock ? Let 's not forget Palmer 's beginnings in the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster . Or Wetton 's bizarre phase with Uriah Heep . And Geoff Downes was nominally half of 'Buggles ' , whose minimal output was unashamed pop . The style of this , Asia 's debut album was n't a million miles from UK 's eponymous LP of 1978 , although it was distinctly more mainstream.I like this album , the best of all the Asia output that I 've heard . I would have preferred the music to be a little more ambitious ; there 's a sense in which it 's all been concocted to maximise the commercial return , which you could n't say of UK . But it 's a good , undemanding listen .	1
This is one of those discs that I 've played often for the last fifteen years and I hear something new with each listen . Asia was four individual virtuosos from mostly prog-rock backgrounds who came together to play pop/rock with a decidedly progressive feel . The result of this debut was stunning . Not only are the songs top-notch , but the playing and singing are absolutely mindblowing . Check out the vocal harmonies on Time Again and Without You , the energy of Wildest Dreams , the dreamy and unexpected ending of Without You , and the sublime piano outro of Cutting It Fine . This piano part could be an entire separate song or theme for a movie , it 's so beautiful . Also , Steve Howe 's guitar and John Wetton 's superb singing are standouts throughout the entire disc ( not to mention Carl Palmer 's drumming ) .ASIA definately starts out in a pop/rock vein with the first two tracks being the AOR radio hits . Heat of the Moment is actually the weakest of all the cuts , in my opinion , although it 's still a great song . Only Time Will Tell , however , is one of the best on the album in spite of the fact that it 's one of the least adventurous -- the melody and orchestration are just incredible . After these two cuts , the album takes on a more progressive sound , while still having it 's roots in rock . Key changes , outside harmony , and adventurous interludes abound in track three through the end . This disc is a must for any musician or rock fan and it 's a shame that the first two tracks are the only ones familiar to most people .	1
Many people drubbed this album when it came out . They did n't like the `` sell out '' mentality of it . Mind you , this was the same set of critics who kept giving the progressive rock groups bad reviews , calling them pretentious and pompous . So , is this a good album ? Absolutely . It is certainly more commercial than ELP , Yes , or King Crimson , but you do n't get the feeling of a blatant sellout . This is really the only Asia album you need . This is their best . They pretty much collapsed after this album , making only one more album with the original lineup , then splintering off into various offshoots to the point no one knows who 's really in the band anymore . I 've always loved Heat of the Moment and Only Time Will Tell , and Wildest Dreams is good too , with Carl Palmer getting a chance to show his chops ( he 's subdued on this album in comparison to his ELP workouts ) . This is Asia 's best , and the only one worth having .	1
This is about as close to being an essential album as an artist can get without being rated as such . The line up of songs is near fantastic ; it 's arena rock at near its best . Best songs on here are `` Heat of the Moment '' `` Sole Survivor '' , `` Without You '' & `` Cutting It Fine '' . It 's the song `` One Step Closer '' that keeps this album from being essential.Asia was a `` supergroup '' with its members coming from other well established groups : Steve Howe ( lead guitarist from Yes ) , Carl Palmer ( drummer from Emerson , Lake & Palmer ) , John Wetton ( vocalist & bassist from King Crimson ) & Geoff Downes ( keyboardist from the Buggles ) . With that lineup you just knew you were gon na get prog/art rock out of you-know-what ! Surprise ! They actually gave us a commercial , streamlined version of that . They still seemed to be pompous in their music.This is probably the only studio album one needs to own on this group . The following albums fell off dramatically in quality . Liner notes are non-existent . But the album cover is sensational . Yes fans will know who I 'm referring to !	1
Luis Mejia ( son ) - Four men ; John Wetton ( King Crimson , Family , Uriah Heep , etc ) Steve Howe ( Yes ) , Carl Palmer ( Emerson , Lake and Palmer ) and Geoffrey Downes ( The Buggles ) made an historical supergroup that enjoyed years of fame and credit , but this album is frozen in time as the greatest example of experience , originality and explosive material.I am a huge fan of Wetton wich I listened first with Asia and eventually with King Crimson , he became one of my favorite vocalists , Howe was a little unknown to me since I did n't like Yes at first and Downes and Palmer were unknown to me . Later I heard a lot of their past collaborations and I was convinced ; this is a band to admire.This debut album was a stunning hit back in the 80 's , making famous classics like Heat Of The Moment and Sole Survivor , but not only fame is on their side , also a lot of musical credit ; The sound is completely original , juvenile , soft , potent and with a certain level of complexity . This is obviously their best album ever made , at least in the Wetton 's era , and is simply beautiful for anyone who has heard Asia in other moments and perfect for casual listeners because is so comprehensible and accessible to their later moods . It contains original classics like Heat Of The Moment and Sole Survivor , beautifuly written and synthesized songs like Time Again , Here Comes The Feeling , Only Time Will Tell , One Step Closer and Cutting It Fine , and fearfully potent tracks like Wildest Dreams and Without You.Wetton 's voice is incredibly potent and firm , applying stunning vocal ranges among certain songs and excellent choruses among the tracks , Howe 's guitar can be heard perfectly and is in their best performance , Downes ' keyboards are applyed moderated and with intelligence , not leaving behind other instruments , and Palmer 's battery is also performed very touchy and delicate but very firm . Asia made their best effort with this album having each member equal control , one thing lost in later albums.Well , in conclussion the album is amazing and should be amazing for anyone , well structured , incredibly performed and each track is unique and well thought , my strong recomendations .	1
Let 's look at this cd for what it was : a great pop record . Sure , it was completely calculated by David Geffen , head of Geffen records at the time . However , their are so few superstar bands that this one , along with Blind Faith , holds up over time . I was just 10 years old when I got this cd , and it sounds dated now , but it brings back good memories . I have since become an ardent Yes , ELP , King Crimson , Buggles , Genesis and Rush fan . Asia was just a fun ride , nothing meant to be taken seriously . However , of all their albums I do believe their first was their best . It 's a good cd for those of us who can remember Asia at all .	1
In 1982 , Steve Howe of Yes , Carl Palmer of Emerson , Lake , and Palmer , Geoff Downes of The Buggles , and John Wetton of King Crimson formed one of Rock 's first & quot ; supergroups & quot ; . The result of this union was this unvbelievable debut album . Penned by Wetton and Downes , this album produced the classics & quot ; Heat of the Moment & quot ; and & quot ; Only Time Will Tell & quot ; . This album was released at the same time MTV hit the airwaves , so these songs received many hours of play . This album still ranks as one of my personal favorites even after 20 years . I ca n't get enough of Geoff Downes ' keyboard work and especially Carl Palmer 's unparalleled drumming . Each track is first-rate and the insturmentals are perfectly blended . This album is a must for serious rock music fans .	1
In 1982 , it seemed as if the new supergroup Asia would be the great white hope of AOR fans . Most of the 70 's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity , and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80 's . Alas , after this first LP , Asia descended into mediocrity , turning out many more albums , none of which equalled this outstanding debut . This record is a document of What Might Have Been , simply put . Well worth owning , and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70 's .	1
Wow ! They did it together ! The power of four musicians has showed us that music is teamwork . My heart will sing every time when I listen to this album . & quot ; The Heat of the Moment & quot ; is perfectly chosen opening track , which contains a classic chorus , & quot ; Only Time Will Tell & quot ; continues the saga of the great songs , & quot ; Sole Survivor & quot ; introduce you the hidden skills of George Downes , who plays his keybords heavenly well , & quot ; One Step Closer & quot ; is the weakest chain of this album but it is till listenable track , & quot ; Time Again & quot ; surprises you its dark melody , & quot ; Wildest Dreams & quot ; is interesting and enjoyable song , which is one of my favourites , & quot ; Without You & quot ; shows the real quitar playing abilities of Stewe Howe , & quot ; Cutting It Fine & quot ; is great song with hooky guitar melody , & quot ; Here Comes the Feeling & quot ; ends this album its own fine way and I will want to listen album again . John Wetton has a very powerful voice , Stewe Howe plays his quitar like a master , Geoffrey Downes 's breathtaking keybords playing makes me smile and the outstanding drummer Carl Palmer knows how to make good beats . Words are n't enough to tell you who I love this album . Strong and catchy melodies , moody lyrics and the skills of the four musicians makes 'Asia ' fantastic album .	1
After the disasterous 1978-79 tours of Yes ELP and UK , these 4 ex-prog kings got together to make a pop rock quartet to make some cash to pay off their debts . Little did they know they would make a great classic album and even go to Number 1 in the charts ! Not bad for 4 prog dinosaurs in the new wave/punk era .	1
& # 34 ; Heat of the Moment & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Wildest Dreams & # 34 ; , and many more are included in this , my favorite Asia album . If you like Toto ( Rosanna , Hold the Line , Africa , Georgy Porgy , etc . ) you will love Asia . My favorite band ( s ) from the very early 80 's .	1
This first album by ASIA is astonishing . To speak the truth , I think it 's their only worthwhile album . THe production ( by Mike Stone ) is clearly slick and commercial , but the songs are top-notch . Howe 's guitar never sounded so fresh , alive and hard before . Carl Palmer is explendid , freed from EMERSON LAKE & amp ; PALMER 's tendency to overblown their songs . Wetton 's voice is one of rock 's best , and Downes ' keyboards fit in completely . It 's a shame it did n't last long and , for their second laubm , Asia tried even harder to go totally mainstream , sealing the destiny of the band , with the departure of Steve Howe ( Howe still tried to get total mainstream attention with the horrrible GTR project ) .	1
As one critic wrote , this album was a breath of fresh air back in '82 . So true ! So ignore the rock critics ; this album is amazing . Remember , these are the same `` rock '' critics that snub Deep Purple , enough said . Case closed.Buy it and enjoy !	1
Review no . 97 . This self-titled effort was , of course Asia 's classic debut album , hitting the streets in 1982 . So nice to hear it on CD reissue . Asia was never one of my favorite bands from the '80 's but I could never resist putting on this record { or disc } and listening to it all the way through . I mean , EVEN if you do n't personally care for progressive album rock , no one can argue that this work showed just what four already-accomplished musicians were fully capable of . So many great INSTANT recognizable tracks to thoroughly take in here , there 's no need to list them all . Would love to catch their reunion tour at some point . If I remember correctly , Asia appealed to most fans of bands like Marillion , Jethro Tull , Utopia , Moody Blues , Alan Parsons , etc . A must-have .	1
This album IS the 1980s . `` Heat of the Moment '' and `` Only Time Will Tell '' are two of the musical highlights of the decade and this album is almost as solid as those two singles . I have read criticisms that the album is too `` cliche 'd . '' I 'm not sure what is meant by that as I thought `` Only Time Will Tell '' had a very unique sound for a single . This is not an ordinary pop album . It has a powerful , progressive sound yet a sound that is also accessible ( progressive rock moves into the 1980s ) . `` Without You , '' for example , starts out as a ballad and then launches into a killer guitar solo with keyboard in tow , then settles down only to explode once more . `` Cutting it Fine '' is a rocker until it reaches a very interesting slow piece at the end . The music takes the listener through different emotions . Although I ca n't give this classic any less than 5 stars , I think some of the songs are overdone , such as `` Time Again '' and , especially , `` Wildest Dreams . '' The POW ! POWPOW ! part of the latter track seems a bit much to me unless the band was simulating war sounds to keep with the theme of the lyrics . Still , it seems overpowering in this song . On the other end of the review spectrum , perhaps this album is overrated ; however , the next two Asia albums ( Alpha and Astra ) are painfully underrated , so it all evens out .	1
This debut is amazing , one of the best ever . It sold more than five million copies . Steve Howe , Carl Palmer , Geoff Downes and John Wetton wrote music history here . All the tracks are killers , catchy but strong , pop but heavy , simple but complex . Of course , such marvelous chemistry could n't last long , and their next effort , ALPHA , was a complete turkey . ( but sold more than one million copies ! ! )	1
If you want 10-minute suites with lengthy instrumental noodling , this is not the album for you ... despite its amazing pedigree featuring members of Yes , ELP , and UK ( and , by extension , Tomorrow , Bodast , Atomic Rooster , Crazy World of Arthur Brown , King Crimson , Roxy Music , and , of course , the Buggles ) . These instrumental virtuosos strip everything down to a tight , melodic core and simply play these songs like a house on fire . It 's got plenty of proggy elements , but it 's all fairly concise . All of the tracks here are radio-friendly powerhouses , and the album sold by the ton , standing tall at # 1 on the album charts for an astounding 9 straight weeks . The critics , of course , hated it . But it still holds up , more than 20 years later . `` Heat of the Moment '' is where English flash and drama meet the Spector-ish `` Wall of Sound , '' and it makes for a fantastic single . Got ta love the riffage from Steve Howe ! On `` Only Time Will Tell , '' soaring harmonies and a memorable melody powered this track into the Top 10 as well . Geoff Downes proves that he is by no means a `` second tier '' keyboardist with his wonderfully dexterous playing and nuanced sonic textures . A tennis match was allegedly the inspiration for `` Sole Survivor , '' and it jumps back and forth appropriately with a hard-hitting edge . The stately `` One Step Closer '' and the rocking `` Time Again '' also feature soaring harmonies and strong lead vocals from belter John Wetton . Carl Palmer steps to the fore with the tricky percussive showcase , `` Wildest Dreams , '' before the band cools down with the majestic `` Without You '' -- Wetton really shines vocally here . The album closes on a rocking note with `` Here Comes the Feeling . '' Prog purists gagged on this album , but Asia captured a spark and sound that riveted listeners in the early 1980s . Sadly , they were not able to maintain this standard as consistently and brilliantly throughout the rest of their career , but for a few brief , shining moments , Asia ruled the music world .	1
Asia 's debut album has sold many millions ... and not least for the song `` The Heat of the Moment '' which you probably have heard sometimes even have n't heard the name `` Asia '' . There 's so many great songs `` Wildest Dreams '' , `` Only Time Will Tell '' ( ballad ) , `` Without You '' , `` Sole Survivor '' ... the funny `` Cutting It Fine '' ... and the classic keyboard track `` Here Comes the Feeling '' ... John Wetton in vocals made excellent work ... he is much better than John Payne who is n't bad either ... John Wetton made with Asia two other great albums `` Astra '' and `` Alpha '' . John Wetton 's voice is very soft and sensitive ... just great for this kind of soft progressive rock.Stars : Wildest Dreams , Heat of the Moment , Without You	1
THE BAND : John Wetton ( lead vocals , bass ) , Geoff Downes ( keyboards ) , Steve Howe ( guitars ) , Carl Palmer ( drums & percussion ) .THE DISC : ( 1982 ) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 44 minutes . Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page fold out including song titles/credits/times , and musicians . All songs written by Asia members . Album cover art by Roger Dean . Recorded at Townhouse Studio , London , England . Label - Geffen.COMMENTS : I had mixed feelings about Asia 's debut album when it first came out in '82 . One of the first true supergroups that I can recall - Wetton ( most notably from King Crimson and UK ) , Howe ( Yes ) , Palmer ( ELP ) , and Downes ( Buggles and Yes ) . Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were ungodly superstars in their perspective bands during the 70 's . I remember buying the vinyl based on the strength of `` Sole Survivor '' . I remember thinking with these progressive musicians at the helm , there 'd have to be some 10-12 minute spacey head trips . That 's where the mixed feelings came in . All the songs were in the 4 to 5 minute range ( `` Here Comes The Feeling '' is the longest track at 5:42 ) . Wetton and Downes were the main writers here ... and Downes prior catalog with the Buggles was `` pop '' to the max . In retrospect , I now know why Asia had that pop feel - it was Geoff Downes all along . Not that it 's a bad thing ... Asia 's sound just was n't what I was expecting . This album is heavy on keyboards . Steve Howe 's guitar remains mostly in the background outside of a few shining guitar solos . The bass work is great . Carl Palmer 's drumming is steady , but it 's nothing flashy like his days with ELP . Wetton 's vocals are top notch . It 's the songs that eventually made me come around , as it did for so many listeners ( and radio stations ) . Asia 's debut spent 9 weeks at # 1 on the U.S. album chart . `` Heat Of The Moment '' ( reaching # 4 ) , `` Sole Survivor '' ( # 10 ) , and `` Only Time Will Tell '' ( # 17 ) were huge Top 40 hits . Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year . Compilations are saturated with songs from their 1st album - `` The Very Best Of Asia : Heat Of The Moment 1982-90 '' has 6 of the 9 songs from it 's debut , and `` Asia - Gold '' ( 2005 ) incredibly contains all 9 songs . A commercial success to say the least , and fans of its members former bands cried `` sell out '' . All I can say is - you ca n't please everyone . There 's no denying the songs are catchy ... with my favorites being `` Sole Survivor '' , `` Only Time Will Tell '' and the heaviest song `` Time Again '' . One of the top rock debuts from the past several decades . If you want to own one studio album of theirs - this is the one ! As of 2006 , I still look forward to a digitally remastered version with extensive liner notes to be released . This is a classic album from the 80 's ( 5 stars ) .	1
`` Asia '' # 1 ( 1982 ) .When this band formed in late '81 , John Wetton was just getting out of Wishbone Ash , Carl Palmer put aside his band XYZ , Geoff Downes quit the Buggles and Steve Howe dropped out of Yes . This album brought together progressive-rock with a pop underbelly . When I first heard `` Heat Of The Moment '' , # 4 hot 100 and # 1 MSR , it was a breath of fresh air on the music charts . Rock 'N ' Roll radio ate this album up , and it should of , it was that good . Wetton 's vocals are top notch . ( I alway 's thought he was one little step below Greg Lake at the time ) . Their follow up single `` Only Time Will Tell '' , # 17 hot 100 and # 8 MSR . Other great songs on this terrific debut were , `` Here Comes The Feeling '' # 40 MSR , `` Time Again '' , # 43 MSR , `` Wildest Dreams '' , # 28 MSR , `` Sole Survivor '' , a classic tune with John Wetton 's excellent bass work , the beautiful mid-tempo ballad `` Without You '' and the slashing `` Cutting It Fine '' . Carl Palmer 's drumming and Steve Howe 's guitar work could n't be topped on this disc .	1
Prog rock worriors got together to team up this project band.The main concept is & quot ; LESS IS MORE & quot ; .That is no more meaningless guitar solos or keyboard solos.This strategy turned out to be very successful in Japan.The songs are so compact and commercial enough to capture listeners heart.This is the JOHM WETTONS 's album and moreover WETTON 'S composership reals his brilliant craftsmanship and his strong vocal expressiveness .	1
Sadly enough for many years I forgot about this album and did not listen to it . I bought the vinyl and remember hearing all the hits on the radio and remember enjoying it very much playing it on my turntable . I was 22 years old ! I was already a fan of Yes , Emerson , Lake & Palmer , etc . But unlike bands like Yes that delivered a multitude of good releases over the years , Asia fell short . So after being letdown by their subsequent releases , after a decade I forgot about the best one `` Asia '' . Thanks to MP3 I have rediscovered this great release . Every song is a winner and this really rates right up there as one of the best prog albums of all time . The songs are so well written it 's just a shame this band couldnt have come up with more songs like this on later albums . They could have been legendary ! It was only a lack of material that stopped them . This album sounds like a Greatest Hits album , like the hit singles from a career full of hits . They were just right on the mark at this time period with the great songs & production work along with soaring vocal delivery by John Wetton . They did make some more decent albums and standout tracks . But nothing compared to this first Asia album . It was a classic rock album that stands the test of time . It sounds as good today as it did 27 years ago !	1
Old Asia was great , was n't it ? I 've had this album for several years now and it 's still one of the best CD 's in my collection . To me all three of Asia 's albums are gems . Steve Howe 's aggressive guitars combined with Geoff Down 's elegant and at times catchy keyboard playing , not to mention the killer choruses , make this and all their albums come alive . There are no real highlights on this album because all the songs are GREAT ! To me none of them stand out any more than the others . The only song I do n't like quite as much as the rest of the tracks is & quot ; One Step Closer. & quot ; But even that song is no slouch . Any fans out there of progressive rock do n't pass this one up !	1
Asia is the grandest superband on earth . But why Asia ? They tried to show that this is no traditional British progressive rock nor American progressive hard rock and it lies somewhere between . Heat of the Moment , Only Time Will Tell , Sole Survivor are super-excellent . Particularly interim keyboard bridge part of Soul Survivor has been embedded in my memory for so long . Rest of the tracks are very dynamic as well and showing the longtime legacy of British prog a bit . John Wetton 's clear voice is another of the band 's appeal . Recommended for wide range of melodic rock and progressive rock fans who may like Dream Theater .	1
Asia was Steve Howe , John Wetton , Geoffrey Downes , and Carl Palmer . These four guys would become instant stars with their debut album , simply titled , Asia . Howe was already an accomplished guitarist with the progressive supergroup , Yes , while Carl Palmer brought his talents from the equally-successful progressive trio , Emerson , Lake & Palmer . Downes was a keyboard player for Yes ' Drama album from 1980 , and Whetton was an accomplished vocalist elsewhere . They would fuse their talents and come up with some of the most memorable songs of the 80 's , and of all time . Songs like HEAT OF THE MOMENT , SOLE SURVIVOR , and ONLY TIME WILL TELL are classics to this day . These guys would stick around for several more years and albums , and would n't match the success of their first album . Still , they were a great band that put out some great music . 9/10	1
At the dawn of the 1980s , the ship of progressive rock had all but foundered on the jagged reefs of musical fashion , weighted down with its leaden pretensions and buoyed on toward ruin by a new wave . Things looked bleak for fans of this once-glorious genre . But then , like a phoenix from the ashes , a band arose from the wreck , borne on the wings of a dragon : Asia.By its very nature , any supergroup is bound to inspire somewhat outsize expectations . But Asia had outsize expectations even for a supergroup . Assembled from the ranks of Yes ( Steve Howe ) , Emerson Lake & Palmer ( Carl Palmer ) , King Crimson ( John Wetton ) , and the Buggles ( Geoff Downes ) , Asia - or the idea of Asia - must have seemed a band of messianic proportions to fans of prog rock . So with outsize expectations firmly in place , Asia proceeded to confound them utterly.The big hits `` Heat of the Moment '' and `` Only Time Will Tell '' give a good indication of ASIA , both album and band , overall . One can hear traces of King Crimson in Wetton 's elephantine bass sound and passionate vocals ; there are moments that recall Yes when Howe interweaves his classically-tinged guitar lines with Downes ' beefy keyboard textures . But ultimately , this does n't sound like some alchemical fusion of its members ' former bands . Because by focusing their attack into four-minute blasts instead of sprawling LP-length epics , Asia strip prog down to its sinewy core - `` arena prog '' , if you care to put a label to it , sounding as much like Journey as Genesis . ( Early Genesis , that is - in the early 80s , Genesis were blazing many of the same trails as Asia were . ) For prog purists , that constituted nothing short of treason . But for listeners who came without preconceptions - i.e . those who sent ASIA soaring to # 1 and `` Heat of the Moment '' and `` Only Time Will Tell '' to # 4 and # 17 , respectively - it sounded pretty damn awesome . The furious `` Time Again '' , the pulsating `` Here Comes the Feeling '' , the exuberant `` One Step Closer '' ... still sounds pretty damn awesome , really . Asia may not have been able to save progressive rock . But they were able to produce a great album , and that 's good enough for me .	1
I really only like the first 3 songs here but what incredible songs they are ! & quot ; Supergroups & quot ; usually are bands of big name stars trying to outdo each other.Not in this band , no way.They could 've really gone into overblown territory but everything stays in check.A solid piece of music start to finish .	1
I first heard of Asia while driving home from a night class in the spring semester 1982 , but the snow we were fighting made it seem anything like spring . There were four of us in the car that night when WEBN played & quot ; Heat Of The Moment & quot ; . Rob actively disliked the song . Mark guessed King Crimson , Bob guessed Yes , and I thought ELP . Turned out we were all partly right . I bought the album almost immediately , only to have my sister ruin it by dropping the stylus while trying to go back to listen to her favorite song for the hundredth time in a row . Asia may have seemed contrived to some , overdone to others , but I 've always thought of it as a perfect snapshot of the spring and summer of 1982 . From my way of thinking , music is at it 's best when twenty+ years later it still gives you that brief taste of life as it was the first time you heard it . This album is like that for me . The albums that followed were decent , but this one never failed to play all the way through . I can point to a favorite song , or rather some favorites , but I ca n't say that there 's anything on it that I regard as inferior to the others . That does n't happen often , so when it does occur , I make sure to add it to my road library immediately .	1
this CD was to replace an LP I had of this album . some good tunes on it you do n't hear much of this group on the air play anymore , this is a good way to collect the music .	1
What a great start ! This album earned Asia 3 hits ( & quot ; Heat of the Moment & quot ; , & quot ; Only Time Will Tell & quot ; , and & quot ; Sole Survivor & quot ; ) . It featured the experimental side of the band members ' & quot ; alma matters & quot ; Yes ( Steve Howe and Geoff Downes , sorry , I only heard 1 song from the Buggles ! ) , ELP ( Carl Palmer , who would comment that he preferred playing shorter songs like on this album ) , and King Crimson ( John Wetton ) . That , combined with the techno-pop sound , this band had potential ! The chenistry worked , at least for this album ( on the next album , the potential was greater than the execution , and personell changes such as Greg Lake temporarily replacing Wetton in the midst of the tour and Howe leaving shortly after ) . But let 's remember this 1 great moment for the band ! And most of this album sounds as good as did when we found ourselves in '82 ! ( like the hits mentioned above and songs like & quot ; One Step Closer & quot ; & quot ; Here Comes the Feeling & quot ; , and & quot ; Time Again & quot ; )	1
While not necessarily in terms of attitude I personally have much in common with Joni Michell . We both love painting and combining it with music in some way.All one needs to do is look at this ladies track record in terms of musical innovation in the 1970 's that led her from folksy poetic observations to ... ..well jazzy poetic obversations.And pretty much between an early album such asCloudsand ... .sayDon Juan 's Reckless Daughterthere was a huge musical tide to swim in for listeners . Joni 's work has always been as a journey in one way or another , whether it be musical or personal . Sometimes it was painful , sometimes tired and sometimes love struck . Much the same as Van Morrison Joni 's sound managed to age well from era to era by choosing to look at things artistically . Well the early 80 's pop music scene had sadly very to do with art often enough.And lucky for the era Joni was obviously in a really good state of mind during this period because her and her new bassman Larry Klein really layed down the bottom on this album ! While embracing the slick production of early 80 's pop/rock we all know Joni was'nt about to go willy nilly into this.The whole Talking Heads/Police/Steely Dan thing was really getting through to her and , despite what she says I 'll bet some Klaus Doldinger 's Passport stuff likeEarthbornduring this time because the influence of that chilly 80 's euro-fusion just about reeks out of cuts such as `` Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody '' , a clever retooling of a classic and setting the stage for this album : the main focus of this album is love and the view of youthful eros from the perspective of middle age.And it comes through in the music too.The title track , a loose cover of Elvis 's `` ( You 're So Square ) Baby , I Do n't Care '' and `` Moon At The Window '' feature some pretty charged up rock guitars , far more so then Joni explored in the past.This album is really informed by all the musical tides she swam with during the 80 's from folksy quitude to electric jazz/funk explorations and for that part of it you can get no better then '' Ladies ' Man '' , '' Solid Love '' and the lyrically pointed `` Be Cool '' , where for one of a very few times Joni is actually giving direct advice rather then musing as an outside party . 'Man To Man '' and `` You Dream Flat Towers '' , the excellent `` Man To Man '' and `` Underneath The Streetlights '' are all short ready made for radio kind of easy rock songs , at least a Joni-fied variation on them.The ending of the album is `` Love '' is really the gell that glues the entire album together ; jazzy , folksy and rocky all at once and actually takes the `` puppy love vs/mature love '' theme as far as she can . It 's really strange that so many people have the impression this album is more poppy and lacks in the jazziness of albums such asMingus . Nothing could be further from the truth as the two axes of Larry Klein ( and Carlton ) on these songs provided all kinds of great improvised riffing along with that great shuffling of the drums , not to mention Joni 's singing dropping down to her lower vocal register from one moment to the next . Either way this did do a lot of bring Joni 's creative , influential musical stylings to a new generation listening in fact to many performers and musicians who were doing everything they could to catch up with her artistry .	1
`` Wild Things Run Fast '' is an unforgettable album with many different atmospheres . It open with the beautifully nostalgic `` Chinese Cafe '' than launches right into the riff heavy sprawl of the title track . Touching on smooth & lovely jazz on numbers like `` Moon At The Window '' & `` Ladie 's Man '' then switching back into rock & roll soul romps such as `` You Dream Flat Tires '' & `` You 're So Square '' . Other amazing moments include the melodic flipped-collar Vienna dreamscape of `` Underneath The Streetlight '' & the appropriately suave `` Be Cool '' , & ending with the wonderful `` Love '' whichs rings true for everyone . She proclaims : '' Love suffers longLove is kind ! Enduring all thingsLove has no evil in mindIf I had the gift of prophecyAnd all the knowledgeAnd the faith to move the mountainsEven if I understood all of the mysteriesIf I did n't have loveI 'd be nothing . `` This is a wonderful expreimental album with fun & also introverted moments . It 's well worth it ! Highly recommended .	1
I liked this album from the very first time I heard it.This is by no means quintessential Joni . Nowhere in this album will you hear the vulnerable optimist who weaves complicated poetry , touching its peak with high notes . That 's the Joni Mitchell of BLUE and LADIES OF THE CANYON . This is a different Joni on a different quest . And I make no apologies in being a die-hart Mitchell fan who enjoys this CD every chance she gets.These are pop/soft-rock songs , all sung in Joni 's lower register with a focus , as always , on lyrics . The songs are catchy . They 're exactly the upbeat tempo I like to have in my car on the way to work , and they 're smoothed out so nicely with a low-riding instrumentation that you can listen to them at the end of the day as well , kick off your shoes , and get into the mellow aspect of these poppy beats.To me , this album is perfect when I 'm in a certain mood . When I need something upbeat , poppy and with flow ... but I 'm not in the mood to listen to bland , commercialized lyrics ... this is the perfect mix . I get my catchy songs - but with Joni-quality lyrics ! This is not an example of the folk-song artwork that made her famous . It 's something completely different . But I 'm not always in the mood for folk music ! Sometimes I want to hear something more lively and groovy . So I 'm glad Joni made an album for THAT too.I have a friend who sings the `` Be Cool '' song on this album every time she gets in a fight with her long-term boyfriend . She said it keeps her from doing something stupid . Personally , I prefer the `` Man to man '' song because of the mellow beat and the articular lyrics.You just ca n't dissuade true Joni Mitchell fans . We want her in all her forms !	1
another reviewer said this : & quot ; I 'd advise picking this one up sooner than either of the two indie releases. & quot ; I assume he works for Geffen like whoever put Mutations in the 'essentials ' list which I heavily disagree w/ , anyhow he 's not totally wrong as these here are all fine funky tunes , Corvette Bummer is Bek 's vision of ultrabassy hiphop complete w/ whacked out rhymes : & quot ; all my days I had mouldy bread ... gon na leap like a worm , gon na take my shoes right off & amp ; smell my socks & quot ; . In a similar style is the version of Soul Suckin ' Jerk which I thought was thouroughly full of grooves enough on Mellow Gold , but I 'm not complaining about the existence of this as it goes even further w/ the funk [ sorry I have to live up to this name ] . Fume is a funny yet disturbing true story of a couple of kids who got in their car & amp ; breathed in nitrous oxide & amp ; died . Alcohol is one of several drinking odes he had around this time [ the lovely Whisky Can Can off the K 7 & quot ; , Whiskeyclone/ Hotel City off MG , BEERCAN , Crystal Clear Beer off Stereopathetic , etc ] & amp ; is a nice hymanl sounding tune . Then of course is everyone 's introduction to his world of wonder , Loser which is still brilliant , both in amusing verse & amp ; creative multilayered sounds . & quot ; In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey & quot ; , yeah he was never 1 of the sheep ...	1
This CD features Beck 's big hit `` Loser '' , plus three previously unreleased songs from his early years . It 's all typical Beck from the time period ( not that there is such a thing as `` typical Beck '' ) . Beck 's fans should enjoy this CD .	1
this is the place to go . Most of these songs are actually stronger than some things that ended up on that album . Since it 's short and because I can , I 'll go through each track now.1 . Loser - Not much I can say here . the same old single we all know and love.2 . Corvette Bummer - Nice groove . I love the fact that despite being a `` rap '' song , most of the lines do n't actually rhyme with each other , and yet it takes you a while for you to notice this because Beck makes it flow so well . Somehow I really like the way he 's spitting out his `` p 's '' in the vocal delivery . The ending is bizarre and hillarious as well.3 . alcohol - a pretty folk song about being drunk . This song has always kind of creeped me out in a way . I remember when I was 13 and accidentally played it on the jukebox because it was the b-side to `` Loser '' it freaked me out , especially that weird unexpected noise coda , and the line `` if I stay in the same place , the animals will lick my face '' . Nowadays I 'm somewhat used to weird noises leaping out of my stereo thanks to hearing a few residents albums , but it 's still eerie , albeit in a good way.4 . Soul Sucking Jerk ( Reject ) - While the version of this song on mellow gold has it 's own appeal in it 's pure bizarre trippiness , I prefer the more straightforward funkier version found here . I love the bit towards the beginning where Beck announces `` rockin ' the town like a moldy crouton ! `` , and the long funky organ solo ( which is mostly why this version 's longer ) . Only thing I do n't like is that the verse order is switched around a bit , partially because it throws me off trying to sing along , and partially because it starts off with what I always thought to be the weakest verse lyrically.5 . fume - funny and yet kind of scary . Apparently inspired by the true story of a bunch of kids who drove around in a truck full of nitrous oxide and died . The details like the images of them cranking Molly Hatchet and their previous attempts at getting high by `` smoking broken pencils '' put a comic spin to it , as does the chorus , but there 's still something unsettling . I love the woozy sounding slide guitar during the chorus that fits perfectly with the subject matter . Bit of a surprise ending as well , but I 'm not going to give it away.So in conclusion , if you liked mellow gold , you 'll pretty much like this , especially if you sort of wished there were a few more funky numbers like `` beercan '' in there .	1
`` Loser '' is the song that put Beck on the musical map and this EP ( 5 songs , 23 min . ) is essential to any Beck fan 's collection . For one , none of the 4 bonus songs are on the `` Mellow Gold '' album . `` Corvette Bummer '' is in the same vain as the `` Mellow Gold '' album , with an irresitable beat . `` Alcohol '' is an accoustic reflective tune , quite nice . `` Soul Sucking Jerk '' is a 6 min . scratch-and-rap tune , also irresistable . `` Fume '' is the only weak track of the bunch.Beck has done many different things since `` Mellow Gold '' . I loved `` Midnite Vultures '' but I just did n't `` get '' his latest CD ( `` Sea Change '' ) . However , Beck 's output from the `` Mellow Gold '' -era remains unsurpassed , and this EP is essential .	1
I do n't think this is the best Beck album to buy , that would be `` Odelay '' , but this does have what is perhaps his best and most demented song to date . That of course is the title track . How does he even come up with these lyrics ? They 're almost surreal in their randomness . This song makes `` I Am the Walrus '' sound normal by comparison . Beck 's really not a great singer , but the way he delivers these lyrics is just flawless . I really ca n't describe what I 'm talking about here . Like , I 'm a much better singer , but I could never do it as perfectly as he does . If that does n't make sense , oh well . It 's befitting of a Beck review anyway . : -PBy the way , did you ever notice that that Butthole Surfers song `` Pepper '' sounds exactly like `` Loser '' . I for one think that 's no coincidence.Anyway , this is a must-buy for those like weird , psychotic music .	1
Evidently , there are 2 versions of this single . I bought one way back in the day which has LOSER on it , accompanied by CORVETTE BUMMER and these two other UNBELIEVABLE songs ! TOTALLY CONFUSED , a mellow song with ( get this ) a female back up singer , and one of Beck 's greatest songs of all time -- MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK , where Beck tears it up on the piano . You need to find this version of the single as well , because the songs on this particular version are really cool , but having a Beck collection at your home without MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK is like showing up at church naked ... it 's UNSPEAKABLE !	1
First of all , its an EP but it has LOSER on it which I already have . Then it also has SOUL SUCKIN JERK which I already have . So what am I paying for ? Well first off , SOUL SUCKIN JERK is even better than the one you know ( and that song was flippin awesome in the first place ) .Well , consider a few things . How much of a BECK fan are you ? Do you like the LOSER song ? Are you into BECK because you just heard that E-PRO song on the radio ? I like the songs on here a whole lot , personally . I would n't have just bought this myself on a whim , I knew ahead of time that I wanted the songs ... Like FUME . This is a very raw , old school BECK song , about locking yourself up in a vehicle with your friend and huffing gas to get high . This song has one of the greatest BECK hooks ever ... .Theres a fume , in the truckand I do n't know if I 'm deador what the f*ckGreat stuff . Beck does n't sware like he used to . He used to sware alot . He had a lot more piss and fire in his songs , this stuff may seem very strange to new fish . CORVETTE BURNER is another raw rowdy peice and ALCOHOL is a folksy ONE FOOT IN type of song . If you 've never heard the ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE album , this one may seem kind of strange too.Beck has a lot of ultra rare stuff , B-sides , soundtrack cuts , indie records ... One of these days it would be nice to see some sort of anthology be released . Theres so much great stuff by this loser.As for this one , try and get it cheap , as it IS only three songs that you would n't be able to find else where .	1
With the price of this EP being so cheap , I do n't see any reason why you should n't buy this . Especially considering that , in my opinion , two of Beck 's top ten songs to date are featured as b-sides here . Those songs being the Reject version of `` Soul Suckin Jerk '' and `` Fume '' . On top of that , `` Alcohol '' and `` Corvette Bummer '' are equally as pleasing to the everyday or diehard Beck fan . And although I do n't necessarily believe Beck has better b-sides than a-sides , his b-sides are definitely worth checking out ( at all costs ) , and outdo most other band 's a-sides in that . `` Corvette Bummer '' is a rap/rock laugher that features trademark quirky lyrics and pumping bass , while `` Alcohol '' is more of a serene , acoustic gem in the vein of tracks from Beck 's unknown album , One Foot In The Grave . Next , being my second favorite Beck track ever , `` Soul Suckin Jerk ( Reject ) '' takes the two main verses from the original , switches them around , and makes the rapping a bit more distinguishable and amiable . The part that jumps in with 'I got a job making money for the man/throwing chicken in a bucket/with a soda-pop can ... ' always makes me want to rap along . It does carry on for a long , long time ( six minutes ) , but I think the music is catchy enough to keep it tolerable . The final b-side , `` Fume '' , is a hilarious narrative of a guy and his friend who drive around in their truck and get high enough on broken pencils to say 'and I do n't know if we 're dead/or what the fxck ' . For the first 2:25 or so it 's musically simple , but thereafter it goes into endless screams of the aforementioned line . And that 's Beck for you.This really is the greatest Beck single/EP on the market , even after all the years and his latter releases . `` Soul Suckin Jerk ( Reject ) '' and `` Fume '' alone make buying this a no-brainer , while the other two b-sides only add to its greatness . That 's four songs you ca n't find anywhere else . If you love Beck you are going to love this EP , and you should n't even think of buying anything else . The toast is ready .	1
The Eagles ' drummer Don Henley released his second solo album , this one , in late 1984 after signing with Geffen Records . His solo debut , I CA N'T STAND STILL was released in 1982 on Asylum , the same label that the Eagles recorded on . Henley 's fellow Eagle Glenn Frey was enjoying success as a solo artist as well . Eagles fans enjoyed Henley taking the lead on some of their hits like HOTEL CALIFORNIA , LIFE IN THE FAST LANE , THE LONG RUN , BEST OF MY LOVE and ONE OF THESE NIGHTS . On this hit album are the hits THE BOYS OF SUMMER , ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS DANCE and SUNSET GRILL ( Cher covered the latter ) . I also heard a cover of TBOS , but I do n't remember the artist who covered it . Henley 's next album , THE END OF THE INNOCENCE , released in 1989 , was a much bigger hit .	1
... and with it a legendary career in rock , balls and good taste.His 1984 opus , even though a product of that ( golden , by the way ) era , is a combination of wit , intelligence , social awareness , poetry , all topped by supreme songwriting skills and one of the best voices in biz .	1
Another excellent album from Don Henley . As usual with his albums , the quality of the songs is uniformly high , the only one I do n't like is the closing track , Land of the Living . It 's evident from the start of the album that it was made in the 80 's . The excellent opening track , The Boys of Summer , along with most of the rest of the album , is synth-driven , in a manner that is distinctly early 80 's . But thankfully , Don Henley is not Phil Collins so we do n't get some outdated garbage when we play this album now . The lyrics especially have stood the test of time . Tracks like The Boys of Summer and the highly underrated and supremely touching A Month of Sundays evoke Henley 's trademark lyrical imagery ( i.e . & quot ; that dark desert highway song & quot ; . Also we get politically charged songs like Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed and All She Wants To Do Is Dance ( whose lyrics were apparently actually written by Danny Kortchmar ) that are extremely thought-provoking . And , as always with Henley , there are a handful of non-cliched songs that deal with human relationships and love . The most notable of those included here are Not Enough Love In The World and the satratic You 're Not Drinking Enough . Another one of the album 's main lyrical themes is the mass commercialization of America and the death of small business , which manifests itself most notably on A Month of Sundays and Sunset Grill ( the latter being especially ironic considering the present state of the Sunset Grill ) . If you 're not looking for an album that hits home with the current musical trends and/or are a fan of honest and good lyrics then you could definately do worse than picking up a copy of Don Henley 's Building The Perfect Beast .	1
Don Henley is a bit like cactus , interesting to observe , but hyper sensitive to the touch..And , ruthlessly armed with country boy smarts..A regular Huck Finn..And out there somewhere in his own East Texas galaxy , slaying all manners of demons and dragons for clean-air causes..But the talent and songwriting ca n't be denied..The music ( the by-product of the angst ) more than compensates for whatever internal petty land grabs busted up the `` Eagles '' ..Apparently , Henley 's a control freak and cares deeply about quality control issues -- a distinctly American enterprise value..Henley transplanted himself from East Texas to the Gold Coast of Southern California ( checked into Hotel California ) to hit the jackpot in rock and roll..And struggled early to earn his spurs , his editorial voice..As to Freedom from The Labels..Art vs. Big Business..Good vs . Evil..Henley claims the labels really taught him how to hate , nor trust anyone , save and except his own instincts..A capital idea..He watched and mastered the game..Hired David Geffen to manage him since he knew , `` He 's an `` SOB '' ..a shark in a suit..but he 's my `` SOB '' ..my personal pocket shark repellant '' ..The net result of the manuevering became..Better Music..Bigger Ideas..More Autonomy..Rock Star Status..Leading Henley to ( earn the stroke ) to pen music of conscience i.e `` Dirty Laundry '' , about relevant societal issues rather than the formulaic piffle much Eagle 's music represents..Without doubt , Henley is the blue chip artiste to evolve out of the Eagles..And a capable drummer to boot..And this CD is worth its weight in Gold records.. `` Boys of Summer '' .. `` Sunset Grille '' .. `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' ..Are well connived political juxtapositions..From an unusually politically activist mind..Yet , at times , remains conflicted..Environmentalist/Gazillionaire..Does n't matter in the end..This is a bone bruising collage of tunes , as prescient as any John Lennon or Jackson Browne faire..Though I might not care to schmooze with Henley , one ca n't help but admire the contribution..Just who is the Perfect Beast in this scenario ? ..Henley , like Jackson Pollack , might not win any popularity contests , but like Pollack , you ca n't dismiss the talent , the music , the ideology..There 's a very fine line between love and hate..Perfect bi-polar country cousins ! Even Henley might agree with the embarrassing truth of that to-do list of `` Dirty Laundry '' .	1
to be honest I was not a big fan or Don Henley growing up . That is n't to say I did n't like him , it 's just that he was n't the type of artist that I 'd buy a whole album for . However , now that I am older and have amassed over 800cds , I have started to look back at stuff I remember and tried to see if there was something I missed the last time . With this cd , both the price and the autorip feature made it an instant sale for me . I did like boys of summer , and I detest the remake by the Ataris . And maybe it was out of the disgust for the remake that I decided to revisit the original . And I am glad I did . Boys of Summer is a great classic song , and alls he wants to do is dance is a great song ( and also a big hit for Henley ) but to me ( at the time ) it was overplayed so I tended to overloook it for that reason , but now I find it to be a classic as well . There are other songs such as Driving with Your Eyes Closed and You ca n't make love that are also great , and to be honest upon listening to the whole cd I find pretty much all of it is great . Most albums , even by artists I am totally into will sometimes have songs that you always skip when listening to the album , and other artists you can pretty much listen until the end . This is one of those albums . Also a big plus ( as I am a bit picky when it comes to cd packaging ) is that this album includes the lyrics . I know some people do not care as they can look it up online , But , I grew up with music being tangible and not a souless download , so I love looking at liner notes and lyrics in my hand . when I am enjoying music ( and not just using it for background filler ) I want to immerse myself into it . So going online when I am listening to my music is not my idea of how an album should be enjoyed . I am a bit of a snob in this area . But , the only time I 'll get a download as opposed to a real cd or other physical copy is when that song is only available online or if it 's part of a promotion from amazon . I love my collection , and for those who love your collections as well , this album is a definite must have .	1
great CD , very poiltically incorrect I love it . I had tyhe tape but needed the disc	1
Of the ex-Eagles doing solo material , I so far have only gotten Don Henley 's second solo album , Building The Perfect Beast . He gets a lot of help from guitarist Danny Kortchmar in music , songwriting , and keyboards . This is a nice exercise in light rock that still has hallmarks of the mellow California sound popularized by his ex-bandmates the Eagles , J.D . Souther , Karla Bonoff , and Linda Ronstadt . Even though Glenn Frey had more notable hits than him , Don Henley 's reputation is more intact , as Frey meandered into poppy soundtrack music that alienated his old crowd . `` The Boys Of Summer '' having been covered recently by DJ Sammy and AFI , makes me appreciate the original all the more . I mean an oontsa-oontsa remix or a punk cover clearly can never capture the wistful pain of trying to forget a lost time on the beach.Another variation on the wealth not being able to buy love is told on the leisurely `` You Ca n't Make Love '' featuring Lindsey Buckingham on guitar and harmonies and the HeartbreakersBenmont Tench on keyboards . There 's an added dimension to the theme , that one can make a promise and walk down an aisle , and `` make a life for her that fits like a glove '' but -- you get the idea.The rocking `` Man With A Missionwith a 50 's rock-and-roll sound , of someone out to have a rowdy partying time , such as running a few red lights , starting some fist fights , drinking a few beers . I was surprised this did n't make it on the Fast Times At Ridgemont High soundtrack , because thematically , this would fit . Charlie Sexton helps on guitar , as does Belinda Carlisle on harmonies . `` You 're Not Drinking Enough '' has a trace of the country rock that popularized the Eagles . The idea here is trying to forget a woman and if `` you still wan na hold her/you must not be drinkin ' enough . '' The way he writes how men get stomped caught my eye : `` She passed on your passion/and stepped on your pride/turns out you ai n't quite so tough . `` `` Not Enough Love In The World '' is a timely song that has shades even today . `` I know people hurt you bad/they do n't know the damage they can do , and it makes me sad/how we knock each other down just like children on a playground . `` The tribal drums and chants of the title track is a jab at creating the ultimate person with motifs of the gods of Olympus and Methuselah . `` Relieve all pain and suffering and lift us out of the dark/turn us all into Methuselah/But where are we gon na park ? is a cheekily humorous question to the age old quest for immortality . Patty Smyth , J.D . Souther , and Martha Davis of the Motels contribute to the chants.The fuzzy bass synth in `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' makes this one of the most familiar songs by ear on the radio . Martha Davis and Patty Smyth help out here again.The tearful `` A Month Of Sundays '' is by far the best song here , on the reflections of a farmer now on hard times , a familiar sight during the Reagan era . The generation gap is shown with the more left of center grandson and the son-in-law , a Vietnam veteran who 's dismissive : `` That little punk , he never had to serve '' The last few verses alone make a melancholy sunset . `` Sunset Grill '' is a social commentary on the mean city and the soul-draining effects it has . The subject here wants to leave , but here 's the tragic joke : `` What would we do without all these jerks anyway ? Besides , all our friends are here . `` Henley gets a lot of help from varied musicians , such as some Heartbreakers , a woman from a Motel , and a woman who causes a Scandal . The light style rock does still give out that peaceful easy feeling of his former band , but his solo album shows he was the lynchpin of the Eagles .	1
Ah , the sound of those synthesized drums that were EVERYWHERE in 1984 . If Orwell had his book to write over again , he 'd warn us about the shelf life of those babies . Musically , songs like the title track and `` Sunset Grill '' scream to you loud and clear exactly when they were made , but the album still hits home today . With Walmart and various other corporations running the world , the lyrics of `` Sunset Grill '' are even more relevant today ( and ironic , since the real location is now owned by a corporation ! ) . `` A Month of Sundays '' has got to be one of the most poignant songs I have EVER heard , and it could certainly apply to many industries besides farming . `` The Boys of Summer '' still holds up as just about the best song from the 1980 's , and `` Not Enough Love '' and `` You 're Not Drinking Enough '' show us why Don just might be the best vocalist in all of popular music .	1
This is probably former Eagles drummer Don Henley 's best solo effort , with & quot ; The End Of The Innocence & quot ; coming in a close second.Perhaps a bit too much synth for my taste , but that 's a minor complaint , and & quot ; Building The Perfect Beast & quot ; does feature some of Henley 's best and most melodious songs , such as the MTV hit & quot ; The Boys Of Summer & quot ; , & quot ; You Ca n't Make Love & quot ; , & quot ; Not Enough Love In The World & quot ; , & quot ; You 're Not Drinking Enough & quot ; and & quot ; All She Wants To Do Is Dance & quot ; .Henley 's voice is strong and soulful ( he was always The Eagles ' greatest singer ) , and with the exception of a few minor tracks , the songs are of high quality , both lyrically and melodically .	1
I 'm a huge Eagles fan and this is the best solo effort by any of them . I had Henley 's greatest hits and loved all of the tracks , so I decided to pick up this album . I was thrilled . Every song is great . The Boys of Summer is one of those songs that just hits the stop so perfectly . It reflects how nostalga ca n't bring back the past . All She Wants to Do Is Dance rocks hard and perfectly expresses Henley 's cynicality . Not Enough Love In The World is great ballad from a master . Sunset Grill is a great picture-esque tune about the end of small business and increasing corporatization in America . Man With A Mission , You Ca n't Make Love , and the title track really , really rock . You 're Not Drinking Enough again conveys Henley 's cynicism and rocks while it 's at it . Every song her is worth it .	1
Although several songs here have n't aged well , the majority of this album allows us to remember the days of conspicuos consumption and moral bankruptcy that defined the 1980 's . `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' is my favorite here : anyone who has ever traveled abroad and been embarresed in public by the rude , ignorant behavior of our countrymen will relate to this one ! `` A Months Of Sundays '' takes up the forgotten plight of America 's farmers , whose suicide rate for a while , at least among males , rivaled that of Western Samoa ! `` Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed '' sums up our politicians today as well as it did in 1984. Henley writes for Americans who still read books , and stil believe that individual freedom is the last doorstop we have left before the door of government-imposed conformity slams our heads in its marble-encrustedframe.This is easily one of the top 10 American rock albums of the 1980 's !	1
The Eagles are obviously considered a classic band . That said , Don Henley is the brightest , most original member of that band as a solo artist . He has only released three studio cds since 1982 , and all of them are excellent recordings . His latest , Otherwise , is due in about a month , and I , like other fans , have waited 11 long years for this . Building the Perfect Beast ( BTPB ) , is , I think , his best recording to date . Why ? Well , aside from the hits & quot ; Boys of Summer & quot ; , & quot ; All She Wants To Do Is Dance & quot ; , & quot ; Not Enough Love In The World & quot ; , & quot ; Driving With Your Eyes Closed & quot ; and & quot ; Sunset Grill & quot ; it has great album tracks like & quot ; Man With A Mission & quot ; , & quot ; A Month of Sundays & quot ; , & quot ; Land Of The Living & quot ; , & quot ; Building The Perfect Beast & quot ; and & quot ; You 're Not Drinking Enough. & quot ; All the eleven tracks come together to form a classic cd . The recording quality and choice of instruments is excellent . It still sounds fresh 16 years later . The lyrics and music work together to form a more cohesive cd than 1982 's I Ca n't Stand Still . While 1989 's The End of the Innocence is probably more mature and refined than BTPB , BTPB has more edge to it , and possibly a fresher sound overall . I think any rock collector should not only have The Eagles , but should also have all three Henley ( soon to be four ) cds . However , if you only have money for one , Building the Perfect Beast is the one to own .	1
Any fan of The Eagles should add this to their collection . The style is classic , and the memories just keep flooding back .	1
Soon I will have to replace this on cd-I have it on vinyl & amp ; cassette & amp ; played both til they nearly fell apart . Every song is a gem , from the title track Building The Perfect Beast-great percussion throughout to the rockin ' All She Wants To Do Is Dance . Once you pop this into your cd or cassette player you 'll want to hear it several times . If you 're not too enamored of Don 's latest cd ( Inside Job ) then this is the only cd you 'll need to get an idea of how brilliant his singing/songwriting really is .	1
Building The Perfect Beast was at the peak of music technology for 1984 and still sounds excellent today . Sunset Grill and Boys of Summer will live on as 80 's all time rock classics . Don 's lite rock is just as good as his hard rock songs . Don always has great studio musicians backing him and has an all star lineup here . Danny Korchmar 's guitar playing rocks throughout the CD . David Paich and Michael Boddiker do excellent work on the synthesizers ; especially on Sunset Grill . Every song is good , if not great on this album , plus Henley 's lyrics always make his recordings worth a listen .	1
Don Henley is truly a great singer , and this album does not dissappoint.He definitely has his own style . This has some absolute gems on it . '' The Boys of Summer '' is a classic all time song . The perfect hit song that is timeless . '' Sunset Grill '' is also great and `` Driving with your eyes closed '' This is a mainstream album , and many music fans would enjoy Henleys workTop music !	1
With Building The Perfect Beast , Don Henley released an album that was his most bitingly critical and cynical album to date . The album is a commentary on the baby boomers , who in the 60 's were the counterculture , but where now the mainstream yuppies in the Reagan-era 80 's . There is alot of commentary on the Reaganomics mentallity of greed is good . He takes on his adopted home state of California in numerous songs . In the title cut , Henley comments that back in the 60 's , California was a place of rebellion , trying to build social change , but now it was a place trying to build the perfect money making machine . & quot ; Man With A Mission & quot ; is about the seemingly singlemindness of the country to succeed at any and all costs . & quot ; Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed & quot ; is a veiled commentary on how he felt Reagan was running the country . The big hit single & quot ; Boys Of Summer & quot ; is a lament about trying to recapturing the past , but knowing things will never be the same again . & quot ; All She Wants To Do Is Dance & quot ; talks about the bad things going on down in Central America , but our country 's lack of care as things are too good here . Not everything is politically charged like the country-blues sounds of & quot ; You 're Not Drinking Enough & quot ; , the moody & quot ; Sunset Grill & amp ; the pretty & quot ; Not Enough Love In The World & quot ; , but they are critical in nature . The album is one of the defining releases of the 80 's as it employs a very contempary sound with alot of synthesisers and drum machines , but since the songs are so great , it a timeless release and the apex of Don Henley 's solo career .	1
This CD brings back the memories of summer vacation and jamming to the Boys Of Summer while laying out by the pool as a teenager . Out of all of Henley 's solo efforts , I believe this is his best one . Except for Dirty Laundry , it has most of the iconic songs he is remembered for like All She Wants To Do Is Dance and Boys Of Summer . It is a must have for music fans .	1
One day during the summer of 1985 , on one of my occasional jaunts to the local strip mall to buy records , I obtained two albums by former Eagles members - & quot ; The Allnighter & quot ; by Glenn Frey , and this album by Don Henley . Interestingly enough , I had never really listened to the Eagles ( sure I 'd heard & quot ; Take It Easy & quot ; and & quot ; Hotel California & quot ; , but it was only on the radio when I was much younger and I did n't even know who had done them ... ) and did not know that both of these artists had been in what I would soon discover was an amazing band . Of the two albums I bought , this was by far the better one and it became a part of my regular listening rotation even into the 1990s.There are so many good songs on this album - they fit together to form a cohesive whole while at the same time each stands on its own individually . I do n't think there is one song on this album that I do n't really like except perhaps ( and maybe ironically ) , the title track . Standouts range from the beautiful , longing and urgent & quot ; Boys of Summer & quot ; , to the pretty & quot ; Not Enough Love In the World & quot ; and & quot ; Land Of The Living & quot ; , to the songs that rock out & quot ; All She Wants To Do Is Dance & quot ; ( complete with sarcastic , cynical political overtones ) and & quot ; Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed & quot ; . But to me , the highlight of the album are the two songs which segue into each other on what used to be side 2 of the album - these are & quot ; A Month Of Sundays & quot ; which is a heartfelt and heart-tugging glimpse at the struggles of farmers hit during the glut of farm foreclosures which were taking place in the mid-1980s . This beautiful , sad song relaxes into the cool , jazzy & quot ; Sunset Grill & quot ; , which for some reason evokes Los Angeles to my mind ... .At any rate , to sum up - this album brings out a wide range of emotions through really well played , well conceived songs . There are pretty songs and songs that rock on this album . An unusually solid blend of great lyrics and great music that plants images in your head and induces contemplation ... Just what music is supposed to do ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! !	1
Henley seems to take a lot of flack from people with similar musical tastes as my own , but I have always thought he was a great songwriter . Yes his music is fairly pedestrian , and he appears to be an average drummer , but I think his lyrics are often extremely clever and he has always been a great singer . Up until the early 80 's Henley was best known for being the drummer , singer , and songwriter for The Eagles . After The Eagles broke up in 1981 Henley went solo and had a very successful run of radio hits and platinum albums . `` Beast '' is his second solo record and although I think his next one was better this one was still solid . Several huge hits came from this album including `` Boys Of Summer '' , `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' two songs that though massively overplayed were pure pop gems . Other highlights include the country tinged `` You 're Not Drinking Enough '' . The title track `` Building The Perfect Beast '' is full of patented Henley social commentary . My favorite song on the album , `` A Month Of Sundays '' is a song about a farmer loosing his livelihood in the Regan era 80 's . This is the kind of track that Henley does best and it really works here . `` Sunset Grill '' is another great song and serves as a kind of sequel to `` The Sad Caf & eacute ; '' from The Eagles `` Long Run '' album . Henley gets plenty of help on this album from well known musicians including most of Tom Petty 's band , Lindsay Buckingham , Charlie Sexton and others . This is not Henley 's best album , but it has quite a few really good songs on it .	1
While his follow-up album , & quot ; The end of the innocence & quot ; was a mammoth success , selling 6 million copies , Arguably & quot ; Building the perfect beast & quot ; is the better album . Don Henley would soon delve into a more Adult Contemporary sound , This album captures him at his best , before that phase.Don Henley recruited an all-star cast of guests to play on & quot ; Building the perfect Beast & quot ; . Among them are from Tom Petty 's band : guitarist Mike Campbell , keyboardist Ben Tench , and drummer Stan Lynch . Fleetwood Mac 's Lindsey Buckingham plays guitar on a few tracks , and The Go-Go 's Belinda Carlisle does some back-up vocals . Don Henley was quite prolific at the time to pull in all these names [ either that or he had a deep Wallet ; ) ] A few fans have slagged the sound of this album , saying & quot ; it sounds so 80 's & quot ; . That was the decade I was born in ! I 'm personally a junkie for the 80 's , I love Synthesizers , go ahead , Chastise all you want ! But I digress.The big hits here were & quot ; Boys of Summer & quot ; , & quot ; All she wants to do is Dance & quot ; and & quot ; Sunset grill & quot ; . You 've probably heard them all once or twice , so I wo n't waste time commenting , to sum it up , those songs are amazing , but the lesser known tracks are equally strong.Opener & quot ; Boys of Summer & quot ; is forever etched in my head , growing up around that time I used to only recognize the chorus and thought the song was about Baseball-Bys of Summer , NOT the case , it 's actually much deeper , telling the story of an acquaintance Don lost touch with . The music is amazing , words ca n't describe . This is probably the best song of Don 's entire solo career . Co-writer Mike Campbell deserves credit where it 's dueNot to be outdone , the rest of the album is equally strong ( like I said before , sorry for the redundance . ) I 'll walk you through it , track-by-track. & quot ; You ca n't make love & quot ; boasts a pleasant guitar lick and catchy synth line.The song is basically about how someone can do all sorts of grand things , even get married , except what the title says. & quot ; Man with a mission & quot ; is a nice Rock-a-billy throwback . The lyrics are from some guy 's & quot ; Typical day in the life of & quot ; perspective , was it Don Henley ? Who knows ? Great song though regardless.Next up is the incredible ballad- & quot ; You 're not drinking enough & quot ; , which is on par with the Eagles best work . It 's about a guy who 's so tense , going through drama with his girlfriend and as a suggestion should take a lil ' dip in the sauce. & quot ; Not enough love in the world & quot ; kicks off with an almost soulful riff . Don plays the drums , returning to his day job . The lyrics are heartfelt and sincere.Next were on to the B-Side [ That 's old lingo for you kiddies keeping score , I 'll explain it some other time ; ) ] The underrated title track is all out fun . It has a bouncy rhythm , and engaging Synth line , and a superb chorus . Beneath the playfulness is Don 's genuine concern that through greed and for profit , beautiful land is destroyed , in the name of a parking lot.The undeniable feel good track is & quot ; All she wants to do is dance & quot ; , it contains another relevant theme even today . So much ill in the world and the girl 's desire is what the title suggests . Writing the song Don probably did n't have problems with the girl per se , but the problems out there ca n't be overlooked. & quot ; Sunset Grill & quot ; follows . A lengthy track clocking in at 6 minutes 22 seconds , there 's not one dull moment . I still ca n't decipher what it 's about . The guitar winds and there 's great use of keyboards , and the use of horns was creative. & quot ; Drivin with your eyes closed & quot ; is a personal favorite of mine . A terrific guitar hook hauls you in . The words describes a meeting with a French guy and how their cultures seem worlds apart , The Frenchman saying the U.S seems too materialistic , honestly that does seem the case sometimes.Closing off the album is the more mellow & quot ; Land of the living & quot ; . Well-Crafted , a shame it was n't released as a single.I was actually listening to the album while I wrote this review , and it brings back fine memories . In my humble opinion , & quot ; Building the perfect beast & quot ; is the crown jewel of one of music 's most notable careers and belongs in everyone 's collection .	1
Songwriting is no trifle matter to Don Henley . And although in the early 1970s the magic duo of Henley/Frey churned out hits with enough speed to allow for the production of four albums in four years , followed by an all-time best-selling Greatest Hits ( Vol . 1 ) album even before the release of the Eagles ' classic `` Hotel California , '' he started to take things considerably slower in his post-Eagles solo career . The two years he took to follow up 1982 's `` I Ca n't Stand Still '' with `` Building the Perfect Beast '' were actually the shortest time between any two of his solo albums ; in part due to the fact that , as Henley explained , his collaboration with Danny `` Kootch '' Kortchmar worked along lines different from those he had established with Glenn Frey in the Eagles . These were not two guys sitting down together in a room with a guitar and a drum kit any longer : For Don Henley 's second solo release , bowing to the musical developments of the 1980s , they relied heavily on synthesized sounds ( Henley 's tour promoting the album even featured an elaborate light show , something that would have been inconceivable for any of the Eagles ' tours ) . And while making most of the songs on the album easily `` listenable '' and producing several top-selling singles ( `` All She Wants to Do Is Dance , '' `` Sunset Grill , '' `` Boys of Summer '' and `` Not Enough Love in the World '' ) , that choice of instrumentation also seemed to render `` Building the Perfect Beast '' the most easily dateable of all of Henley 's solo releases.Lyrically , however , Henley had lost nothing of his bite ; the album 's very name is indicative of that fact . `` We 're the ones who can kill the things we do n't eat , '' he warned in the title track , musically the edgiest song on the album ( synthesizers or not ) - `` we have met the enemy , and he is us ... the secrets of eternity ; we 've found the lock and turned the key ... all the way to Malibu from the Land of the Talking Drum , just look how far we 've come . '' `` Sunset Grill '' and `` A Month of Sundays '' lament the death of small mom-and-pop farms and businesses and their takeover by large corporations ; a criticism of Reaganomics Henley would take up even more forcefully in 1989 's `` The End of the Innocence . '' ( Ironically , his beloved Sunset Grill in L.A. later went down that very same path , too - `` Do n't Go There , '' he therefore quipped during the closing appearance of his recent `` Inside Job '' tour , `` it ai n't there anymore . Even though it still has the same name . Even though the guy has my name on the menu . Do n't go there ! '' ) `` All She Wants to Do Is Dance '' has a similar theme , focusing on corporate and political greed in general . `` The Boys of Summer , '' musically based on a guitar riff supplied by Heartbreaker Mike Campbell , is a warning not to look back and romanticize the past but rather , to look toward the future - just keep your eyes open whatever you do , though , because if you 're Driving With Your Eyes Closed `` you 're gon na hit somethin ' ... but that 's the way it goes . `` As on all of his solo releases , Henley was able to secure the collaboration of a virtual all-star cast of musicians , from Fleetwood Mac 's Lindsey Buckingham and Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to Randy Newman , Patty Smyth , Belinda Carlisle , Richard and Waddy Wachtel , Toto 's Steve Porcaro and David Paich , `` inofficial Eagle '' J.D . Souther , and many , many more . And despite the seeming bow to the 1980s ' musical tastes in the instrumentation of many of the album 's tracks , their lasting quality becomes apparent like on no other occasion when Henley performs them live , as he did on his recently-concluded tour . Stripped of some of their fancy effects , they stand up even more visibly to the class of his other work , both with the Eagles and solo - and you just have to have heard that stunning , several minutes ' long drum/percussion intro ( not even performed by Henley himself ) to `` All She Wants to Do Is Dance , '' the closing song of the tour 's regular program . `` Building the Perfect Beast '' cemented Don Henley 's standing as a solo artist , and it paved the way for his biggest release to date , `` End of the Innocence . '' As he had done with his bandmates a decade earlier , Henley again proved that he was able to create something lasting , in whatever format he chose . Maturity added more focus to his work ( lyrically if nowhere else ) ; and vocally , many of the tracks on this album are among the most demanding he has ever written . Unlike the output of the era 's countless hair bands , disco kings and queens and punk bands , all of Don Henley 's first three solo releases still have a large enough audience to warrant their inclusion in the catalogue of every major record store - including the seemingly so 1980s-sounding `` Building the Perfect Beast . `` Also recommended : The End of the InnocenceDon Henley Live - Inside JobThe Eagles - Hell Freezes OverSelected Works : 1972-1999Hotel California	1
Anyone would want this album for & # 34 ; The Boys of Summer , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; All She Wants to Do Is Dance , & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Not Enough Love in the World , & # 34 ; but you should stay to listen to the title track , & # 34 ; Sunset Grill , & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Drivin ' with Your Eyes Closed. & # 34 ;	1
Siouxsie SIoux..We salute..I danced so hard.. '' Hong Kong Garden '' ..Early Siouxsie was this..Raw crunchy guitars that spoke with her idealistic lyrics..Disco in `` Israel '' ..Siouxsie was beautiful then and now..Artsy and new wave in `` Christine '' , and `` Arabian Nights '' the first of these songs being an artful part punk part new wave mish mash.. '' Tinderbox '' is the other album that shines..Be 17 again..Go buy `` Once Upon A Time '' and get the history and the attitude of youth that keep our world alive..Hey Rick and Colleen remember me ? Let 's start a punk band..	1
This is the first Banshees album I bought . Incredibly varied . From `` punk '' to `` pop '' and back again . Superb . Very highly recommended .	1
Firstly I would like to make a couple of point accross to other reviewers . 'Carnival ' from the album 'A Kiss In The Dreamhouse ' are not included in this album , but rather in the next singles installment . 'Israel ' is NOT from Juju but rather a standalone single . Sorry for being pedantic but the right information to potential buyers is important I think.Secondly to Sereneghost note how this is a SINGLES collection as opposed to your personal favorite collection . While I agree that these songs do n't always represent the heart of these albums , singles rarely do but rather represent the more assesible side of a band.Tracks 1-5 represent Siouxsie 's abrasive punks days , being rather more simplistic and straightforward than later efforts . That being said 'Hong Kong Garden ' is incredibly catchy ( although do n't the lyrics come accross as being blatantly racist ? ) while 'Mirage ' and 'Love In A Void ' are purely punky and abrasive . 'Staircase ' and 'Playground Twist ' express a minimalist gothic style and nightmarish in their mood and lyrical content.The remainder of the album see The Banshees evolve rapidly , displaying sharper songwriting , a more layered and complex sound , and introducing synthesizers . 'Happy House ' and 'Christine ' are not only infectious singles but display more subtle and mature lyrics . 'Spellbound ' and 'Arabian Knights ' are typical of Juju 's complex rhythms and psychadelic landscapes , the latter song has a breathtaking chorus that I ca n't get out of my head . 'Israel ' my favorite song from this album , has an evocative majesty of its own that shows how far the band had evolved into a complex unit from their punk days.A good introduction into Siouxsie and The Banshee 's early days and an interesting documentation of their quick evolvement . Twice Upon A Time is even better .	1
Essential for any and all Siouxsie & The Banshees fans . Sure , it 's an early compilation , with material from 1978-81 . Every one of the CD 's ten cuts are a winner , like `` The Staircase Mystery '' , `` Love In A Void '' , the insanely written `` Happy House '' , `` Christine '' , `` Israel '' , `` Spellbound '' ( one of my all time favorites ) and `` Arabian Knights '' . Top rate goth alternative . It 's nearly impossible not to like at least a couple of these tunes . Sounds just SO good , that it almost hurts . Voodoo enthusiasts , fortune tellers and goth queens , rejoice ! Highly recommended .	1
This album is a good showcase of early Banshees only but of course not representative of their full career which started moving in different directions after the release of this compilation . Hong Kong Garden which burst onto the UK charts in 1978 still sounds unique and special after all these years while the other early hits have lost none of their icy appeal . I would have included some additional songs for a Best Of covering their early days , like & quot ; Mother/Oh Mein Papa ' from Join Hands and perhaps & quot ; Jigsaw Feeling ' from The Scream . In conclusion , Once Upon A Time is a window on the more & quot ; elegant & quot ; and certainly more intelligent side of UK punk rock .	1
Jon Sykes , Jon Sykes , Jon 'Effin ' Sykes ! ! ! His guitar work on this CD is absolute ball buster ! If I only liked the track Still of The Night this disc would still be worth it but Sykes slashes and burns throughout the disc . And his guitar tone is monster ! And I say this as a drummer , not a guitar player , that 's how impressive Sykes is . You wan na hear some fierce guitar work then this CD is the real deal . Air guitar alert ! ! [ ... ]	1
David Coverdale said once that'John ( Sykes ) and I sat down and rewrote rock history in 15 minutes'.Far from being a bombastic statement this summarizes a rock album now legendary-those who called Whitesnake a Zep clone are oblivious to the fact that Coverdale comes from the same blues tradition -while those who want to see how it 's done , they 'd better listen to this !	1
This album was among & quot ; the best of the best & quot ; of all the great hard rock albums that came out in 1987 . The combination of classic and melodic hard rock make this an all time mainstream rock masterpiece. & quot ; Still Of The Night & quot ; is , beyond a doubt , one of the best hard rocking tracks of all time . Clocking in at just over 6:30 , this song just does n't let up ! Begins and ends heavy with a slight slowdown in the middle for dramatic effect . Obviously the two huge radio hits & quot ; Here I Go Again & quot ; and & quot ; Is This Love & quot ; are fantastic -- the epitome of a time when pop radio was listenable . & quot ; Give Me All Your Love & quot ; is an underrated track -- I particularly love the exploding drums at the end of the track . & quot ; Cryin ' In The Rain & quot ; and & quot ; Children Of The Night & quot ; both are great heavy rockers , and & quot ; Do n't Turn Away & quot ; is an excellent anthem to end the album.Quite simply , there is not a bad track here . Nearly 15 years after its release , this album is just as rocking and enjoyable to me today as it was when it came out . Absolutely an essential purchase for fans of '80s melodic hard rock .	1
It 's 1987 and Whitesnake throws in guitarist John Sykes . He was from the band Thin Lizzy . `` The Boys Are Back In Town '' was one of Thin Lizzy 's biggest hits . If you noticed , Thin Lizzy did n't have alot of huge guitar solos with John Sykes . So , how will he fit into Whitesnake then ? In the song `` Straight To The Heart '' a very fast guitar solo is present , and it shocked me . This song mos def rubbed off me alot , because of the guitar solo . It 's so incredibly fast . I 'm sure this also shocked Whitesnake lovers . Also , a new version of `` Here I Go Again '' came out . It was n't so `` churchy '' as some of my friends say . This album has everything , and after this album was thrown out there , John Sykes left the band.So , 1989 comes around , just about to crack into 1990 . Whitesnake has a crazy guitarist named Steve Vai . He was in David Lee Roth 's band , and was taught guitar by Joe Satriani who are 4 years apart . Steve Vai mos def does a great job.Basically , Whitesnake 's self-titled debut was a huge hit , just like Boston 's self-titled debut . But , it was n't a debut . So , you need to go out and get it if you love classic rock/hair metal . What a surprise John Sykes was .	1
This is in-your-face metal that do n't let up - Zeppelin reincarnated for the 80 's . David Coverdale is a modern day Robert Plant , I just wish he was still around these days . Whatever happened to him , anyway ? Whitesnake jammed cuz they created good love ballads AND they made throbbing , groove-heavy metal hits , like the awesome & quot ; Still of da Night & quot ; . Trust me , metal fans , you 'll love each of these 9 songs . If you get the chance , be sure to see an 80 's Whitesnake video . It 's like Led Zeppelin re-formed and came back to do some heavy entertaining - with a great lookin ' chick ! ! CHECK 'EM OUT ! !	1
This is one of the best heavy metal albums to come out of the 80 's and it made Whitesnake international superstars.The video 's with the vixen of Tawny Kitaen and the hunter of David Coverdale will forever be a part of our memories as the the captivating sensual imagery just sinked its teeth into our limbs and souls.The music of course is what matters here and it sizzles from start to finish.Songs such as `` Still of the night '' though derivitive hit hard due to the passion and conviction put forth into every note.It is a bonafide heavy metal classic filled with pounding drums and machine gun guitar solo 's courtesy of former Thin Lizzy axeman John Sykes.John Sykes was obviously a crucial factor in the success of this album as he helped to write a big chunk of it.Just listen to the sexy prowling groove that carries the classic `` Is this love '' complemented by the romantic intense lyrics sung with such eloquence by David Coverdale.This is a timeless classic rock ballad that still tugs at your heartstrings no matter if you hate metal or not ... it speaks to everyone.There is also a heavy blues influence as witnessed in the swaggering `` Give me all your love '' and the thundering rage of `` Crying in the rain '' which contains a blazing blistering guitar solo and some hair raising vocal acrobatics from Mr. Coverdale.Of course we can not forget the anthemic `` Here i go again '' with its catchy chorus and the unforgettable images of Tawny doing the spread eagle on that oldsmobile.The whole album is just a big plate of sophisticated polished metal that is irresistable and just too darn tasty to resist.Whitesnake sinks its fangs in deep and does'nt let go.Do n't forget to catch Whitesnake live this summer ! ! ! ! The new lineup David Coverdale has put together is a monster of a band and they will smoke everyone in their path.o.f .	1
If you 're looking for an album , from the 80 's , that drives full throttle on all cylinders and in your face , look no further ... .you 've found that album here ... .Whitesnake 's self titled album ! It opens with Crying In The Rain ... .a guitar blazing rocker which became a modest hit for Whitesnake .

They are all unique in their own way ... .Children Of The Night would definitely have to be their most hardest rock song ... .crank up your stereo for this one ! ! ! ! Most remembered about Whitesnake 's videos , from this album , is the heavenly body of Tawny Kitaen shown doing a summersault over Coverdale 's car in a very thin , white silk dress ( in Here I Go Again ) ... .yeah baby ! ! ! ! Do yourself a favor by breaking out the plastic and ordering this CD , today ! You 'll thank yourself , soon after !	1

How do you know when you are listening to commerock ? When a self-proclaimed hard rock/heavy metal band suddenly releases an album that your wife or girlfriend likes better then you do . I guess even `` hard rock '' bands have to make a living too.As far as commerock goes though this is a pretty good representative of the genre ; I liked the unabashedly commercial tracks i.e . `` Here I Go Again '' and `` Is This Love '' but I found that I liked the other tracks even better ! `` Still of the Night '' is my favourite and you have to give guitarist , John Sykes , a lot of credit as he plays some fantastic guitar on this album which makes me wonder why he was replaced soon after . Have to admit though that many of the riffs he uses he `` borrowed '' from Jimmy Page 's Led Zeppelin days ( in fact , `` Stil ... Night '' is a prime example of this ) but still he pulls the guitar parts off very well.I hope they do remaster this album and even release it in a mini-lp package format as that should make the whole thing sound and even look a lot better . Even in this unremastered version , I thought the sound was pretty decent enough so overall if you are into commerock , this is a good disc to get although you may want to imitate me and wait for the remastered version that hopefully will come out someday soon .	1
One thing I can say about Dave Coverdale , he sure attracts some great backing musicians . If you start with his first album , you will find his career punctuated with a who 's who roster of rock elite . This shows in the music . It is well done , very slick , and totally catchy.I saw him in Spain in the 80 's and he had Steve Vai and Adrian Vandenberg with him . They put on a great show despite Vandenberg flubbing a keyboard line on one of the songs . At least that flub gave them a human touch that is a bit missing on some of this album . It is good , in fact , great in a lot of ways , but I just wish it was n't so slick.One thing I noticed is that there are two versions of Here I Go Again . The one on this vinyl album is a bit heavier and simpler than the more orchestrated version usually heard on the radio . I 'm not sure why they tampered with it , but probably to make it an even bigger hit would be my guess.This is heavy pop/hair metal . That standard hair metal snare drum sound is prominent , as well as their hair styles ( though there is no photo of the band on my vinyl copy ) . This album in particular is a hit factory and you can hear many of the cuts on classic rock radio . This is another band I can tolerate over and over again , though it does get a little old , but not enough that I slam the off button on the radio.One thing I ca n't resist mentioning , is that they were pretty big in Spain in the 80 's . There was this old man at a bar near our house and when he saw my daughter with a Whitesnake T-shirt on , he said , `` Veetuh-snawkuh . '' To this day , I call them veetuh- snawkuh.A couple of years ago , I saw Whitesnake here in Las Vegas at Mandalay bay . Of course , Coverdale was the only original member , but his band of hired hands , as usual , rocked . He still has it.I would 've liked to see him get a little more down and dirty with the sound on Whitesnake , but still , this album rocks . Recommended .	1
By the time the 80 's had rolled around Whitesnake had been making albums for about decade , so they had time to perfect their craft.1987 was finally their year , 1984 's Slide it In had became a minor hit , which helped pave the way for the 1987 to become a smash hit . The opener of the album is Crying in the Rain , which had originally appeared on their 1982 album Saints and Sinners , Here I go Again was also a rerecording of a song that appeared on Saints and Sinners . Besides Crying in the Rain , and Here I go Again , other highlights include The Still of the Night , Give me all your love , and the rest of the songs are awesome too ! Whitesnake is the essential 1980 's album , buy it today !	1
This may not be their best album , but it 's easily their most popular . The casual fan will find their biggest hits on here . This was released in 1987 , and includes & quot ; Still Of The Night & quot ; , & quot ; Is This Love & quot ; , and the huge hit & quot ; Here I Go Again & quot ; . However most of the other tracks are nearly as good . & quot ; Crying In The Rain & quot ; and & quot ; Children Of The Night & quot ; are two other favorites . Overall they were one of the better hard rock/metal bands of the era , and had great taste in hood-ornaments too . Also better than & quot ; Great White & quot ; , and & quot ; White Lion & quot ; .	1
Wow . This album has more than twenty years . I have listened to this album for more than twenty years and it still sounds fresh to me and still moves me . Few bands did so much with a single album for an entire movement or musical genre in my opinion . It is a perfect , perfect album . Every song is a single with incredible melodic hooks , killer guitar solos and parts , a fantastic guitar player ( John Sykes at the top of his game ) and an incredible singer ( Coverdale ) who managed to sound perfectly in charge with this music . I do n't know if they were aware of the fact that they were making history with this one . I ca n't say much more than this . 1987 would be one of my 10 desert island discs for sure . No doubt about this . One of the three or four rock ones . For me it 's absolutly a MUST HAVE . Talking about this edition it is a splendid remastered cd . They did it big . The sound is very full , the guitar parts sound incredible and the overall mix is very good . The booklet and everything else is `` special edition '' and deserve the high price . All in all something you ca n't miss , if you like me , are in love with this album since we were kids . I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS ONE ! ! ! ! !	1
Whitesnake 's self-titled album was one of the better ones of the hair metal era and it 's easy to see why . Most of the songs have something positive to offer as lead singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes molded Whitesnake from a classic rock band with a bluesy edge to a hard rock band which balanced songs based on memorable riffs with heartfelt power ballads with equal aplomb . And this album , while very good , is one of its era : very slick and tailor made for radio . Having said that , I do favor this album 's versions of `` Here I Go Again '' and `` Crying in the Rain '' as they have a passion and energy that was lacking on the originals that were on the Saints & Sinners album . The aforementioned `` Here I Go Again '' and the ballad `` Is This Love ? '' would became huge hit singles and deservedly so . `` Still of the Night '' , while representative of Led Zeppelin , was a killer and songs like the riff heavy track `` Bad Boys '' and `` Give Me All Your Love '' were nearly as good . The closing ballad `` Do n't Turn Away '' is another strong power ballad that was better than `` Is This Love ? '' and would have been another hit single if released . The remaining tracks , `` Children of the Night '' and `` Straight from the Heart '' , were okay but suffered from clich & eacute ; d lyrics . All told , Whitesnake is a strong album that brings back a lot of memories and has a lot of great songs . Newcomers who want to hear them at their best might want to pick up Slide It In , an album with better songs overall and a sound that has aged more gracefully .	1
In 1987 , after a couple of years layoff , Whitesnake slammed back into the rock scene with their self-titled record . Quite a few people list this as Whitesnake 's sellout album , but give this monster a couple listens , and i 'm sure you 'll agree this is one of the decades best.The only downside to this album is that , it only has nine tracks on it . However , do n't let that deter you from giving it a try . This album is a little different than previous Whitesnake offerings in that it mixes a more pop-metal feel to it , all the while keeping with Coverdale 's love of the blues . The obvious draw to this album is the anthemic rocker `` Here I Go Again , '' but the rest of the record is equally as good . Songs like `` Still Of The Night , '' `` Give Me All Your Love Tonight , '' `` Bad Boys '' and `` Is This Love '' make this an absolute must for any fan of the genre.I ca n't brag about being a monster Whitesnake fan , I ca n't even say their one of my favorite from the 80 's , but with their self-titled album they definitely grabbed my attention . This is easily one of the decades best .	1
I am so sick of people saying that Whitesnake sold out in the 80 's ! How can anyone NOT love the greatest anthem , Here I Go Again ? This is REAL rock ! You have awesome rock songs like Here I Go Again , Bad Boys , Still Of The Night , Crying In The Rain and one of the most awesome rock ballads , Is This Love that not only made number 1 and has one of the most dramatic and awesome guitar solos but is a REAL rock song ! Still Of The Night has not only one guitar solo , but TWO guitar solos and it 's over 6 minutes , very epic ! Very Whitesnake ! Any Whitesnake fan or hard rock fan for that matter would be crazy not to love this song ! I just totally love Bad Boys and Crying In The Rain for the guitar solos and melody ! I mean , you listen to these songs and you hear ROCK ! ! You hear flawless musicianship , they 're definitely some of Whitesnake 's greatest accomplishments ! This is just amazing ! The entire album just screams METAL/ROCK like every other Whitesnake album ever made ! You need this CD if you are a ROCK and/or WHITESNAKE fan ! I just ca n't understand how people do n't like this . It 's NOT bad just because it 's not like their earlier stuff ! I love their earlier albums , the blues sounding albums but one thing to remember : EVERY SINGLE WHITESNAKE ALBUM IS REAL ROCK ! ! ! Please stop saying it 's POP rock ! ! Yes , it 's considered Hair Metal but guess what ? Hair Metal ROCKS ! ! Hair Metal has awesome ROCK sound , awesome ROCK guitar solos , awesome lyrics , awesome vocals , awesome melody , and awesome ROCK drumming ! All of Whitesnake 's albums are REAL rock ! ! Whether it 's Hard Rock , Hair Metal , Blues Rock , IT 'S ALL ROCK ! ! ! I just hate how people have this perception that if it 's Hair Metal , it 's not Rock and that can not be further from the truth ! I love almost every kind of Rock ever and you know what they all have in common ? ROCK ! ! It all ROCKS ! So please , stop dissing this amazingly talented band and get ALL their albums because I own everything from the beginning up to now ! Please , do n't be closed minded or think Pop Metal or Hair Metal is n't REAL rock because it is ! Just like Poison , Warrant , Ratt , Scorpions , Def Leppard , Dokken , Winger , Europe , Cinderella , and Bon Jovi : IT 'S ALL REAL ROCK ! !	1
One of the best metal bands ever ! `` Is This Love '' is one of the best metal love songs ever made and is included on this album . `` Still of the Night '' , `` Here I Go Again , '' , and many more are included as well . A must have for 80 's metal fans !	1
First there was Deep Purple 's `` The House of Blue Light '' from January 1987 , and then , `` Whitesnake '' [ the album ] from March 1987 . Whitesnake 's turned out to be the more popular album , maybe the most popular album of the year because of it 's commercial appeal , and the music videos that helped to sell it , but make no mistake it 's a really good album . But Deep Purple 's was even better in my opinion , a far less commercial rock album who 's videos were unfortunately banned by MTV , which helped keep it out of the Billboard top 20.Finally , I 'm so tired of reading about the Whitesnake songs from this album being Led Zeppelin rip offs . Coverdale has already confirmed that a lot of the riffs come from Deep Purple rehearsal tapes back in the mid seventies when Coverdale was their lead singer . These riffs are `` borrowed '' from Ritchie Blackmore , not Jimmy Page . Case closed ! I advise getting both of these great rock albums of 1987 : *Whitesnake - Whitesnake*Deep Purple - The House of Blue Light	1
You must hear this record . John Sykes is one of the greatest guitarists of all time - I am not joking . He writes killer songs and the solos are outstanding . He has created a musical masterpiece with this release . His songwriting skills shine and in particular his arrangements of the songs are brilliant . These songs are destined to be played forever . You will not be musically complete until you hear this stuff .	1
After casting about early after leaving Purple in a fairly non spectacular effort with Northwinds Coverdale begat Whitesnake . Which put forth a number of very British blues based hard rock style albums . They sold out tours in the UK and Europe and still lost money . So like they say - go west young man ! This album is the fruits of a concerted effort to break the US market . It might be sneered at for thos reasons and often is by a still at times bitter UK press . But let 's face it - the recording is power drenched , the band and production sound light years ahead of most other releases of the time and this album is noteworthy not only for the blistering feel of the tracks but also for the blend of ballads and rockers . With his wonderful set of pipes and great backing band Coverdale can attack stuff like Here I Go Again and Is This Love yet still happily turn around and crank serious wattage with the likes of Children of the Night , Bad Boys and the plaintive Crying in the Rain - a power ballad with the emphasis on the power and a tune above the norm for this style of song.And that 's without mentioning Still of the Night . Seriously , a strong so strong that it blitzed just about every other hard rock track doing the rounds from other contemporary bands . A flagship tune and there ai n't no doubt - a track any band would be proud to have in it 's armoury with which to lay waste to their audience with.The downsides here are a ) a slight reservation about the deliverate commercialism of the project b ) perhaps a few too many ballads - sometimes affected by what territory your in as the tracklisting was not always fixed in concrete with this album and c ) there is n't really a part c gripe ! Overall this is a great hard rock album that crossed over to massive mainstream success . The riffs are pounding and insistent as are the drums and Coverdale is in fine voice throughout and the entire package reeks of professionalism . Even if the actual players on the album did n't get to fully enjoy the success of the album due to Coverdales revolving door policy regarding bandmates	1
I did n't get to hear the whole album until 1989 , but I recall Whitesnake 's impact in 1987 and 1988 with the mileage they had with it ! Dynamic rock songs here , especially Still Of The Night and Here I Go Again . Bad Boys I also like with its attitude and fast pace ! As I 'm writing this , the song Is This Love might be playing on some stations . Adult contemporary pop stations still love this record a good 17 years later ! It is a well crafted song with its reflective breaks that match with the song 's lyrics and David Coverdale 's longing for that woman . I like the guitar solo , of which they play it a lot more versus the single version . The other members such as John Sykes , Vivian Campbell and Adrian Vandenburg played an important part in this album ! I still like Still of The Night , and its rocking sections and reflective section in the middle before rocking once again . It 's kind of something Led Zeppelin would do if they had continued . This is a phenomenally done effort , one of the '80s best albums in terms of the big production and bombast ! Coverdale matched romanticism and emotional sides with aggressive rock all in one album with his band !	1
This cd needs to be in your collection if you 're any kind of fan of 80 's pop metal . Yes , there are sappy power ballads and sappy rocking songs and sappy everything . This cd is so sappy you 're liable to get your hands sticky just handling it . This sappiness makes for one great trip down memory lane . It also holds up very well after all these years .	1
Whitesnake 's self-titled album , was great when it came out in 1987 , but it has sled a little since . The bluesy Whitesnake had become part of the hair rock scene in 1987 . David Coverdale , Aynsley Dunbar , John Sykes , Neil Murray and Adrian Vandenberg ( who had a hit in '82 `` Burnin ' Heart '' ) . Their 9th studio release broke this band like wildfire . This album gave us , the rockers `` Children Of The Night '' , `` Crying In The Rain '' , tremendous track , the Zeppelin clone song `` Still Of The Night '' , # 79 , still one of my favorites from these guys . The melodic rockers in , `` Give Me All Your Love '' , # 48 , and the ballads that got played to death `` Is This Love '' , # 1 , and `` Here I Go Again '' , # 2 . They would release `` Slip Of The Tongue '' , in 1989 .	1
Whitesnake 's self-titled release is one of the best Rock albums of 80 's and with his huge history is one of the best Rock albums ever.Who can forget , `` Here I go again '' , or `` Is this love '' or even `` Still of the night '' , one of the biggest anthems of rock history.Who can forget an album that was on the Top 5 positions of United States for 6 months . Selling worldwide over 13 million copies ( 8 million in US ) , also `` Whitesnake '' was the album of the year 1988.I tried to rate all the songs of this historic LP1 . Crying in the rain 10/102 . Bad boys 9/103 . Still of the night 10/104 . Here I go again 10/105 . Give me all your love 9,5/106 . Is this love 10/107 . Children of the night 9,5/108 . Straight for the heart 9/109 . Dont turn away 9,5/10	1
Most fans of Whitesnake consider this to be the band 's best album . It was certainly their commercial peak and many of the songs are staples of classic rock radio to this day . I remember when this came out in the late 80 's it seemed to be to be a good old fashioned hard rock shot in the arm compared to much of the music that was on the radio at the time . Since it 's formation , other than David Coverdale , the Whitesnake lineup has always been in flux , but this album featured one of the better versions of the band with John Sykes ( Thin Lizzy , Blue Murder ) on guitar , Neil Murray ( Black Sabbath , Coliseum II , National Health ) on bass , and Aynsley Dunbar ( Frank Zappa , Journey , Jefferson Starship ) on drums . Instrumentally this band was a force to be reckoned with as all of the member turn in outstanding performances . Coverdale 's voice was never in better shape and soars over the roaring music of his bandmates . The songwriting is decent enough , pretty much typical late 80 's hair metal subject matter , but for the most part it all works . For me `` Still Of The Night '' remains one of the great songs of this era and is the centerpiece of this album . This line up of Whitesnake would disintegrate shortly after this album was released , which is too bad as it would have been interesting to see where the Sykes / Coverdale partnership could have led them .	1
This album stays one of my all time top 10 . Excitement is understatement to describe this album . If you like Whitesnake 's Greatest Hits , maybe this is your second pick for exploring great rock kingdom created by David Coverdale and John Sykes.Crying In The Rain is good opening track sure to blow you away . Still Of The Night is one of my # 1 favorite rock tracks of Whitesnake . You know Is This Love or Here I Go Again because it became huge hit worldwide . Straight From Your Heart and Do n't Turn Away are excellent tracks and my favorites.If you are classic rock fans , it is the album you should never miss .	1
This is Whitesnake 's great work of art . Every song makes you sing along and play air guitar . Even people who do n't care for heavy metal liked this when I played it . Whitesnake was the best of the bands to pop up from Deep Purple alumni . This record gives Led Zeppelin a run for their money . It is even better then Van Halen 's debut . John Sykes is one heck of an axe player . Neil Murrey had been im Whitesnake for it 's entire career since it formed in '78 . Dunbar is a decent metal drummer . Adrian Vandenburg did some guitar work on this album , and he also contributed the nicely done keyboards . A huge album , it was overshadowed by Guns N ' Roses debut the same year . This is one of the best classic heavy albums of the 80 's and all time .	1
1987 ... a year when Bon Jovi was still living large off of their breakout & quot ; Slippery When Wet & quot ; album . Van Halen was a year into a very successful start with a new lead singer named Sammy Hagar . Bands named Whitesnake , Def Leppard , and Great White would all release masterful hard rock albums . But standing right at the top of this list was this debut from Tesla . While it may not have garnered the pop chart success most of the aformentioned albums did , it was truly in a class of its own . All this band cared about was THE MUSIC . No & quot ; glam & quot ; gimmicks -- just some of the most amazing hard rock you could ever hope to hear . Nearly every track is a standout . Besides the great radio tracks -- including the rocking first release & quot ; Modern Day Cowboy & quot ; , the near-top 40 catchy diddy & quot ; Little Suzi & quot ; , and the sweetly reminiscing anthem & quot ; Changes & quot ; -- such rockers as & quot ; Comin ' Attcha Live & quot ; and & quot ; 2 Late 4 Love & quot ; and slower tracks like & quot ; We 're No Good Together & quot ; and the anthemic & quot ; Love Me & quot ; are favorites . I could rave about each and every track on this album ; that 's how good it is . One of the best bands from my favorite era of rock music .	1
I 'm so excited in writing this review , more than twenty years after I did buy this album . I 'm excited in writing the review for Mechanical Resonance , MECHANICAL RESONANCE , which to me is like a picture from my youth , a smell from my youth , ... it is like having again the taste of the first kiss I had in my life . MECHANICAL RESONANCE GUYS ! ! ! ! ! I remember quite clearly those days , when this album came out . Instead I ca n't remember how many times I have listened to this one . A billion maybe ! It is the soundtrack of my teen age years ! This album is just one of those albums that sign a time . It is simply perfect , one note after the other , one riff after the other , one song after the other , nothing is out of place here . This album is perfection in this style . Few albums in this style we love , rock , hard rock , metal , hair metal whatever you may call this , can match this perfection . But Mechanical Resonance is up there with the best of them in the very first positions . It was a shot in the dark to me ! I will never forget the first listenings ! I remember quite well I immediatly thought ... Wow this is unbelievable ! Mechanical Resonance , yes , is perfect . It is the `` Kind of blue '' of rock 'n ' roll , modern hard rock I might call this . Rock with chops , more chops than the Zep or Aerosmith . It was rock 'n ' roll in the era of guitar heroes when the competition in guitar was very high . The guys from Tesla won that contest through a kind of Van Halen guitar style taking back to the simple and no frills rock'n ' roll . This is the album to have from those years . From any era if you want a rock album that will shake your walls and delight your ears . It will never sound dated because it is simple and sophisticated , hard and tender , anthemic and brilliant . It has that special quality of the things that you know from the very first time you listen to them , that will last . It is a perfect example of what rock should be about . No frills , great chops , great energy , simple but catchy songwriting , extremely clever arrangements , and that special sense of modernity that will never fade away in a thousand years from now . There are wonderful ballads like We 're no good together , phenomenal country rock songs like Little Suzi , incredible rock anthems like Ez come Ez go , or Comin atcha live , Cover Queen . I mean . It is perfect . It is FOR SURE one of the albums I love the most FROM ANY ERA . Neither Tesla ever reached this level . Some people say The great radio controversy is better . I do n't agree . `` Radio '' is a good album , but Mechanical Resonance is PERFECTION . Everything is perfect in this album , even the cover which exactly speaks for the music . A shot of fire , the warmth of the tubes , an electric meltdown that was going to shake the world . And it did ! ! ! ! ! Lights and thunder guys , close your eyes and listen here it is one the best rock albums ever made , MECHANICAL RESONANCE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I was about 17 when this first came out and I can still remember how dynamic I thought it sounded at the time . The thing is , it still sounds that way to me . The worst thing to do would be to mistake this album with other superficial hair bands that were churning out hackneyed material in the late 80 's and early 90 's ( i.e . Warrant , Winger , Skid Row , Poison , Cinderella , etc ) . Having said that , overly deep , thoughtful lyrics are not in abundance here ( `` Modern Day Cowboy '' is an exception ) . By the same token , stupid lyrics are absent as well . What we 're left with is good rock and roll and a great album to crank at parties ( I know I did ) . `` EZ Come EZ Go '' is a terrific song to begin the album and is followed by the smokin ' `` Cumin Atcha Live '' . Overall , it 's one great tune after another including `` Gettin ' Better '' , `` 2 Late 4 Love '' and `` Rock Me to the Top '' . Side two ( imagine for a moment that it 's an old cassette ) has three of the strongest tracks on the album in `` Modern Day Cowboy '' , `` Changes '' and `` Little Suzi '' . CRANK IT ! `` We 're No Good Together '' and `` Before My Eyes '' may be two of the weaker songs here , but even they are n't bad.Nothing that Tesla ever did after this one really did anything for me with the exception of a handful of songs on their second album , The Great Radio Controversy . Other than that it was all down hill as far as I 'm concerned . I mean , do we really need a song attacking Thomas Edison ? By the time `` Edison 's Medicine '' was hitting the airwaves they were a mere shadow of their former selves . This is their first and best album . Ignore the others and turn this one up until the knob breaks off .	1
From a guitar player and audio engineer point of view ... awesome and jaw dropping ! My first listen to this CD affected me like the first listen to the Montrose album , times 10 ! BUY this CD is my best advice . Learn every note , store it in your head , listen on the way to work , sitting at home alone ... .just do it.THEN , go get Tesla 's second release , The Great Radio Controversory , and do it all over again !	1
Scorching hot album right out of the 80 's . I was raised in the central valley of California and these guys where the best of the best to come out of Sacramento . For some unknown reason my daughter has taken a shine to 80 's metal and this CD was high on my list of suggestions - she loved them as much as I did .	1
If I could only keep 10 albums and I had to sell all of the others , this one would be on my 10 keepers . This debut album from Tesla is dynamite ! While Modern Day Cowboy , Gettin ' Better and Little Suzi got the most airplay in the late 80 's , the rockers EZ Come EZ Go , Cumin ' Atcha Live , 2 Late 4 Love and Rock Me to the Top can melt your eardrums and your speakers . The two lighter but very good tunes are Changes and Love Me . The other songs on the album are also respectable.Jeff Keith has a good , raspy vocal delivery that he practiced while driving cement mixers . It 's easy to identify Tesla 's work by his singing . Great guitar work by Frank Hannon is another of Tesla 's signature trademarks . While the Great Radio Controversy and The Best of Tesla are both albums worth acquiring , this is by far their best effort .	1
I simply do not know where to begin with this record . Many of the previous reviews echo my sentiments about this album exactly . `` Mechanical Resonance '' is simply a must-have Hard Rock CD . This is straight-up , a**-kickin ' , no frills Rock And Roll . There is a lot musically for a true Rock And Roll fan to sink their teeth into . Across the board , this album has it all : riff-intensive songs , awesome solos , acoustic interludes , and a good dose of blues and melody . There are plenty of both short , to-the-point , rockers : `` Ez Come Ez Go '' , `` 2 late 4 Love '' , `` Love Me '' and long kickin ' jams : `` Cumin ' Atcha Live '' , `` Cover Queen '' and the album 's tour-de-force `` Modern Day Cowboy '' , which is their best song of all time . Not to mention that `` Mechanical Resonance '' is the band 's best and strongest album . I love the rest of their output , but nothing touches this one . Same goes for any of the other hard rock bands of the time.Tesla was not a hair band , they were a Rock And Roll band . They did not worry about their hair or sported spandex , they put the music first and it shows on this album . I usually list other standout tracks of any album I review . But I ca n't do it for this album , because from beginning to end , this album is a true classic !	1
Without exception , this is as good as anything ever released by anyone . I 'd rank this one with Who 's Next , Aerosmith 's Toys , and Floyd 's Dark Side . It 's that good .	1
while everyone else was puting out speed metal and glam rock in the 80 's ( which i like both ) , tesla chose to put out straight old rock.telsa never went for fads , just bread and butter rock and roll . they do such a wonderful job of it . i guarantee if you listen to this , you 'll want more tesla	1

Back in 1986 , this album was a big deal . In a sea of poofy-hair heavy metal bands ( and bands pretending to worship the devil ) , Tesla came out of nowhere with a debut album of straightforward hard rock songs . Sounding like a Midwestern Def Leppard , they had a couple ballads , three or four songs about rocking all night , and even a political song.Listening to it now , it 's a little cheesy but too sincere to dislike . They know how to write a song and they can play , but they did n't have a gimmick that would embarass them later . The only real drawback to the album is the song `` Little Suzi . '' It 's so good , you ca n't avoid noticing how mediocre the rest of the album is .	1
Robbie Robertson 's solo debut is a radical departure from his former work with The Band . The sparse feel-good country rock compositions are gone . This release could very well be titled ` Peter Gabriel Meets U2 ' if is was not for the fact that Robertson is clearly in command . Gabriel 's African rhythms dominate ` Fallen Angel ' and ` Broken Arrow . ' Bono and The Edge lend a hand on ` Sweet Fire Of Love ' and ` Testimony . ' Bono 's passionate pleading vocals are contrasted by Robertson 's gravely speak-sing delivery.The music has an overall feel of danger : it is rich , powerful and pounding . The bass guitar notes crack like thunder . ` American Roulette ' is the perfect driving song . Speeding along a deserted Nevada straight away at 120 miles per hour is living on the edge of fear.The disc begins with ` Fallen Angel , ' a slow tempo loving tribute to a departed friend . It is filled with loss and longing . The fear and anticipation of Judgment Day ( Showdown At Big Sky ) will knock you out of your seat . Peaceful and melodic , ` Broken Arrow ' ( with its references to the Prince of Peace ) is a brief relief from ` Showdown . ' Love and redemption set ` Sweet Fire Of Love ' ablaze . ` American Roulette ' is a dangerous game played by superstars - and it sounds hazardous too . That dark mysterious place on the wrong side of town is ` Somewhere Down The Crazy River . ' Again , menace and horror are the center of ` Hell 's Half Acre ' : it may very well be a scene of carnage from any war . The outlaw is filled with shock and regret when `` Sonny Got Caught In The Moonlight . ' The album closes with a funky 'Testimony . 'Robertson 's most captivating lyrics are lines from the Bible : five of the nine compositions include multiple Biblical quotations . The Good Book is a deserving choice as a reference on the subjects of love , fear , danger , despair , peace , comfort and redemption .	1

A truly & quot ; American & quot ; album , very spiritual , ethereal , sort of like a thunder storm . & quot ; Fallen Angel & quot ; has the dignity , insistence , and defiance of an unbroken man , & quot ; Big Sky & quot ; is one of the most dramatic songs I have ever heard ; I have seen two hour movies with less emotion , drama , conviction , action , and passion than this song.Robertson 's voice is a unique instrument . I kind of like it , not only because it sounds unique , but because Robbie forces you to understand what he tells you , almost like a griot.Clearly one of the best debuts of the 1980 's , and undeniable confirmation of Robbie Robertson 's stature in music history .	1
This record holds up . I am happy to have added to my collection once again . Generally , and in this case , a Daniel Lanois production nearly guarantees a worthwhile listen .	1
Robbie Robertson gives you what i will called `` naturs own '' experience when it comes to music . When you try to listen to it , with open mind , it will lift you up as a human beeing . Certainly Track 6 : Somewhere down the crazy River is in that category . That song has a certain touch of magic . It ` s the space inbetween the different instruments , and the voice of Robbie Robertson , which will spin your soul into the direction of happines.But how can you go wrong when you get help from Peter Gabriel and U2 . When listen trough this CD , it have many highpoints , but there are some minor problems wich don ` tgive it a 5 star , probably because sometimes the U 2 soundpicture make Robertson a `` copycat '' of U2 . But when you listen once again at Somewhere Down the Crazy river , you are back on the track again . Listen to the wind , listen to the sea , listen to the nature . The voice of Robbie Robertson fits in there , ... .somewhere probably over the rainbow , when the words stops , and the music take over .	1
i really like rod stewart 's cover of broken arrow but i much prefer robertson 's version and it means even more when you know he wrote it .	1
No surprise that this album was a three-time winner at the 1989 Juno Awards ( Best Album , Male Vocalist and Producer Of The Year ) . Despite the commercialism and pointlessness of music awards , those three awards were most deserving . The pairing of Robertson and fellow Canadian producer Daniel Lanois is perfect . Both give the right amount of restraint to AC-sounding songs like & quot ; Broken Arrow & quot ; and & quot ; Somewhere Down The Crazy River & quot ; , and let true rock n roll loose on songs like & quot ; American Roulette & quot ; and & quot ; Hell 's Half Acre & quot ; . This recording was a tremendous success , spurred on by the hit singles & quot ; Showdown At Big Sky & quot ; , & quot ; Somewhere Down ... & quot ; and & quot ; Broken Arrow & quot ; . Though Robertson 's vocals sound raspy and forced at times , that is forgiven with the superior musicianship . Robertson 's version of & quot ; Broken Arrow & quot ; is a bit of a disappointment , given that Rod Stewart did a much better ( and surprising ) cover of that song in 1991 . Highlights include the shadowy sounding & quot ; Showdown At Big Sky & quot ; ; the lyrical & quot ; Broken Arrow & quot ; ; Sammy BoDean on & quot ; Somewhere Down ... & quot ; and the electric & quot ; Testimony & quot ; . With additional help from Peter Gabriel and U2 , this is a convincing debut from a very talented man . Great stuff .	1
Robbie Robertson 's self-titled solo debut is also his best album on his own . Retaining some of the spirit of his work with the Band , he brings in numerous guests , including Peter Gabriel and U2 , to help out , and the result is that his trademark style is brought into the modern age . Influences ranging from U2 to the Meters are clearly audible here , along with Van Morrison , the Band , and Bob Dylan . There 's a cautionary undertone to many of the songs , which is fitting considering that his former bandmate , Richard Manuel , had committed suicide the year before . This is a CD that you should own if you 're a fan of folk-rock in any form .	1
I have always found it ironic that one of the men most responsible for defining the American Genre of music was a Canadian . Robbie Robertson led that band through many highs before they ultimately dissolved , then took another 11 years to release his first solo album . At a mere nine songs , he obviously took his time to compose what he felt were compositions worth hearing , and his 1987 solo debut remains his best solo work.Robertson also made it very clear that he would not be satisfied just making an album that mimicked The Band . Enlisting producer Daniel Lanois to spin his atmospheric production mist around the new songs , then bringing in admirers to assist with their creation , `` Robbie Robertson '' emerged as an all-star effort of critical praise and artistic cooperation . Peter Gabriel , Bono , The Bodeans , Maria McKee ( Lone Justice ) all make appearances , but this is strictly Robertson 's show . While the album also has a very late 80 's feel to it ( having a great deal to do with his guest 's influences ) , all the songs are stellar.The highlights are `` American Roullete , '' where Robertson takes on our idol martyr machine , driving at Elvis , Marilyn and James Dean . The `` Broken Arrow '' tribute to Band member Richard Manuel was emotionally powerful enough that Rod Stewart took a softened version of it Top 20 . While Gabriel 's contribution of `` Fallen Angel '' sounds a tad too close to his own `` Red Rain '' and U2 made `` Sweet Fire Of Love '' seem made to force Robertson into a guest on his own album , these are still both good songs.For me , though , the capper was `` Somewhere Down The Crazy River . '' Delivered as a smokey talk-song , it is also the album 's production apex . The Bodeans supply a sweet/sour vocal echo to the chorus as Robertson describes a darkly magic night in New Orleans . It 's the least organic song on an already eclectic album , and that 's saying something . Robertson would further explore these thoughts and locales on hisStoryvillefollowup , but for `` Somewhere Down The Crazy River , '' he said it all in under four minutes .	1
I was always just a casual fan of The Band , so when I first stumbled upon & quot ; American Roulette & quot ; while on a trip through Cleveland , I was shocked at what a great song it was . As usual , Cincinnati radio totally ignored it , but I found a kindered spirit in a local record store who recommended the album . American Roulette barely scratches the surface . This was one of those rare albums that drag you in and never let you go , ( not that you 'd struggle much . ) As I listened to the tape in my car for the first time , I kept expecting & quot ; the clinker & quot ; . Nope . Never happens . Even the then overplayed Bono and U2 never come close to overriding Robertson 's proudest recorded moment . & quot ; Sweet Fire Of Love & quot ; has Robbie and Bono trading vocal licks , but sounding totally in sync . & quot ; Showdown At Big Sky & quot ; might be the most incredible song you 've never heard if it were n't for & quot ; Somewhere Down The Crazy River & quot ; which never fails to grab the first time listener . I 've made copies of this for several friends over the years and all have later commented on how great it was and how odd it was that they never heard it . Then I remind them that we live in Cincinnati , where good radio goes to die . Make this a part of your permanent road trip collection . It 's that good .	1
Even in the 80 's and afterDog Eat Dogwent somewhat unrecognized Joni Mitchell still had her creative juices very much flowing at decades end and to her advantage even these times provided her with plenty of inspiration for her musical and lyrical poetry . There are guest vocalists on this album that range from Peter Gabriel ( whose participation is pretty appropriate ) , Tom Petty , Billy Idol and interestingly enough Willy Nelson . The overall sound of this album does'nt differ too much from the previous album in as much as the synthesizer textures and rhythms that never come to a full concluding point still make up the bulk of this album musically . One difference is everything from the songwriting to Joni 's vocals sound very distant here . `` My Secret Place '' and `` Number One '' , the two songs that start out this album illustrate this sound very well . The whole idea , pretty much as always is focused on the lyrical poetry , which on this album seems to be a dialog on nearly everything on Joni 's mind at that time . `` Lakota '' on the other hand is pretty clear cut ; now the song itself has a Native American flavor and the lyrics are an equally likeminded protest song and very well illustrated . Joni once released a video calledPainting with Words and Musicand that is exactly the feeling you get from this and the other songs from this album . One song that does rise a bit in tempo , probably due in part to the continuing presense of Thomas Dolby is `` Dancin ' Clown '' , the only song on this album that relies on something like a beat . Willie Nelson 's flavor adds an important tone to the impressionist feeling of `` Cool Water '' , which actually brings you into the words and music as a very active participant due to the sounds of both singers voices largely . This completes a decade of Joni Mitchell 's musical output that over ten years time only produced three albums which , after listening to this one are all of very good quality . As for the synthesizers and drum machines I do n't mind them at all , never did with most people anyway . At least , as with most musical ideas that come Joni 's way she uses them as if they were colors on a paint pallete rather than merely to sell a record . I would strongly recommend this album to anyone already somewhat familiar with Joni 's 70 's classics who wish to dig deeper into her second full decade of recording .	1
The diversity on `` Chalk Mark In a Rain Strom '' is simply wonderful . There 's a good balance of politically charged beauties ( The Reoccurring Dream , The Beat Of Black Wings , Cool Water , Etc . ) & also endearing odes of love ( My Secret Place , Snakes & Ladders , Etc . ) She continues her use of synthesisers ( Also heard on 1985 's `` Dog Eat Dog '' ) which constructs gorgeous pieces such as the bittersweet synth bouquet of `` Lakota '' or the achingly beautiful `` The Tea Leaf Prophecy '' in which she brilliantly says in wonderful Joni fashion : '' Newsreels rattle the Nazi dreadThe able-bodied have shipped awayMolly McGee gets her tea-leaves readYou 'll be married in a month they say '' These leaves are crazy ! Look at this town there 's no men left ! Just frail old boys and babiesTalking to teachers in the treble clef '' Absolutly wonderful record . Brilliant lyrics & harmonies as usual . Highly recommended .	1
Honest and powerful lyrics blended with atmosphereic and beautiful melodies add up to this triumph of a record . Joni is in complete control of her muse and artistic vision and it 's very much apparent on wonderous bits like `` The Beat Of Black Wings '' or `` Lakota '' There is a driving ebb and lush cinematic sweep to these songs that is simply gorgeous . Joni is a prolific and accomplished artist way ahead of her time . Her legacy will live on forever , and her flawless discography and archives hold testimate to that .	1
Many ( ignorant ) people dismiss Joni 's '80s work and do n't even give it a chance . In my opinion , she has never made a weak album . Every single one is well crafted and well executed . Critics get caught up in comparing each album to the last one . Joni is a painter , and approches her music/albums the same way . Each one is a completely different piece that stands on it 's own . She 's never made the same album twice , and has never been afraid to experiment and take chances . This is a beautiful record . There are many duets with a wide range of people ( Billy Idol , Willie Nelson , Peter Gabriel , etc . ) I would recommend this or anything in the Joni catalog . She really amazes me with her consistant elegance and brilliance .	1
A very strong effort from vetern song writer/performer Joni Mitchell.The collection starts with , in my opinion , the best track on the CD , `` My Secret Place '' . The lyrics and musical track provide the listener with a scenic vision of `` the secret place '' , one we all dream of and relate to . Add in Peter Gabriel as Joni 's vocal partner and the track is complete.Track # 3 , `` Lakota '' has drummer Manu Katche taking charge . The beat , so hypnotic , makes it easy to become trapped in the story and fell like they are sitting at the camp fire listening.Track # 5 features none other then Billy Idol playing the supporting role . Mitchell plays off Idol 's cliche hjowls and sneers to make this song work wonderfully.Willie Nelson joins Joni for Track 6 , `` Cool Water '' . Yet another fantastic vocal collaberation.Track 9 , `` The Reoccuring Dream '' , allows Mitchell the opportunity to take issue with `` the decade of greed '' . The song features several out takes from advertising spots as the backdrop to Mitchell 's lyrics.The CD closes with a snappy track featuring legendary sax man , Wayne Shorter . Shorter 's quick riffs add yet another demension to this very diverse and enjoyable recording .	1
Here Joni 's creative embers are glowing brightly again . Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal - religious symbolism surfaces in Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem ( an adaptation of a Yeats poem ) . The topic of growing old , gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold , is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray 's Dad 's Cadillac , in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones , one of her imitators . Savour these lines : `` Ray 's dad teaches maths/I 'm a dunce , a decimal in his class/When it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic . '' Well , this is music - not maths - and Joni gets four out of five for composition and performance .	1
Ladies Of the Canyon , Court and Spark , Miles of Aisles ( a Live Work of Art ! ) and & quot ; finally & quot ; we come to Chalkmark In A Rainstorm . This was one of the last things that I bought on vinyl ( remember that ? ) before I started to convert CD . Needless to say I played this album till you could practically see through the grooves . When friends would come over we would all marvel at the incredible sounds coming out of the stereo . This album was , believe it or not ( like many of Joni 's others ) nominated for a few GRAMMY AWARDS , including Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female . I do n't remember what won instead of this album but , I do remember the deep dissappointment that this album did n't reach the masses . With smart catchy lyrics and singable harmonies , this is Joni 's best offering since Court and Spark ! If you are looking for something to sample from Joni 's Less Folk/More Pop/Jazz oriented period , THIS IS THE ONE . The only album of hers that I would recommend more would be Court and Spark . This one will have you singing along and wondering where the hell it 's been hiding from you all these years . You got ta love this one !	1
SHe and the New Bohemians have created a thought-provoking array of wild and hippy fun loving songs that speak to the care free yet concerned spirit -- songs of pain and truth collage this album into any artwoRk that 's high on a collector 's list . `` Circle '' speaks of lonliness and redemption , '' Little Miss S '' speaks to the soul of the unfulfilled in a way that encompasses an empathy found in songs such as Maria McKee 's remake of `` This Propery Is COndemned . '' It 's good .	1
`` I 'm not aware of too many thingsI know what I know , if you know what I mean ... '' Sa ovim recima pocinje kultna pesma 80'. , What I Am , koja i otvara jedan od najznacajnih albuma iste decenije Shooting Rubberbands At The Stars.Izuzetno mudri tekstovi plove kroz ceo album , koji su imali vidni uticaj na zenske izvodjace koje su donele 90'.Edie je uspesna na svakom polju , nebitno da li peva o ljubavi ili drustvu , pesme su pune osecanja , i nikako ne mozete izbeci njihov udarac pravo u stomak . '' I remember you put a chill across my facelike the air of December- I swear I remember it that wayI swear I remember itWhere r u know ? `` Da li sada razumete o cemu pricam ? Da li osecate jak uticaj Edie na Alanis Morissette ? I to nije sve.Pravi sok dolazi na kraju albuma sa vise nego odlicnom besnom pesmom Keep Coming Beck.Odlican album za svaku preporuku.Uostalom What I am i Circle govore vise nego sto bi trebalo .	1
What can I say ? I wish I could give this ten stars. ( ... ) Edie Brickell is my favourite female vocalist of all and I absolutely adore the youthful and sensual beauty of her angelic voiceNot only this the lyrics are very good .Edie , who writes the lyrics , has a great turn of phrase , 'philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocksreligion is alight in the fog'and 'There 's nothing I hate more than nothingNothing keeps me up at nightI toss and turn over nothingNothing can cause a great big fight'And this 1988 album is by far the best of Edie Brickell and The New BohemiansApart from 'the well known and wonderful 'What I Am ' and 'Circle ' there are also other beautiful melodies like 'Little Miss S ' , 'Air of December ' , 'The Wheel ' , Love Like We Do ' , 'Circle ' , Beat the Tune ' and 'Nothing ' I could listen for hours and still want more.if you like good music I can not recommend this one enough	1
This is an excellent album , with thoughtful and intelligent lyrics , incredibly catchy tunes , Edie 's voice hip , tough and sensitive at the same time - a kind of sexy wistfulness that 's as frank as it is meloncholic . The Amazon review underrates it . Edie Brickell 's first album is great through and through . It 's no wonder that it was the success that it was . One of the gems of the late 80s , with a spiritual tone more akin to the 90s .	1
Any list of the 'best ' albums of the 1980s never seems to include this album . The average person considers her a `` one hit wonder '' for `` What I Am '' ..the track that leads off the album . I ca n't for the life of me figure out why this is the case.I found this album quite by accident at our local library when I was in high school ( `` What I am '' was n't really a big hit in our area and I 'd never heard it ) . Something about the packaging sparked my interest and I borrowed it and loved it . It 's been almost 20 years since this came out and I still play it and still love it which I can say for precious few discs I loved in high school.My enamourment with the album does n't stem from pure nostalgia . I still have good memories associated with a song from Bad English but I 'm not going to tell you it 's great art . This is ... What you get here is 12 smart , tuneful songs that marry folk and rock without being pretentious about it . Indeed , `` What I Am '' urged listeners to `` choke me in the shallow water before I get too deep '' . The intellect that underscores this album is more basic than the kind that 's flaunted in an attempt to garner critical praise and `` indie '' cred . It 's in the notion that your doppelganger ( look it up ) is at this moment living his/her life elsewhere on this blue-green orb . ( `` The Wheel '' ) It 's in the simple observation that it is n't the harsh words we exchange that cause relationships to implode but the poisonous feelings held inside ( `` Nothing '' ) . It 's in the telling detail that paints a picture from a long distant memory ( 'the sun was in the sky like pink champagne and it glistened in your eyes all day ' from `` Air of December '' ) . Perhaps Edie ended up marrying Paul Simon because she really understood `` I Am a Rock '' ( consider her own `` Circle '' : '' When I 'm by myself it 's the best way to be/When I 'm all alone it 's the best way to be/When I 'm by myself nobody else can say goodbye '' ) . A gorgeous understated tune like `` I Do '' can even be wasted as a hidden track on this one.BOTTOM LINE : Give this a chance . Your library probably has a copy . A friend has a copy . This album is much better than it gets credit for.HIGHLIGHTS : Air of December , The Wheel , Love Like We Do , What I Am , Circle , I Do ( Hidden track )	1
Of all their albums , including & quot ; The Ultimate Collection & quot ; , this debut is the one & quot ; Edie Brickell & quot ; cd to have . Song for song it 's the best . Besides the big hit & quot ; What I Am & quot ; being on here , it also includes & quot ; Circle & quot ; , & quot ; Love Like We Do & quot ; , & quot ; She & quot ; , and the bonus track & quot ; I Do & quot ; . I think anyone would enjoy this , even those who normally would n't listen to happy hippie pop music , like myself . You can just see her spinning around in the grass singing when you listen to this . For those interested , she also has a 2003 solo release called & quot ; Volcano & quot ; , and she 's still as cute as she sounds .	1
Of the two Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians ( EBATNB ) cds , 1988 's Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars ( SRATS ) is better than 1990 's Ghost of a Dog or Edie 's 1994 solo effort . On SRATS , there are 12 consistent and original songs with Edie 's breathy vocals complimenting each one . The music , lyrics and vocals are what make this a stand out cd . Sometimes the first cd is the best from an artist and that would be accurate to say here . It has the hits & quot ; What I Am & quot ; and & quot ; Circle & quot ; plus 8 other tracks that are just as good . A must have for any rock collector .	1
After the Eagles ' acrimonious break-up at the beginning of the decade , the individual members could n't have pursued more different solo careers . Glenn Frey tried his best , but his success came mostly with soundtrack songs like & quot ; The Heat Is On & quot ; ( from BEVERLY HILLS COP ) and & quot ; You Belong To The City & quot ; ( from MIAMI VICE ) . Joe Walsh had already had a considerable career before joining the Eagles as a solo artist and leader of the James Gang . But even his solo career was a bit less than satisfying in the '80s . Don Henley , on the other hand , who was probably the least vocal of the Eagles ( at least musically ) , had only just begun . I CA N'T STAND STILL ( 1982 ) was a good start for a solo career , but was immediately overtaken by the sheer flawlessness of BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST ( 1984 ) . Dated as it sounds today , it was still an excellent example of Don 's cynical look at society of the time . With Reaganomics at their height , Don was probably one of the few people brave enough to claim that all things may look good on the surface , but could cost us dearly in the long run . By 1989 , with Reagan gone , and Bush the elder starting out , it was time to look back at our progress and regress of the decade , and ever the unofficial political pundit , Don Henley contributed his viewpoint with END OF THE INNOCENCE . In a decade where pop music was so much geared towards the youth market , a near-middle-age guy like Don Henley having hits was quite an anomaly . But it showed that adult wisdom was still very much appreciated among the din of prefabricated pop music . END OF THE INNOCENCE proved that Don had learned a whole lot more in the 5 years since BEAST . Opening with the immediately recognizable piano chords of Bruce Hornsby , the title track on the surface sounds like end of a love affair . But when you dig deeper , that 's only part of the story , for the song has Don claiming that after an age of tax cuts , recessions , and government deregulations , we 're facing an uncertain future as to how those things would soon affect us . Some truly wise words for a song that became a top 10 hit in 1989 . While BEAST captured the '80s at their materialistic peak , INNOCENCE had Don examining the fallout . Other songs like & quot ; How Bad Do You Want It ? & quot ; ( another social commentary masked as a song about a lovers ' quarrel ) , & quot ; Shangri-La & quot ; , & quot ; If Dirt Were Dollars & quot ; and & quot ; Gim me What You Got & quot ; further examine the idea that in an age of & quot ; free money & quot ; , we were too busy reaping the benefits while not looking close enough at the side effects . This may be considered a little hypocritical coming from an artist like Don , whose albums always bring him plenty of money . But for a man who 's also gotten involved with environmental causes like the Walden Woods Project ( which he helped found ) , perhaps he really is putting his money where his mouth is by calling it a corruptor of society . Not every song on INNOCENCE is social commentary , though . The more personal statements of INSIDE JOB are foreshadowed on the album 's other two hits singles & quot ; The Last Worthless Evening & quot ; and & quot ; The Heart Of The Matter & quot ; . With most love songs not surpassing the old & quot ; I love you , I ca n't live without you & quot ; standard , those two songs on INNOCENCE have Don looking at a different side of love that is more honest and adult than what you 'd normally hear in constant rotation on the radio . And with many middle-aged artists trying their best to be young and hip , Don was n't afraid to act his age . After END OF THE INNOCENCE did its time on the charts , Don Henley fell silent for most of the 1990s . But that 's not to say he was taking a load off . With the Eagles reunion we thought we 'd never see , Don getting married and starting a family , and his record company trying Don 's patience , no wonder we would n't hear from him until the new millennium . While INSIDE JOB took a long time to appear more because of life itself and not Don 's legendary perfectionism , that was actually good . A whole different era would take its time unfolding Don had a chance to put in his two cents about it .	1
THE END OF THE INNOCENCE was Don Henley 's third solo album and his second since he signed with Geffen Records . His first solo album I CA N'T STAND STILL was released on Asylum in 1982 , the same label that his band The Eagles recorded on . In 1984 , Henley signed with Geffen and released BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST . Five years later , this album was released . Henley had two previous megahits with The Eagles , their albums HOTEL CALIFORNIA and THE LONG RUN . Now for the songs : the title track , which is the first hit from this album , features Bruce Hornsby playing the piano . The track was written or co-written by Hornsby . Other hits include THE LAST WORTHLESS EVENING , I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY , THE HEART OF THE MATTER and NEW YORK MINUTE . GIM ME WHAT YOU GOT features Geffen Records labelmate Edie Brickell singing background ( I want it , I want it ) . NEW YORK MINUTE also appeared on the Eagles ' reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER , released in 1994 . All the other tracks are good .	1
Easily one of the best albums of the eighties , 'The End of the Innocence'still shines brilliantly.Henley has one of the most recognizable voices in business and on this record he took his great songwriting skills to the limit ; what makes this CD so great is not the star studded cast ( Bruce Hornsby , Axl Rose , Wayne Shorter , to name a few ) but rather the exceptional quality and maturity of the songs ; they are utterly cinematic and compelling , e.g . 'New York Minute ' , as if each one encompasses a novel-they also exude a certain timelesness making them sound fresh even today.Music like this is hard to come by !	1
Don Henley has been successful as a solo . His music has a lot of variety , and , though he does n't have a great voice , it is good , and it suits his music . This will be an enjoyable addition to anyone 's collection . TANSTAAFL .	1
This is surely Don Henley 's best album , ripe with not only his trademark sarcastically , clever , and sometimes cynically honest lyrics ; but with full-out music and arrangements . Beautiful , reflective songs such as the title track , If Dirt Were Dollars , and New York Minute are among his best . Also , rounding out the album , are heartfelt ballads like The Heart of the Matter and The Last Worthless Evening . The former is one of my favorite ballads , and the latter is noteworthy for it 's clever lyrics . If you 're looking for a Don Henley album , this would n't be a bad place to start .	1
& quot ; The End of the Innocence & quot ; really hit home.When JFK was killed in Dallas , I lost my Innocence.This song , that Bruce Hornsby co-wrote , and plays keyboards on , just brings back that terrible day.I was only 8 , but I still remember sitting in my 3nd Grade Classroom , and being sent home.This song also tells about the terrible Reagan years , with the line , & quot ; For this tired old man that we elected king , & quot ; and the preachers telling us not to sin , while there sleeping with everyone and stealing our money.Every song on this CD has some special meaning. & quot ; I will not go Quietly , & quot ; about turning your life around , & quot ; The last worthless evening , & quot ; a loveless relationship , and a the wonderfull fun cut , & quot ; Shangri-la. & quot ; The last song on the album , & quot ; The Heart of the Matter , & quot ; is my favorite.Just forget about hatred , and move on. & quot ; You keep carryin that anger , it 'll eat you up inside. & quot ; When you play & quot ; The End of the Innocence , & quot ; you think about the end of he 80's.This album is Don Henley 's greatest solo Album .	1
I have loved the as a tape and wanted it as a CD . it arrived on time and in the condition it was described as . Thanks	1
The End Of The Innocence may have marked the end of an era , but it is unquestionably the musical pinnacle of Don Henley 's career . The one drawback may be that Don spoke too soon by his disparages of Reagan and the social mindsets of the 80 's . Considering we had yet to see Clinton and the 90 's , the album almost sounds dated , but the messages are just about timeless.The title song , sounding almost like a requiem for the 80 's , stands as one of the greatest ballads of the decade , recalling the small-town beginnings of many an American . `` How Bad Do You Want It ? '' is Eaglesque in its lyrics although set to the pulsing rhythm of Don 's solo work . Regarding the rocking `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' , I had the fortune of seeing Don live on his 2000 tour , and in closing with this song , he was true to his word . Right after that , `` The Last Worthless Evening '' , is unskippable as one of his more romantic musings . `` New York Minute '' , a very unique song for Don 's catalog , weaves a bluesy tale about the terrors of being alone in the city . On the other side of the country , `` Shangri-La '' depicts Hollywood as seen through the eyes of the young and struggling . And then come the three bitter but catchy attacks on life in the late 80 's : `` Little Tin God '' knocks the pins out from under crooked televangelists , although the slant against Reagan 's campaign of American Pride is thinly veiled , remiciscent of how another President was attacked still more brazenly in `` Everybody Knows '' . `` Gim me What You Got '' sounds like it was written for the movie 'Wall Street ' , railing at how easily greed can replace ambition with one barely noticing . `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' could arguably be a sequel to `` Dirty Laundry '' in its not-as-satirical exposure of the circus of news coverage , or is it sensationalism ? The album 's stirring finale is another return to Don 's tangible but rarely seen forgiving side , and he admits applying the message of `` The Heart Of The Matter '' in a way , helped with the Eagles reunion 5 years later.It 's hard to locate a low point in the album , as all the songs are memorable , even if the views do n't agree with yours . Don never sounded better ( except live ) , so grab this one and somewhere on here you must find a song you love .	1
His is one of the great Eagles band members that one can forget . Once again , He 's the best Thanks , David	1

Don Henley 's The End of the Innocence capped off the '80s on a perfect note . With Bruce Hornsby 's classy piano sounding like the last , gentle strains of an uneasy age , lead track & quot ; The End of the Innocence & quot ; features one of the best lyrics ever written on disillusionment ... and hope in the face of disillusionment . Henley sounds like he was put on earth to make this majestic song come alive , his singing the best he 's ever done , a high croon filled with longing and sadness.And the rest of the album holds up : & quot ; The Heart of the Matter & quot ; is a quiet , extraordinary exploration of lost love , moving beyond words ; & quot ; I Will Not Go Quietly & quot ; rips into hard-rock mode ; & quot ; The Last Worthless Evening & quot ; is a brewing ballad with suppressed feelings of desire ; and & quot ; New York Minute & quot ; 's ringing guitars make for a perfect accompaniment to Henley 's mournful but hypnotic voice.This album belongs on every list as one of the best of the 1980s .	1
When I first heard some of the tracks on this record , my feelings were , & quot ; Just what I needed . More bland pop music. & quot ; However , time has definitely made me change my tune on this batch . These songs are all written with heavy emotion . Whereas the tone is quite sad and disillusional , it rings of many honest and true sentiments . New York Minute is the real gem here as anything can truly change in the blink of the eye . Heart Of The Matter has a captivating hook and Bruce Hornsby adds the right touches on the title track . The touching horn and keyboard arrangments really make Don Henley 's music stand up when compared to his former band mates work . And his lyrics are so original and real that it balances out some of bland moments . This collection is definitely worthy of my respect .	1
I bought this album when it came out , a friend of mine recommanded this one to me . I have to say that I still enjoy listening to it , every song a pleasure to listen to , no filler . Great from the beginning till the end . My favorite tracks are `` The end of Innocence '' , `` The last worthless evening '' , `` New York minute '' and `` The heart of the matter '' . A very good addition to any cd collection .	1
This is another CD I nearly wore out . This is good stuff . Henley got the lyrics going . And great music .	1
There are only one or two songs on this CD I 'm not crazy about . How often can one say that about any album they buy ? The line `` a man with a briefcase can steal more money than a man with a gun '' is a CLASSIC ! And `` never seen no hursts with luggage racks . '' is great too !	1
What can you say about an album like this ? Finely crafted , painstakingly original and influential , this should be a part of the 1980s timecapsule . The title track is a masterpiece about the Reagan era and the values it represented . This is the real thing , unlike the revisionism which has been happening in recent times . It is easy to see why Henley won the Grammy for best vocal performance by a male . It should have won song of the year as well . The original 3 & quot ; CD and vinyl 45 of this song are prized collector 's items and if you have them keep them under lock and key . For the rest of us we can keep the dream alive by listening to this CD . It truly is a once in a lifetime event .	1
The title song is a classic . The overall feel of the album is what you would expect from any of the Eagles .	1
Following the breakup of the Eagles , Don Henley would embark on what would slowly become a very successful solo career . In the 1980s , Henley would release three albums . His first effort was 1982 's `` I Ca n't Stand Still '' . This effort would produce a classic tune called `` Dirty Laundry '' in which Henley poked fun at the `` pretty faces '' doing the TV news . Two+ years later - in 1984 , a more successful follow-up `` Building the Perfect Beast '' would produce three more singles `` All She Wants To Do is Dance '' , `` Sunset Grill '' , and `` The Boys of Summer '' . `` The Boys of Summer '' was a mega-hit for Henley that was boosted by an award winning music video . Following `` Building the Perfect Beast '' , Henley would take nearly 5 years to make his next effort . The 5 year effort made by Henley would not disappoint - his 1989 effort entitled `` The End of the Innocence '' would become his most successful solo effort to date . Each of Don Henley 's solo albums would be more successful from both a commercial sales and criticial acclaim standpoint . `` The End of the Innocence '' marked the peak of Don Henley 's solo career and broke him out of the mold of the Eagles and put him on his own two feet.There are three factors that make `` The End of the Innocence '' a great album . First , from a songwriting standpoint - Henley and Company do some of his best work . Second , from a production standpoint . Danny Kortchmar was brought in as the a co-producer with Henley for 7 of the 10 songs . Kortchmar had collaborated with Henley on his two previous albums as a songwriter . Kortchmar continues to collaborate with Henley on several tunes , but now moves into the role as the main co-producer . Kortchmar 's previous work with Henley makes him a natural fit as he is able to get the most out of Don Henley 's talents . Finally , as with his previous studio albums - Henley brings in an all-star lineup of musicians - past , present , and future . This lineup of musicians help augment Henley 's talents even more and make this such as great release . The lineup of musicians includes : Bruce Hornsby , Mike Campbell ( from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ) , Patty Smyth ( Scandal ) , Axl Rose ( Guns N Roses ) , Jeff Porcaro and David Paich ( Toto ) . The lineup includes three woman who would become big stars in the 90s : Melissa Etheridge , Edie Brickell , and Sheryl Crow.Bruce Hornsby is co-writer , producer ( this is the one of non-Kortchmar produced song ) , and pianist of `` The End of the Innocence '' . Hornsby 's trademark piano playing combined with Henley 's vocals make this a classic . The lyrics make a lot of use of metaphors . Although a much different sound than 1984 's `` The Boys of Summer '' , the song still has much of the retro-qualities of `` Boys of Summer '' . `` How Bad Do You Want It '' is a very underrated tune . It probably is one of the best songs of the album and is co-written by Henley , Kortchmar , and Stan Lynch . There is some great horn work and terrific drum work . Patty Smyth plays a key role with the background vocals that fold in perfectly when needed . Although not as strong a song as `` How Bad Do You Want It '' , the third track `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' makes good use of background vocals as well . Another Henley and Kortchmar collaboration , this strong uses Axl Rose on background vocals and he goes perfectly with the hard rock edge of this song.Despite Kortchmar 's solid influence , the collection 's best track `` The Last Worthless Evening '' was n't a Kortchmar collaboration from a songwriting or production standpoint . Mike Campbell and John Corey ( Corey and Stan Lynch wrote and produced this with Henley ) provide some terrific guitar work . The acoustic sound makes this song special . In this song , Don sings this song to himself about a woman who has broken up with someone and Don feels he can fill the void in the woman 's life . The best part of the song is the bridge in the middle of the song that goes `` Time Time Ticking ... '' . This song is a classic . `` New York Minute '' was written in 1989 by Henley , Kortchmar , and Jai Winding . It is a truly great song that features Toto 's Jeff Porcaro on drums and Toto 's David Paich on piano . This song has a terrific haunting quality . What nobody would realize is how this song would almost become a soundtrack for the state of New York City following the World Trade Center attack . Lyrics such as `` Harry Got Up ... .Went Down to the Station ; And He Never Came Back '' and `` Lying here in darkness ; I hear the Sirens Wail '' are examples of this . Paich also contributes piano on `` Little Tin God '' . `` Little Tin God '' deals with Evangelists and Healers . This best way to describe this song 's sound is a folk-like quality applied with a harder Rock edge.Edie Brickell and Melissa Etheridge contribute background vocals on `` Gim me What You Got '' . Because of Kotchmar 's guitar , this song has almost a John Fogerty sound to it - much like you hear on `` Centerfield '' . Sheryl Crow contributes background vocals on `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' . This song also has a Fogerty like quality . Both songs may have a Fogerty sound , but they also explore Fogerty-like topics of materialism and greed.The collection wraps up with `` The Heart of the Matter '' . This song almost seems like a perfect `` wrap-up '' like song . Mike Campbell plays guitar and keyboards and is a co-writer and producer with Henley on this track ( also Kortchmar co-produces ) . Don sings about a lost love and he explores to see what went wrong by getting to `` The Heart of the Matter '' . Campbell 's work on guitar and keyboards will really be the foundation to this song.The liner notes of this collection contain the lyrics to all of the songs . The production and songwriting credits are also included . The collection also does a nice job at listing the studio musicians . Overall , this is a solid effort by Don Henley - highly recommended .	1
When The Eagles split during the 1980 's , they truly have had some split decisions during the era . Even though three of the 5 memers really struggled during that time , two of them actually made the mark solo . In that time , Glenn Frey and Don Henley each embarked on successful solo era . While they both did extremely well , Don Henley seemed to show a whole lot more within the solo act . In the 80 's he seemed to break down so many doors and stories within his videos and his actual songs from three solo efforts . Out of all three of his efforts , Building The Perfect Beast , I Ca n't Stand Still , and The End Of The Innocence , the last one actually made the greatest impact , and opened so many doors for so many people.The End Of The Innocence , Don 's 1989 record , was worth 5 years within the making . In fact , the record really seemed to be one of the few records that actually spoke out true Americana at that time . The melody ranges beautifully with great songs from sorrow to New York Minute , to ballads of forgiveness , like Heart Of The Matter and The Last Worthless Evening . The record seemed to open so many so many doors for so many performers including Sheryl Crow , Melissa Etheridge , the Gospel group Take 6 , and the other recluse of the 80 's outside of Michael Jackson , Axl Rose . Although the record is short , the music still seems to break very well , as an 80 's version to Marvin Gaye 's What 's Going On . That 's what I think it is to be anyway.Although many people do n't seem to get the message within The End Of The Innocence and Don Henley 's voice today , it is still one of the greatest records to ever come out during the 1980 's and still just as strong and assetive as it was back then . If you 're a fan of The Eagles , get this record . If you 're not a fan of Don Henley , you still should try to get a listen to this crafty and dynamic record .	1
Why do I say that ? It 's because it encapsulates the decade better than any other did both musically and lyrically . The 80s were , indeed , the end of the innocence for many , many of us . In my case I got married , had kids , got divorced and changed careers at least 4 or 5 times . The music fits every niche and cranny , from the metal edge of & quot ; I will not go quietly & quot ; to the satire of religion in & quot ; Little Tin God & quot ; and the failed materialism of & quot ; Gim me what you got. & quot ; All summed up in the overture of the brilliant title cut and ending with the heartbreaking & quot ; Heart of the matter. & quot ; To me there simply is no argument to make . This is the best album of the 80s .	1
Forty percent of this CD is really top-notch stuff . `` The End of the Innocence , '' `` The Last Worthless Evening , '' `` New York Minute '' and `` The Heart of the Matter '' are as good and poignant as pop rock music gets ; no wonder they were released as singles . Don Henley is one heck of a lyricist , and he knows how to write a catchy tune . The title track leads off the album , piano laden , sentimental and beautiful . Like all the aforementioned songs , there 's a sadness to the lyrics , in this case the loss of childhood and teenage innocence . `` The Last Worthless Evening '' is an easygoing Eagles-like ditty that , through its lyrics , perfectly captures the hardships of romance and remaining alone as one grows older . `` New York Minute '' is even more woeful . It begins with a starry-eyed string section and keyboards , which lead to Henley 's grizzled voice singing about suicide , street violence and the precarious shortness of life . The somewhat haunting chorus of `` New York Minute '' is as beautifully harmonic as it gets , and ultimately , the song ends on a positive note , lyrically . Truly , it 's one of the best songs Henley has ever been associated with , and that includes his work with The Eagles.Henley is also defiant and angry in spots . `` How Bad do You Want it ? , '' despite a cheesy sax , overly loud drums , hymnallike background vocals and a dark lingering synth , possesses genuine spirit that is commendable . Meanwhile , it 's priceless to hear the thin voice of Axl Rose performing backing vocals on the somewhat forced `` I Will Not Go Quietly , '' a song in which the pseudo-sounding metal bite is less than its valiantly attempted bark.Besides the gritty `` If Dirt Were Dollars , '' the forced tunes leading up to the album 's last track , `` The Heart of the Matter , '' do n't do a lot for me . But that 's OK -- `` Heart of the Matter '' contains some of the best breakup lyrics ever written . Henley could n't have written a better , more astute song , or chosen a more perfect tune to close out the CD . `` The End of the Innocence '' may have a touch of radio-ready , late-1980s AOR gloss to it , but the songs are admittedly immediate and memorable . And , as mentioned , the four good songs on this album are better than just good ; they 're excellent .	1
There is always a day of reckoning . As the 1980 's drew to a close , Don Henley 's conscience cracked wide open , leaving no alternative but exorcizing the demons that dominiated from the mid-70 's forward . This was the end of the innocence.The title track is an accomplishment in musicianship , but also a fine look at society 's descent into shattered myths coupled with dreams destroyed . Great song for lying under a tree on a lazy summer day , wondering where it all went wrong . '' I Wo n't Go Quietly '' is a fabulous duet with none other than Axl Rose . It seriously rocks. `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' is so direct the metaphors get lost. `` The Heart of the Matter '' , the closing track , finds Henley melancholy , accepting equal parts sorrow and blame . It 's an open invitation to put self aside in order to return some dignity.A little philosphical , a lot melodic , this continues to stay fresh , almost twenty years later .	1
For me this album was Henley 's high water mark as a solo artist . The album was another huge hit that spawned several big singles and propelled the album well beyond platinum status . This is one disc that deserved the sales in my opinion as every song on it is a winner . Henley 's social , religious and political commentary has never been more prevalent , and whether you agree with his points of view or not , the subject matter is always thought provoking . Highlights of the disc include the opening title track which was co-written with Bruce Hornsby . Bruce 's signature piano is the main instrument of this tale of lost innocence in the Regan years of the U.S. `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' is a rocking duet with Axle Rose from Guns And Roses . `` The Last Worthless Evening '' is a cool ballad that was a big hit . `` New York Minute '' was another big hit with great lyrics . `` Little Tin God '' is Henley 's reggae-ish take on religion . `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' is another great lyric and one of the heavier rocking tunes on the disc . The last track `` The Heart Of The Matter '' is one of those relationship songs that came along at just the right time in my life . This song always brings me back to my turbulent 20 's , and relationships gone badly . The lyrics pretty much reflected exactly what I was going through at the time , and it was like Henley got in my head and ripped this right out of my brain . He does this type of song as well as anybody in my opinion . Henley is once again supported by an all star cast of players . The music is never overly adventurous , but fits exactly what Henley was trying to get across in most cases . There are a few weak tracks here `` How Bad Do You Want It ? `` , `` Shangri-LA '' , and `` Gimmie What You Got '' are all ok , but not up to the rest of the disc . Overall though this is a very enjoyable album and the best of Henley 's solo career .	1
Don Henley is best known as the vocalist of legendary rock band , the Eagles . After the band broke up , he still managed to stay on top of the corporate music world through three solo efforts , Dirty Laundry in 1982 , Building the Perfect Beast in 1984 and the End of Innocence in 1989 . Among his solo efforts during 80s this album showcases his vocal appeal better than his previous works . Since most of the hit tracks from the album are ballads such as the title track co-written with Bruce Hornsby , THE LAST WORTHLESS EVENING , NEW YORK MINUTE and THE HEART OF THE MATTER , many music fans miss his blues rock track such as I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY , groovy track such as IF DIRT WERE DOLLARS , reggaeish track LITTLE TIN GOD . Five years after the huge success of this album the miraculous Eagles reunion followed . DVD version of 1994 Eagles reunion work HELL FREEZES OVER you can listen to Eagles version of THE HEART OF THE MATTER.Verdict : The best out of the voice of the EaglesRating : 96 out of 100Recommended for : 80s pop and rock fans , Eagles and Don Henley fans .	1
I bought this compact disc twice without realizing my error . I liked this compact disc and when it was in audio cassette . I love the songs like the Heart of the Matter , the unforgettable New York Minute , and the classic End of the Innocence . I did n't like Shangri-La but this compilation of Don Henley 's hits are worth the price if you buy it once or twice . It 's still worth hearing again .	1
THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is Don Henley 's other best solo album , along with BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST . The title song , like `` The Boys Of Summer '' from the previous album , made me realize that looking good for my favorite actresses was more important than attending food-related reunions at my old school , especially since most of the staff I knew are gone and many of the changes there have not been for the better . `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' and `` New York Minute '' made me realize that looking at photos of attractive female celebrities is a good way to inspire myself to avoid an individual I 've had issues with BEFORE I do myself in over it , whereas `` Little Tin Gods '' and `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' skewer hypocritical preachers and gossip columnists , respectively , and `` The Heart Of The Matter '' , like the title song , is about letting go , whether of a lost love , a grudge , or your past . Overall , THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is an album with great music and multilayered lyrical messages . The fact that Henley believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience .	1
`` Remember when the days were long and rolled beneath a deep blue sky '' ... remember Paradise Lost and the Last Resort ? At the end of the 1980s , his awareness of society and what 's wrong with it more acute than ever , on his third solo album Don Henley took up the theme of the closing song of the Eagles ' classic `` Hotel California '' even more forcefully than on his two prior releases . Now , however , it was not just `` somebody '' any longer who `` laid the mountains low while the town got high . '' Now the enemy had a face ; he was `` the tired old man that we elected king ; '' that cowboy whose name was Jingo , and who `` heard that there was trouble , so in a blaze of glory he rode out of the west - nobody was ever certain what it was that he was sayin ' but they loved it when he told them they were better than the rest . '' ( `` Little Tin God . `` ) By the time he published `` The End of the Innocence , '' Don Henley 's name was as firmly established as that of a successful solo artist as it had previously come to be known as one of the driving forces behind the Eagles ' almost decade-long success . Commercially his most successful album and critically his most acclaimed , his third solo release garnered a Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocalist ( for the title track ) and produced several more hit singles besides `` The End of the Innocence : '' `` The Heart of the Matter , '' `` New York Minute , '' `` How Bad Do You Want It ? '' and `` Last Worthless Evening . '' Stylistically , the album ranges from ballads like the piano-driven title song ( co-written by Bruce Hornsby , whose fingerprints are all over its instrumentation ; not just in the keyboards but also in the saxophone solo , performed by Wayne Shorter , and in the song 's main theme ) , `` The Last Worthless Evening , '' and Don Henley 's variation on the theme of forgiveness , `` The Heart of the Matter '' ( a song that took him `` 42 years to write , '' as he explained during the opening show of the Eagles ' `` Hell Freezes Over '' tour ) - all the way to hard-rocking tunes like `` I Will Not Go Quietly , '' featuring background vocals by Axl Rose . In between are the jazzy , introspective `` New York Minute , '' yet another ( percussion- and rhythm-driven ) warning that the world `` ai n't no Shangri-La , '' the deceptively light-footed `` Little Tin God , '' and no less than three hard , edgy songs rounding up Henley 's damning verdict on Reaganomics ( `` How Bad Do You Want It ? , '' `` Gim me What You Got '' and `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' ) .As were his previous solo albums , `` The End of the Innocence '' was co-produced and largely co-written by Danny Kortchmar , and likewise as on the previous albums , Henley enlisted the cooperation of a number of other outstanding musicians - in addition to Kortchmar , Hornsby , Shorter and Rose , Melissa Etheridge , Sheryl Crow , Julia and Maxine Waters , Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Stan Lynch , Toto 's David Paich and Jeff Porcaro , `` inofficial Eagle '' J.D . Souther , and many others . Except for his greatest hits album , 1995 's `` Actual Miles , '' this was also to be the last record Don Henley would publish on Geffen ; a label he did not leave without a fight ( which alongside the Eagles ' reunion , his marriage and his preoccupation with the Walden Woods Project , he would later list as one of the reasons why he did not produce another new album in all of eleven years ) .Henley is well-known to be a perfectionist and is sometimes criticized for allegedly overly `` slick '' productions ; a statement usually going hand in hand with accusations of superficiality and occasionally even hypocrisy ( his records did , after all , earn him millions ; so how serious can he be about his social criticism ? ) . But it does n't even take a look at his efforts to preserve the environment ( in the Walden Woods Project and elsewhere ) , his recently formed coalition for artists ' rights , and his testimony before Congress on a variety of related topics to doubt the accuracy of that assessment . This guy means every word he writes ; just listen to his lyrics - and as long as `` we got the bully pulpit and the poisoned pen '' and `` this brave new world [ is ] gone bad again '' ( `` If Dirt Were Dollars [ we 'd all be in the black ] '' ) , he 'll be around to hold up a mirror before our eyes.Also recommended : Don Henley Live - Inside JobThe Eagles - Hell Freezes OverSelected Works : 1972-1999Hotel California	1
Don Henley has faced his fair share of personal troubles . Busted for & quot ; entertaining & quot ; underage prostitutes , smeared ( along with the rest of the Eagles ) by Rolling Stone on a regular basis and never quite taken seriously as a songwriter by critics , The Age Of Innocence is timely revenge.Easily as good as and less dated sounding than Building The Perfect Beast , this album showed that Henley was both the most talented of the Eagles and capable of a self reflection not previously seen in his work.Sadly , those of us who are fans are going to have to wait for that fourth solo album as the Eagles are getting back together to record another album and tour once again proving that the public 's infatuation with the band is never ending .	1
Tesla 's debut album & quot ; Mechanical Resonance & quot ; blew me away . Rarely had I ever heard such a straight ahead , quality hard rock sound . Well , with this second effort the songs are every bit as good . Of course I love the radio songs -- the top 10 quality ( not cheesy ) ballad & quot ; Love Song & quot ; , the also slower tempo but excellent & quot ; The Way It Is & quot ; , and the gritty & quot ; Heaven 's Trail ( No Way Out ) & quot ; . However , every other song on this album RULES too ! Like with the first album , I could rave about each and every track . & quot ; Hang Tough & quot ; is an awesome heavy start to the album , & quot ; Lady Luck & quot ; just screams with attitude , & quot ; Lazy Days , Crazy Nights & quot ; is a party rocker , and & quot ; Paradise & quot ; is just one amazing anthem with a great softer side but a very uptempo ending -- a true masterpiece of a song . Anyone who likes straight ahead , heavy , and yet melodic rock and roll should definitely own this one . A truly underrated classic .	1
Of the studio albums Tesla has produced , I love & quot ; Great radio controversy & quot ; . This album may have been overshadowed by the release of better known ( at the time ) Def Leppard and their album & quot ; Hysteria & quot ; . However , Tesla countered with probably one of the best written ballads amomg heavier rock bands & quot ; the Love song & quot ; . I also found & quot ; paradise & quot ; to be just as powerful . & quot ; did it for the money & quot ; is another fav of mine . I love the high energy of the album . When I heard & quot ; the way it is & quot ; I was sold on the cd . I think you will be too . I you like Queensryche , you 'll like Tesla . Great band .	1
WOW , WHAT TO SAY ? THIS ALBUM WAS AND STILL IS ONE OF THE DEFINING POINTS OF THIS PERIOD OF ROCK . TESLA ROCKED THE ARENA 'S OF THE WORLD AND THIS ALBUM WAS THEIR BREAK OUT . COMPLETELY FULL OF GREAT SONGS . NO NOT ONE BAD ONE TO BE FOUND HERE ! IF YOU HAVENT HEARD THIS ONE YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO . TESLA CONTINUED TO PUT OUT GOOD ALBUMS BUT THIS IS THEIR BABY ! ALSO IF YOUR INTO THIS TYPE OF GOOD TALENTED ROCK N ROLL CHECK OUT THE TORA TORA CDS . ABSOLUTELY WAY UP THERE IN MY OPINION . THESE GUYS WERE BEHIND IN THE GAME BLOOMING LATE AND GOT LOST IN THE GRUNGE BUT LORD HAVE MERCY THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST ROCK IVE HEARD AND IVE HEARD IT ALL .	1
I was about 14 years old when I heard this album for the first time -- and then as now , what blew me away about it was the conviction , and the songwriting.Melody beats bombast every time -- refer to Van Halen 's early albums for this lesson -- and song for song , `` The Great Radio Controversy '' is arguably Tesla 's best album ( others give that title to `` Psychotic Supper '' ) . `` Hang Tough '' ( not to be confused with NKOTB ) , `` Lady Luck '' , `` Lazy Days , Crazy Nights '' , and `` Makin Magic '' all sway from verse/chorus/verse in various tempos but never vary in quality.Besides , the harmony vocals are what set Tesla aside from their contemporaries -- see them as a smart Poison with better chops and even better taste in influences . Check out `` Love Song '' ( one of the best power ballads of all time ) , and `` Paradise '' ( note the G'n'R homage in the 2nd half of the song ) for proof.It 's aged a little -- I have to be honest -- but it still holds up .	1
Tesla was a bit different than the majority of the late '80s hard rock bands . When one listens to & quot ; The Great Radio Controversy & quot ; , one can detect Tesla 's 1970 's influences , whether it is Montrose , The Eagles , Aerosmith , or Peter Frampton . The result is a convincing exercise in hard rock.This album contains & quot ; Love Song & quot ; , perhaps the best known song off this set . & quot ; The Way It Is & quot ; has that Eagles influence all over it , while & quot ; Heaven 's Trial ( No Way Out ) & quot ; has an Aerosmith-esque quality . That 's not to say the songs are derivative , though ; Jeff Keith 's vocals are unique and give Tesla their own identity , with a little help from guitar wizard Frank Hannon and sidekick Tommy Skeoch.Of course , Tesla does whip out the heavy artillery quite often on this album . & quot ; Flight To Nowhere & quot ; , & quot ; Hang Tough & quot ; , & quot ; Lady Luck & quot ; , & quot ; Did It For The Money & quot ; , & quot ; Party 's Over & quot ; and & quot ; Yesterdaze Gone & quot ; are excellent examples of the band going for the throat , while & quot ; Be A Man & quot ; finds Hannon sliding his way out of control in the intro before the song settles into an almost country groove . & quot ; Lazy Days Crazy Nights & quot ; , & quot ; Makin ' Magic & quot ; and & quot ; Paradise & quot ; are examples of Tesla keen sense of orchestration . Piano timbres grace & quot ; Lazy Days & quot ; and & quot ; Paradise & quot ; , while the thick & quot ; Makin ' Magic & quot ; uses guitar orchestration to build drama.This is the most accessible out of Telsa 's cannon because it 's got something for everyone : crushing hard rock ( & quot ; Flight To Nowhere & quot ; ) , tender ballads ( & quot ; Love Song & quot ; , & quot ; Paradise & quot ; ) and acoustic blues ( & quot ; Heaven 's Trail & quot ; ) to name just three genres . Tesla will be remembered as one of the better bands of the '80s hard rock explosion .	1
Five stars because it has stood the test of time ; I still listen to it , and it was a near perfect follow up to Tesla 's first release.The production is way different from the Mechanical CD . Same engineers , just more $ $ $ to spend I 'm sure , but it 's more than that.The rythym guitars are much more fuller sounding , the mix just a bit more sonically filled out.This CD is one of the few from that `` era '' that still sits in my CD rack.Buy It !	1
Still holds up almost 20 years later . This was one of the first CD 's I bought back in 1989 . Funny thing too , I was a fat lil kid , and I used this CD as my `` workout '' music . And I lost 60lbs in 6 months . No joke . But the music still holds up . They did n't need gimmicks like most of the bands back around then .	1
`` Great Radio Controversy '' ( 1989 ) # 18.Great hard rock music here , and a few nice peer ballads , there 's plenty of meat and potatoes on this disc . `` Hang Tough '' # 34 MSR , `` Heaven 's Trail ( No Way Out ) '' # 13 MSR , `` Lazy Days , Crazy Nights '' , `` Did It For Money '' , `` The Way It Is '' # 55 hot 100 and # 13 MSR , the ultimate classic `` Love Song '' # 10 hot 100 and # 7 MSR and `` Party 's Over '' . Best Tesla album of theirs on the market . Due for a re-master . Out .	1
Cher has been one of the best successful female solo artists ever , right behind my favorite , Madonna . Ever since her success with Sonny and ever since the start of her success of her solo career , Cher has been known to shock the people with her unbelievable style . During the duration of her time with Sonny , Cher had also a solo career on the side . Her solo albums include , ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO ( 1965 ) , THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER ( 1966 ) , CHER ( 1966 ) , BACKSTAGE ( 1967 ) , WITH LOVE CHER ( 1968 ) , 3614 JACKSON HIGHWAY ( 1969 ) , GYPSYS , TRAMPS & THIEVES ( 1971 ) , FOXY LADY ( 1972 ) , HALF-BREED ( 1973 ) , BITTERSWEET WHITE LIGHT ( 1974 ) , DARK LADY ( 1974 ) , GREATEST HITS ( 1974 ) , STARS ( 1975 ) , I 'D RATHER BELIEVE IN YOU ( 1976 ) , CHERISHED ( 1977 ) , PRISONER ( 1979 ) , TAKE ME HOME ( 1979 ) , I PARALYZE ( 1982 ) , & CHER ( 1987 ) ( her second album with this title ) . But in 1989 , Cher released the album that was chosen to be the favorite amongst many of her fans : HEART OF STONE . This album was Cher 's first most successful commercially released album , the second being BELIEVE , where it reached triple platinum status.IF I COULD TURN BACK TIMEThe second single from the album . One of Cher 's best and none of you can deny that . This is a love song that 's as original as they come . Cher tells her ex-boyfriend that `` if she could turn back time '' she would never have said all the rotten things she said to him and that they would still be together . The music video featured Cher in her most revealing outfit ever . The video was shot on a Navy Battleship with Cher performing the song in front of a bunch of sailors . Cher had a completely stocking-like material made see-through outfit with a thin black leather strap to cover her chest and her privates . The only thing the strap did not cover was her rear , which was tattooed . This outfit caused MTV and VH1 to air the video after midnight.JUST LIKE JESSE JAMESThe third single from the album . Cher did something we never thought she would do : she made a country-western song . This happens to be one of my favorite Cher songs of all time . In this song , she talks about how her boyfriend acts like he 's a bigshot by breaking the hearts of every woman he 's ever dated , including Cher . She tells him that if he 's going for breaking her heart , then it 's gon na take a lot to break it because Cher is a fighter and she promises that her boyfriend is gon na go down the way ole Jesse James did.YOU WOULD N'T KNOW LOVEI could n't believe how much of a great tune this one is . This is a song that all die-hard Cher fans will most likely adore , just as I do.HEART OF STONEThe fourth & final single from the album . An amazing song all together . You can not tell me that this is not a great song . Its acoustic guitar is out of this world.STILL IN LOVE WITH YOUI bet almost every ex-boyrfriend or ex-girlfriend has said this statement , more than a few times . This is a song for everyone who has been dumped by their girlfriends or boyfriends.LOVE ON A ROOFTOPI wonder what Love On A Rooftop feels like . I guess we 'll all find out , wo n't we ? This is one hell of a song.EMOTIONAL FIREGreat song . I always make sure I play this one before turning the album off.ALL BECAUSE OF YOUGreat.DOES ANYBODY REALLY FALL IN LOVE ANYMORE ? Great song . And to answer Cher 's question . Yes , anyone who is anyone falls in love.STARTING OVERAmazing . Not many couples ever get the chance to start over . Since I am a fan of the hit show , `` Friends '' , I was able to see Ross ( played by David Schwimmer ) & Rachel ( played by Jennifer Aniston ) get their chance to Start Over.KISS TO KISSGreat song . You have to listen to this song before you go to the next . I mean it . You 'll all love this song.AFTER ALL ( duet with PETER CETERA ) The first single from the album . This incredible duet was made the love theme to the 1989 film CHANCES ARE , starring Robert Downey , Jr. Everyone knows that this is a classic and classics never die . Remember when I said that we FRIENDS fans hope that in the season finale ROSS and RACHEL will get back together ? Well , if they do , I hope they tie the knot and if they do tie the night , this song is the perfect wedding song for them . The lyrics are a more than perfect fit . The chorus goes like this : AFTER ALL THE STOPS AND STARTS , WE KEEP COMING BACK TO THESE TWO HEARTS . TWO ANGELS WHO 'VE BEEN RESCUED FROM THE FALL . AND AFTER ALL THAT WE 'VE BEEN THROUGH , IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ME AND YOU . I GUESS IT 'S MEANT TO BE FOREVER YOU AND ME AFTER ALL.This album is just unbelievably amazing . This is my first favorite Cher album , the second being I PARALYZE , the third being , IT 'S A MAN 'S WORLD . If you are all Cher fans , then HEART OF STONE is the album for you to enjoy .	1
Cher followed up the success of her self-titled 1987 album with Heart of Stone , whose first two singles did better on the charts . She had retained the same production team-if it ai n't broke ... But the followup benefits from having better arrangements and instrumentations , while embodying a musical style now sadly long gone.Instead of merely writing this song , Diane Warren puts on her producer 's hat with Guy Roche . `` If I Could Turn Back Time , '' whose strident rhythms with the same synth and fiery guitar from her previous album , made it to # 3 on the charts and a week atop the Adult Contemporary charts . With a host of backing vocalists , including Desmond Child , Robin Beck , and Maria Vidal , plus guitar from Steve Lukather , who 'd contributed on `` I Found Someone , '' this could n't fail and it did n't . However , with the video aboard a US aircraft carrier with an ever-so revealing outfit , the song might as well have been called `` If I Could Show My Behind . '' What 's also revealing and tried and true are some things I have experienced : `` Pride 's like a knife it can cut deep inside/words are like weapons they wound sometimes . '' Words have hurt me too much at times , so I know.The second single , the power ballad written by Diane Warren and Desmond Child , `` Just Like Jesse James , '' challenging a ladykiller and trying to drop him off the swaggering macho cloud he 's floating on , indeed has lyrics with the aura of a Western showdown . This # 8 hit also features backing vocals by Child , Warren , and Brenda Russell ( `` Get Here , '' `` Piano In The Dark '' ) . Another winning song.Bolton and Warren co-write , with the former producing and arranging `` You Would n't Know Love , '' which is straight 80 's synth-laced music complete with its host of backing vocals . His production and songwriting on `` Still In Love With You '' and `` Starting Over , '' the latter co-written with Journey 's Jonathan Cain embodies the same style.Her cover of Desmond Child 's reflective `` Love On A Rooftop , '' produced by Asher , also on percussion , was not the first time I 'd heard it , as Ronnie Spector had done her version two years earlier on Unfinished Business , which makes at least three versions , including Child 's own , which came out in 1991 . This has more of a crunch to it , airy keyboard-wise and guitar-wise , the latter courtesy of the Heartbreakers ' Waddy Wachtel . A strong single-worthy rendition , though the more low-key version by Spector fits me more . Asher also produced the duet between her and Peter Cetera , `` After All , '' which was from the movie Chances Are . A # 6 hit , this spent 4 weeks atop the AC charts , and is a classic 80 's type pop ballad , and something Chicago probably 'd have no problem doing around their 17 or 18 albums . Wachtel also does guitar here as well . Another favourite here.The other Child-produced songs , `` Emotional Fire '' has the raging power to be on a Bon Jovi album , with harmonic chorus as strong as on BJ 's `` Living On A Prayer . '' Speaking of which , Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora help co-write `` Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore . '' A rhetoric question posed here is : `` There 's a lonely world around me/I get sucked in by the tide/I said , hey , love ai n't no crime/so why is everybody so afraid to cross that line . '' I found out the hard way . This is the song Kane Roberts later did in 1991.A successor to Cher 's 87 album , this is evidence enough that Cher had that second wind going for her . I mean , three Top Ten singles , one of them Top 5 , and the # 20 title track , not bad . Cher would repeat the formula for one more album before going on another hiatus , and redefining herself in 1998 with oontsa oontsa music with Believe .	1
This is by far one of Cher 's best ones in my collection.She surpassed her previous effort , and in 1989 she got to rank even higher on the charts ( IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME penned by Diane Warren significantly reaching # 3 on the singles charts and producing 3 other Top 40 hits ... ) .Reasons may vary : the ( in ) famous video for the above-mentioned tune , shot on that navy vessel , banned by MTV ; the impeccable choice of writers ( Warren , Child , Bon Jovi , Bolton , Galdston ) and producers ( Guy Roche , Peter Asher , Jon Lind , Michael Bolton , Diane Warren and Desmond Child again ) ; the collaborations ( great duet with Chicago 's former vocalist Peter Cetera on AFTER ALL ) ; the top form of her vocals ( JUST LIKE JESSE JAMES , KISS TO KISS ) and energy ( EMOTIONAL FIRE , DOES ANYBODY REALLY FALL IN LOVE ANYMORE ? ) put in this work.I suppose you can name it only by purchasing the CD and choose for yourself.I am not going to rate it less than 5 stars , it should earn 6 if i had the chance ... .	1
HEART OF STONE is a fine Cher album , although a bit dated now , it shows strength in her vocals that is masked underneath electronic beats on her newer material ( which is great too ) . The album has the mega Diane Warren hit & quot ; If I Could Turn Back Time & quot ; , who could forget that music video and the outfit ? Not to mention that it 's a great song . & quot ; Just Like Jesse James & quot ; is a nice midtempo ballad . It 's hard to explain but this album has a certain grittiness to it , and a rawness to it . There 's also some strong songwriting throughout the set . Other highlights include & quot ; Starting Over & quot ; , & quot ; You Would n't Know Love & quot ; , the title track , & quot ; After All & quot ; , and many others . Check it out if you have n't already !	1
I have Cher 's whole discograaphy sience 1987 , when she released her first Geffen record . They 're all great but definitely & quot ; Heart of stone & quot ; is the best.This album is from 1989 , it includes some of Cher 's biggest hits ever such as : & quot ; If I could turn back time & quot ; , & quot ; just like Jesse James & quot ; and & quot ; After all & quot ; next to Peter Cetera. & quot ; Heart of stone & quot ; became Cher 's first multi-million selling album , it sold over 3 million copies in the Us and it 's her best selling after her 1999 smash album & quot ; Believe & quot ; .Some of the song in this album were written by Diane Warren , one of the best song writers of all times , she writes song for singer such as : Michael Bolton , Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.Other hits of this album are & quot ; Kiss to kiss & quot ; , & quot ; Love on a rooftop & quot ; and the tittle it self .	1
HEART OF STONE is a strong effort from Cher . Her voice lends very well to these songs , and it 's a fairly consistent effort start to finish . The album opens with the mega hit & quot ; If I Could Turn Back Time & quot ; , a signature song for Cher . There 's a mix of a little of everything on here , from rock , to tender ballads . The feel of the album is very 80 's , definately because it 's from that era , but it 's still a solid sounding album . I enjoy the tender & quot ; After All & quot ; with Peter Cetera , the theme from CHANCES ARE . Other hits spawned from this album included & quot ; Heart of Stone & quot ; and & quot ; Just Like Jesse James & quot ; . My favorite tracks include & quot ; If I Could Turn Back Time & quot ; , & quot ; Starting Over & quot ; , & quot ; After All & quot ; , & quot ; Still In Love With You & quot ; , & quot ; Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore ? & quot ; and & quot ; Love On A Rooftop & quot ; . As other reviewers have pointed out , this is a good CD to start your Cher collection with . Not a bad CD to add to your collection .	1
a detailed drawing of a huge heart of stone , Cher sitting next to it ( with big hair ) and from a distance ... it all looked like a skull ! Some used-CD 's stores may have one festering in their bargain bins ( I found it on cassette ) . The music does n't reflect that original cover ( may be why they changed it ) : it 's power pop , heavy on lovelorn ballads . Very entertaining , but not exactly varied , colorful or substantial . Probably the best Cher from this period however , as & quot ; Cher & quot ; ( with & quot ; I Found Someone & quot ; ) and & quot ; Love Hurts & quot ; were slim on the hits . B+	1
For those who were introduced to Cher through her latest albums , & quot ; Believe & quot ; and & quot ; Living Proof & quot ; , & quot ; Heart of Stone & quot ; is probably the best of her & quot ; middle period & quot ; recordings . You hear her rock soul on this set , and yet you get diversity from a sort of country parody ( & quot ; Just Like Jesse James & quot ; ) , a kind of gospel rock number ( & quot ; Heart of Stone & quot ; ) , something tender ( The duet with Peter Cetera : & quot ; After All & quot ; ) , to the adult contemporary & quot ; If I Could Turn Back Time & quot ; .Along the way , you 'll incidentally hear song writer Diane Warren at her very best . She writes quite well for Cher in this album , with songs that lend themselves to Cher 's dramatic and rather sardonic delivery.All in all , if you 're a new Cher fan , I think you 'll be pleased with this , and if you 're an old Cher fan , you should already have it .	1
I bought this as a tape when I was in first grade and lossed it a while back , so I decided to buy it on CD . I forgot how much I loved this album ! All the songs are great and it includes some of her biggest hits like & quot ; If I Could Turn Back Time & quot ; , & quot ; Just Like Jesse James & quot ; and & quot ; After All ( theme from & quot ; Chances Are & quot ; ) & quot ; I also like & quot ; You Would n't Know love & quot ; , & quot ; Love on a Rooftop & quot ; and & quot ; Heart of Stone. & quot ; Her voice has really matured when this album came out . If you 're a fan of Cher 's 80 's work or a fan of Cher in general then this is a great album to start out with . Also reccomended is her other best work of the 80 's & quot ; Cher & quot ;	1
I gave up on Cher after this cd . Although her cd after this one called & quot ; It 's A Man 's World & quot ; was n't bad , & quot ; Heart Of Stone & quot ; and the previous self-titled & quot ; Cher & quot ; rate as two of the best things she has ever put out . I 've yet to hear anything she has done that can top those two rock cds . The current crop of dance music cds she is putting out ca n't even come close to to the classic rock music she was doing in the 80s . Her voice is more suited to rock than dance . Even the disco she did in the 70s was better than the forgettable current dance stuff she is doing now . Cher may be all about campy cheesy fun , but that woman can sure belt out a serious solid rock tune with the best of the other female rockers . I have n't bought a Cher cd since Heart Of Stone , and until she goes back to doing rock music i wo n't be . Buy & quot ; Heart Of Stone & quot ; and listen to Cher the way she was meant to be heard , not suffocated under processed and overproduced dance garbage .	1
I 've had this album for almost 10 years now , and it is still as great as the day I got it . This is a true classic . The more you listen , the better it gets . This album is for all music lovers , not just fans of jazz . 10 years later , and Pat Metheny is still the only jazz I like . He is truly a genius , and in a class by himself . I can not put into words the emotions that are brought out by listening to this album . It is some of the very best music that is out there , and that will ever be out there . If you do n't have this album yet , you are depriving yourself of some of the best music you will ever hear .	1
This is the classic , summer jazz that Pat is known around the world for . By this stage ( 1989 ) , he was well settled into his new label ( Geffen ) and the Power Station studio . Geffen brought out the optimism in Metheny 's music . ( If he 'd stuck with his previous label , the immaculately germanic ECM label , the album would have had a dreary monochrome cover and probably been called 'Telegram Bearing Seriously Grave Domestic News ' . ) This was the last studio album which stuck to the formula established with 'First Circle ' : nothing too aggressive , delight all the way , plenty to attract intelligent rock fans , encased in attractive Latin rhythms.The album kicks off the wonderful ensemble piece , 'Have You Heard ' . This piece seems to be the favourite Metheny tune covered by brass bands . It 's been covered by European youth orchestras , it 's been covered by the Bob Curnow LA Big Band . It transposes to these instruments really well.Pedro Aznar was back for this album , bringing his own gorgeous vocals to the 100 % classic 'Slip Away ' . Why was this never released as a single ? ? This is an excellent place to start in the Metheny portfolio -- a mid-term high spot in the career of the most important popular composer in the last quarter of the 20th century . Buy this , and then if you play piano or guitar , buy the extraordinarily-good-value Pat Metheny Songbook , which has nearly all these tunes in .	1
This album was very popular when released . The music is very melodic . It was played on Smooth Jazz stations in edited formats ( they cut out parts that did n't fit the smooth jazz format ) . That would make some classify this as smooth jazz . They are sadly mistaken.This recording is underrated and filled with so much subtlety that the point would be missed by many . Contained here is recording that contains some excellent pieces which are melodic , but effectively convey a vibe , with excellent soloing and arrangements.Pat 's displays a virtuosity in his playing without running away with himself . This recording 's influence is world beat . First class world beat seamless woven throught the Mays/Metheny conciousness . `` Have You Heard '' is simply one of the best pieces the group has composed and performed . It has aged well over the years . It has one of Pat 's very best solos and some impressive vocal work by Pedro Aznar who holds an impossibly long note toward the end . Pedro has to perform these difficult octave leaps throughout and he does so in good voice . `` Spring Ai n't Here is one of the pieces where the subtlety factor comes in . Pat 's solo here is excellent . He so beautifully embellishes the melody and also makes great use of space . This one has an intangible element for me that I ca n't lend words to . It so effectively conveys not a relaxed mood , as much as a languid vibe.45/8 is this short little piece that so effectively conveys a South American feel that you wish that it had been much longer just to see what they would 've done with it.5-5-7 is also is also another elegant piece which has an arrangement anchored by Steve Rodby 's amazing bass playing which fuels Metheny 's imagination throughout . Pat 's lead here is remarkable . `` Are We There Yet/Vidala '' is amazing the way they tie a modern electric piece to a folkloric and plaintive piece . They do this seamlessly and to perfection . `` Are We There Yet '' is for you Guitar Synth fans of Pat 's . The interplay between Pat and Lyle is if full force here . It 's one of those quirky pieces whose pacing makes it somewhat unique . The segue portion is ethereal . `` Dream of the Return '' is unique in that Pat rarely features a vocal with words . Aznar is the composer of these lyrics and they are thankfully , thoughtful . Good lyrics are hard to come by and often in instances where instrumental groups attempt them , they usually are pretty goofy . Not in this case though . This one has that patented tension and releast thing that the group does so well . A moving piece of music.My one complaint is that Pat tends to use the vocables a tad too much on certain songs like `` Better Days Ahead '' and `` Every Summer Night '' when the pieces do n't need them at all . Pedro Aznar is a talented multi-instrumentalist . Perhaps one of these other talents could 've been lent to these same pieces . He has a very good voice , but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.The group showed yet another fact of themselves and of a particular aspect of their exploration of world-beat themes . This one different than the preceding `` Still Life ( Talking ) '' and `` First Circle '' both of which are excellent , which embraced similar but distinct themes .	1
I can only use one word to express the feel on this incredible c.d . ENCHANTING ! ! Pats music is beyond explanation ... it has a deeply spiritual feel which is ethereal.These chaps are the best musicians around , they do n't get any better ! Practically every c.d he has done takes you to another zone , they are all like seperate & quot ; soundtracks to life on planet earth & quot ; ... but the Brazilian feel of this c.d and its partner , the equally brilliant & quot ; Still Life Talking & quot ; , is breathtakingly superb ! Every track on this c.d is stunning , although I first heard the track & quot ; Slip Away & quot ; back in 1992 and I felt myself going into a trance like state , carried away by its sheer beauty.All the musicians on his c.ds are SO talented.This is one guy who equally is n't afraid of being different and recording something as diverse as & quot ; Zero Tolerance For Silence & quot ; which , although it seemed strangely avant-garde , just was another extension of his personal character.Pat is like a talented chameleon . You have to be brave , at times , to follow his changes but the journey is really worth the effort !	1
I am a big Pat Metheny fan and have most of his work on CD . I am also a very picky musician when it comes to recording quality.Even if you already own this title , it is definitely worth purchasing again . The dynamics are new and wonderful ! I estimate an increase in `` Gain or Loudness '' to be about 25 % ... even more improvement on quiet , pensive tracks such as Letter from Home or Vidalia . The balance is maintained and not overly compressed.The reappearance of the stand-up bass and the dynamic sweetening of Pedro Aznar 's vocal stylings is what you 'll notice right away . Turn up your subwoofer a little bit and enjoy Steve Rodby 's masterful upright bass . The remaster also makes Pat 's adventures to the higher guitar octaves more smooth and less screechy than the older pressings.Ear candy at it 's best ! Get It !	1
She 'd been around for a decade already and , oddly enough only had a very few albums to show for it at the time . I am not sure if it created a situation wherin she really had n't developed as much but either way it did have a certain effect on her musically . In fact I 'd have to say that aside from songs such as the dub sounds of `` Love Is Gon na Bring Us Back Alive '' , the Chicago blues of `` Ghost Train '' and the atmospheric jazziness of `` Atlas Maker '' most of the songs on the album tend to be that same soft mixture of of jazz-pop and contemporary folk that she 'd used as her base since the beginning , although I must say the plucky `` Satellites '' and `` Ghetto Of My Mind '' , another dub/reggae influence tune are pleasant enough . She just does n't take any really serious creative detours here and seems to opt to play it a bit safe . The songs also drag on a bit much in lengh for their rather simple nature for another thing.Another thing I would 've thought she 'd done something about at this point is , in her lowest and highest vocal registers she has a tendency to be a little less than audible . I certainly understand soft female singers such as Sarah McLaughlin or Norah Jones . But there 's a fine line between being soft and inaudible and sometimes , just sometimes Rickie Lee crossess that line and it happens often enough on this album . So between the low energy level of the music and vocal performance on this album it 's definately not something I would recommend to first time Rickie Lee Jones listeners . It 's one of those albums you can slap on , listen to on a roadtrip or just enjoy in the backround but even with the production of Walter Becker everything from the sound to the music itself has a pressed down , flat sound to it . Again as with much of her work it did start a trend into the next decade with female singer/songwriters . But even so this did n't wind up being one of her most exciting albums in spite of the high quality of the songs themselves .	1
my only contact with the music of RLJ was thru the album MAGAZINE which i found to be disappointing.Well imagine my delight when i heard this collection as it is a gem of a disc.RLJ sounds as though she was having a ball and it shows.Not one dud track.Its an album that you can stick on and leave with confidence and you will want to play over and over again.There are some really lovely tracks here HORSES with its unforgettable guitar line , the gentle reading of GERRY and the PACEMAKERS'DONT LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYING'and the superb RODEO GIRL.At times RLJ does indeed sound very NYROESQUE but no way would that ever be a bad thing , believe me listening to this album is a real pleasure .	1
I love Rickie Lee Jones and did n't have Flying Cowboys . It 's an awesome CD . I got it for a good price , and I received it before the given date . Everything was done very professionally and I love the CD . Thank you .	1
Was glad to receive this and played it almost immediately . Within the last year I purchased the SHM CD from Japan of this title and that was an improvement over the domestic issue . This was a digital recording so I was not expecting a vast improvement . Immediately upon starting the Audio Fidelity version I knew this was even better than the SHM CD version . There was more life to it and more punch when punch was there . All around this was a much better sounding issue . Let 's hope Audio Fidelity continues to issue great sounding issues . Their recent Audio Fidelity release of Styx 's The Grand IllusionGrand Illusionwas not anywhere near as good as the Japanese SHM CD versionGrand Illusion ( Mlps ) ( Shm ) . I would like to see some sort of consistency here , whether it be Audio Fidelity or Japanese but at this point there does not seem to be any , the wallet is just getting lighter due to this . I would rather buy the Audio Fidelity product only but there are times when the Japanese import is vastly superior .	1
is this decording , cover included . Just her best . By the way , does anybody know when is she going to remaster her collection ? . Flying Cowboys has to be her most fullfilling comercial output , an a very good one at that . All the songs are very well crafted and performed with passion and heart ... Love it ...	1
With RLJ it always comes down to the songs . Her first 2 albums are classics and her work since then has been inconsistent but usually very good however she hasd never been able to hit the high water mark of those first 2 albums . As is the case with all of her albums , this one runs out of steam at the end . Here is a song by song rating:1 . The Horses - 52 . Just My Baby - 53 . Ghetto Of My Mind - 44 . Rodeo Girl - 45 . Satellites - 56 . Ghost Train - 47 . Flying Cowboys - 48 . Do n't Let The Sun Catch You Crying - 59 . Love Is Gon na Bring Us Back Alive - 410 . Away From The Sky - 311 . Atlas ' Marker - 3Recommended after you buy her first 2 albums .	1
There is a soft & endearing beauty to `` Night Ride Home '' that gets me everytime . With vivid imagery of Botticelli angels , questions of religion , & yearning for warmer weather , `` Night Ride Home '' remains an underrated masterwork . As always Joni expresses herself with those ravishingly perfect lyrics that are thought provoking & truly poetic . There are songs on simple acoustic guitar ( Passion Play , The Only Joy In Town , Night Ride Home , Etc . ) Wonderful synths ( Nothing Can be Done , Ray 's Dad 's Cadillac , Etc . ) & a welcomed return of piano on the truly breath-taking closer `` Two Grey Rooms '' a story of forlorn love . Joni yearns : '' You look so youthfulTime has been untruthfulHeaven knows I loved you30 years agoHot days , your shirt 's undoneRainy days , you runOh and then you fade so fastBelow my window . `` `` Night Ride Home '' is a wonderful journey . I happily ride shotgun with every listen .	1
No one made more impact on the sixties and early seventies folk-rock scene with her deeply personal songs than Joni Mitchell . So , when she returned to the same style and presentation after a long absence in the early nineties with this album , it certainly galvanized our collective consciousness by provocatively presenting a number of songs that are both representative of and yet quite superior to a lot of what she had done before . Here Joni presents a song writing that is both mature and serious , and yet showing her mischievous side with a few songs like `` Come In From The Cold '' , which is probably the most accomplished and popular of the tunes collected here.Yet we linger over other songs as well , such as the title cut of `` Night Ride Home '' , which is a memorable glimpse into her private and personal world with her husband in some moments alone out on the road . A lot of similar cues to her aversion to being a public personality are here ; the hope for quiet , the reference of `` no phones till Friday '' , etc . So , while this is no outrageously autobiographical tour of the state of her psyche as some previous albums had been , it does represent a return to her habit of speaking loudly and clearly about a number of personal and social issues she has in mind . Another memorable effort is `` Passion Play '' , with its provocative verses and interesting arrangement , and one must mention a quite lovely `` Nothing Can be Done '' . All of the songs make for a worthwhile listening experience.Of course , no one as observant and perceptive as Mitchell can help but make shrewd side remarks at the inanity of social circumstance or political happenstance along the way , and we laugh along while accompanying her on this soulful journey through the risky , crater-filled landscape of life in the nineties . This album marks a return to her classic form , and is an outstanding effort by one of the most captivating , surprising , and articulate talents in modern music . From the numbers mentioned above to her treatment of everything from original songs to a stunning interpretation of William Butler Yeats famous poem `` The Second Coming '' , this is filled with numbers you will be humming and singing along with . You will find yourself listening to it and shaking your head knowingly as you recognize her wisdom as she sings her way into the millennium . Enjoy .	1
I came to Joni Mitchell by way of her earliest folk music , so the & quot ; new Joni & quot ; featured on this album was a surprise to me ! Her voice has gotten SO SMOKEY - I hardly recognized her . And the overall sound of the album is so richly polished , smooth as a jazz club , and moist as dew on moss.This album is fabulous ! ( Once you get used to the change ) . It starts off with the sound of crickets , leads you through one multi-layered , full musical experience after another , and her new lower , rougher , but still expressive voice rocks you in a cradle of carefully written lyrics.This album , more than any of Joni 's others , is an EXPERIENCE OF MOOD . The low singing , the luscious production , the soothing beats all lend themselves to a feeling of moody comfort . The perfect album for , as the title suggests , a night ride home . Also the perfect album to accompany an after-work glass of wine by candlelight .	1
Like many reviewers have pointed out before , this record is very underrated . The songs are lyrically complex and musically simple , but in a very good way . I also noticed in many other reviews that people continuously pointed out `` Two Grey Rooms '' as being one of her greatest songs ever , and I 'd definietly agree . It 's such a beautiful and elegant song , the whole album is just very elegant and classy . `` Night Ride Home '' is simply wonderful !	1
Its great to see several cuts from NIGHT RIDE HOME featured on Joni'snew look back , & quot ; THE BEGINNING OF SURVIVAL & quot ; , ( being releasedJuly 27th ) . Although & quot ; TurbulentIndigo & quot ; received the Grammy and basically took itsblue print from & quot ; NIGHT RIDE HOME & quot ; , I really felt the warmthand devotion return with NRH , something I had missed from Joni 's works over the years after Mingus . Although I really enjoyed Turbulent Indigo , Night Ride Home is special , moody , sad at times but itshows the real Joni Mitchell that overproduction sometimeshit with its colder touches ( during the 80 's ) . I still listened to everything Joni putout but this underappreciated collection of songs hit me just at a timein my life where I was reflecting about life and this musicfrom Joni really touched me . She 's deeply spiritual , alwaysseeking answers yet always asking questions in her songs . I have listened to this over and over since its 1991 releaseand it still one of many Joni Mitchell classic favorites .	1
Take a singular artist who became known for her gossamer voice , throw in a few decades and a couple thousand cartons of cigarettes and what do you end up with ? Simply one of the most gorgeous CDs in her collection . It is wonderful to hear Joni 's voice now , it is so different than back in the '70s ... but it is definitely the same compelling , masterful instrument . As she has become older and her voice has deepened and grown a bit raspy , it has become downright haunting in places on this CD , like in `` Slouching Towards Bethlehem '' and my favorite `` Two Grey Rooms '' . Supporting this unique voice which , though wisely not chasing the shattering highs of years gone by , is still precise and versatile , is Joni 's surreal guitar and piano work . Supported by a smaller but familiar cast of expert musicians , `` NRH '' is one of the most beautiful , most mature , most objective CDs I 've heard in a long time . It is so hard to believe it came out over 15 years ago !	1
Joni Mitchell 's work is a stream of loving art , art that actually loves . 'Night Ride Home ' is an imcomparable CD , easily on a par with 'Dog Eat Dog ' , 'Turbulent Indigo ' , and 'Blue ' . Mitchell 's musicianship is like a night watchman , faithful and rare and so adeptly attuned . Everything she touches , when she really touches it , becomes the gold of our lifetimes . On this disc all the tracks are little wonders ; title track , 'Come In From the Cold ' , 'Passion Play ' , and 'Only Joy In Town ' are as fine as anything Mitchell 's written . Her musical art is so subtle , it gets overlooked , but so what ! Musicians know who and what she is , and what is genius . That 's too hearty a word for her layers of gifts , too rough a praise , but you get the picture ... I was listening to the string ideas in the back of 'Two Grey Rooms ' driving down the hill tonight -- what an almost Bert Kaempfert feel . I thought who IS this woman , really ? and how is it that her art is so fulsome , and plain wonderful ? Check out this CD and get some light for the night .	1
Let 's not forget , among the accolades for her songs , that Joni Mitchell really invented a new way to play the guitar with her use of exotic tunings and her signature playing style . Others have rightly praised the music and the poetry , but `` Night Ride Home '' is an also amazing guitar album . With her guitar is mixed right out front on NRH , you realize just what a singular musician she is.In fact , the musicianship throughout is top notch . Let 's face it : Joni never plays with slouches , and NRH is no exception , with Larry Klein , Wayne Shorter and Alex Acuna pitching in . Joni has always made great use of good bass players , and Klein 's playing syncs with her music almost ( just almost ! ) as well as Jaco 's did.Joni also made albums that were sonic wonders , wonderfully recorded and engineered , and here again NRH is a delight . Her restrained , tasteful use of synths reminds me somewhat of Daniel Lanois with that spacious , shimmering sound . Her use of her voice , layered many times , as a background `` instrument '' continues to amaze me after 30+ years . She truly towers over the landscape . If you like Joni but do n't have `` Night Ride Home '' , you 're missing out .	1
Here JM displays a new-found sense of balance and harmony in her life and music . Night Ride Home proves that the creative embers were glowing brightly again . Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal . Religious symbolism surfaces on Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem - the latter an adaptation of a Yeats poem . The topic of growing old , gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold , is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray 's Dad 's Cadillac , in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones , one of her followers . Savour these lines : & quot ; Ray 's dad teaches maths/I 'm a dunce , a decimal in his class/when it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic. & quot ; Well this is music - not maths - and Joni gets five out of five for composition and performance .	1
Historically , & quot ; Night Ride Home & quot ; has been called Joni Mitchell 's return to form . It was her first album in the 90 's and the aural atmosphere surrounding the songs seemed like a welcome relief from her turgid 80 's material . I have been and remain an avid fan ; even so , & quot ; Dog Eat Dog & quot ; and & quot ; Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm & quot ; are not particularly favorite 's of mine . So when & quot ; Night Ride Home & quot ; appeared it seemed as if Joni ( and Larry , of course ) had begun to feel that an uncluttered approach to her music was best . And they were right ! & quot ; Night Ride Home & quot ; is just another example of Mitchell 's stunning range as songwriter , guitar player and singer . The title track is a lovely ballad , all the more enjoyable since it reflects on a small cherished moment between Joni and Larry . Her reworking of Yeates ' & quot ; Slouching Toward Bethlehem & quot ; is terrific : her plaintive guitar work is surrounded by thunderous percussion and siren wails . It 's sense of the coming 'revelation ' is ominous . And who -- but Joni Mitchell -- would have the nerve ( and good sense ) to change Yeates ' original text ? & quot ; Come In From the Cold & quot ; offers Joni 's slightly middle-aged perspective on romance & amp ; relationships . Gone is the doomed folkie from & quot ; Blue & quot ; which kind of cast her as the & quot ; Sarah Bernhardt & quot ; of the '70s ; now she assumes a more mature and realistic ( while not overtly cheery ) stance on matters of the heart . Two songs regarding Joni 's childhood also appear : & quot ; Cherokee Louise & quot ; recounts the story of a sexually abused girlfriend while & quot ; Ray 's Dad 's Cadillac & quot ; concerns itself with slightly less weighty matters ( a la & quot ; In France They Kiss On Main Street & quot ; ) . Ironically , despite & quot ; Cherokee Louise & quot ; 's repugnant theme , Mitchell 's guitar work and percussion make the song a toe-tapper . & quot ; Night Ride Home & quot ; laid the groundwork for Mitchell 's next masterpiece , & quot ; Turbulent Indigo & quot ; . It is a fine collection of songs from a true master : strong , vibrant and immensely enjoyable .	1
Some people think that great , artistic pop essentially died with disco . This album negates such thought as an absolute assertion ; it deserves to be regarded in history as one of the very best non-classical albums of the last quarter of the 20th century . The lyrics to songs such as `` Come in from the Cold '' and `` Slouching Towards Bethlehem '' are tremendously arresting and thought-provoking , simply as poetry ; and the gorgeous harmonies and Wayne Shorter sax will make you forget that `` Cherokee Louise '' is about the terrible subject of child sex abuse , and `` The Windfall '' about a civil litigation system out of control ( really , a great theme song for insurance companies who want legislatures to restrict the ability of victims of medical malpractice to recover . The point being : as politics , this is garbage ; but as art , which is what we 're reviewing here , it 's interesting . Actually , it enhances the overall mood of the album , which is like a walk in a gloomy , humid rain forest , with foreboding lurking around the corner. ) . Joni Mitchell has always been regarded as a great lyricist above all , and a pioneer for such artists as Tori Amos , Ani DeFranco and Alanis Morrissette . Here , she is the master of that universe .	1
Who else but Joni Mitchell can create a song that takes you from your daylit , traffic bogged SUV to a country road at night with the stars above . That 's one of her strongest gifts -- transformation . Joni takes you places you 've never been before . `` Night ride home '' is one of her best .	1
is one of the finest songs I 've ever heard . & quot ; Tomorrow is Sunday , now there 's only one day left till you go by , below my window & quot ; I ca n't help but think of Leonardo DaVinci 's & quot ; window & quot ; he also utilized in his paintings , his theories of depth and distance on the perspective grid show up in this new generational poet 's work , wiht and in her words she weaves the same theories and philosophies with. & quot ; No one knows I 'm here , One day I just disappeared , And took I these two grey rooms up here , with a view , only when you walk by , below my window , when you walk by ... & quot ;	1
I 've recently been wanting to discover different types of music & artists from legendary female singers and Joni Mitchell was mentioned to me . I must admit , I knew who she was but never had the pleasure to experience her music until I picked `` Night Ride Home '' as my first Joni Mitchell album . Listening to this haunting album , I discovered her lyrics are extremely deep and complex , which is something a true artist/poet can only possess . Overall this is true art from a true poet , absolutely wonderful ! . Up next for me `` Blue '' and `` Hejira . ''	1
Night Ride Home was really a return for Joni Mitchell . She dropped almost all of the instruments that made her records released in the 80 's sound so overproduced . There are more acoustic tracks who focus on Joni and her guitar . The lyrics are again from a very high level , like her albums from the 70 's . Joni 's voice has matured incredible and now you can hear that because of the sparse instrumentation . But that 's not a complaint , because her voice sounds very cool and experienced by now . Absolute highlight of this album is Come In From The Cold , a song were Joni is looking back from the first time that she falls in love , to all the romance and relationships that have happened in her life . This is a great work from Joni Mitchell and if you love her more famous albums , you 're gon na love this one also .	1
This CD is full of smooth and laid back revivals of some melodies of the last 50 years , delivered in Rickie Lee Jones ' unique style . Her delivery can best be described as vulnerable , with her soft voice wavering and floating over the lyrics.Rickie 's version of the classic `` Hi-Lili Hi-Lo '' revives this work and she pulls off the line `` A song of love is a sad song , ask me how I know '' to great effect.Her version of `` Second Time Around '' seems real with her phrasing and pauses that seem almost conversational . `` I 'll Be Seeing You '' is mellow , with a clarinett complimenting every line . She ends with the sad line `` I 'll be looking at the moon but I 'll be seeing you . `` `` Bye Bye Blackbird '' comes across fun and jazzy . `` I Wo n't Grow Up '' comes across less Hollywood from the Frank Sanatra version from one of his movies . `` Love Junkyard '' is full of odd lyrics , testimony to the creativity and sarcasm of earlier generations.The CD ends with the very spooky and odd `` Comin ' Back to Me '' that sneeks up on you because she whispers before she sings . This final song haunts like a ghost as Ricki 's voice becomes mournful and almost deranged from loss of her lover as she sings `` I saw you coming back to me '' .A wonderfully mellow and even quality CD .	1
RLJ 's voicing may not be everybody 's cup o ' tea , but it works here . Supported by the musically eloquent Charlie Haden and Robbin Ford who provide the exquisite backing on Acoustic Bass and Classical Guitar ... check out their take on Jimi Hendrix 's Up From the Skies it 's wonderful . Tastefully done renditions of jazz standards decorate the landscape of the aural masterpiece . Enjoy .	1
As has been the case with me before , I bought this one not because of the artist herself , but because Charlie Haden plays on it , and I am a huge fan of his playing . But , Rickie 's performance just floored me . Listening to her sing & quot ; My one and only love & quot ; almost got me to tears . I mean , her voice cracks , fades into a whisper , then comes back up , she phrases somewhat unevenly - all these things sound like a technical analysis of her performance , and that 's what it is . But , if you forget about that , and just let her voice invade your heart , you will be moved . Her voice on this song alone is just THE most emotional vocal performance I have ever heard . Now , the rest of the album is not bad , mind you . The musicians are all top-notch , and the instrumentation is generally sparse - no big band , no loud drums or electric guitars . Just the pure sound of a few acoustic instruments supporting her unique voice . A beautiful , stark , un-glamorous little album that is just pure , naked emotion . It is not all sad , of course . The bouncy , upbeat & quot ; Dat Dere & quot ; provides a needed break from the & quot ; seriousness & quot ; of most of the other tracks . With this album I added another worthy female vocalist to my playlist . If you have not had a chance to hear Rickie , or just need a passionate performer that does not rely on production gimmicks or hype , give this one a spin .	1
When the question is asked , `` What pop singer did the best jazz standards covers , '' answers that tend to pop up are Linda Ronstadt and Rod Stewart . No , actually : Rickie Lee Jones ' `` Pop Pop '' is the one . I 'd give it 4 and 1/2 , in truth ; but the `` best of '' anything , no matter how esoteric , ultimately gets 5 in my book . The selections that stick with me are `` Love Junkyard , '' `` Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most , '' and `` My One and Only Love . '' Ms. Jones has a most interesting voice : at once playful and plaintive , worldly and coquettish . I 've heard slightly better covers of these done by Mark Murphy , Johnny Hartman and the New York Voices , among others : but if Rickie Lee Jones leads you to singers like Mark Murphy , Johnny Hartman and the New York Voices , she 's definitely worth the ride . As it is , this album is worth having . Recommended .	1
This CD is fantastic , not only do you get Olivia 's greatest hits , but 4 wonderfull new songs.I first heard & quot ; I need Love & quot ; driving back from Florida.I thought this song was so different , about not having sex untill you truely love someone , and also being worried about Aids.I really believed this record was going to be a huge hit for Olivia.She was ready to tour untill she discovered she had breast cancer. & quot ; Deeper than a river , & quot ; was a hit in the Adult charts , and & quot ; Not Gon na Be the one , & quot ; that sounds alot like the Bee Gee 's , are fantastic new songs also.This one CD has it all , from Olivia 's begining when she was into country music , to one of the greatest musicals of all time , & quot ; Grease , & quot ; to Olivia 's biggest hit , & quot ; Physical , & quot ; and these four beutifull new songs.You have to get this CD if your a Olivia Newton John fan .	1
nowadays , an album released in one country could omit or add tracks when released in other countries . luckily , `` olivia newton-john 's back to basics : the essential collection '' was released in the philippines with 20 tracks ! the cd is made in germany and the tracks are:01. if not for you02 . banks of the ohio03 . what is life04 . take me home country roads05 . honestly love you06 . haveyou never been mellow07 . sam08 . you 're the one that i want09 . hopelessly devoted to you10 . summer nights11 . a little more love12 . xanadu13 . magic14 . suddenly15 . physical16 . the rumour17 . not gon na be the one18 . i need love19 . i want to be wanted20 . deeper than a riverthe tracks seemed chronological as the albums where the tracks came from are featured in the sleeve cover . all the new tracks are tucked in the end . reading the reviews of fellow amazon.com customers , complaining about the missing tracks , i feel sorry that they were not able to get the european version.for a more comprehensive track listing , `` gold '' which is a 2-disc greatest hits was also released . you may grab that instead of this collection.in brief , this essential collection is really great and a amazing retrospect of olivia 's multi-platimum career !	1
Despite starting with folk and country roots , Olivia Newton-John came to the forefront with her relocation to North America and retooled herself to more pop standards , despite winning a Grammy for Best Country Female Vocal for & quot ; Let Me Be There. & quot ; No , there was one more Grammy to be won , and that was Record of the Year ( 1974 ) for the tearful heartfelt piano and strings & quot ; I Honestly Love You , & quot ; definitely the best song here.That was from the If You Love Me , Let Me Know album , and the country title track is also included . The basso male backing vocalist provide a good balance with Olivia 's winsome pop vocals.As for the rest , it 's the requisite collection of hits , of which there are plenty , as well as four new songs . The first one was penned and co-produced by Diane Warren , showing she has something in her magic pen for O N-J . & quot ; Deeper Than A River & quot ; belongs squarely in the 80 's tradition of dreamy pop ballads , complete with synthesizers and strings. & quot ; Not Gon na Be The One & quot ; could easily belong on one her Totally Hot album , as there are similarities to this and & quot ; A Little More Love. & quot ; Produced by her longtime producer John Farrar.Her cover of Brenda Lee 's # 1 hit , & quot ; I Want To Be Wanted , & quot ; -- who does n't want to be ? -- is my favourite of the four new songs here , showing her ability to put forth great ballads have n't diminished with her Grammy winner . And with Peter Asher ( Peter of Peter and Gordon ) as producer , how can she go wrong ? & quot ; I Need Love & quot ; is 80 's soul/pop and synth fills set to a funky bass backbeat , with some monologue thrown in . In an ironic reference to an earlier hit , she sings that she holding out for something more than physical . Clearly it 's something more permanent : & quot ; I 'm not looking for a bandaid on loneliness. & quot ; Are n't we all ? And this is the most un-Moroder sounding Giorgio Moroder production I 've heard.In a twist of fate , many of her best-known songs turned out to be soundtrack hits . And because of that , N-J gets tarred with the epithet 70 's cheese when many are asked to classify her . Two of them were from Grease , both duets with John Travolta . The bouncy & quot ; You 're The One That I Want , & quot ; penultimate number in the movie with the catchy bass setting the rhythm of the song , and a big hit in the US , spent nine weeks at the top in England . & quot ; Summer Nights , & quot ; a song placed clearly in the musical genre , also went to # 1 in the UK . The other # 1 , & quot ; Xanadu , & quot ; is not on there , but & quot ; Magic & quot ; also from that movie , is.Of the other movie tracks , the fast-paced pop of & quot ; Twist Of Fate , & quot ; from Two Of A Kind , her second teaming up with Travolta , with its racing electropop bass synth and fuzzy guitar , definitely shows her staying power in 1983 , and as far as this collection went , as material from Soul Kiss and The Rumour are excluded . The other , from Grease , is her soaring strings and steel guitar ballad , & quot ; Hopelessly Devoted To You , & quot ; showing a mixture of pop and country instruments.In the US , one of her last gasps at greatness was the smart and punchy title track to her & quot ; Physical & quot ; album , but singles like thatand lines like & quot ; let 's get physical/let me hear your body talk & quot ; showed her embracing the naughty Sandy side of her . Small wonder the album cover , showing her flushed from an exercise workout , was mistaken for ... well , physical things.From Do n't Stop Believin ' ( 1976 ) comes the melting strings ballad & quot ; Sam. & quot ; And from the previous year , & quot ; Have You Never Been Mellow ? & quot ; taken from the album of the same name , was a leisure mid-paced number with strings , and showed Olivia adding her two cents to the feminist bandwagon : & quot ; someone else be strong & quot ; or & quot ; comfort from inside , & quot ; reflecting the inner spotlight people began turning on in the 70 's . Another song from that album is the country tune & quot ; Please Mr. Please , & quot ; a pleading request to someone not to play a certain song for fear of being reminded of a past love.Despite the subtitle 1971-1992 , the earliest songs here date from 1974 's If You Love Me , Let Me Know . For a first-time listen at Olivia , much recommended , and if you love her stuff , let me know . If not , let her be .	1
I have to say that for an unremastered album , the sound quality of this cd is remarkably good ! I can only imagine how much better this would be if they would remaster it and make this a 20 track collection as I agree with most of the other reviewers here that some truly essential tracks are missing . That , I suppose , is inevitable given the volume of ONJ 's work and the ability to only put so many tracks on one disc . Which is why I 'm more forgiving of this version of her best of tracks and I 'm going to say that the tracks here are a very good selection by themselves and there are 4 new tracks as well . ONJ has been very lucky in that she has had great songwriters write for here like John Farrar and great producers as well like David Foster enhancing her sound . There really is n't a weak track here and my favourites that are real gems of songwriting and performance are `` Magic '' ( the great guitar harmonics still gives me goosebumps everytime ) , `` A Little More Love '' ( one of the best bass lines ever composed ) `` Sam '' ( a great love song and written by one of the original members of the Shadows ! ) '' Have You Never Been Mellow '' and `` I Honestly Love You '' This is a very good ONJ compilation and for the price , 17 great track selections and surprisingly good sound quality a great bargain indeed . Highly recommended .	1
A good collection of Olivia 's classic pop songs , along with 4 newly recorded ones . & quot ; Deeper than a river & quot ; is a Diane Warren song , not a bad song , but I do n't think it 's one of Diane 's best . The rest of the songs are culled from 8 of Olivia 's previous albums . Of the new songs , my favourite is & quot ; I want to be wanted & quot ; ... a lovely ballad . It 's too bad her comeback did n't happen as expected , but at least we have this album .	1
This CD hs four new songs by ) olivia . The old songs are the best You 'll love this CD .	1
I was glad to see a CD that , at least partially , combines the previously-available Greatest Hits Vol . 1 and Vol . 2 to span Olivia 's entire career . I wish Geffen had n't limited the selection to 13 hits ( plus 4 increasingly-less- & quot ; new & quot ; songs ) ; however , I 'd say they picked most of the best 13 . I was pleased to see & quot ; Deeper Than The Night & quot ; and & quot ; Sam & quot ; among the more-famous songs , but all of these are wonderful . ( Note : I was 13 when & quot ; Grease & quot ; came out . I may not be objective . ) It pained me to see & quot ; I Need Love & quot ; stop at the bottom of the pop chart ; produced by Giorgio Moroder ( producer of most of Donna Summer 's classic hits ) , it had a great sound and lyric ( & quot ; I 'm not looking for a Band-aid on loneliness ... & quot ; ) .Olivia deserves a 2-disc set . Import versions of this CD include & quot ; The Rumour & quot ; ( fantastic ; written by Elton John ) and & quot ; If Not For You & quot ; , among others . The latter 's exclusion from the U.S. version is peculiar because it 's actually from 1971 . Its absence means this CD should be called & quot ; Essential ... '74-'92 & quot ; .Also among the missing are & quot ; Let Me Be There & quot ; , & quot ; Make A Move On Me & quot ; , & quot ; Heart Attack & quot ; , & quot ; Xanadu & quot ; ( with E.L.O . ) , & quot ; Soul Kiss & quot ; , & quot ; Livin ' In Desperate Times & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Stop Believin ' & quot ; , & quot ; Suddenly & quot ; ( with Cliff Richard ) , and a bunch more . Maybe someday these will turn up on an & quot ; Essential Collection , Vol . 2 & quot ; . This is why I kept my vinyl ...	1
the 4 newer songs on this must have release are awesome olivia - unfortunately personal problems hurt the success of the & quot ; comeback & quot ; . luckily a few years later we have & quot ; back with a heart & quot ; classic olivia and a tour ! fate twists back ! & quot ; not gon na be the one & quot ; is a definite should 've been hit and she should consider re-cutting it for her next cd . & quot ; i need love & quot ; is a great dance song and the ballads soar . plus you get most of the classics - what more could we ask for but another new album !	1
nothing like a sweet voice to stop road rage . how can you get angry listening to something so mellow ! ! ! ! SWEET	1
Before Madonna or Lauper , it was Olivia . ONJ ruled her time period with hits like `` Hoplessly Devoted To You '' , `` Magic '' , and a hot song called `` Let 's Get Physical '' , very racy for back then . `` You 're The One That I Want '' is another one sung on Grease . If you grew up in the 70 's , you know and love this woman 's music . Highly recommended !	1
Olivia Newton-John 's career can neatly be encapsulated in a few separate phases : early pop/country hits ( `` I Honestly Love You , '' `` Have You Never Been Mellow '' ) , a big splash in a cheesy movie ( `` Grease '' ) with the corresponding hits , the sexy pop hits that followed ( `` Physical '' , `` A Little More Love '' ) followed by a gradual exit from the charts . ( Sounds a lot like Sheena Easton - I suppose `` Miami Vice '' could substitute for `` Grease '' ) .I could easily put together two or three CDs worth of chart hits from Newton-John , but Geffen Records did n't offer me the chance , so this one-CD mishmash , featuring virtually no liner notes whatsoever , will have to suffice . It 's missing some pretty good songs ( `` Suddenly , '' `` Heart Attack '' ) and some not-so-great ones ( `` Soul Kiss , '' `` Tied Up '' ) , but they bagged most of the good ones , including `` Twist of Fate , '' which had basically been unavailable to those who did n't think to buy the `` Two of a Kind '' soundtrack on CD . Four nondescript songs recorded for this CD are included as well . This covers virtually all of her career , and most fans will accept it as such.Late note : Universal 's `` Magic - The Very Best of Olivia Newton-John '' now supercedes this set , as it includes all of these songs ( save the four newly recorded tunes ) and adds `` Let Me Be There , '' `` Heart Attack , '' `` Make a Move on Me , '' `` Xanadu , '' and `` Suddenly . ''	1
This CD is a great collection of Olivia 's greatest hits . Although it is far from complete , and does n't include some of her live favorites ( such as & quot ; Do n't Cry for Me , Argentina & quot ; ) , it still encapsules some of her finest moments , from the early country/pop to the later straight-forward rock/pop that made her a star .	1
I have always loved Olivia Newton John as a singer and actress . A little more love touched my heart and I honestly love you , I still listen to the song everyday . When I first heard I honestly love you , I contacted the radio station to dedicate it the person I loved and always will . Love does not go away . Thanks Olivia !	1
LISTEN UP JACKYL IS NOT FOR EVERYONE . I 'LL STATE THAT UP FRONT . BUT IF YOUR UP TO SOME GOOD OLE SOUTHERN ROCK AND ROLL DESIGNED TO GET YOUR BLOOD UP JACKYL IS THE CURE .

IVE SEEN THEM MANY TIMES AND THEY ALWAYS KICKED THE AUDIENCE 'S BUTT . JESSE JAMES DUPREE IS THE ULTIMATE FRONT MAN WHILE THE REST OF THE BOYS JUST FLAT OUT PLAY TO THE CROWDS . MOST OF THE TIME EVERYONE IS SINGING ALONG WHILE THE WOMEN GENERALLY GET HYPNOTIZED INTO SOMEHOW START REMOVING CLOTHING THATS A BONUS AT MOST CONCERTS WHILE KINDA THE NORM AT A JACKYL CONCERT.THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE ROCKER LIKE NOTHING ELSE PURE SEXUAL SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE ROCK N ROLL . NEVER HEARD JACKYL ? THEN YOU NEED TO I DARE YA TO . NEVER SEEN JACKYL THATS EASY , GO TO YOUTUBE SEE FOR YOURSELF WHY THEY ARE ALWAYS WELCOME AT VENUES . MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT JACKYL IS THAT WHEN WAL-MART REFUSED TO SELL THEIR CD DUE TO THE SEXUAL CONTENT JACKYL PULLS OUT A IMPROMTU CONCERT ON A FLAT BED TRUCK IN THE PARKING LOT OF A MERRIETTA GA. WALMART . TALK ABOUT SOME BALLS NOW THATS IN YOUR FACE ! THIS VIDEO IS ALSO ON YOUTUBE CHECK IT OUT . REMEMBER `` ROCK ME , ROLL ME , JACKYL ME OFF ! ``	1
This is the album to have ! The hard driving riffs and great catchy tunes make this almost seem like its a greatest hits album and hard to beleive its a debuet album ! If only & quot ; locked and loaded & quot ; & quot ; push & quot ; & quot ; Kill the sunshine & quot ; & quot ; I hate you Bin Larden & quot ; where on this , it would be there greatest hits all on one ! !	1
If you are a southern hard rock fan , this is a terrific band for you to try out ... as long as you are n't offended by explicit lyrics or content , that is . More conservative people will NEVER allow their children to listen to or buy this album ! Jackyl is pure southern orneryness , or , hard rocking music with a southern rock flair , and they are unabashedly horny , lewd , rude , crude and socially unacceptable and , there , not for the faint of heart ! But for those who appreciate them for who and what they are and get a kick out of what they have to say , hey , go out and buy their music because they wo n't disappoint . They are actually very nice southern born and raised guys who love and appreciate all of their fans and the fan support they receive . Me and my wife actually got to meet them at Rock USA Oshkosh 2013 because at the close of their show they announced they would be in the merch tent and wanted to meet and greet all of their fans who wanted to meet them . I think they stood in the merch tent for at least three , if not four , hours , shaking hands , getting pictures taken , signing autographs , and when my wife told Jesse James Dupree she was a huge Jackyl fan , he put his hand over his heart and then planted a huge kiss on her cheek , and so did another band member , although she did n't know which one . That 's what I mean about them really loving their fans ! I really think you will love their music .	1
To this day , this record stands as a high for straight-up , no-nonsense hard rock . Plus , it has what may be the coolest cover ever . And it uses a chainsaw as a musical instrument . Effectively , I might add.There is a strong AC/DC-tinged blues influence here . The Jackyl sound is also heavily influenced by its southern location , especially evident in Jesse James Dupree 's powerful and accent-laden voice . This is mixed with a heavy guitar tone to create a truly unique , instantly recognizable sound.Though each and every track on this record is well-done , catchy and worthy of being a single , by far the most noticeable song is `` The Lumberjack . '' Its basic construction is nothing new : an elementary , clich & eacute ; d blues progression played at a relaxed swing tempo . What puts it over the top is the chainsaw solo.Yes , a chainsaw solo . A bluesy chainsaw solo , cohesive , catchy and played in time . It is recreated outstandingly at concerts.This became a defining trait of a Jackyl record : each album since has featured a `` chainsaw song . '' Perhaps the only one to top `` The Lumberjack , '' though , was `` Headed for Destruction , '' from their sophomore release Push Comes to Shove . ( In this track , they used a talk box to make it sound like the chainsaw was reciting the lines of the chorus . ) Also , the song itself was a bit more original , with riffs instead of the clich & eacute ; blues pattern . But I digress . `` The Lumberjack '' was unprecedented , and it forced people to listen.The rest of the record is filled with southern rock ` n ' roll attitude , minus the confederate flags of Lynyrd Skynyrd or Pantera . There are songs about booze ( `` Brain Drain '' ) , sex ( `` Dirty Little Mind '' ) and all-around being a `` Redneck Punk . '' The uncensored 11-track version of the album culminates in the album 's one low point , the juvenile , almost comically profane `` She Loves my C -- - . `` The tamed-down 10-track version , however , is nearly perfect : it is concise , catchy , loud and fun . Underrated as it is nowadays , it is a worthwhile addition to the CD collection of any hard rock fan . It 's highly unlikely ( though they did come close with Relentless ) , but hopefully Jackyl will one day make another record as good as its debut .	1
This is a pretty good album . My dad had this on tape but I found the CD of it at a record store for a 1.99 . My favorite songs on here are This Wheel 's on Fire , The Passenger , Peek-A-Boo , Kiss Them For Me , and Dear Prudence . The music is very relaxing and I enjoy it .	1
This is a great introduction to this truly talented band . Chockful of all thier greatest songs from 1982 or so forward , All thier classics are included here . Not a weak cut among the bunch as far as I am concerned .	1
Of all the albums , cassettes , compact discs that I have owned and loved over the years , one of my top five personal favorite cds of all time is Siouxsie & The Banshees ' `` Twice Upon a Time : the Singles '' . I was a freshman in college when I discovered Siouxsie & The Banshees over a decade ago . This was my earliest exposure to goth music . Little did I know was just how big of an impact the tape version of this greatest hits collection would have on me . I was having a horrible time during my freshman year in college . I felt like an outcast and Siouxsie 's music came at the perfect time . I was drawn in by the melancholy lyrics and evocative music . I now own this collection on cd and the music still sounds fresh to me . No matter how many times I have listened to it , I still love `` Cities in Dust '' , my favorite Siouxsie song of all time . Got ta love the band 's interpretation of The Beatles ' `` Dear Prudence '' . All of the songs on the cd is timeless . The production on the cd could use a remastering job but other than that , I love this cd . It is a great representation of the band during the '80s .	1
I remember the first time I heard & quot ; Twice Upon a Time : The Singles & quot ; in my freshman year in college almost ten years ago . I absolutely loved the haunting vocals of Siouxsie Sioux . It had become one of my personal favorite albums of all time , not to mention most influential album ever . I was struggling to fit in at the school I was attending at the time and & quot ; Twice Upon a Time & quot ; was my personal saviour . I really could relate to the lyrics to & quot ; Fear ( of the Unknown ) & quot ; and & quot ; Face to Face & quot ; . I absolutely adored & quot ; Cities in Dust & quot ; ( which I still do to this day ) . I played & quot ; Cities in Dust ' so much that I wore out that song on the cassette version of & quot ; Twice Upon a Time & quot ; . I still love listening to Siouxsie wail on & quot ; This Whee 's On Fire & quot ; and & quot ; The Passenger & quot ; . I love Siouxsie 's version of those two particular songs even more so than the original versions . The band 's cover of The Beatles ' & quot ; Dear Prudence & quot ; is great too . I think the only song I do not care for ( and still do ) is & quot ; Peek-A-Boo & quot ; . I personally find the lyrics a bit silly and the beat of the music annoying . Overall I love the rest of this album . I now own the cd version so I do n't have to worry about wearing it out so quickly . I definitely have to agree that this album is an essential album to own . It is a reminder why Siouxsie & amp ; The Banshees ' music will always remain timeless unlike most acts today .	1
This collection is great for many reasons . First of all it 's 18 tracks , and that 's pretty sweet . It also covers more ground than their previous singles album did , including their most popular era . The hits here would be & quot ; Kiss Them For Me & quot ; , which was probably their biggest one , and also & quot ; Peek-A-Boo & quot ; , & quot ; Cities In Dust & quot ; , & quot ; The Killing Jar & quot ; , and & quot ; Fear ( of the unknown ) & quot ; . Plus there 's the covers of & quot ; The Passenger & quot ; ( Iggy Pop ) , and & quot ; Dear Prudence & quot ; ( Beatles ) , as well as & quot ; Face To Face & quot ; from the Batman Returns soundtrack , and numerous other great tracks like & quot ; Slowdive & quot ; , & quot ; Swimming Horses & quot ; , and & quot ; Dazzle & quot ; . There 's also of course the 10 track & quot ; Once Upon A Time & quot ; collection , which is the real early , more punk stuff , but this one is & quot ; Twice & quot ; as nice . They also have a career-spanning 15 track & quot ; Best Of & quot ; , which misses some songs from this , but includes & quot ; Hong Kong Garden & quot ; and & quot ; Stargazer & quot ; , among others .	1
You would normally think chick vocals do n't fit with & quot ; goth & quot ; music , but Siouxsie does just the opposite . She has a good voice that is never overdone behind somewhat-but-not-totally-gloomy guitars . & quot ; Kiss them for me & quot ; is really for me the oldest song I know by them , & amp ; I 'm just now getting to know their older stuff . & quot ; Cities in Dust & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; This Wheel 's on Fire & quot ; have become my favorite tracks on the cd . Just be prepared to probably listen to the first half of the cd over & amp ; over before ever getting to the end of the cd , as that 's what I did .	1
I bought her lps back in the day . Wow . A trip down memory lane . And I find I like her more today ... hear new things in her music . So talented ... compared the [ ... ] on the radio and in the cd racks . Good pedigree too as connected to Sex Pistols and the Cure . If you like good English rock/punk with original vocals , start here !	1
I have to admit that I got in Siouxsie & amp ; the Banshees later that most people . I have been a new-wave and synth-pop freak for 15+ years . I am a die hard Cure fan and have been for many many years . I never got myself into listening to Siouxsie for some strange reason , but my X-girlfriend exposed me to them , and I have to say , WOW ... ... ... I had been missing out on some serious music and an stunning voice . This album was the perfect way to get me into the band . It has it all , maybe not their very early punk stuff but you can always get the & quot ; Once Upon a Time & quot ; album and have the best of that era . No female artist has Siouxsie 's voice , NO ONE ... ... ..Her voice sends chills down my spine from its mesmerizing beauty . She has the voice of an angel . Evey song is breath taking . Some of my favorates include & quot ; Dazzle & quot ; , & quot ; Cities In Dust & quot ; , & quot ; This Wheel 's On Fire & quot ; , & quot ; The Passenger & quot ; , & quot ; Kiss Them For Me & quot ; , & quot ; Fear ( Of The Unknown ) & quot ; , and my all time favorate & quot ; Face To Face & quot ; . From this album , I started buying all their others . Be aware , Siouxsie & amp ; the Banshees are very addictive .	1
Siouxsie Sioux is one of my favorite female gothic vocalists of all time ! My favorite song on this album , `` Cities In Dust '' , was aired alot on German television in the mid 1980 's . After the Banshees broke up , Sioux and Budgie carried on recording as The Creatures.Her unique , versatile musical style makes this a five star album .	1
In 1995 Lisa Loeb had a huge hit with the off-beat folk/rock song `` stay . '' That song was so different from the ` radio formula ' that it was a surprise success . I personally was surprised at the success but `` stay '' was and still is a very catchy song . There was no chorus , no verse by verse lyric formula but you could n't get it out of your head . You also could n't deny Lisa Loeb 's charm . On TAILS it 's evident - Lisa is confused.She comes across as an awkward , nerdy , teenager with a cute voice . Lisa also seems downright scatter-brained with her lyrics . The songs seem like jumbled diary entries that forces the listener to take note . For instance , check out `` when all the stars were falling . '' She sings `` when all the stars were falling/I reached up like you said/all the stars were falling/one hit me in the head . '' HUH ? Else where Lisa confesses that she likes her man smelling like sandalwood ( `` sandalwood '' ) .TAILS is lyrically strange but it 's quite possibly one of the best folk/rock/alternative CDs out there . It 's filled with Lisa undeniable charm and awkwardness . It 's one of those offbeat CD 's that you ca n't help but play once in a while . It 's enjoyable . `` Stay '' is by far the best song on TAILS . Other highlights include `` do you sleep ? `` , `` rose-colored times '' , `` sandalwood '' , `` alone '' and `` waiting for Wednesday . `` TAILS is a unique take on 90 's rock/alternative/folk . It 's acoustic guitar driven with electric guitar undertones . When I first saw Lisa in the `` do you sleep ? '' video , I thought `` who 's that girl with the big guitar ? '' Now I know . This CD does n't quite match up to the charm and emotion of `` stay '' but it comes close at times . All in all TAILS tells an interesting story .	1
she kinda reminds me of daria . i love her lyrics , so poetic and insightful . i think it 's best to listen to her albums as complete units rather than just individual songs ... i like it that her records sell and yet she can remain who she is ... you cant go wrong with anything she makes . a thinking man 's sex symbol ...	1
Lisa Loeb 's first major album with her band Nine Stories , titled TAILS , is an excellent album on so many levels . It 's one of those CD 's you can listen to anytime , and it just speaks mountains to you , or it makes you want to sing along with it . Lisa 's first single & quot ; Stay & quot ; , which was on the Reality Bites soundtrack , was the first song to go to # 1 by an independant artist who had no record label . It 's also on TAILS . & quot ; Do You Sleep & quot ; is another winner . The instruments are used well in this album . Composing and performing songs that combine effervescent pop with the lyricism of a skilled storyteller , Lisa Loeb is one of contemporary music 's most sumptuous delights . The CD has not even one filler track . Other highlights include & quot ; It 's Over & quot ; , & quot ; Snow Day & quot ; , & quot ; Rose Colored Times & quot ; , & quot ; Waiting For Wednesday & quot ; , & quot ; Alone & quot ; and the ever poignant & quot ; Hurricane & quot ; . Check this out for something new !	1
Ooh ... Lisa Loeb 's first album 'Tails ' is by far her best album . I love the style . Great rock with her vocals just seems unreal . I never thought I 'd find someone like Lisa Loeb but I did . At first , I did n't want to give her a chance because her single 'Stay ' was overplayed at the time and I was n't into that kind of music . YEARS later I decided to give her another try . I 'm so glad I did . The songs are relatively simple but hold a lot of meaning and most people can relate to the lyrics . I love 'Do You Sleep ' , 'Taffy ' and 'Snow Day ' . It 's a great album .	1
With music in general , & esp . with certain artists , it 's value is far more in the beholder than in the item . Some are acquired tastes , perhaps , but IMHO most either produce a strong response in the listener -- or not . I think ( esp . if one reads the personal reviews ) this is certainly true of Lisa Loeb & this album . She reminds me a bit of Jewel & Amy Grant in tone . To Lisa 's credit , she writes her own material . I 'm not that big on her presentation ( though I do like `` Stay '' ) . I seem to like her lyrics better than most reviewers do . Indeed , it seems to me she could have published these `` songs '' as poems . There 's certainly enough angst in them ! But , the music sometimes does n't seem to quite fit the words . Further , most of the tunes seem somewhat similar to each other IMHO . But , if you are a REAL FAN , this is wonderful . If you 're not , it 's not so wonderful . That 's why there 's chocolate , vanilla , & ...	1
Lisa Loeb 's 1995 Tails album was very well anticipated after that 1994 megahit Stay . It lived up to all the hype . Very solid pop songs and excellent songwriting from Lisa . She has managed to stay in the spotlight for a decade making very solid songs and albums that she chooses to do . I wanted Do You Sleep to have the same kind of airplay and huge response that Stay did , keep that momentum going . Wanted it to go to No . 1 too , but it peaked at No . 18 . Actually , adult contemporary stations liked that song more than the pop stations . She rocks on several songs on the second half and takes no prisoners . Loeb is one of the '90s best songwriters and this album proved that .	1
Tails encapsulated the promise of Lisa Loeb , who made the big time with a hit single `` Stay '' off of the Reality Bites movie soundtrack . The other hit off of the CD was `` Do You Sleep ? `` , but the other tracks off of the disc are well-written and executed , speaking of relationship perils of successes , sometimes with a sense of humour . Lisa 's star has n't stayed as high since the release of this disc , but in part that 's attributable to the change in the music landscape that occurred at the turn of the millennium , as MTV turned the pop culture sheep away from alternative rock and Lilith Fair music towards hip-hop , and ( sadly ) themselves away from playing videos and towards Punk 'd . Tails is definitely worth a listen , if you were a fan of music of that time .	1
In an effort to expand my collection of women 's music I purchased this CD based solely on recommendations here . I have had no regrets ! This CD is very good . It took several listens for me to get hooked but once that happened I have found myself reaching for this CD to play almost everyday . I was acquainted with two of the songs from the radio years ago : 'Stay ' and 'Do You Sleep ? ' but others are just as good if not better . 'Snow Day ' is high energy and I often play air guitar when nobody is watching . I will definately look into buying her other CD .	1
OK.. I 'm shallow . I was watching $ 25,000 Pyramid when Lisa and Dweezel were guest contestants . I thought to my self , & quot ; Wo , she 's really good looking. & quot ; I remembered liking that video where she walks around the apartment in one long shot and wondered if she had any chops other then cool glasses . So I started pickin up used CD 's when I could find them and was moving in a Lisa fan direction . This one sealed the deal . Smart musician , with a unique pocket . She just got prettier ... ..	1
... this CD is great . It is full of songs you want to bob your head to , sit and contemplate , and dance a little jig to . Be on the look out for Lisa Loeb new , THIRD album called , `` CAKE AND PIE '' scheduled to come out February 26th 2002 in the US . It is EXTREMELY GOOD ! I think it is right up there with this CD , `` TAILS . ''	1
this album is a classic ! genius gza is one of the best wu members out of the whole clan the best songs on liquid swords are ( 4th chamber , liquid swords and swordsman ) i highy recommend this album !	1
The title is true . Most of this album are battle raps -- and it does n't disappoint , at all . There 's not a lot to say at this point , so let 's break it down ... We start off with the title track , which I think is one of the best RZA beats . The lyrics are so hard hitting . Its an addictive song , that 's sure . And the intro ... well , its weird , as most of the samples from the movie . Standout . 10/10 '' Duel of the Mic '' is one of the best Wu-tang track with group members that 's not on a group album . Again , a standout . 9/10 '' Living in the World Today '' is a great track , but not really a stand out for me . 8.5/10We then come to `` Gold '' , which is a spectacular song . Hard-hitting beat , rhymes and great flow from this GZA solo . 10/10 '' Cold World '' is another RZA that 's unskippable . GZA gives us an amazing verse with Inspectah Deck showing us why he can outshine someone . 10/10 '' Labels '' . Hmm ... well , yes the song mentions a lot of labels , there 's a lot of name dropping ... its REAL annoying ! WAIT WAIT ... ITS ONE OF THE CREATIVE SONGS EVER MADE . `` And if you ai n't boned a mic you could n't hurt a bee/That 's like going to Venus driving a MERCURY '' and `` slave of a mental death MC do n't panic/Throw that A & R ; n***a off the boat in the ATLANTIC '' are just some of the many amazing lines that GZA drops ... just stopping for a chorus or a hook -- nearly 50 bars of straight sickness . Can not be rated due to greatness/10 '' 4th Chamber '' is on the same note as `` Duel of the Mic '' . But this time , its even greater with no chorus or hook . Ghost shows us why he was picked to be on OB4CL with Raekwon . Killah Priest shows us , even know he is n't in one of the greatest groups in hiphop , he can still spit some crazy lines . `` Clutch they fists/ and throw up signs like a Crip/And throw all types of fits/I leave 'em split/like a** cheeks and ragged p***y lips '' . RZA shines and shows everyone he 's more of a producer . 10/10 '' Shadowboxin ' '' is a song that you can either like or not . This was me when I first listened to it , but after awhile I fell in love with it . Great guest verse from Meth . 9/10 '' Killah Hills 10304 '' is one of the best from this album . Long intro , some thing you would see on a cop show ( i.e . Law and Order ) . After that , once again GZA goes off into space and delivers one of the greatest verses in Wu-Tang history , with amazing flow and delivery . No hook or chorus , well over 50 bars . You WILL go back a few times just to catch what he 's saying . 10/10 '' Investigative Reports '' is an amazing song . Involving the best Wu member , Ghostface and his partner , Raekwon , for `` their '' later classic . Yet , GZA steals the show . 9.2/10 '' Swordsman '' is another hit or miss . Its very hard hitting , both lyrically and musically . Really comes hard here . 8.8/10 '' I Gotcha Back '' , same as above . Hit or miss , the more you listen to it , the more you will like it . 8.5/10 '' B.I.B.L.E . ( Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth ) '' , when I first heard this track , the second the left and right channels hit the speakers , I was hooked . No this is NOT GZA , its the man who *almost* outshined 3 Wu members ( tho he did this to Ghost ) , Killah Priest . He drops some amazing knowledge lyrics . I went back about 3 or 4 times WITH the lyrics just to see what he said . Amazing way to finish a great album . 10/10Closing Comments : No , its NOT better than Illmatic nor Paid in Full , but its a great album and debut . I did n't expect more or less , he showed us why he is a genius . Its his best album to date -- though he still has great follow ups , they wo n't ever be nearly as good as this . Its a classic , but no masterpiece . 5 stars . Oh , and I think I 'm going to have to check out the movie , `` Shogun Assassin '' . Its the movie that 's used as some samples as intros/outros in some songs .	1
Those of you who do n't appreciate the Wu 's latest efforts , and there is alot of talk of a lack of hunger , fresh concepts , and RZA beats should check this classic out . GZA layers his verses with several meanings and the beats are razor-sharp . Rae and Ghost do one of their best efforts on Investigative . The title song and Shadowboxing are also super highlights . This is hiphop for the intelligent brother .	1
What can I say ? I have to say this is gold ! GZA is a genius just like his name says . He is aware , smart , and on point !	1
GZA dropped a jewell with Liquid Swords ... .The opening skit sets the tone for a very dark and introspective album ... .GZA lives up to his nickname `` the genius '' and provides some of the best crafted verses I 've ever heard ... Many of his verses are layered w/ double meanings that can actually take numerous listens until actually realizing fully what it all meant ... props to the RZA for providing some of the darkest and coldest beats I 've ever heard ... Not saying this is the perfect hip hop album , its not even near my top 10 of all time ... .BUt to me , it is a certified hip hop classic and an overall flawless album ...	1
Wu-Tang has several dope mc 's but they all admitted back on 36 Chambers that the GZA was the head . Not in commercial appeal but lyrics . Liquid Swords is second only to Cuban Linx by the Chef in Wu-Tang solo projects . The beats are dark and grimey and the lyrics are vivid as a painting by Picasso ...	1
gza of the wu tang clan releases a classic hip hop album with bad ass beats courtesy of the reliable producer , rza of the wu tang.the lyrics are intelligent and complex.the album starts off with & quot ; liquid swords & quot ; , which has a continuous bass line and gutitar that makes it a favorite of the album.thats rza 's secret , throwing in unexpected beats that make his style one of a kind in the rap scene.from guitars to piano and even bombs going off are used.as usual members of the wu tang clan guest appear making the album more enjoyable.especially on the song & quot ; 4th chamber & quot ; where ghostface killa , rza , and killa priest get down.other great tracks are , & quot ; duel of the iron mic & quot ; , & quot ; living in the world today & quot ; and & quot ; i gotcha back & quot ; .an excellent album .	1
We know that there is no such thing as perfection if you 're Living In The World Today . So that 's why us as human beings look up to our superiors . There is Michael Jordan , Tiger Woods who can define the word perfection better than anyone else . We learn what perfection is by observing them . Now , we can hear what perfection is by listening to the Gza . The Gza has created wonderful flawless hip hop that he pieced together perfectly just like a jigsaw puzzle . Therefore , Liquid Swords was created.I do n't recall the Gza ever hit a bad note in his rhymes , his tongue always slashes as sharp as a kitana . What I adore more about this MC is that he remains calm no matter what his surroundings are . He is arcane and yet , exciting , galvanizing , and lyrically furious.After a chilling intro , we are introduced to the Gza through Liquid Swords . He specializes in chopping up wack MCs , Dueling enemies out of his way with his Iron Mic . And using the most powerfull skill of the Shaolin , which is Tai Chi , also known as Shadowboxing . Also be prepared to be mesmerized by the production of the Rza . Using keyboards ( Iron Mic ) , electric guitars ( Shadowboxing ) , and strings to bring pleasure to our ossicles.Gza is at his very best on Living In The World Today , Gold , Cold World , Lables , and Killa Hills 10304 . He spits top notch similes without even breaking a sweat ( & quot ; Unbalance like elephants and ants on seesaws & quot ; ) . The aforementioned Living In The World Today and Gold are classics . ALong with Killa Hills 10304 , which is my favorite track on the album . Gza summarizes a story about a drug dealer and a terrorist over raw Rza beats.Songs like 4th Chamber , and Swordsman are way ahead of its time . The production on both tracks were just & quot ; crazy & quot ; . It sounded as if the beats went on its own foray , it was just everywhere.There is only one flaw in this whole album . & quot ; Investigative Reports & quot ; , Well , I thought the beat was a little dull compared to the other tracks . And Gza spitted the same verse he did in a freestyle a year ago . This track still gets props , but it 's not as brilliant.This album is probably the best Wu has ever put out . Just about everything was on point . It 's the closest to perfection .	1
from the very second you start this it 's awesome . hell , it uses clips from shogun assasin , which is the first two lone wolf and cub movies edited into one . if you 're interested in getting these you should get the individual movies rather than shogun assasin . oh , this was what they 're watching in kill bill by the way . anyway ... back on track.When the MC 's came , to live our their nameAnd to perform ( forrrrm ) Some had , to snort cocaine ( caiiinnne ) to act insane ( sannne ) with before Pete Rock-ed it on , now gonethat the mental plane ( plaaanne ) to spark the brain ( brainnn ) with the building to be bornYo RZA flip the track with the what to guyCheck em check chicka icka etta UHHabsolutely the best hook ever ! ! ! RZA is supurb on this , but obviously the GZA stands out . his lyrics were so fresh when this dropped that they literally blew fresh air into mainstream hip hop . unfortunately it seems like everyone that was around back then seems to have forgotten about this . i remember when tracks off this were played on the radio REGULARLY ! it 's a shame there is n't anyone of this caliber around any more ( that gets air play ) , maybe we would n't have to deal with this mike jones , lil john , crunk , southern , bullsh*t anymore.buy this and raekwon 's `` only built 4 cuban lynx '' . of course get `` 36 chambers '' , `` forever '' is pretty damn good too . actually . f*ck it , get everything that wu-tang put out before '98.in terms of best wu-tang . no , this definately is n't the best wu-tang cd.only built 4 cuban lynx36 chambersliquid swordsliquid swords is definately a step down , cuban lynx and 36 chambers are interchangable .	1
If there was any Wu-Tang member that could make a solid album between the 36 Chambers and Wu-Tang Forever era , it would be GZA . Every member of the Wu-Tang was talented and created in their own ways , but GZA knows how to make a phenomenal underground rap album . Unlike the majority of rap `` stars '' nowadays , GZA can craft excellent lyrics . The vintage kung fu sound clips also give it an extra step up . RZA did an excellent job in producing this album . With `` Liquid Swords '' , GZA tells us how rap should be done : with meaningful lyrics , talent , distinctive vocal styles , and the soul of the Wu-Tang . A must own for the underground rap fan .	1
This album is deep the beats are ill , His lyrics are crazy . There are a few really good songs and some of them are now classics . 1 ) shadowboxing 2 ) dual of the iron mic 3 ) b.i.b.l.emy favorite track would have to be b.i.b.l.e b/c it 's like religious and in order to understand it you have to be familar with the old testament , go buy it ...	1
Wu-Tang Clan have always made albums that go beyond and Liquid Swords is no exception . Me being a long time fan of the Wu , I would have to say this is one of their finer solo projects . Genius/GZA has always been one of my favorite members of the clan . His cold , scientific , intellectual flow is unmatched by anyone . He has a flow which compels the listener to drink in everything he says . This album is hip hop in its purest form . There 's nothing mainstream about it . Which is probably why I like it . The beats are n't quite as dark as Method Man 's Tical but they are darn close . The album still has a very cold , ominous and brooding feel to it . It 's raw , uncut and it holds nothing back . I could never get the Swordsman beat out of my head . Its so cold and dark that beat could be playing in a nightmare . I Gotcha Back is also very cold and hollow sounding . I do n't think the Rza 's beats will ever be as good as they were during this time period . In my opinion , the beats on this album and on Tical surpass those on the Cuban Linx and Ironman album . Not saying that Raekwon and Ghostface did n't have great albums because they did . I know others will disagree with me but thats just my opinion . I think I just like the Liquid Swords and Tical beats better because my taste is a little darker . Gza and Meth 's flows were darker so Rza had to craft beats to match their flows . I understand that . Just like Rae and Ghost had to have beats that matched their flows . It was crafted so perfectly . This is an album that has to be listened to from beginning to end . Love the cover art too . If you are a Wu-Tang fan or just a fan of real hip hop , buy this album . Support real hip hop . Peace ! ! !	1
This is a classic . My desert island Wu-Tang pick , simply because everyone else would be packing ' ... 36 Chambers . ' And maybe they 'd be right ... Liquid Swords- It 's one of those albums that bring people into hip-hop , one of those albums that I buy used whenever I see a copy for under 5 bucks , simply so I can give it as a present to a friend who 'does n't get hip hop . ' It 's also one of the few hip hop albums that I have on dual formats ( CD and vinyl ) and tracked down the instrumentals too . It 's just that good . It 's dark , macabre , over the top and surreal . The RZA 's production is top notch , The samples and beats are spare , gritty , rambling , odd- this is ANTI-P.Diddy music . The myriad kung-fu interludes for once do n't work against the overall thematic drive , in fact , they heighten the album 's doomed theatrics . The whole thing works perfectly . My brother and I have played many games of chess to this masterpiece . Good also for jogging , lifting , washing dishes , playing cards , driving long distancxes with friends chanting the lyrics ... which reminds me- Lyrically , this is just on a different plane . NO ONE sounds like the GZA- he 's one of those inimitable individuals who ca n't help but rock his own way . His flow and verbosity are seldom matched in the arenas of today . I 'd say he 's up there with KRS-ONE , Guru , Black Thought , Kool G Rap , early Ice Cube , and other originators of all vocal variety.The GZA ties out with Ghostface as my fave Wu-Tang MC , but Liquid Swords is a far better , denser , tighter , diamond hard album than Ironman ( even despite the Al Green samples ) . Now then- Supreme Clientelle ... hmmmm ... In short- all of the best elements of early Wu-Tang , perfectly entwined . If you only have a handful of 'rap ' Cds make this one of them ! ! ! !	1
Continuing the Wu-Tang Clan 's saga of sword swinging chambers strikes member Genius or GZA 's Liquid Swords . Wu-Tang 's sound provider RZA produced all with the exception of one with the Clan 's signature style and sound to fit GZA 's lyrical assault . The album begins with the title track filled with looping keys and simplity , but animated by GZA 's delivery such as `` ... lyrics are weak , like clock radio speakers ... '' Keeping the formula of success and sword swinging `` Duel Of The Iron Mic '' featuring Ol ' Dirty [ ... ] , Dreddy Kruger , Inspektah Deck & Masta Killa blended the streets with the orient tales . Genius shows his versitility on `` Living In The World Today '' by combining harsh street with sharp punchlines and wizardry . `` Gold '' is a hustler 's tale with aspirations of having more than what is given to him . Reality of casualties from gun play and nonchalantness on `` Cold World '' featuring Inspektah Deck & Life is quite vivid . From Wu 's debut album Enter The Wu-Tang ( 36 Chambers ) a hint is found on this album on `` 4th Chamber '' featuring Ghostface Killer , RZA & Killah Priest is a gem . `` Shadowboxin ' '' featuring Method Man is one of the highlights of Liquid Swords to every degree . `` Hell 's Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304 '' this one verse no hook life of a narcotics dealer over a high pitched , yet well orchastrated organ/keys . `` ... calling all cars , calling all cars ... '' for the well knit lyrical content for `` Investigative Reports '' featuring Raekwon , Ghostface Killer & U-God adds support for this LP . Questioning the meaning of crime on `` I Gotcha Back '' was concluded as an acronym criminals robbin ' innocent [ ... ] everytime was a bit short with only one verse . Produced by 4th Disciple , `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth '' featuring Killah Priest does not include a word from Genius , but this scripture tale of soul searching and a higher existance along with `` Swordsman '' completes the album . There may be something missing for the masses , such as a mainstream or commercial track , but this album exercises your mind over off-beat track to keep your head nodding .	1
Wu-Tang Clan is definitely one of the weirdest and most hilarious rap groups that ever existed , but that 's also what makes them one of the greatest . They have a great sense of humor ( as seen in their awesome Kung-Fu movie interludes ) , and GZA/Genius is a funny-yet-great rapper . He 's not my favorite , but he 's very very good ( he seems friendly even though what he 's talking about sometimes is n't ) . The beats here are fantastic , though I 'm not sure who the producer actually was ( I 'm 50 % sure it was GZA/Genius himself ) . The lyrics are always interesting and occasionally pretty funny - you 'll definitely love listening to it all . Basically , if you 're a rap fan or if you already like the Wu-Tang Clan then you 're going to LOVE this album ! Highly recommended ! Highlights include : the entire album !	1
This album dropped back in 1995 , and ten years later , it is still one of my favorite 's . The reason being simple ; The GZA is a Genius . He is without a doubt one of the sharpest lyricist to ever bless a microphone . I agree with the popular opinion on this website , that this is the best Wu-Tang solo album . The RZA'a production and the GZA 's verbal assault are a perfect marriage . Although all of the tracks are hot , `` Living in the World Today '' is the quintessential showcase of the GZA 's pure talent . He attacks the track like only he can , twisting an arsenal of jabs and powerhouse rights , with his unique cadence and inflection . Although he is perhaps the most respected clansman among the Wu and fans , he has never attained a strong popular following due to his disinterest in diverting from his roots as a true street MC . Whenever I grow tired of the rappers of today , I feel thankful that I can drop in this CD and get-down to some real hip-hop .	1
Basically every Wu Tang album up until `` Forever '' is worth owning . The GZA ( Genius ) second album ( not the first people ) `` Liquid Swords '' is one of those albums that need to be in your collection . Backed by some of the most inelligent lyrics and RZA 's razor sharp production , this album was a success.GZA 's rhymes are some of the most thought out lyrics that I 've ever heard comming from the Wu . On the first track `` Liquid Swords '' he says `` ..I drop more bombs faster than you can think ... '' . Or how he uses major record labels to put a rhyme together in the song `` Labels '' . Other notable solo tracks are `` I Gotcha Back '' and `` Living In The Cold World Today '' .Guest wise is pretty sick also . Everybody who appears on this album brings their A game behind the mic . Inspectah Deck , Masta Killah , and ODB appear on the track `` Duel On The Iron Mic '' , backed by a dope beat . Method Man makes a notable appearance on the track `` Shadowboxing '' as he and GZA show off their mic skills . Killah Priest makes an appearance on `` 4th Chamber '' ( along with Ghostface and RZA ) and he would also get a solo track by himself on the final mindblowing track `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth '' about religion.So overall , I enjoyed this album . It showcases one of the finest Wu-Tang Clan talents that you will ever hear . I know this review is n't saying much , but if you 're a Wu fan of anykind , and enjoyed mid 90 's albums , I highly recommend this album to you.Lyrics : A+Production : A+Guest Appearances : A+Musical Vibes : A+Favorite Tracks : Liquid Swords , Duel Of The Iron Mic , Living In The World Today , Cold World , Labels , 4th Chamber , Shadowboxin ' , Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth .	1
This my favorite Wu Tang album . It ditches the ultra-intense everybody-on-the-mic atmosphere of `` Enter The Wu Tang '' since the focus is squarely on GZA ( despite numberous guest appearances from all Wu Tang Clan members ) and replaces it with a creepy , even more subterranean feel . This is some of RZA 's darkest and heaviest production . It fits perfectly with GZA 's grim voice . GZA always sounds threatening and scary but unlike the hyped up Ghostface Killah or macho-sounding Raekwon , The Genius portrays this with a laidback , creepily calm flow . And great lyrics that are both streetwise and surprisingly complex . Whether he 's describing criminal fantasies , autobiographical slices of street life , or simply destroying rival MCs with battle rhymes , GZA sounds both wise and scary , kinda like an aging kung fu master who could kill you with his pinkie finger .	1
GZA 's debut solo album `` Liquid Swords '' is an undeniable classic . The album is of the first wave of Wu-Tang solos from 1994-1996 following the legendary group album `` Enter the Wu-Tang : 36 Chambers . '' On that album , GZA was shown to maybe the group 's best lyricist , a metaphorical master who lived up to his nickname of `` the genius . '' This album boasts multiple classic tracks , and it 's got such a great feeling . The dark , gritty production gives it a cinematic feel , which is heightened by the dramatic kung-fu movie samples throughout the album . RZA handles the productive and it is awesome , completely fitting of GZA 's amazing lyrics . The production is very similar to `` 36 Chambers , '' RZA showing his signature style on the mixing boards . This album is only 13 tracks , but the tracks are all complete and it 's a perfect length , not at all overblown like some later Wu releases would be . Almost the entire Wu-Tang Clan makes a guest appearance at some point on the album , so it 's a group effort in some respects , but GZA always shines . Lyrically he is a beast , and this album may be his shining triumph . He uses battle-type rhymes often , full of great punchlines and also uses a lot of metaphors . He stays very true to the original Wu-Tang style though , often referencing kung-fu and chess in his rhymes . `` Liquid Swords '' is in my opinion the best Wu-Tang solo and a classic album , necessary for any fan of 90s hip hop or Wu.The album begins with the title track , which has a great organ-laced beat and GZA displays his addictive flow and nasal voice , shooting lyrical bullets . `` Duel of the Iron Mic '' is hard-hitting and well-produced by RZA . `` Living in the World Today '' is musically simple and lyrically complex , GZA boasts of Wu-Tang 's prominence and is full of punchlines . `` Gold '' is an almost mafioso look at his lifestyle . `` Cold World '' has an awesome , almost disturbing chorus and GZA takes the opportunity for great storytelling . `` Labels '' is very clever , he uses all the record label names he can think of to almost make fun of them , I like this song a lot . `` 4th Chamber '' is one of my favorites on the disc , it has an awesome beat and great verses from the Genius and Ghostface Killah , this is a Wu-Tang classic like the other `` Chamber '' cuts of old . `` Shadowboxin ' '' is another classic , a collaboration with Method Man where the duo slays MCs with their Shaolin styles . `` Killah Hills 10304 '' is another simply awesome song preluded by a funny interlude . `` Investigative Reports '' is so cool to listen to , GZA tells a paranoid view of the world and crime life . `` Swordsman '' is a metaphor-heavy representative track of his character , and `` I Gotcha Back '' is another of my favorites , GZA telling an eerie philosophy ( `` I gotcha back , but you 'd best a-watch your front / ` cause it 's them n ... .s in front , they be pullin ' stunts '' ) . The last song is my absolute favorite , `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth . '' This track is completely unlike any other on the album , so it 's good that it was last on the album . It 's a very conscious and relevant song by Killah Priest that tackles racial and religious disunity , looking to the children of the world and trying to find peace . The beat has an awesome , relaxing sample and a great vocal sample . I love the hook , this song just ends the album perfectly . `` Liquid Swords '' is a complete , well-rounded , and diverse masterpiece , unique and basically unlike any other album I have heard . Even among the Wu-Tang classics it shines as a legendary work , one that would never again be matched by GZA . This is one of those albums that I find something new I like about it every time , and I really do n't find that in many albums that are released today . I strongly recommend the purchase of `` Liquid Swords '' to all passing hip hop fans , this is even one of those albums that could sell rap to a non fan . This is one of the essential albums that built the legend of the Wu-Tang Clan .	1
GZA is one of the best lyricists of the Wu Tang Clan ( he is also the leader of the group ) . His second solo album ( first is hard to find ) is a lyrical masterpiece . The beats by the RZA and 4th Disciple are as dark as the group 's first solo album . Plus guest appearances by the Clan do n't hurt either . Favorites are Liquid Swords , Duel of the Iron Mic , Living in the World Today , Labels , 4th Chamber , Shadowboxin ' , Investigative Reports , I Gotcha Back , and Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth ( Killah Priest Solo ) . This is a classic album that should be bought by any fan of the Wu Tang Clan .	1
Gza is the most lyrically sound emcee in the entire wu tang clan , and im not picking favorites , he is not even my favorite member of the clan . There is almost no doubting his remarkebly easy flow and creavtive metaphors , which can either make you just want to hear more , or rewind it to hear what he just said . While listening to this album , and earing some of his unbelieveably creative rhymes , I wondered how does he come up with these , `` Lyrics are weak , like clock radio speakers '' , is just an example of his creatvity . He has the ability to hit you in all types of places which has been a rare quality in an emcee since the beginning of hip-hop and is completely exstinct in today 's rap . Aside from the lyrics , Rza , brings in some of his sickest and his most eerie for this album . Using experimentally spooky and out there sounds to create his unbelieveable beats which are always put together perfectly to allow Gza to flow right over them . Some of the best Wu tang beats of all time are on this album , perhaps many are . Gza also often credits Rza for his insane production , `` my sword still remain imperial , Before I blast the mic , RZA scratch off the serial '' showing he knows he is not the only reason this album is monumental.As an emcee , Gza seems to make other rappers on his tracks better lyrically . Notably Inspectah Deck and Method Man . On the albums best song `` Cold World '' , The inspectah virtually outshines Gza which is a complete shock considering how sick Gza 's verse is . The inspectah seems to just be a bit hungrier , '' No time to freeze undercovers roll up in grand prix and seize packages and pocket the currency , clicks control strips full clips are sprayed , Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay '' . Aside from whose better on the track , the two make the best tag team wu record of all time . However , its not just the lyrics that make this the best song on the album , the beat is also the best on the album , with spooky violins and drums which just flow so sickly . Another great tag team callobo is `` Shadowboxin '' featuring Method man . Gza does not get outshined on this one , though Meth throws in a sick verse . When Gza kicks the second verse though , he 's hungry and he actually shows it a bit more then usual , he usually just seems so confident he does n't have to be aggressive but his slight aggressiveness on this track is outstanding , `` I slayed MC 's back in the rec room era , My style broke mother_______ backs like Ken Patera , Most rap ______ came loud but unheard Once I pulled out , round em off to the nearest third '' . The beat on this one is also top of line , not as scary , more quietly aggressive , simple but not light . The `` Oh man '' every few seconds that chimes in is a nice touch.One of the most creative rap songs ever written , and Im not exaggerating , is `` Labels '' . Gza is able to tell a story while using the name of music labels , and he is not crediting them , more like he 's dissing them . Never have I heard an emcee even attempt to create something like this , truly proof that he his the genius . `` Investigative Reports '' is another great track . It opens up with a sick verse from Raekwon . With U-god telling different reports during the chorus with a newscast going on in the backround . The beat is one of those that hit home , they go to your head and you do n't hear the different instruments , just the beat as a whole , and it is a great one . `` Swordsman '' has a great beat that is mostly drums with strange sounds in the backround . Lyrically Gza seems to be trying to say something but he adds `` I 'm not caught up in politics I 'm no black activist '' , so I guess it 's more about self then political indevers . The final track is not Gza but it furthur prooves that success around `` Liquid Swords '' is contagious , Killah Priests raps the vastly different from the rest of the album `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth '' . It has more of a funky beat and it 's a biblical song , initials are B.I.B.L.E . Priest tells a great story of his childhood and gives out instructions before leaving earth.Every time I listen to this album , it gets better . Everytime I notice something different whether lyrically , or musically . It is easily the best Wu Tang solo album and perhaps riviles `` Enter the Wu Tang '' as best Wu production period , well not quite . Every track on this album is bangin ' with some of them just completely off the chains . Could be lyrically the best album I have heard , and it shows how much of an amazing lyracist Gza is . He never changes his tone which is affective because he smooth easy flow is so good he does not need to compromise it at all . Not only Gza made this album the phenomenom it is , much of its success is due to the producer , Rza . `` Liquid Swords has it 's place amongst the greatest of all time and easily is one of my personal favorites .	1
Gza is the most calm and probably least animated member of the Wu-Tang Clan . So do n't go into this album expecting all-out head nodding beats and energy like on Wu-Tang albums . Gza is the most cerebral and lyrical member , as he recites his lyrics almost without emotion like he 's reading them off a page . That can be a good or bad thing , but it 's what sets him apart from other Wu members . He does n't yell and get in your face , like say ... Ol ' Dirty.This `` Liquid Swords '' LP may be underwhelming when you first listen to it . However , it requires many listens to even halfway descipher what he , and other guest Wu members are saying . Rza amazes once again ! His superb beats helped immensely to make this album so revered . The beats perfectly fit Gza 's laid-back style . It does n't seem like Gza 's on this album all that much though . He features every Wu member ( even Killah Priest ) at least once , and the songs that he does solo were mostly two verses taking up two minutes or less in time . And the last track is so amazing too ! Enlightening and empowering ! The song really makes the album complete , and makes you want to bow down before the Genius until ... wait , that 's not even his song ! ! ! It 's Killah Priest on that track ! Okay , well I guess Gza was n't AS untouchable as I thought , but I 'll say that he still does drop great material , and a bunch of other dope songs , on this LP . You just ca n't understand how mad and perplexed I was when I found out that `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth '' was n't Gza 's doing ! This whole album may not have the energy of the `` 36 Chambers '' album , but it definitely feels like a Wu-Tang album with Rza 's beats and the skits and all . Every song is essential here , the only one I was n't feelin ' too much was `` Killah Hills 10304 , '' but I know that one appeals to other listeners . I would have to say that `` B.I.B.L.E . '' is slightly my favorite here , even though it ai n't Gza . Otherwise , my personal favorites are `` Gold , '' ( with a 'golden ' beat ) `` Cold World , '' `` 4th Chamber , '' `` Investigative Reports , '' and `` Swordsmen . '' The `` 4th Chamber '' is an excellent collab with Ghostface , Killah Priest , and Rza ( who drops an absolutely amazing verse ) . `` Cold World '' features Inspectah Deck and has appropriate singing . `` Shadowboxin ' '' was cool too , but I would of liked to hear more from Gza and not so much Method Man . Every song on this album is quality though.I recommend this album to experienced Hiphop listeners out there , possibly even newcomers . It 's a dark experience that just keeps growing on you the more and more you listen to it . I 'm still catching new things as I listen , and it 's been in my stereo for an extended amount of time . That 's rare for me ! I 'm still trying to get over the fact that the last song was Killah Priest , not Gza , but I still give this one at least 4 stars ! I think I 'm going to check out a Killah Priest album before I buy another Gza joint however .	1
So the world is falling apart ? No doubt about that . Turn on your TV , and it 's the same thing , just different colors of crap . I mean , how did it all get this stupid ? Even the music , god ... the music . Between Lil ' Jon 's stranglehold and TI and ... is Nelly still around ? The rock scene is n't much better , with all this The Killers From The Heat of 1979 . I swear I 'm so disillusioned . `` I drop megaton bombs more faster than ya blink ... '' RZA and GZA are doing a pretty damn good job of taking it back to where it came from . If the beat does n't get you quite grooving , just listen to GZA . That 's what you 're SUPPOSED to do . And then you 're like ... `` Yeah , this is how it 's done , damn you Justice . '' And this album is almost 10 years old now ? I 'm afraid to get caught up in the `` Duel of the Iron Mic '' . GZA , MK , and Deck are n't nice . I suppose I should listen to these guys . The beat is nice , but they 're getting a tad confrontational . MK says it 's not an 85 affair , but they definitely took a few cues.Then it hits `` Living In The World Today '' . But only raise your hands if you 're sure . What is this ? 3 for 3 already ? The first 3 tracks on this CD knock the ball out of the city , screw the park . Damn , GZA is n't just coming out cutting heads . He 's drawing and quartering . All opposition is probably running like hell . Do n't get shattered like a glass jaw.And of course , `` Gold '' comes through with some overdriven guitar and a beat farmed straight in Hell . It 's just the beginning though , as it segues into the highlight of the CD , the icy and epic `` Cold World '' . Probably the best beat RZA has ever done , hands down . No arguement . This is the beat that had me sold on Wu . GZA throws out an awesome narratto ive of the battle , only to be outdone by the INS . `` No time to freeze , undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs and seize packages and pocket the currency '' .What can I say about `` Labels ? '' Either you know , or you do n't . If you have no idea , that 's your problem . I 'd almost rather you not know if it 's taken you this long.And when I start thinking `` Cold World '' was the best thing this CD had to offer , `` 4th Chamber '' starts beating you into submission . Featuring the Wu GOD up first , Ghostface drops some more cryptic science that takes forever to decypher . He 's so good that by the time Killah Preist and the RZA are done , I 'm hoping Ghost would come in to drop another verse.But then you have to wait until the end of `` Investigative Reports '' to catch Ghost again . Rae and GZA throw out some good stuff ( The chef cooks up some MOUTH WATERING words ) , but ... Ghost throws the verse to end any MC 's career into the Grand Canyon . Lines like `` I grab the pen for revenge and let loose , see ? Like Muslims standing on the block rockin ' the Kufi '' to `` Packed with visions , copywritten , throwin ' bread to pidgeons , christ has risen '' to the ultimate `` Yo , they used guns while we angrily shot arrows , you better keep your eye on the sparrow '' . What can you do ? Nothing.Before I end up analyzing every song on this , I 'm gon na cut it short . By the time you 're finished listening to the Killah Preist manifesto `` B.I.B.L.E . `` , you realize that this CD is knowledge . Minimal , possibly old school , but 100 % on point . It 's also an escape.Absolutely jaded by the world around you ? Throw in `` Liquid Swords '' . There 's nothing I can say about the feeling you get when `` Living In The World Today '' starts after listening to the first two songs . The world might be falling apart , but screw it . If you 've got `` Liquid Swords '' , no one can mess with you .	1
This CD has everything a Wu fan loves : Stark , haunting beats ; great kung-fu samples ; amazing lyrical wordplay ; and terrific performances by other Wu members . GZA shines on this album and proves he was at the top of his game . The movie sample that starts out the ablum is excellent and relevant for what comes next : `` It was a bad time for the empire ... '' GZA and company are on the attack on the song `` Liquid Swords , '' with lyrics like `` When the MC 's came , to live out their name ... Some had to snort cocaine to act insane . '' Then comes Duel of the Iron Mic , wielding more wild kung fu sound effects and eerie gunshot samples that serve as a perfect background while GZA , Inspectah Deck , and Master Killer kick furious and ODB even shows up in the end chorus . `` Livin in the World Today '' is amazing , with a great minimal beat and hook , it also features some mc'in by Method Man , who was always great back then . The whole album just really flows like no other Wu album out there . And songs like Investigative Reports showcase GZA and other Wu bangas ( Raekwon , Ghostface , U-God ) at their most cutting -- creating a vivid picture of the more disturbing aspects of living in America ( drug culture/violence/government conspiracy ) .The only song out of place , for me , was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth . Killah Priest lays down this track and it is filled with religious fervor and , at times , intolerance : `` Son , life is a pool of sin , corrupted wth foolish men and women with wicked minds , who build picket signs to legalize abortion . '' It 's a shame , cause this album would be five stars otherwise .	1
Y'all know the Wu-Tang style : shaolin sworeds , kung fu films , rhymes and other oriental things.Real Wu fans know the style of every member of the Wu-Tang and everybady an confirm that GZA/Genius is the most ... genial rapper in the group.The older phylosopher has got a legendary technique and a perfect metric , so everybody rate this man a Ney York Legend.Genius made , before `` Liquid Swords '' , an unlucky LP called `` Words From The Genius '' .The real oriental soul grow up with `` Liquid Swords '' , the diamond of Wu-Tang solo discography with `` No Said Date '' of Masta Killa and Raekwon 's '' Only Built 4 Cuban Linx '' . GZA spits on beats produced by another Killa Bee , The RZA Abbott . In almost every track you can find a Wu member , a lot of people say that this is a kind of reunion on a solo album.GZA 's lirycs talk about many topics : Genius raps of the ghetto ( Killa Hills 10304 , story of a drug dealer ) , of music ( Labels , a funny song where we can listen a lot of label 's names ) , of corruption ( Investigative Reports , track with a mafia flava , there is Raekwon and the co-chef GhostFace ) .GZA 's second LP is a mix of styles and topics but you will find everytime that shaolin sound that is the Wu simobl.Great.If you have n't got this cd , move that mouse and click on GZA 's `` Liquid Swords '' .EXCUSE ME BUT I MIS MY PASS SO I 'LL REWERITE EVERY OLD REVIEW ; )	1
Lets get right to the point , Gza is absolutely the best lyricist in the Clan . It is no suprise that he was in the clan from the beginning . Much like Cuban Linx by Raekwon is about RZA 's hott beats , this is the Wu album which showcases the Wu 's best lyrics ( excluding the genius 36 chambers ) . Best tracks : Liquid Swords , Duel of the Iron Mic . Peace .	1
With his second album , GZA takes you through his dark and somewhat scary chamber with lethally real lyrics and foreboding beats provided by RZA . Incredible storytelling injected with a seriousness unmatched by any other rapper . His delivery and cleverness keeps the album a privilage to listen to all the way through . Just an amazing hip hop album from one of the most talented rappers to ever grace the mic .	1
The GZA/Genius drops as the 4th Wu-member to drop a solo ( I 'm not considering his 1988 `` Words From The Genius '' which sold around 12,000 copies ) . As with all the early solo Wu projects RZA handles all the production , and it is his best solo to date ( even though his next 2 are still very good albums ) . A lot of the Wu is on here as well as some Wu-affiliates . There are 1 or 2 average tracks , and 2 classics on it , the rest are very good ( as well as an average Killah Priest solo ) , it is a must have album for any rap fan. # 1 - 8.5 ( Long intro before the song ) # 2 - 8.5 ( f/ Ol ' Dirty { R.I.P . } & Inspectah Deck ) # 3 - 8 # 4 - 9 ( great beat ) # 5 - 8 ( f/ inspectah deck & street life ) # 6 - 7 # 7 - 10 ( classic -- f/ ghostface killah , rza , killah priest -- great beat ) # 8 - 10 ( Method Man has 2 verses & GZA has 1 -- GREAT BEAT -- one of the best songs ever ) # 9 - 9.5 ( good beat & story but a LONG intro ) # 10 - 8 ( f/ Raekwon , ghostface killah & U-God ) # 11 - 8 ( f/ Killah priest ) # 12 - 6.5 # 13 - 7 ( Killah Priest solo ) Gary Grice -- b . 8/22/66 -- Staten Island , NYcheck all my reviews	1
This cd is so damn grimey like crazy . Every track has the most dark/grimiest beat you can think of . Wow and is GZA a genius ? ? He writes better lyrics than anyone else in the damn Wu-Tang and he could rip up any other fake rapper out there any day ! This cd is tight as sh*t ! ! ! ! It also has a tight ass CD cover . He has more of a laid back style of rapping , and he raps perfectly with these beats . The track LABELS is a classic , so check that one out . This album is known as one of the best solo wu releases , and let me tell you it is ! ! ! So cop this wu fans ! ! ! ! Peace !	1
One of the best hip-hop albums to ever be released ever . Hott beats and true hip-hop lyrics keep you wanting more from GZA . This album is insane , dark and grimey . Buy this now if your a true Wu-Tang and Hip-Hop Fan. # 1.Liquid Swords - 10/10 # 2.Duel Of The Iron Mic - 10/10 # 3.Living In The World Today - 10/10 # 4.Gold - 10/10 # 5.Cold World - 10/10 # 6.Labels - 10/10 # 7.4th Chamber - 10/10 # 8.Shadowboxin - 10/10 # 9.Hells Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304 - 10/10 # 10.Investigative Reports - 10/10 # 11.Swordsman - 10/10 # 12.I Gotcha Back - 10/10 # 13.Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth - 10/10This album is perfect in everysingle way . Buy it now ! !	1
By all means if you 're a hip hop fan and do n't own this drop everything your doin and cop it . GZA is lyrically the best from the wu tang clan , and the production is definitely some of their rawest !	1
I would not recommend this to teenagers due to the graphic nature of drug usage and how it dispensed verbally through suggestive ways such as overt and not so overt tones also mixed into the sub-layers of the music . So to parents , I think that this is a poisonous album that would infect the children and decrease some areas and also entertain some as people that like this music .	1
I picked this up at Best Buy yesterday ( yea I know 15 years to late , but I was only 3 when this came out ) . So yea I picked this up because I saw it was on sale for $ 8 so I was like `` Ok , I love Wu-Tang and I want more material and $ 8 is a STEAL ! '' So I picked it up and listened to it this morning and ... wow ! Everything about this album is nice . There is n't one bad/alright track on here they are all real smooth and work extremely well together . The mood of the album is very dark , as is most Wu albums , and all the features are amazing and fit their part , but it 's all Wu so of course they gon na be nice.Anyway I do n't wan na ramble on so I'ma just say this ... If you like Wu-Tang , scratch that , if you like REAL HIP-HOP , then pick this up . You wo n't be disappointed . And if you are , then you must be a Young Money , Kid Cudi , or Kanye West fan . This is for the hip-hop heads who know their stuff	1
This could arguably be the best Wu-Tang solo album . Once again , the RZA lays down his amazing beats for his fellow Clan-mate to glide over . The GZA , who is probably the Clan 's most gifted MC , drops jewels throughout this album ( peep & quot ; Labels & quot ; ) . This is my second favorite Wu-Tang album behind & quot ; Only built 4 Cuban Linx & quot ; . Also , his second Wu album was O.K. , but the & quot ; Legend of The Liquid Sword & quot ; is hot too . As far as this CD goes , certified classic .	1
Although this album was released all the way back in 1995 , I just got my first taste of it . I have always known about Wu Tang Clan but I never got a chance to hear much from them because they are not as mainstream and commercial . After listening to GZA 's Liquid Sword I was quite amazed . Why does someone who has such story telling and comparison lyrical skills is not on the radio and flowing in the mainstream and appearing on TRL and BET . I have not heard such great skills since back in the Biggie and 2Pac days . GZA has solid skills with great back up guest appearances from other Wu Tang members . ( method man , RZA ) The production of RZA was solid , and it somewhat tries to tell the story of Liquid Swords before songs . Some of the beats reminds me of the themes from the old martial art movies . Eventhough this album might not sound really appealing the first time , but every time you listen to it , you will hear something you missed the last time and be impressed by the kinda skill he displayed . Such artists like this are rarely found in the mainstream today . GZA is truly a genious with rhymes and brought the best out of the other guest appearances . This CD is definitely worth your money , it has depth although it talks streets and guns . The creativity in this album is far above many rappers even in the game today.Lyrics : A+Production : ADelivery : A+Overall : A+	1
Many debate which is better , Raekwon 's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... or GZA 's Liquid Swords . It has been discussed for over 10 years , but there is no result . One of the best that came out of Wu-Tang , with sharp lyrics and flawless production from RZA . Killah Priest gets credit for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth and with Invesitgative Reports , Raekwon shines on it . Although with `` Labels '' and `` Gotcha Back '' shows why GZA has labeled himself as the Genius .	1
By 1995 , the RZA 's five-year plan for the Wu-Tang Clan to take over hip-hop was surely well in motion . While their albums were hardly the blockbusters they deserved to be , their quality was unimpeachable . From the group effort `` Enter the 36 Chambers '' to Ghostface 's `` Ironman '' , was three years of unparalleled excellence from all involved parties , but especially producer mastermind RZA . Teaming up with his cousin Genius/GZA , they created `` Liquid Swords '' , one of the eeriest , most cohesive and just plain ridiculously amazing rap albums ever made . Simply put , this belongs in the top five of the best hip-hop albums.The first listen will probably be the hardest , as it is so anti-thetical to any sound rap has produced - excepting the Wu , and even then it 's a stretch . Lasting only about 55 minutes , it is simply without any filler : the extensive kung-fu samples from `` Shaolin Assassin '' add to the thematic unity of the album and increase the doom . The real stars of this album are the RZA and the GZA , two artists firing on all cylinders : the RZA 's production has never been dense and expressive , while the GZA is the real `` razor sharp '' rapper here . Listening to El-P 's production on his own and Cannibal Ox 's albums , you can completely hear RZA 's production work from this album being paid homage to . This is the highpoint of the Wu-Tang 's golden reign from 93-96 . A RAP CLASSIC , JUST GET IT NOW !	1
This is a CLASSIC . Right up there with Cuban Linx . What GZA lacks in persona he more than makes up for with his wicked intelligent deliveries . He exudes a veteran aura , someone who has been there an done that . GZA cuts right to the chase and gets down in the thick of it in this album . It has a dark and gloomy aesthetic feel to it , which I love . Yo , do yourself a favor and stop reading my review and just buy this sh**t. It is just as good now as it was back in '95 ... You wo n't regret it ; )	1
First , we were inroduced to the 36 Chambers of the Wu-Tang Clan in 1993 . Shortly after , we entered Method Man and ODB 's ( R.I.P . ) respective chambers . In 1995 , another classic was unleashed courtesy of the dynamic duo of Raekwon The Chef & Ghostface Killah . Only a couple of months after , we entered the brain of The Genius AKA GZA . There is a reason why this man is labeled as the head of The Clan . His introspective verbal assults on the mic shows how deep this man 's mind goes . He shines regardless , with the clan ( `` Duel of The Iron Mic '' w/ ODB , Rebel INS , & Masta Killa ; `` 4th Chamber '' w/ Ghostface Killah , Killah Priest , & The RZA ; `` Investigative Reports '' w/ Raekwon , Ghostface , & U-God ) or with out them ( `` Liquis Swordz '' , `` Labels '' , `` I Gotcha Back '' ) . When paired up with another MC as a duo the result is pure fire ( check `` Cold World '' w/ Rebel INS and `` Shadowbixin '' w/ Method Man ) . In fact , there is no song on this album in need of skippin . Even the album 's bonus , `` B.I.B.L.E . '' ( Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth ) , an itroduction of Killah Priest as a solo MC is stellar . This album is a good listen from begining to end . PEACE !	1
this is the best Wu tang solo effort next to Raekwon 's `` Only built for cuban Linx '' , the beats are tight and the lyrics are sharp . It starts with Liquid Swords which has the usual Wu tang samples at the start which is good , anywayz the track is tight and one of da best . `` Duel of The Iron Mic '' is great . Living in the world today is tight . `` Gold '' is a hard hittin track yknow with Method man . `` Cold world '' is tight with Inspecta deck . Labels is dope . 4th chamber features Ghostface , Killah Priest , and RZA it is dope . `` Shadowboxin '' is dope and features Method Man . I dont think Hells wind staff is on the CD i have so I cant rate that . Killa Hills 10304 is tight . Investigative reports is dope . Swordsman is next and is tight . I gotcha back is probably my fav . BIBLE is great and features KillaH priest and i think it is on Priest 's album.Overall 10/10and thatsall I have to say about that	1
My favorite Wu-Tang solo album of what I 've heard , in my opinion GZA is definately the best Wu member lyrically ( Whole album produced by RZA except for track 13 , which is produced by 4th Diciple ) 1.Liquid Swords-5/5-Perfect song to start the album , great beat and GZA is great lyrically2.Duel Of The Iron Mic ft.Ol Dirty Bastard , Inspektah Deck & Masta Killa-5/5-Classic RZA piano loop , with obviously great verses from INS , Masta Killa & GZA3.Living In The World Today-5/5-Great song4.Gold-4.5/5-Great production on this one , and GZA shines lyrically5.Cold World ft.Inspektah Deck-5/5-This beat goes perfectly with GZA and INS ' verses and the hook6.Labels-5/5-Amazing song , GZA uses the names of almost all record labels ( in 95 ) in lyrical context that actually makes sense in the song ( Does the same thing with celebrities in `` Fame '' ) 7.4th Chamber ft.Ghostface Killa & RZA-5/5-RZA has always been one of my least favorite Wu-Tang MCs ( Not that hes bad ... ) and his verse is outshone buy Ghostface & GZA , but its actually very good8.Shadowboxin ' ft.Method Man-5/5-Great song , nice verse by Meth9.Hell 's Wind Staff ( Skit ) /Killah Hills 10304 ft.Masta Killa-4.5/5-Nice production by RZA and GZA 's nice lyrically10.Investigative Reports ft.Raekwon , Ghostface Killa & U-God-5/5-Nice Wu posse cut , Rae has the best verse on this one in my opinion11.Swordsmen-5/5-GZA is great lyrically , and it has a nice beat12.I Gotcha Back-5/5-Great beat , and more great lyrics13.Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth ( B.I.B.L.E . ) -Killah Priest-5/5-Killah Priest solo song , actually really goodThis is one of my favorite albums , and especially reccomended if you liked Enter The Wu-Tang ( 36 Chambers )	1
The GZA is a complex , but hardcore artist who put out a classic in the making . Liquid Swords is a must get for any Wu-Tang fan . Songs like & quot ; Cold World & quot ; , & quot ; 4th Chamber & quot ; , & quot ; Shadowboxin ' & quot ; , & quot ; Swordsman & quot ; , & quot ; Investigative Reports & quot ; , and my favorite & quot ; Duel Of The Iron Mic & quot ; makes this album historic . This is definately a must get . Peace to the Wu .	1
this is one of the best wu tang solo efforts . the beats are razor sharp , and the lyrics wonderfully compliments the beats . the flow IS like a liquid sword if you think about it . this is best heard with the volume all the way up ! ! ! !	1
Believe it or not , Gza is actually one of my least favorite clansmen , behind maybe only Cappadonna and U-God . However even I ca n't deny that this is a great album . It is a little overrated , I have read that it is `` the perfect album '' , far from it , but still a great album . Gza really is nice on the mic , I just prefer other rappers over him because he does n't ever really get hyped , and the tone of his voice never changes , but some people are into that . Anyways , the production is another great aspect of this album . It was made while the Rza was at his prime , so you know its laced with some of the tightest beats . Even if every other song on this album was terrible , it would still be worth buying just to hear the song `` Labels '' which is , quite possibly , the best rap song of all time . Gza incorporates each record label 's name into his rap to form verses that actually make sense , and the beat is one of the tightest on the cd . Thankfully , that is n't the only great song , and there are many more , so if you want to get into Wu Tang , first buy Enter The Wu Tang : 36 Chambers , then this .	1
THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GRIMMEY FROM PRODUCTION , BEATS AND , LYRICS . BUT , LYRICALLY IT 'S JUST SIMPLY PUT GENIUS . THE THOUGHTS PROCESS TO CREATE THIS ALBUM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IS PURE DARK BEAUTIFUL HIP HOP POETRY . THERES EXCELLENT GUEST VERSES FROM FELLOW CLANS MEN WHO BROUGHT THERE A* GAME TO THIS PROJECT . STANDOUT GUEST VERSES ON THIS RECORD ARE GHOSTFACE KILLAH ON 4TH CHAMBER . METHOD MAN ON SHADOWBOXIN ' RAEKWON AND GHOSTFACE ON INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS . THE PRODUCTION FROM THE RZA AND BEATS ARE INCREDIBLE . YOU CAN PLAY THE WHOLE ALBUM WITHOUT SKIPPING 1 TRACK . PUT LIQUID SWORDS ON FOR ANYONE THAT HAS N'T HEARD IT AND INSTANTLY BLOWS THEM AWAY .	1
This is an incredibly fluid and swift album with incredible lyrical precision and RZA-freaked beats . How could you go wrong with album ? This is not only one of the essential albums of the Wu-solo efforts , but it 's also one of the essential hip hop albums of the '90s .	1
Go out and cop this album . you wo n't be let down , like most modern day releases . 4th chamber , shadowboxin are just a few of the highlights and many more . The lyrical swordplay is awesome and this cd is a true essence of hiphop . A must buy.rating A+	1
Liquid Swords is a true work of art and stands to this day as the finest work that Wu-Tang ever put on wax.Unlike alot of albums which come off as a bunch of singles put together , Liquid Swords works as a single unified , thematic piece with all of the songs blending together to form a dark , nightmarish vision of the streets which has more in common with a Stephen King horror movie that with most of the other hip hop that was coming out at the time.This album , for me , proved once and for all that the RZA stood alone as the the most exciting and creative producer in Hip Hop . Pete Rock , Premier , Dre were all outstanding but they tended to stick to their signature sound . RZA 's tracks were different from album to album and on this album everything comes together . The kung fu samples fit perfectly with the beats . He uses crazy sound effects like electric guitars , feedback , explosions etc not usually associated with hip hop to create something new , exciting and frightening.What can I say about the GZA . Outside of Illmatic era Nas , there was no other MC who was as descriptive and literate in describing the street life . GZA could talk about the most brutual and violent topics and still make it sound like fine art.This album was a true team effort..every member of the Clan at the time appeared on the album in some capacity which is another reason that it is my favorite.A couple of highlights from this classic album ... Dual of the Iron Mic- Ominous Kung Fu movie sample in the beginning along with sound effects of a rain storm go into what may be RZA 's best beat ever . An absolute , trunk rattling monster with a sick bassline and piano loop accented with explosion and feedback sound effects . GZA sets it off nice ( Picture blood baths and elevator shafts ... . ) Cold War- Very memorable hook and Ins . Deck absolutely kills it with the second verse on the song.4th Chamber- Crazy , tripped out electric guitar intro before it goes into a more conventional beat . The best verse of `` Pre-Cuban Linx '' Ghostface 's career ( The only kid I 'll hold weight for ) and quite possibly RZA 's greatest verse ever.Killa Hills 10304- Great synthesizer sample and one of GZA 's trademark crime narratives.This album is a home run . While everyone else was copying Pete Rock and Premier doing the horn and piano thing death . RZA was in the lab creating new sounds . Along with his best MC , GZA , they created this masterpiece which will go down in history as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time .	1
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST HIPHOP ALBUM OF ALL TIMEWhat is the first thing that comes to your mind when the album Liquid Swords is brought up ? Maybe the word PERFECTION , maybe CREATIVE , possibly ORIGINAL , or maybe just plain ILL . There is thousands of words that could be used to describe this classic , and every word would have to be a positive one.Ask any super sick hip-hop junkie who the greatest emcee of all time is , you may get a few Rakims or KrsOnes in there , but for the most part the without a doubt answer would be the Gza/Genius . NO other EMCEE comes close to being as sick as this kat.Then ask what is the greatest hip-hop album of all time , guess what you get the answer Liquid Swords . It puzzles me why this album isnt about 20 x platinum . The Gza remains very low key , but anyone who is into deep hip-hop understands this album is beyond classic , beyond this day and time.Give Rza just as much credit as the Gza . This album is Rza 's pinnacle of work as fas as production goes . I dont feel a lot of the Wu material unless it goes back as far as the 36 Chambers , but this album 's production is simply amazing.Every single track is beyond perfect.My personal favorites are Cold World and Duel of the Iron Mic . But all the tracks are just astonishing . I would elaborate more on each track but I have a life.Just to say if you dont have this beyond classic lp you need to get this . Seriously .	1
Hands down one of my favorite albums of all time , though even I can admit it does n't stand up to `` Cuban Linx '' and `` 36 Chambers '' . Nevertheless , GZA is an outstanding lyricist with damn powerful delivery ( you 've probably seen him perform `` Knock , Knock '' on the first season of Chappelle 's Show , and NO other emcee brings that intensity with the exception of Ghostface , ODB and early Onyx ) . The Genius is right up there with Rakim , Kane , Kool G Rap and Ice Cube as a master of the microphone . He can rhyme and rhyme all day and kill any rapper with his words just as well as he could on `` 36 Chambers '' ( see `` Clan in da Front '' ) . The only difference between GZA and 90 % of other stellar emcees today is that GZA has the RZA at his back with beats that will blow you away . They can be dark and grimy ( `` Duel of the Iron Mic '' ) or perfect for bumping in your car ( `` Living in the World Today '' ) , but they always fit together perfectly with GZA 's intense rhymes and powerful delivery.But when you buy this album , you get more than just the Genius spitting over powerful RZA beats . You get all 8 other Wu members plus some Killa Bees too , and none of them disappoint . In fact , Method Man even goes far enough to outshine GZA on `` Shadowboxin ' '' , which is arguably the best song on the CD and the first single from it as well.After listening to this album and the other 5 albums that were in the first set of Wu solo discs , `` Liquid Swords '' is by far the best , both in lyricism and production . Now , GZA was never able to come up with a classic hip-hop song like ODB 's `` Brooklyn Zoo '' or `` Shimmy Shimmy Ya '' , Rae 's `` Incarcerated Scarfaces '' , or Meth 's `` Bring da Pain '' ( hell , the closest thing to a classic on this CD was the one song where Meth performed better than the Genius ) , and that 's probably why he does n't get all the respect he deserves . Instead , GZA is cursed with powerful consistency throughout this entire album . The Source slipped up by not giving this album 5 mics , so instead `` Liquid Swords '' will have to remain an underground classic instead of get the mainstream respect it deserves.If you 're not into dope beats and tight lyrics this CD might not be for you , but if you like banging kicks and snares and rhymes that 'll make you press rewind and say `` DAMN , did he just say that ? '' this album is probably for you .	1
There were a few Hip-Hop Albums in my youth that took me by storm . One was `` Peoples Instinctive Travels ... '' another was `` Illmatic '' yet another was `` Fear of a Black Planet '' '' Liquid Swords '' , was the last great Hip-Hop album of the nineties . GZA ( The Genius ) second studio album but best described as a `` compilation '' album that starred GZA with production duties handled by RZA ( Prince Rakeem ) and the 4th disciple . Pretty much all of the WU clan is represented here including Inspectah Deck , Method Man , Ghost Face Killa , Masta Killa , ODB , U-God , and Killa Priest . This album was unlike any of the other albums that are permanently etched in my memory . Illmatic was elegant . Peoples was Positive . Fear was paranoid . Liquid was deep , cold and dark like a pit . Once you inserted the disc or tape into your stereo there was no escape until the last song was played . Its best described as a graphic novel that you listen to . No dance track to be had here just thought provoking lyrics and hypnotic trance like beats . The songs range from egomaniacal and angry to icy and sparse . No song is meant stand out here although I do have my favorites . `` Gold '' talks about a drug dealer 's frantic almost mindless pursuit of wealth by any means . In `` Cold World '' Inspectah Deck and GZA both paint a vivid picture of the nightmarish chaos of a crime riddled neighborhood . The trouncing pummeling beats , the deliberately out of tune singing it matches the hopelessness and desperation of life in the streets.Method Mans overwhelming lyrical charisma anchors `` Shadow boxing '' In the bonus track `` B.I.B.L.E '' Killa Priest explains his spiritual and intellectual awakening . `` Liquid Swords '' is the most personal of all the WU efforts . It tells us about the belly of the beast from which they are spawned . The Imprecise Synthesizer driven `` Killa Hills 10304 '' is where GZA reaches his lyrical Apex.16 years old and still one of the greatest most innovative Albums ever produced .	1
It 's 11:00PM , im browsing Amazon , and I come across Enter The 36 Chamber 's , WU TANG 's first album . Me personally I gave it a 3.5 , and I thought it was ok . I COULDNT BELELIVE HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE GUSHING OVER THIS ! I think people just fell into the marketing concept , after Wu Tang Clan was not as much a rap group as you think , but more a Marketing Sceme devised to use a collective group of rapper 's , and a in house Producer , to produce a rapid firs amount of albums quilckly in the early-mid 90 's , to dominate the East Coast rap game , and it pretty much worked.Now on to this album ... If anyone tell 's you this is anything like 36 Chamber 's slap them in the face , yes it 's GZA , RZA , and the rest of the crew , but it is a toatally different sound . Even though it is more underground feel to it ( There is no C.R.E.A.M . here ) It seem 's more accesable.There is really no good song here , but the best ones are the ones that have a clip , or skit before them , and that feature a few other artist 's then GZA , to give it more variety . Actually my favorite track is B.I.B.L.E . which is tecnically not even his song . There is really no skippable track though , and it 's vibe is really nice to listen to in the dark of the school bus in the morning , or when your rolling thru your hood.The only weaker part of this album , but that is still good is the production , do n't get me wrong RZA is da man , but this is not the best production ive seen . ALso the CD is only about 60 min 's , leaving about 15-20 left to fill . Also one more weak point that enhances the flaw of the distance of the record , is that most of the song 's only have maybe 2 minutes of actuall rhyming , the rest is skit 's , and beat 's . But what is cool about that is the Clip 's are fVCKING AWESOME ! ! ! And it is nice to hear the beat 's by themselves , so it balances out . Also the first track will surprise you , as will the rest.Enjoy this is a great ALBUM ! Overall 4.5/5NEAR CLASSICAnd I bump it constantly ... Lyric's- 10/10Delivery- 9.5/10Production - 8.5/10Charisma - 9/10Skit 's - 11/10 ! ! ! Hope this helped ! If so , tell amazon it did !	1

I do n't even know if kids nowadays know about this cd or even this rapper . Basically , this is the best east coast rap cd ever released . Non-commerical , so not many know about it . Listen to the samples on here . Lyrically , it crushes . The entire album is atmopsheric . It 's a story . The Gza slashed up buttholes like Mexican food .	1
Yeah , sure , ODB has the most personality , and Method Man gets all the ladies , but when it comes to raw MCing and keeping faithful to the true elements of hip-hop , the GZA is unparalleled . This is the best Wu-Tang solo album , bar none . It has the darkest overtones , RZA 's production is deeper than it had ever previously been ( and never will be again , as far as I 'm concerned ) , and GZA 's lyrics just knocked me out of my chair . It was chock full of metaphors galore , technicolor ghetto tales , and anyone who says & quot ; Labels & quot ; was less than brilliant needs a speedknot upside the head . This is a beautiful piece of hardcore real hip-hop , and it deserves to be in any collection . It 's just a shame that he had to follow it up with & quot ; Beneath the Surface ... & quot ;	1
Now in my rap dictionary , this is probably the best Cd from any other Wu-Tang solo artist . Like hus name , GZA is a pure Genius when it comes to making a solid CD like `` Liquid Swords '' . I can go through evry song on here , and not skip one track . Thats how much I liked it . No matter what genre of music you enjoy , you can appreciate it . You will never find a group and artits liek Wu-Tang Clan and GZA . This CD just shows how much better music was back in the early 90 's and mid 90 's . The next time you are looking for a classic Cd 's by oen of the Wu-Tang members , and you dont have this Cd , tehn by it . You will be amazed of how well done this Cd was . There will never be one like it , ever again.peace	1
Before all of the Wu-Tang Forever hype and the slew of disappointing follow-up albums from the Wu solo members , there was the underrated Liquid Swords by Genius . Although it seemed that other Wu members such as Method Man , ODB , and Raekwon gained more attention for their solo albums , Liquid Swords is still a great Wu album . The production by RZA is grimy , eeirie , and perfect . Genius ( a.k.a . GZA ) drops his one-of-a-kind battle lyrics on & quot ; Duel Of The Iron Mic & quot ; and the title track and also paints vivid pictures of crime and pain in the city on & quot ; Cold World & quot ; and & quot ; Gold & quot ; . The only track that seems out of place is the Killah Priest solo track & quot ; B.I.B.L.E. & quot ; which also appeared on his Heavy Mental album . Although it 's a favorite of mine , it really has no place on this album . Otherwise , this is a great album that all Wu or hip-hop fans should own .	1
[ ... ] new cds . `` ... the genius is nothing in comparision to this guy , this album shows what real hip-hop is all about ... '' Pretty much self-explainatory . [ ... ] you got no clue , go back to your pop rap [ ... ] and you saying he defines hip-hop . He is a sold out commercial artist , producing radio hits . On the other hand , The GZA 's name really defines him - GENIUS . This album is one of the greatest ever . It 's simply amazing , some of the illest beats you will ever here , with some of the tightest rapping and sick flow , plus tight LYRICS . This album is really classic , i am addicted to it . Best tracks are Investigative Reports , Shadowboxing ( my favorite ) , Duel Of The Iron Mic , and Swordsmen , but every other song is a classic . Get this if for some reason you have n't already . This is hip-hop at its best .	1
Probably one of the best Hip Hop albums of all time . A definate classic . Everyone who appreciates real hip hop ought to have this in their collection . Intelligent lyricism ( that 's why he 's known as & quot ; The Genius & quot ; ) , dope beats , and great Kung Fu sound clips make this a must for real hip hop headz .	1
Honestly This is one of the most perfect Wu-Tang Solo albums you can get ... What more can I say . Gza 's flow on this disc is just brilliant and the lyrics are tight as hell . The production by R to tha ZA is just ill from Liquid Swords to Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth this album is possibly one of the most overlooked hip hop albums of our time . It really is a crying shame that the Source did'nt give this 5 Mics because of all hip hop records this deserves it more than any Record . If you do n't have this album now ... then definetley cop it ... it 's a must have.1.Liquid Swords-10/10-Tight opening with the Shogun line . Pretty cool kung fu sample . The track itself is pretty tight , Ill beat and tight lyrics . Classic.2.Duel of the Iron Mic-10/10-Like Liquid Swords opens with a tight kung fu sample . Track itself is a Classic . The beat is sick and the lyrics between Gza and Masta Killa are tight.3.Living In The World Today-10/10-One of the hottest tracks on the record . Fly hook , tight lyrics , sick beat , Perfect all around.4.Gold-10/10-One of my favorite songs , The illest beat that I eva heard on a Wu Tang solo album , tight hook , and some crazy lyrics.5.Cold World-10/10-Opens with a Kung Fu sample and leads into a tight hook wich then slams into Gza 's rhyming . One of the most haunting songs on the album . Classic.6.Labels-10/10-Begins wif RZA talking about the rap game then leads into a really tight rhyme track by Gza.7.4th Chamber-10/10-Yet again opens with a kung Fu sample . Classic , one of the best on the album.8.Shadowboxin'-10/10-Really ill beat and some crazy rhyming from Jhonny Blaze and GZA . Just great all around , I garentee you 'll replay this one like 99 times in a row.9.Hell 's Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304-10/10-I do n't like tha opening but tha track itself is hot.Pretty tight beat but Gza 's lyrics on this one is just frantic and hot . Cop It.10.Investigative Reports-10/10-Ill , just Ill. Rae tha Chef does some tight verses on this and so duz Gza . Like I said Before ... Ill all around.11.Swordsman-10/10-Perfect with the beat , perfect with the rhymes , perfect with the hook . Perfect and Classic.12.I Gotcha Back-10/10-Tight hook , Tight Beat , Tight Track.13.Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth-10/10-My Favorite song on tha album . Just awesome , Killah Preist solo wif no GZA but still Mad Ill.Final Word : COP THIS JOINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
GZA is truly the Genius of the Clan , my all time favorite from the group . The GZA is the most sophisticaed and complex clan member of the group , he is the top 3 lyricst of the group ( GZA , Inspectah Deck , Masta Killa ) . Liquid Swords is a `` Classic '' album that creates an atmosphere which not a lot of albums can do . This is one of RZA 's best productions on a whole album , right next to `` Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... '' this album is one that will give you shivers while you are listening , its almost like a motion picture for your ears ( if you have a good imagination ) .I Admit that this album took me a while to love . Honestly this is not an album you will appreciate until you listen to it at least 2 or 3 time fully . While this is a classic album , there is no mainstream appeal whatsoever ( which is a VERY GOOD THING ) . I love that this album is considered a mainstream album but at the same time it could pass as an underground album . GZA 's lyrics take time to fully understand , I would recommend looking up the lyrics while your listening so you can fully understand what the hell GZA is talking about . I have listen to the album at least 9 or 10 times and I 've listened to the whole album , not just single songs . This album is a top 10 of all time for me . FOr all you mainstream lovers that adore Lil Wayne and the likes of him , look somewhere else because this album is too intellectual for people to comprehend and you wo n't enjoy it . As for the REAL Hip Hop listeners such as myself , its worth every penny , you will not get dissapointed.Top 5 Tracks -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -1 ) Duel of the Iron Mic2 ) Cold World3 ) Hell 's Wind Staff / Killah Hills 103044 ) Gold5 ) Liquid Swords	1
Some say its the best Wu individual release . I say it is the best . Some still do n't know about this album . Those naysayers that do n't think this is one of the best cd 's of all times.. well it was a tape when I was coming up . I am sure they are a fan of and a believer that Lil Flip LL or 50 or somebody like that is the greatest of all time . You know they believe in some false profit like that . Please put the flying guillotines away and know that some people are still analog . We Wu heads are too digital . In the words of Bobby Digital..That reminds me I need to write a review for that too . It gets no better than the first releases for the Wu .	1
its easy to declare any wu clansman as underrated ( with the exception of meth ) but i do believe gza along with ghost and rakewon are among the better emcee 's in hip hopduel of the iron mics starts the album off with a typical wu feel , that track along with gold , labels , investigative reports are classics.the other tracks are all solid , making this an album you can put on and leave it ... but they are just that solid . that is what puts this from 5 to 4 starsa great cd	1
GZA dropped something with this album that is very rare . It grabs you emotionally , you feel the intensity of the lyrics in your bones , and RZA 's beats set an atmosphere that sucks you into the record . I 've got nothing bad to say about the album ; GZA is really one of the most intelligent MC 's out there and sounds like a poetic guru the way he pours his rhymes out on this.- Most of the Clan guest on different songs on this and they for the most part deliver some of their best moments ever . Ol Dirty even appears here and does wonders for the song he guests on . If there was ever a sequel to the original `` Enter the 36 Chambers '' , I 'd have to say that `` Liquid Swords '' reminds me the most of it and in some ways even improves on the original formula.- This album is extremely intense and makes you think . It may have movie samples and talk about the streets but the GZA goes intellectual with his lyrics and has a way of getting you to hang on his every word . With RZA being paired with GZA in one way or another this entire album , it 's apparent that GZA brings out a side of RZA that I 'd like to hear more . `` B.I.B.L.E . `` , the last song on the album , is amazing in the sense that it makes a lot of valid points without losing flow or power and raises some questions that needed some awareness.Point is : If you own a couple Wu-Tang albums and do n't know where to go from where you 're at , go here and you 'll love this.Everybody who 's a fan of Wu-Tang knows what I 'm talking about already most likely.This is an album every rap fan should own in my opinion . Buy it .	1
this album is of course one of the best wu-tang solo albums ever , this album and ONLY BUILT FOR CUBAN LINX are both amazing and wortha five star rating .	1
People are right , this cd is a classic but I only gave it four stars because some of the beats on here just do flow right with GZAs crazy insane lyrics he spits on every song . Another problem is that there are only thirteen songs which to me , that with any rapper is just way to little.GZAs ' probably my favorite Wu-Tang mc lyrical wise along with Ghostface and Ol ' This happened to be one of my first Wu-Tang purchases , and I have to say , it wo n't be the last .	1
This album is one of the best rap albums ever . GZA weaves a tale and this makes the whole record coherent with a unique flow that only RZA can produce . Not only that , but the shaolin inserts are even interesting and intriguing , which is something few MCs understand how to do ...	1
& quot ; When I was litte , my father was famous . He was the greatest Samurai in the empire , and he was the Shogun 's decapitator . He cut off the heads of a 131 lords . It was a bad time for the empire ... & quot ; With this intro , spoken by a small child over husky , scratched strings , Genius/GZA explodes onto what is possibly one of the finest albums in Wu-Tang 's ( and therefore hip-hop 's ) collection . The keyboard loop on the title track builds tension without releasing it , creating an ( intentional ) musical headache that GZA 's voice cures like a double dose of aspirin . The album only goes on from there , with GZA and a few guests riding the dark horse of RZA 's production into the sunset . Possibly the peak of Wu-Tang , 'Liquid Swords ' still stands as one of the crown jewels of 90 's hip-hop , still somewhat undiscovered as it does n't have the flashy attraction of the other cubic zirconia on record store shelves .	1
The first Wu-Tang Clan album I bought is the essential debut that started it all , 36 chambers . I was blown away by the supreme lyrcicism and crafty production skills of the RZA . I was extremely impressed with Raekwon 's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx , Method Man 's Tical , and GFK 's Ironman . But the GZA 's Liquid Swords is something else entirely . The intellectualism on display here is exactly what I look for in a hip hop record . His rhymes are so poetic and captivating they just hook the listener in and you sink into the dark world of the Wu-Tang with the GZA as your narrator . RZA 's production is top notch especially on the chilling `` Cold World '' where the Genius is at his best featuring a top-notch verse from the Inspectah Deck . GZA 's skills as a lyricist are unmatched as it seems like he can throw 10 rhymes into a sentence with very little effort . I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear what hip hop should sound like . Incredible work by the GZA .	1
I listined to 36 chambers and all other solo projects from wu menbers except ugod cause he 's wack ... But man gza ? Diz guy is the best ... Liquid swords is one of those albums that will live on forever . Best tracks ? `` cold world '' , `` 4th chamber '' , `` shadowboxin '' a classic .	1
As has been said over and over again by many other reviewers , I feel this is the best Wu-Tang album , solo or as a group , period.GZA is the best lyricist of the group . He has a great delivery and writes great lyrics.It also has the best atmosphere in creating what the Wu-Tang wanted to be about : kung-fu vintage clips ; Rza 's razorsharp beats ; great lyrics and great songs.This is the best album that the Wu-Tang ever dropped , so it 's surprising that it is generally overlooked .	1
This album has the debut of GZA 's genius . Of the first course , his albums is the best executed and it is my favorite of the early Wu . However , Beneath the Surface has the better lyrics because it deals with more social problems on more of the tracks and is the most political of the second round of Wu solos . However , Liquid Swords is always on my rotation play because RZA is so dope and dangerous . Inspectah Deck is close in dopeness but RZA is the OG of the Wu , so you ca n't forget that . The Oriental sound of Liquid Swords is enoug h for me to date my girl for a Chinese meal seriously ... the dopeness is so romantic and Wu has this beautiful darkness is so appreciative and lovely definitely . The skits are cool too . I think that Liquid Swords has got to be one of the 10 best albums ever . In my book at least . Check out DJ X-Caliber at [ ... ] and peaze and I 'm out ...	1
The GZA is a lyrical swordsman . This guy says things that make you go back and think . This album , Liquid Swords , truly defines the classic Wu-Tang sound , just like the first Wu-Tang Clan album and the first Raekwon album before it . The GZA was at his absolute best on this album , and it shows in his lyrics . Here 's the review : Album Highlights : The entire album.Production : Thumbs up . Once again , The Rza cooks up another production masterpiece.Lyrics and Subject Matter : Thumbs up.Originality : Thumbs up.The Last Word : Other GZA albums after this have not lived up to this release . GZA released this at a good time in hip hop . Hip Hop music right now needs releases like this . Overall , this album is BRILLIANT . It 's the classic Wu-Tang sound in all of its glory , and for that I strongly recommend that you purchase this album .	1
While every Wu-Tang solo release is noteworthy for one reason or another , this flawless solo LP from GZA is of special note because , to my ears , it captures The RZA at a creative peak , soundwise . These tracks are truly atmospheric and deep , and there are , thankfully , no outside contributions , every track here is pure RZA . While Inspectah Deck has a great guest shot on my favorite track , `` Cold World '' ( ca n't you just listen to this song 1,000 times ? ) this is entirely GZA 's showcase and his intricate , brilliant wordplay , while somewhat measured in places , is stunning from start to finish . There is no filler here and the album does n't overstay it 's welcome , it 's simply perfect . A hip-hop classic .	1
Let me say , this is GZA 's second solo release . His first release `` Words From The Genius '' quickly went out of print and you cant find it anywhere so this is his `` main '' first album . What is there to say about it ? That its insanely good in so many ways . This album is grimey in so many ways its hard to explain ! Let me break down my opinions for you.The lyrics , GZA is the best lyricist out of Wu-Tang Clan . And this album can sure prove that . His lyrics are incredible . His rhyming schemes , he switches them up , uses different styles all the time its just hard to explain his rhyming abilities . He has so many good rhymes you cant `` oh that ones good '' cause they all are ! If you read the lyrics to this album and arent amazed then you probably like bubblegum rap or your just too ignorant to undertstand real emcees ! GZA 's lyrics and flow go perfectly with the production also . GZA put his heart into this album lyrically with everything he got . He speaks on the REAL topics that other emcees dont spit about . This by far is GZA 's best work and always will be . One of the best solo albums of all time.Production wise , man this is where the album is top notch . Dark , grimey all in one album ! There isnt one track on the album that isnt grimey , it all is ! RZA put his heart into producing this album . He did every single track and its great . Hard bangers , great loops following the beat . Most people love the album because of the production , and I dont criticize them for liking it , its HOTT ! Came out in 1995 , and its still MAD hott here 11 years later . Only if RZA still produced now like he did with this style . But trust me this production is off the chain ! RZA is the true production genius.Overall , this album is a must have . If ANYONE tells you anything negative about the album , they are ignorant . This album is awesome . Just read the reviews and you will notice that . Perfect lyrics and perfect production make a perfect album .

one of the reasons I love rap is for the visuals that some rhymes put in my mind.. more rappers ca n't than can give me good visuals.. GZA is one of the best at doing that for me and he is just a great rapper . It 's dark and scary sounding while at the same time pure hip hop . And everybody who guested on the album gives great visuals as well . This album has such an incredible vibe to it.. Plus , RZA did some of his best work on this album . the beats go with the rapping perfectly . if you like Wu-Tang clan , you need to get this/	1
`` Liquid Swords '' is a throwback to the days when 9 emcees from Shaolin Island , New York were just at the beginning of an iron rule over much of hip-hop . I am referring to , of course , The Wu-Tang Clan . Gza is the veteran of the group , as well as the lyrical eye of the storm . Dependable and consistent , The Genius ( as he is appropriately known ) is just that . A lyrical genius . Gza has been around the rap game for a considerable time . The only Wu-Tang member to have released solo before the collective 's seminal debut `` Enter the Wu-Tang : 36 Chambers '' with his debut `` Words from the Genius '' , Gza then proceeded to blow away the listening world with his performances on the clan 's debut . The time came for Gza 's sophomore solo release . The world was expecting , and boy did `` The Genius '' deliver . Even though his follow-up album , 1999 's `` Beneath the Surface '' was not all that good , `` Liquid Swords '' is an entity quite different ... Track Listing1 . Liquid Swords . ( 5 Stars ) 2 .

Don Henley is a great singer/songwriter and was in one of best bands of all time . This is great cd to chronicle some classic hits.1 . Dirty Laundry- 4 stars-catchy pop rock song2 .

The Eagles ' reunion , welcomed by most , shortcircuited the solo career Don Henley had to that point . With the Eagles , Henley played southern California 's John Lennon to Glenn Frey 's poppy Paul McCartney ; solo , he delivered pointed observations on decaying morals and lifestyles while Frey delivered drive-tape raveups like & quot ; The Heat Is On. & quot ; ( If the call-girl expose ' & quot ; You 'll Never Make Love In This Town Again & quot ; is to be believed , Henley knew that decadence first-hand . ) With stellar backup including members of Tom Petty 's Heartbreakers , Toto , Bruce Hornsby ( on the gorgeous & quot ; End of the Innocence & quot ; ) Sheryl Crow ( her backup vocals on the preposterous & quot ; Garden of Allah & quot ; ) Take 6 and even ex-Eagles , Henley guides us through a decade gone wrong . He spotlights ugly Americans overseas ( & quot ; All She Wants To Do Is Dance & quot ; ) , street crime ( & quot ; New York Minute & quot ; ) , insensitivity personal ( & quot ; The Last Worthless Evening , & quot ; & quot ; Heart of the Matter & quot ; ) and media-generated ( & quot ; Dirty Laundry , & quot ; ) . Throughout , Henley writes with character detail and empathy missing from Eagles ' chestnuts like & quot ; Desperado & quot ; and & quot ; Life In The Fast Lane. & quot ; The two new songs notwithstanding , & quot ; Actual Miles & quot ; serves as an audio photo album through the decade of Gordon Gekko and Ollie North , and establishes Henley in front of the drum kit as a first-rate singer-songwriter .	1
Though I prefer his work in The Eagles , I really love Don Henley 's solo work as well . He did n't have nearly as much hits on his own as he did with that band , but nonetheless quite a few of his solo recordings became very popular and made the Top 40 . `` Actual Miles : Henley 's Greatest Hits '' gives us 13 of those hit singles , and though it 's missing a few essential tracks , it still is a very good.Anyone interested in Henley 's solo work should find most of what they 're looking for on here . You get the big hits ( `` Dirty Laundry '' , `` The Boys Of Summer '' , `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' , `` The End Of The Innocence '' ) , popular radio hits ( `` Not Enough Love In The World '' , `` Sunset Grill '' , `` The Heart Of The Matter '' ) and a two very good ( then ) new tracks , `` You Do n't Know Me At All '' and `` Everybody Knows '' . So , if you 're a casual fan , you pretty much have all you need.However , there are a few glaring omissions . Henley 's first solo chart hit , `` Johnny Ca n't Read '' , has been omitted . Also , two big hits he did as duets with female solo artists . First , the number six hit `` Leather And Lace '' that he did with Stevie Nicks ( his onetime lover ) has been cut off . That 's sad since that is a song I love . Also , his number two smash duet with Patti Smyth , `` Sometimes Love Just Ai n't Enough '' has been cut off . Granted , thise songs were not on Henley 's albums but on his duet partner 's albums , but they still should have included them anyway . Also , I also would have settled for a solo perfomance of one his Eagles tracks , preferrably `` Hotel California '' . Also , since this collection came in 1995 , you wo n't get his 2001 hit `` Taking You Home '' .Other than these munor complaint , `` Actual Miles '' is an excellent representation of Henley 's solo career that should appeal to most .	1
Despite the cynical ( and hilarous ) cover , this is really quite an adequate Greatest Hits albums . It includes almost all of the best songs from Don 's solo career . I like Don Henley 's music because he 's honest , he 's not fooling anybody , and he tells you what he really thinks in his songs , instead of just catering to the audience like so many others . This is rare in an artist today ; you have to dig through an awful lot of boy bands and sell-outs to get to the Don Henleys , Roger Waters , and Bruce Springsteens . Anyway , this has most of Don 's best songs that are both lyrically cynical and honest as well as still managing to be melodic . Dirty Laundry , The Boys of Summer , New York Minute , etc . are all great tracks , and The Heart of the Matter ( one of my favorite ballads ) , The End of the Innocence , and others are flat out masterpieces . Buy this album if you want a good overview of Don 's solo career , although it is missing a few songs , which is why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 .	1
Actual Miles : Henley 's Greatest Hits being Henley 's greatest hits compilation release 1995 and contains hits from 1982 to 1995 . The album contains classic Henley tracks such as `` The Boys of Summer '' , `` Dirty Laundry '' , `` The End of the Innocence '' and `` The Heart of The Matter '' . The booklet is strange of used carsales man and I do not know what the point of this is . Only one track has the lyrics included but we do get linernotes written by Henley . We do get a list of the muisicians on each track but not what they play on each track . 4/5 .	1
I am a big fan of Don Henley with and without the Eagles , and while his social commentaries do get a bit tiresome at times , there is no denying the quality of the music , which is the bottom line for me . From the opening biting social commentary of & quot ; Dirty Laundry & quot ; to the closing unlisted track & quot ; Everybody Knows & quot ; , most of these tracks are stellar. & quot ; The Boys Of Summer & quot ; and & quot ; The End Of The Innocence & quot ; are two of Don 's biggest and best hits that are of course included here . In fact , every top 40 Don solo song that is not a part of a duet is here . In addition , none of the three new tracks are really ballads -- interesting since Don has had so many great slower hits.I take exception to those who think & quot ; I Will Not Go Quietly & quot ; should not be here . That is a great hard-rocking track that rock radio played a lot of in the summer of 1989 . To me , it helps to show the diversity that does in fact make up Don Henley 's great solo music.For sure , you ca n't go wrong if you are a fan of the Eagles and/or Don with this collection . While some of his hits are much better than others , this collection provides just what a greatest hits collection should provide -- all the biggest hits along with some great album tracks and interesting new material . Definitely a recommended purchase .	1
A missed track or two , but otherwise your basic & quot ; best of & quot ; . A good helping of songs from & quot ; End of the Innocence & quot ; , including the title track . Also important is & quot ; The Boys of Summer & quot ; , and & quot ; Sunset Grill & quot ; . My personal favorite would be & quot ; Dirty Laundry & quot ; though . I just love the way that song starts out . His cover of Leonard Cohens & quot ; Everybody Knows & quot ; is n't bad , but it 's hard to beat the original . The new songs are good , just not & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; good . The only thing that could make this any better , is if it was released in 2002 so it could include & quot ; Everything is Different Now & quot ; from & quot ; Inside Job & quot ; . That 's his last greatest hit .	1
Henley ` s solo collection is not a mixed bag of music . Actual Miles shines quality all over . From the opening track Dirty Laundry , with a very good tabloid critique of the media society , which still holds up today , to the last track . This CD shines.But how can you possible go wrong when you move into The Boys of Summer on Track 2 . You can realy feel the summer breeze shivering trough youre soul on this one . An open soundpicture with a somekind of air feel to with it . Uplifting . Track 4 It ` s not enough love in this world is also a winner . It ` s moody and have enough tempo upbeat to make you a happier human beeing . And the lyricks tell you things to think about too . But the real winner and my old time Henley favourite is Track 6 The End of the Innocence . The opening with the piano . It ` s pure music magic . And when Henley ` s voice is put in gear . This is what music should be . It ` s like a short movie in a way . Just close your eyes , and listening . Anyway if you new to Henley this one gives you an earopener when it comes to pure gold quality all trough	1
I always liked the Eagles , but I love Don Henley . He has the smoothest of voices and his songs are fantastic . This cd comprises some great hits that we all know and love . The one song I 'd like to see here ( which obviously could n't be on it because it was written and released after this was made ) is Taking You Home . That 's one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard . Other than that , there is Dirty Laundry , End Of The Innocence and New York Minute for us to enjoy . I love this cd and I love Don Henly . This is a must for any fan of his .	1
Well , my dragon escaped . Yes he did . This is what happens when your Metamorpho is called away to do publicity shots . I tell ya , that David Hemmings sure knows his way around a camera . Anyway , when I arrived home from London , I went to feed the dragon and found that he was n't there . To my total chagrin , I realized he had pulled a Shawshank Redemption stunt on me . The evidence was there . Looks like he breathed fire on the stone to weaken it , and used his claws to create an escape hatch . Of course , I did not suspect anything . But what a clever dragon ! Hiding the hole with a big poster of Playdragon of the Month over it ! Anyway , I had a private investigator get on his tail immediately . I found out that he took the chunnel to France . From there , he puchased a used car from a salesman that looked like Don Henley . The authorities then contacted me and said they had him cornered in the Cave of Lascaux . Of course , by this time , the car salesman was looking for him too . I guess he did n't like being paid in Drachmas . But , I ask you folks , what other currency would a dragon carry ? Anyway , on my trip through the Chunnel to fetch that snakey , surreptitious serpent ( 3 X fast people ! ) , I started on this review of Don Henley 's Greatest Hits called `` Actual Miles '' . I wonder where that idea came from ? Mental note to self : massive mental meditation ( 3 X fast again ) needed.Mr . Henley , as we know , is no stranger to the pop-rock arena . And with all the hooks he employs here , he solidifies his status as a true craftsman . Well , what do you want people ? If I had been an Eagle instead of a Seer , you 'd be buying my music instead of me giving away free reviews ! So have some respect , please ! But , back to the point , this is a fine collection of music . Mind you , it is not perfect , but for the most part , it is well done . Most of the tunes here are taken from his first 3 solo albums , with the bulk of the material coming from `` The End of the Innocence '' . As with Henley , and a box of chocolates , you 'll never know what you 'll get . He can give you social commentary with the looping organ parade in `` Dirty Laundry '' , the mild suggestion of reconnection in `` The Last Worthless Evening '' , the somber and sobering reality of `` New York Minute '' . But , take heart ! He also gives you many deadhead stickers on a cadillac ( I have one ! ) in his megahit `` The Boys of Summer '' ( listen for that almost imperceptible echo of the word `` Crazy '' on this ) . Also , a camraderie of good feelings down at the `` Sunset Grill '' .The thing about his music is how effectively he marries the mood with the message . The hop-jump sound of `` All She Wants to Do is Dance '' , totally makes sense , even as they drive poor Mr. Henley out of town . The semi-sweet piano of Bruce Hornsby is perfect for the breaking of fragile glass reality in `` The End of the Innocence . '' Digging even deeper in the dust , Henley pulls out the crown jewel of all his songs with `` The Heart of the Matter . '' What makes this such a remarkable achievement is that he sheds off all the illusionary garb that we all possess , and goes not only into the heart , but the soul of the matter . Knowing his own imperfection , and his own part in the matter , he reveals what is essential for any human failing . Forgiveness . But , not necessarily for her , but himself . That is the true value and insight this song brings to people who need to hear it.Unfortunately , I could have thought of a lot of other , worthy songs to fill out this c.d . He includes 3 new recordings , which , although interesting , somehow do n't seem to gel . I am sure some social commentary is behind `` The Garden of Allah '' , but it has never intrigued me enough to find out just what . The sarcasm and bitterness of his composition `` You Do n't Know Me At All '' , and the defeatism of Leonard Cohen 's `` Everybody Knows '' is just too blunt and does n't let you leave with a good feeling.Henley 's forte is to write a balance between wit , irony , lyrics and music to make the journey worthwhile , or somewhat relevant on many levels . For me , unfortunately , the songs sound dark and whining.In conclusion , a fine collection with a few drawbacks - thus the 4 star rating . Now , I better get back to business here . I am now outside the cave with the Henley look alike . He is lurking , leering , lambasting me ( 3 X fast people ! ) as I am trying to lure the dragon out of the cave . He 's not happy , I 'm not happy , and the dragon 's not happy . But , be honest people . You 're happy because I finally wrote this review ! Do n't be shy - admit it ! Stop dragon my heart of the matter around -- -- -- -- - Metamorpho ; )	1
but he writes some great music . This set gives you a great glimpse into his solo career . And , it 's the only place you can find & quot ; You Do n't Know Me At All , & quot ; and the maginifcently perverse & quot ; The Garden of Allah. & quot ; Henley is at his best when he 's being sarcastic , and this set shows that well . Not a bad track on the disc !	1
When The Eagles broke up in the 1980 's , two members landed outstanding solo projects . One of them was Don Henley . Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums , into one great package . The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill , and The Heart Of The Matter . It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah , is the so-called sequel to Hotel California . I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable , than its prequel . You Do n't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics . Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune . This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song : The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles , Don Henley proved to break down the walls , and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives . It is not the end of the innocence . It still is continuing on .	1
All but two of the recordings on this album are taken from four older albums : BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST ( 4 of 13 ) , THE END OF THE INNOCENCE ( 5 of 13 ) , I CA N'T STAND STILL ( 1 ) , and TOWER OF SONG ( 1 ) . That is , they 're the same recordings , not re-recorded or rearranged to 'get a musically superior version'.Speaking for myself , knowing that and being able to get `` Dirty Laundry '' with a sampling of songs from BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST is all I needed to know to persuade me that this album was worth pursuing . Henley 's got a gift for coupling good music with clever lyrics , and he sings clearly enough that I do n't have trouble following what he 's saying . ( Which means , of course , that the arrangements are n't drowning out the vocals with percussion , a plus . ) Four of the first five songs strike me as perfect for playing over the summer holidays in hot weather . `` Dirty Laundry '' ( from I CA N'T STAND STILL ) Good song to listen to when the scandal-mongers have been unusually busy in the media . `` I make my livin ' off the evenin ' news/Just give me somethin ' , somethin ' I can use/People love it when you lose/They love dirty laundry ... '' From BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST ( see ) : `` The Boys of Summer '' , `` All She Wants To Do Is Dance '' , `` Not Enough Love in the World '' , and `` Sunset Grill '' , of which the last is my favourite of this group . `` Let 's go down to the Sunset Grill/watch the workin ' girls go by/Watch the basket people walk around and mumble/stare out at the auburn sky ... '' From THE END OF THE INNOCENCE ( see ) : `` The End of the Innocence '' , `` The Last Worthless Evening '' , `` New York Minute '' , `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' , and `` The Heart of the Matter '' , the last of which is a contender for best breakup song . `` I 'm learning to live without you now/but I miss you sometimes/The more I know , the less I understand/All the things I thought I knew , I 'm learning again ... '' Really , if you like Henley 's music at all , you should know enough by know to persuade you whether this album is worth your time , if you do n't have the individual albums from which most of the songs were drawn . `` The Garden of Allah '' Recorded in 1995 ; the sense of the title is roughly any supposed earthly paradise . Fairly slow tempo , minor key as the Devil appears , lamenting simpler days past . `` Vainly reaching for the bottle full of empty Edens/branded specially for the ones/who had come with great expectations/to the perfumed halls of Allah/for their time in the sun ... '' '' You Do n't Know Me at All '' Breakup song . `` I gave you everything on a silver tray/Could 've been a fool forever , but I 'm not made that way/And after all these years , I think it 's time to say goodbye/I 'm doin ' you a favour , I will not help you live a lie/And believe me , if you think I 'm gon na catch you when you fall/you do n't know me , you do n't know me at all . `` `` Everybody Knows '' ( from TOWER OF SONG ) The only piece on this album that Henley did n't compose as well as perform .	1
Don Henley makes a masterpiece of his greatest hits , and even adds 3 new songs ( 2 of which I like a lot ) to the mix . He certainly does n't skimp on the good music in this fine collection . Starting off with & quot ; Dirty Laundry , & quot ; a biting track about the press , he never lets the listener down with is fine material from 3 albums . My personal favorites from this album- & quot ; The End of the Innocence & quot ; -a fantastic track , & quot ; New York Minute & quot ; -a really haunting song about rushing through life too fast , and & quot ; Not Enough Love In The World & quot ; -Henley on a falsetto , not bad . The new songs , especially & quot ; The Garden of Allah & quot ; ( a really funny track ) , are quite fine as well . The only thing that could have made this album better is the inclusion of & quot ; Johnny Ca n't Read , & quot ; & quot ; Sit Down You 're Rocking The Boat , & quot ; and his masterpiece duet with Patti Smyth & quot ; Sometimes Love Ai n't Enough. & quot ; Still , this is a fine album , one of the finest greatest hits albums I 've seen in a while ...	1
I 'm not really sure why I picked this up . I already have 9 of the 12 songs on the original studio albums . Only the big hit `` Dirty Laundry '' and the two new tracks `` The Garden Of Allah '' and `` You Do n't Know Me At All '' are tracks I did not already own . The two new tracks are both very good , with `` The Garden Of Allah '' particularly a standout track . Henley plays the devil in modern day Los Angeles . This is great stuff and an example of Henley at his best . `` You Do n't Know Me At All '' is another solid tune . There is also a cover of `` Everybody Knows '' thrown on to the end of the album , although it does not appear on the back cover . I do n't know if this is worth buying for the new songs alone if you already have Henley 's 3 studio discs up to this point in his career , but this is a nice compilation if you are just looking for an overview .	1
Shoulda included at least two of the following - `` Johnny Ca n't Read '' , `` I Ca n't Stand Still '' , `` Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed '' , `` If Dirt Were Dollars '' , and possibly `` How Bad Do You Want It ? '' Shoulda left out `` I Will Not Go Quietly '' , a stupid funk-metal number I never heard on the radio which only seems to be included here because it 's basically a duet with Axl Rose ( and two more incompatible voices you will not find ) . However , these missteps are more than made up for by the inclusion of `` New York Minute '' , an absolutely beautiful ballad that most non-Henley fans did n't even know existed until the Eagles covered it for `` Hell Freezes Over '' . I 'd have to say that the Eagles did it better with their perfect backing vocals and a great string section , but only marginally . As for the two new songs , `` The Garden of Allah '' , featuring Sheryl Crow prominently on background vocals , is a funky ( but too long ) commentary on THE story of 1995 , the O.J . Simpson trial . The highlight of the piece is the vocally-altered spoken-word commentary by `` the devil '' . The other new song , `` You Do n't Know Me '' , is kind of a throwaway ( a ballad would 've been a nice complement to `` The Garden of Allah '' ) , but does n't detract from an otherwise decent compilation .	1
After the Eagles ' first break-up , Don Henley and Glen Frey went right into solo-ville , and it was apparent who the Lennon and McCartney personalities in the band were . Frey exited straight to sappy love songs and high-energy/low-calorie rock , while Henley 's first singles were the socially targeted `` Johnny Ca n't Read '' and `` Dirty Laundry . '' While Frey had the first hits , it is Henley 's solo albums that have stood the test of time.When his second solo album , `` Building the Perfect Beast , '' was issued , there was an instant classic with `` The Boys Of Summer . '' Written about those for whom life in the fast lane had become a driveway full of SUV 's , it contained a bitter melancholy and the striking lyric `` I saw a deadhead sticker on a Cadillac . '' This was the kind of thoughtful rock that The Eagles occasionally slipped onto their albums , but in a more wizened and weathered point of view . `` All She Wants to Do Is Dance '' continued that social malaise , but the self-depreciating `` Not Enough Love In The World '' backtracked when it came to relationships . `` I 'm not easy to live with , I know that it 's true.You 're no picnic either , baby.That 's one of the thingsI love about you . `` Axl Rose , who was at his GnR finest even snarled along on `` I Will Not Go Quietly . '' No saccharine here , folks . The followup album , `` The End of the Innocence '' is a masterpiece and much darker than `` Beast . '' `` New York Minute '' follows urban violence while `` Sunset Grill '' chronicles urban decay from the first person . But the kicker was the title song , with the stately Bruce Hornsby piano line supporting a grown man 's look back with longing . Not the usual longing , because the collapse comes from such issues as the lawyers who `` dwell on small details since Daddy had to fly . '' It paints one of the most succinct picture of The Reagan Years in a small cluster of artists who tried . ( Another favorite of that period , David + David 's `` Boomtown . '' ) `` Innocence '' was such an amazing album that Henley took almost 15 years before he issued `` Inside Job . `` The new songs are OK , no big deal really . There are a few MIA tracks , like `` Johnny Ca n't Read '' and Henley 's version of `` Sit Down You 're Rocking The Boat . '' But that is a small complaint . With music as uniformly good as that on `` Actual Miles , '' this is one late model CD that you will be fine with on your road trips .	1
Usually remix albums are a horrible thought . Very rarely do they deliver a complete experience and most remixes these days seem to just take one line out of a song and repeat it over a crummy breakbeat . However , Supersexy Swingin ' Sounds is more like another interpretation of one of the best albums out there , Astro Creep 2000 . All the sings from Astro Creep are remixed here ( excluding Creature Of The Wheel and I Zombie ) plus a remix of `` I 'm Your Boogie Man '' which originally appeared on the Crow City Of Angels soundtrack . All the mixes on here sound awesome , I do n't think there is a track on here I do n't like . I pretty much wore out my Astro Creep CD , so this is a new way of listening to it . My favorite remix would have to be the Wine , Women & Song Mix of `` El Phantasmo & the Chicken Run Blast-O-Rama '' which just almost surpasses it 's original ( It 's also pretty much the theme song of a radio station here ) . If you are a fan of White Zombie 's or Rob 's work , I strongly recommend you pick this up . It 's not like other remix albums and I promise it wo n't disappoint .	1
This is a remix masterpiece . As Boston says , `` Just listen to the record . ''	1
White Zombie was/is one of the few 90 's metal bands that I could actually listen to and enjoy . In an age of Pearl Jam and Sum 41 , Rob Zombie along with Kid Rock and Metallica were pretty much the only options for 70 's and 80 's style music . White Zombie is super occult and sex minded with extremely racy lyrics that I can not write here . If you want to get raucous , rawdy , and rebellious , NOTHING comes close to a good White Zombie album . Jam out to this in your car on a road trip or at a party . Zombie combines electronica , club , techno , and synth with CRUSHING metal jams . More Human than Human is just one example . Serious metal with an electronica twist ! My favorite sounds ever !	1
First off , let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release ( hubba-hubba ! ) . They used several full color adult pin-ups from ( would have to be ) the late '60 's era . I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep : 2000 ' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune . Totally dug the after dark mix of `` Electric Head Pt . 2 '' , the raw mix of `` Grease Paint And Monkey Brains '' and the ass-kicking wine , women and song mix of `` Blood , Milk And Sky '' the most . Great compilation CD .	1
This , you should know , is an album full of remixes . That said , know that it is also beyond decent , very good in fact . If you like White Zombie and do n't mind electronic music , definitely pick up this album . Many of the remixes rely on some electronic bases to deliver the goods , but it is welcome and it fits as you will see if you purchase this album . Very nice stuff .	1
Remix albums are most of the time not done too well ( see Rob Zombie 's `` American Made Music to Strip By '' ) , but this is the only case I have come across where a remix album is quite good . The songs from `` Astro Creep 2000 '' are remixed pretty good , adding a techno vibe to the songs , plus there is a cover of `` I 'm Your Boogieman '' which is also on `` The Crow : City of Angels '' soundtrack . Sadly though , this was White Zombie 's last official recording before their untimely breakup .	1
Usually re-mixes bore the hell outta me and for the most part I do n't see the point ? If you have a good cd/song , why mess with it ? Why take good songs and destroy them completely ? Examples , Yes and Queen re-mixes come to mind just off the top of my head as really bad attempts at this . Anyway this is not the case here . Sure their are a few short comings , but for the just cranking it up at parties factor this cd rocks and the girl 's a nice touch as well.Overall a decent attempt that deserves some notice .	1
i usually listen to metal when it comes to rock music . i 'm a metalhead , so generally my attitude towards punk is like AH ! ! GOOD CHARLOTTE 'S GAY ! ! ! but then i realized , like with any type of music , you have to search for the good stuff ; it 's like with rap , people think Chingy and crap like that , but then there 's Atmosphere , Sage Francis , and Cage ( `` the good stuff '' ) . i actually found this cd is my friends car , i borrowed it from him and gave it a try . i played it and i fell in love with it . my favorite song is `` dig up her bones . '' that song really got my attention because it was strong , it was hard , and it hit you in the face . the feeling i got was the same feeling you get after listening to guns n roses `` welcome to the jungle '' it hits you right from the beginning . the chorus brought me to jump up with the music . another good track on here is `` do n't open 'til doomsday . '' a simply amazing song , and a simple amazing album . each track is fast , and hard hitting . from beginning to end , Misfits , take you on a rollercoaster ride . it does n't stop , it does n't pause . the whole record just keeps going , on and on and on . this album is an amazing piece of work and anyone who wants to listen to real punk rock needs to pick up this album . this is the closest to 80 's The Clash and Sex Pistols punk as you 'll get .	1
No Danzig . Boo hoo . Would everybody feel better if there were no Misfits at all ? For everyone who is so loyal to Danzig , I ask you this . Who loves the Misfits more ? You or Glenn ? The answer is you if you are a fan . Glenn abandoned the Misfits . He fought with bandmembers over cheeseburgers for crying out loud ! If you like Glenn then go follow Glenn 's career . If you are a true fiend , stick with the 'Fits . I 'll be honest , I was more disappointed when Doyle left , then when Danzig did.OK on to the album . If this is the first Misfits album you have purchased without Glenn ( like me ) , then at first listen you may feel a need to check your CD player to see if you are playing the right album . Your mind may think to itself `` What ? ... ... .what is this I hear ? ... ... ..Is it ? ... .No it could n't be ... ... ... Wait it is ! I hear it ! Production ! ! `` That 's right friends and neighbors . The Misfits actually had the money , equipment , and sound engineers to properly record and produce and album . Gone are the days of the muffled drums , lost bass lines , and hard to hear vocals . It is a real album . Doyle 's playing is awesome I love it . Dr. Chud is my favorite Misfits drummer , even though I really like Robo too . Jerry 's playing is tight and Michale Graves sings very well , but to me his singing blossomed on the Misfit 's next release 'Famous Monsters'.The songs here are good , again it 's the Misfits , not Electric Light Orchestra or Kansas . The songs are fast ( 17 songs in 40 minutes you do the math ) . Subject matter is of course B monster and sci-fi movies . Highlights for me are `` Invaders from Mars '' , `` Dig up her Bones '' , `` Shining '' , and I really like `` Do n't Open 'till Doomsday '' .Hey like I said , times change . Maybe one day Glen and Jerry can bury the hatchett , and Doyle will come back to the fold . KISS , Black Sabbath , and even Van Halen have reunited . Never say never , chances are Glen and the Misfits will perform again . Until then , be a true fiend and celebrate everything Misfits .	1
American Psycho is a great bridge between `` classic '' Misfits & the `` resurrected '' Misfits : all of the energy and none of the profanity . `` American Psycho '' has all of the things that made The Misfits great : -Sing-along choruses-Horror themed lyrics-Relentless energyBut what the album really does is improve on the old ideas . Jerry & Doyle can actually play their instruments now and being backed by Dr. Chud 's thundering drums and Michale Graves haunting screams really gives the band a great heavy , full sound.The stand-out songs are : `` Speak of the Devil '' , `` Dig Up Her Bones '' , `` Crimson Ghost '' , `` Day of the Dead '' and `` Do n't Open Til Doomsday '' .Also , the hidden track `` Hell Night '' is pretty catchy.This is a great album in it 's entirety , but the `` resurrected '' Misfits did n't really find their own sound until `` Famous Monsters '' which is definitely their best.Buy this album and prepare to shout along .	1
& quot ; American Psycho & quot ; introduced the & quot ; new & quot ; version of the Misfits which included original bassist Jerry Only , longtime guitarist Doyle , and new members drummer Dr. Chud and singer Michale Graves . Graves ' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig 's , but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig 's writing and musical talents . However , & quot ; American Psycho & quot ; is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans . The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics , and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves ' voice sounds fantastic . Standout tracks include the title track , & quot ; From Hell They Came & quot ; , & quot ; Mars Attacks & quot ; , & quot ; Hate the Living , Love the Dead & quot ; , and the excellent & quot ; Dig Up Her Bones & quot ; . All in all , longtime fans may not dig & quot ; American Psycho & quot ; or any of the newer material bearing the Misfits name , but all together this is a solid album .	1
This CD is definetely a must own for any Misfits fan/fiend/whatever . Released in 1997 , this CD features classics such as `` Dig Up Her Bones '' , `` Mars Attacks '' , `` Shining '' , and `` Black Light '' . Okay , so Michale Graves ' ca n't sing as well as Danzig . But , hey . Not many Punk vocalists can sing better than Danzig . Michale 's aggressive howls and cries sound well blended in with sharply-tuned guitars and bass . The drums are also decent . Pick this one up along with Famous Monsters .	1
Does it sound like The Misfits ? Yes and no . If you heard this album not knowing what it was you would think it 's a thrash/punk group heavily influenced by The Misfits . Naturally , fans rejected this on general principal kinda like when Saved By The Bell switched it 's entire cast . Even if they did like it , they would n't admit it to anyone-too much pride . Jerry Only took a big risk resurrecting this group ; I mean , come on , he had to know he 'd ruffle alot of feathers . Well , he did it , and personally I think the results were impressive . Did they sell out ? No more than Danzig on his last three albums . As a matter of fact , The Misfits are sticking to their guns ( with a few modifications of course ) , and not trying to be Trent Reznor ( Danzig 5 ) or Machine Head ( Danzig 6 ) . Come on , Danzig practically renounces his Misfits days , I would n't want him in the new lineup if I were Jerry . His ego destroyed the band the first time around . Graves may not be the singer Danzig was , but he 's unique to be sure . Regardless of any negativity you read or hear about American Psycho or Famous Monsters , the songs are catchy ... .really catchy . A little more schlocky , a little more metal influenced , but infectious . The band on Psycho and Monsters has since broke up and The Misfits are reduced to Jerry and a few select Black Flag and Ramones members . On those two albums I think Only was on to something , but with the band already gone I think he is truly beating a dead horse now and should quit . So , if you have repect for the band members other than Danzig ( yes , there were other members , and do n't try to tell me that Danzig wrote every lyric and every note regardless of his claims ) , ignore that little devil on your shoulder saying , `` No , you wo n't like this ! Danzig 's not on it ! `` , and check this and Famous Monsters out . It may not hit you like the classic albums , but I doubt you 'll really hate it .	1
Boy was I surprised at this album ! This is GREAT ! I got `` Firecracker '' as part of a package of 3 CD 's - I really bought the package for the other 2 CD 's , but I like this one the best ! I had heard `` I Do '' on the radio , and I liked it , but I had no idea that Lisa Loeb is really a force to contend with in her musical talent . She writes great songs , based primarily in acoustic guitar , with intelligent lyrics . Even further , her voice is absolutely angelic.Many of these songs are simply beautiful . To single a few of them out , however , would serve as an injustice to the others . I have had this album in my CD player consistently since I got it.I thoroughly enjoy this disc , and I am definitely buying other music from Lisa Loeb . She is the real thing - writing great songs , playing the guitar , and singing as well as the best of them . This one is a keeper !	1
Lisa Loeb 's second album , Firecracker has 12 great tracks but some of the songs took awhile to grow on me but songs I loved right away include : Falling in Love , Jake , I Do , Let 's Forget About It , Truthfully , Furious Rose , This and How . Loeb has a beautiful and rich voice , her lyrics are poetic and haunting . From the song Falling in Love , `` The gray sky was romantic 'cause he was holding her hand , he was her man , the time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love . '' The title-track gives me the chills , the chorus is amazing . Truthfully is such a gentle and sweet song , so much better than I thought it was , `` You showed up with your parachute ... '' If you like deep , meaningful , and poetry-like lyrics then Firecracker is for you .	1
My only knowledge of Lisa Loeb a few weeks ago was that I had seen a cable interview of her . Glasses to me are a turn on with the right person , but that 's all I knew of her . So when I see this CD at a garage sale , with this & quot ; just been boinked & quot ; look on the cover , it was certainly worth giving it a try . This collection of songs is currently number one as new find of the year for me.What she does is probably my favorite kind of music . I like the singer-songwriter combination , because you can see exactly what the writer had in mind . Just give me a table in a small club , and the performer with a guitar , and I 'm set for the evening.Of course , the songs have to work for it to work . The most important component in music is the songwriting , and very few people have the talent . Ms. Loeb definately has the talent . Practically every song on the album has a hook that she grabs from several angles , and keeps working . That 's the stuff that grabs your attention . Songs like & quot ; I Do & quot ; and & quot ; Truthfully & quot ; work this very well.But she also shows a great amount of depth with songs like & quot ; Falling in Love & quot ; . This story of how easy it is to fall for someone , but lines like & quot ; The time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love & quot ; shows a wisdom beyond her years . From what I can tell , her other works seem to be also quite good , and I promise myself to rise above garage sale level to seek out more works by this talented artist.Just hope she does n't switch to contact lenses .	1
this is a great cd . every single song on this cd is great.it is nothing like her last album ( tails ) . this is muchmore thought out with some great lyrics that actuallyconvey some type of emotion without being too sappy . goout and buy this album as it is awesome .	1
A fine singer-songwriter with a sweet , candy-coated voice that belies the 29 years old that she was when she made this album , Lisa Loeb first hit big with the song `` Stay '' from her 1995 album `` Tails , '' and established herself as a talented and heartfelt lyricist . This album , in my opinion , is best carried by songs like `` I Do '' and `` Falling In Love , '' which have sunny guitars and her most cheerful , upbeat singing , but even dark , brooding selections like `` Furious Rose '' and `` Jake , '' are beautifully written and sang with sincere , lilting angst .	1
Lisa Loeb returned with her sophomore album FIRECRACKER in late 1997 . Her excellent debut TAILS would be a hard act to follow , but she followed up with an equally good album , if not better than its predessor . Starting with the opening track , the first single , & quot ; I Do & quot ; which is an infectuous song that will stay in your head for a long long time . The time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love . That line from the song & quot ; Falling In Love & quot ; shows the mastery behind her poetic and beautiful lyrics . & quot ; Wishing Heart & quot ; is a beautiful song about following your heart and knowing what you want . & quot ; Jake & quot ; is an interesting song about a guy named Jake , and she is trying to escape him . She uses abstract language in this song which makes it even more powerful . Lisa 's ability to use abstact lyrics and to tie it in with pop/rock melodies which are catchy and captivating at the same time . FIRECRACKER is above and beyond many other albums out at the time , however , it was not very well received , which is a shame . Other highlights include & quot ; Dance With The Angels & quot ; , & quot ; Lets Forget About It & quot ; , & quot ; Split Second & quot ; and & quot ; Firecracker & quot ; . Give it a try .	1
I do n't know of a more beautiful song than Lisa Loeb 's 'How ' . It is perfect , brilliant and captivating . I love every inch of it . & quot ; Firecracker & quot ; is Lisa 's second album and it does a great job . Some of the songs I do n't see fit for this album but most of the songs do the CD justice . I love Lisa 's vocals and acoustic sound . The opener 'I Do ' is also an amazing song , especially for an opener .	1
This is a great sophomore effort from Lisa Loeb . You will find Lisa experimenting with strings/orchestra arrangements which adds a certain quality to the CD that is n't found on the first album , `` TAILS . '' This CD was one that grew on me . The more you listen to the songs and hear all the production and work that went into each track , you appreciate it more and more ! You realize why it was nominated for a Grammy for `` best engineered album - non classical '' or whatever they call the category ! Be on the look out for Lisa Loeb 's new , THIRD album , `` CAKE AND PIE '' ... In my opinion , it is one of her best CD 's so far ! `` EAT YOUR VEGETABLES NOW BECAUSE DESSERT IS ON ITS WAY ! ''	1
1 . Madness is pop fun with loud horns 2 . & quot ; Wings of a Dove & quot ; ( A Celebratory Song ) is a wonderful Caribbean-sounding blast 3 . & quot ; One Step Beyond & quot ; is a ska materpiece 4 . & quot ; Micheal Caine & quot ; is a twisted delight 5 . Madness completely trancends its '80s roots 6 . That said , & quot ; Our House & quot ; is a dance classic 7 . Unlike a lot of 80 's stuff ( like most Time-Life collections ) this is disc is nicely remastered 8 . If you have only heard & quot ; Our House , & quot ; you 're in for a treat - Madness is so much more than a one-hit wonder 9 . It 's goofy 10 . It 's fun	1
Multi-talented singer/songwriter Tony Carey , who makes his home in Germany , recorded two terrific progressive pop/rock albums in the early 80 's under the group name Planet P ( later re-christened Planet P Project ) . This self-titled debut album from 1983 , with Carey writing all the songs , playing most of the instruments , and singing lead vocals on all but one song , is an awesome piece of work , combining a strong pop sensibility & amp ; great hooks with dramatic , keyboard & amp ; guitar-driven progressive rock that reminds me of Pink Floyd and the Alan Parsons Project . The songs are all excellent , especially & quot ; Static , & quot ; & quot ; Armageddon , & quot ; the MTV favorite & quot ; Why Me ? , & quot ; & quot ; Send It In A Letter , & quot ; and & quot ; Only You And Me & quot ; ( with guest lead vocals by David Thomas ) . Tony Carey would totally top himself with Planet P Project 's ambitious 1984 follow-up , the double concept album & quot ; Pink World. & quot ; But this self-titled debut is an awesome album all on it 's own , and it remains one of 1983 's very best releases .	1
Planet P Project forgotten by most years ago thrives in today 's music spectrum . Listen to the hip populist music of today ... Radiohead , NIN , Coldplay , Remy Zero . Planet P belongs of this time . A concept album crafted and unique . Give it a try , I can assure you that you will spend a lot more for other discs that you will enjoy much less . This CD is best when listened to as a whole ... while there were singles released in 1983 the songs form a journey that is best taken in the dark , cool , calm of night . Loaded with 80 's fears of atomic wars and cold wars the work is somewhere between Floyd and Bowie ... .Give this a shot , you wo n't be let down .	1
While many have compared Planet P Project to other prog rock bands one thing that still amazes me is how fresh the material still sounds ! Carey was able to produce an album that could convey a space or futuristic rock theme without relying on pure cold synthesized gimmickry that was prevalent in the early 80 's . It 's awesome 80 's early rock ; pure and simple . On the whole this is one album that has been a favorite of mine all these years due to it 's atmospheric and rich-hook laden lyrics and musicianship . Fans of Pink Floyd , Alan Parsons , and even Enigma may be quite intrigued by this now 20 year old release with one of it 's most captivating early MTV videos of Why Me ? ...	1
I love this music . I listened to it when I was in my teens and I thought it was the coolest . Tony Carey is awesome ! Some say this is suppose to be a more perfect version of The Wall and if you listen , you can hear it a little . I simply think it 's a techno sound rock album from an era where we had too much over engineered music . Then again , Planet P is over engineered as well ...	1
I had to get this CD again , after first having had it on vinyl well over a decade ago.Believe it or not , I can remember well a number of the tracks , despite not having heard them this whole time . 'Static ' in particular sticks out for me . A haunting rendition of moody , post-holocaust science fiction , one can almost feel the desolation in the atmosphere . If you ever have to contemplate nuclear war and its mind boggling aftermath , you should do so while listening to this song ! Just thinking of Planet P Project gets my creative imaginative juices flowing . I used to curl up with a good science fiction novel with this on the stereo -- and nothing has been quite the same since .	1
I remember when Planet P Project first release the debut lp . It was something that was really hard to label for sure . Then I went and purchased the CD in the 90 's . The sound was OK and did not offer any additional bonus tracks . This re-master with bonus tracks is just , as Dick Vitale would say , `` awesome baby . '' While some of the songs have a slowed tempo you really have to appreciate how well crafted the tunes are . Sadly , Planet P really did not do anything that came close to this release commercially or creatively . This IS the CD to have with the bonus tracks and it being remastered shows the true strengths of this release .	1
PLANET P is a great progressive rock/pop album recorded mostly by singer/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Tony Carey . Unlike his albums under his own name , which are more pop-oriented and rooted in bands such as Survivor , Shooting Star , and Asia , this one sounds a great deal like the Alan Parsons Project and features extended pieces . Carey sings lead on all but one song here , and the lyrics explore a theme that would be even more pronounced on Planet P 's follow-up , PINK WORLD : anxiety over Albert Einstein 's work with nuclear physics being used to eliminate the human race . The songs here describe the fears of the Cold War generations , and anyone who was a teenager or adult before glasnost should own this CD .	1
It 's almost impossible to avoid the fact this album starts with a bang with it 's best know song that also doubles as Wang Chung 's signiture hit `` Everybody Have Fun Tonight '' , a song that if I had n't owned the 45 since I was six years old and had it 's music and lyrics memorized to a tee I would'nt have bothered buying this . Now myself being an album lover as opposed to being into individual hit singles it always interests me to see how a pop ALBUM as opposed to a pop SINGLE can work . And trust me a pop album can work , anytime and in any decade if done well . Now this album is absolutely nothing like any of the other Wang Chung albums before it . Produced by J.Geils Band singer Peter Wolf this , as with all their music the sense of songcraft is high and the basic framework is intact but the production is absolutely polished to a near perfect sheen and therefore the soul/pop elements of their sound are puffed up to a huge degree . In fact the majority of this album does n't exactly follow the excitable , uptempo pop/funk/rock sound of the lead off song and focuses more on moodier pieces all taken at more of a medium tempo such as `` Hypnotize Me '' , '' The Flat Horizon '' , '' Betrayal '' and `` Let 's Go '' . Every area of the sound on these songs is spoken for , either with instrumentation or vocal fills so the empty spaces are not quite prominant as it would be in most new wave style pop . And perhaps it was just as well . By the mid 80 's the new wave sound was on the wane as most of the bands developed either a soul-funk and/or an adult contemporary oriented sound by the end of the decade as the sounds that would later become known as alternative rock began to outshadow them commercially . This elegancy and more obviously dance/R & B oriented music also showcases more singers and musicians than usual such as Michael McDonald 's presense on the more edgy funk of `` A Fool With No Money '' . Some of the songs do catch a little more fire such as the somewhat Motown/Chicago inflected rhythm of `` Eyes Of The Girl '' and the vibrant , polyrhythmic `` head '' style funk groove of the more topical `` The World In Which We Live '' . It may be a bit more streamlined and glossy than earlier Wang Chung albums but that does n't make it any less important ; just different and maybe a bit more obviously radio friendly . Lucky it does so in a way that 's very appealing to listen to .	1
i used to have this on record . i was thrilled to finally find it on cd . this whole album is great .	1
Wang Chung never was that great a success , even within 80 's dancepop , but they had some memorable hits . This is a great representative sample of what they were capable of , including the incredibly catchy Everybody Have Fun Tonight ( one of the best song titles ever ) . Only the mediocre A Fool And His Money and Betrayal hold it back .	1
wang chung had a huge hit with everybody have fun tonight in 1987. they had two more hits that year . let 's go ! and hypmotise me . other songs i like are betrayl , a fool and his money , eyes of the girl , and the world in which we live . i love mosaic by wang chung , because it has a good mix of pop , rock , and dance musc i think you will like . ed wilson	1
Let me indulge readers in an alternative perspective of Wang Chung . The other reviews here seem to rubberband between worshipfulness and thrashing . How about a more reasonable , more objective view ? I remember seeing the video for `` Dance Hall Days '' from their 1984 album `` Points On The Curve '' as my first exposure to Wang Chung . I was unaware at the time that they already had a previous album.In 1985 , I was aware of `` To Live And Die In L.A. '' and saw the video for the title track ( and later the film by William Friedkin -- The Exorcist , The French Connection ) .In October 1986 , `` Everybody Have Fun Tonight '' was inescapable , and to a 13 year old kid like myself the video was unique and the song was infectious . `` Let 's Go '' was the second single/video , and I was sold . I saw Jack and Nick at an in store signing at Sound Warehouse in Aurora , Colorado in March 1987 . The third single , `` Hypnotize Me '' was also good , and was used in the film `` Innerspace '' with Dennis Quaid and Martin Short.All eight songs on Mosaic are well produced and arranged . If you did n't like the New Wave sound of the 1980s , then you probably wo n't like `` Mosaic '' . I thoroughly enjoy the punk/New Wave sound , so 20 years later , I still enjoy `` Mosaic '' . `` A Fool And His Money '' I think of as being the weakest track . Otherwise , `` The Flat Horizon , `` The World In Which We Live '' , `` Betrayal '' and `` The Eyes Of The Girl '' are all solid numbers . Unfortunately , `` Mosaic '' would prove to be the pinnacle of Wang Chung 's career.In 1989 , I was quick to buy their next album `` The Warmer Side Of Cool '' , which may surpass `` Mosaic '' artistically . However , by 1989 , many popular artists of the 1980s were being snubbed by radio and MTV/VH1 , and so Wang Chung disappeared from view.I have `` Strictly , Inc. '' with Jack Hues and Tony Banks ( of Genesis ) from 1995 which received no recognition . Then their Greatest Hits was released in 1997 with a new track `` Space Junk '' which I felt showed great promise , but there was to be no new album.In June 2005 , after I thought they 'd vanished into the annals of pop music history , Jack and Nick showed the world once more that they are trained experts at their craft when they performed on the television show `` Hit Me Baby One More Time '' covering Nelly 's `` Hot In Herre '' with the precision of a surgeon . There was talk of a new Wang Chung album ( which I 'd snap up in a minute ) , but alas , a year has come and gone and no new album.And so those of us who appreciate Jack and Nick 's vision have to deal with derision from anti-80 's music snobs who are in no position to judge music they were n't old enough to experience the first time around or who were old enough , but preferred hair bands or the fledgling , underproduced rap music of the day.I give `` Mosaic '' four stars because I never felt Wang Chung were allowed to reach their true potential , but what they did leave behind is pure melodic New Wave/romanticism that no one seems capable of duplicating 20 years later . It was another time and another place 20 years ago , and while there is a new Neo-New Wave music crowd burgeoning , I have n't heard anything remotely similar to what Wang Chung were able to devise .	1
As quite often happens with me , I bought MOSAIC for a single song - `` Everybody Have Fun Tonight '' , the only one I recall ever hearing before buying the album and the most famous of the lot - and ended up liking a couple of the other songs even better than the original raison d'etre of the album . Out of the eight songs , I 'm very fond of four , which is a pretty good hit rate by my standards.Jack Hues ( the lead vocalist on `` Everybody Have Fun Tonight '' ) is lead vocalist throughout , and most of the songs have approximately the same mix of vocals , give or take throwaway lines . `` Everybody Have Fun Tonight '' Original 1986 recording ( ouch , that it 's been that long ) , has n't been given any new ill-advised `` musically superior '' arrangement . `` Hypnotize Me '' Forgettable . `` Just shine the light in my eyes/And hypnotize me love . `` `` The Flat Horizon '' I 'm fond of this one , though I have to say I had to read the lyrics before I had a good grasp of all that was being said . `` Oh this line is the flat horizon/and you are the shape on the left/Oh this line is the flat horizon/And this is the sun in the sky/Oh this line is the flat horizon/and makes the great divide/between heaven and angels/and earth and man . `` `` Betrayal '' Minor key as sax dominates the accompaniment , very sad while being a good song . `` Let 's Go '' - One of my three favourite songs on here ; surprising that it is n't played more often on weekday mornings . Very cheerful and upbeat . `` I wish you 'd drop what you 're doing/And get on the case/We could blow this existence/Right out into space ... '' '' Eyes of the Girl '' - Fast 4/4 tempo , dominated by snare and guitar . `` Tears fall from the eyes of the girl/and the girl is watching me . `` `` A Fool and His Money '' - `` Just like a fool and his money/Just like a fool , I let it slip away '' . Slower tempo , but with guitar rather than keyboards dominating the instrumental accompaniment , and with a different mix of supporting vocalists . `` Betrayal '' is much more effective at conveying heartbreak ; Jack Hues does n't sound like he really cares about the subject of the song here . `` The World in Which We Live '' - The longest song on the album at over 7 minutes ( the others average about 4 minutes 45 seconds ) , arguably the most obscure ( the unexpurgated lyrics are n't a help there ) , and yet the song that gives the album its name . While the tempo seems much faster than that of the other songs due to the driving percussion , it 's actually about the same beat as `` Let 's Go '' with a lot more energy . `` The world in which we live/the world in which we all are depends/whoever would forgive/the way we treat the world in which we live/Chorus : The world is a mosaic upon a golden floor/Moving silently , darkly through space/and our lives are the fragments and all that 's gone before ... ''	1
I bought this in cassette form when it came out in '86-'87 . I played it so much that when I wanted to play it a year ago it would not play anymore . So , I bought the cd and it still sounds great . You can only beat the price if you buy it used !	1
Sure , Michael Jackson , Culture Club and Wham sold more ! But what song is more of an indictment of the decade than & quot ; Everybody Have Fun Tonight & quot ; ? Wang Chung , anyone ?	1
I was at Michigan State when I picked up this album in the discount bin ( do n't ask ) across the street at the local [ store ] . I bought it for [ $ ] and I was blown away , I mean I was expecting a somewhat cheesy album to buy just for camp value but I was pleasantly surprised . The tracks especially `` Hypnotize '' were pretty good . I understand it 's pretty hard to find this album now . I just checked out the discount bin , imagine that .	1
It 's more than likely that the single Everybody have fun tonight ... & quot ; is the one most people will be familiar with but this album was one of the classic 80 's albums ( and there were such a lot ... ) .I managed to get this on CD last year after having it on vinyl for ages and then losing it . Wang Chung never got the recognition in the UK that they had in the US , I remember a reviewer of & quot ; Points On The Curve & quot ; writing them off as too American , and that was with the class & quot ; Dance Hall Days & quot ; on there as well.The uptempo songs such as & quot ; Everybody ... & quot ; , & quot ; Hypnotise Me & quot ; ( English spelling ) and & quot ; Let 's Go & quot ; are all worth the money , but my favourite song on here is & quot ; Betrayal & quot ; . This ballad is a moving song about a guy who married his child-hood sweet-heart and has realised that she 's betrayed him with someone-else while he 's been out working all hours trying to get enough money to live . A familiar story to many people I think ... Wang Chung always sounded to me like they were having a good time and just wanted others to share in their fun . Go on , you know you want to ...	1
Wang Chung made a strong impression to Japanese yogaku ( western music fans ) in 1984 with their first US hit album POINT OF THE CURVE churning out two TOP 40 hits DO N'T LET GO and DANCE HALL DAYS . These two hits have a nice blend of techno pop with rock vibe.Their 1986 album finally produced nearly No1 hit EVERYBODY HAVE FUN TONIGHT ( It missed the No 1 spot at Billboard but did with Radio and Records ) . HYPNOTIZE ME ended up TOP 30 hit but one of the top favorite Wang Chung songs . LET 'S GO became TOP 10 hit but I do n't care for it so much . It sounds a bit slack to me . BETRAYAL is the best among non-hit tracks . This ballad is excellently produced and could have been US hit . The rest of the tracks were well made but with lesser degree than the aforementioned tracks . WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE could have been the highlight in their live . Their compilation should include the live version of this track . EYES OF THE GIRL has similarly styled with some of the tracks of GLASS TIGER 's DIAMOND SUN . THE FLAT HORIZON is the typical of british techno pop.Verdict : Some excellent songs and the rest is so-so good.Rating : 83 out of 100Recommended for : Fans of 80 's techno pop with some rock vibe such as A-ha , Glass Tiger , Level 42 , and Cutting Crew . Some of Coldplay fans .	1
Something brilliant . That 's exactly what happens when you turn Cher into nothing short of a rock Goddess , and mix her with Jon Bon Jovi , Richie Sambora , and Desmond Child . Aswell as these HOT producers , there 's also production from Michael Bolton , Peter Asher and Jon Lind . This is honestly one of Cher 's best ever albums . All of the tracks are brilliant , but my favourites are obviously the ones produced by Jon , Richie and Desmond ! ! ( We All Sleep Alone , which is my favourite Cher song ever , Bang-Bang , Main Man , Give Our Love A Fightin ' Chance , Perfection and Working Girl , though I really like I Found Someone , too ! ) I love them all ! : ) I think her later work is also great ( Believe , Living Proof , etc ... ) , though she should 've stuck to Jon , Richie and Desmond ! ; )	1
Had Cher named her big selling 1998 Believe album Cher , she would 've made a history book or two as she recorded in the 60 's and then had a brief dry spell until the early 70 's when she released an album called Cher , then after a few hits it all dried up again until this 1987 album entitled Cher . But alas Believe was n't called Cher and that album as fun and perhaps innovative as it was is n't as good as this one . In fact , after all these years it 's quite clear to me that Cher can put out numerous excellant singles but in ways of full albums they are n't very good . However , this album seems to be the exception . Perhaps it 's because when it came out I listened to it all the time and so all the songs are good . Of course it could also be that after the success of this album she made her next one that sounded almost identical , just like her follow up to Believe was almost a carbon copy to that album . But hey you ca n't blame the girl for trying to make a few extra bucks . Anyhoos , onto the 1987 album which opens with what is probably my favorite Cher single ever `` I Found Someone '' ; a rockin ' pseudo ballad complete with keyboards and the like , this was the song that brought the singing Cher back to light . Written by Michael Bolton and originally recorded by Laura Branigan in 1985 , this is to me the best version of the song as Cher rocks it out a tad more than Ms. Branigan did . Then we go onto the Jon Bon Jovi composed `` We All Sleep Alone '' another brilliant singer from the girl and then an amped up and redone version of the Sonny written song `` Bang Bang ( My Baby Shot Me Down ) '' produced by the bon of Jovi in fact , this one rocks harder than the original and I like it . There are a few dudish songs on this 10 song set and `` Main Man '' is probably the song I hate the most . For some reason they even tried to release it as a single , it 's just a slowish type of ballad with Cher spewing out some fairly strange lyrics for a woman of her age and umm personally conflicted life , but then we move onto two of my all time favorite songs `` Give Our Love A Fighting Chance '' is perhaps full of cliches and even those rock n roll riffs of the 80 's that themselves are cliches but it 's catchy and I ca n't help but love it ; then Cher cashes in on some of those celebrity C-lists she is on by getting Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love to sing a pseudo duet on `` Perfection '' which is so damn catchy it gets me singing everytime . The lyrics seem to fit Cher better than some of these songs as well , `` All my life I 've been driven by Perfection/ pushed it to the limit every night and day/ oh , I 've been driven by Perfection/ but nothing 's perfect if love ai n't right '' and the ultimate in lyrics , `` When love is here to stay/and then it 's gone today/you 've got a list of lovers looking like a resume '' - cracks me up every single time . There 's some typical 80 's fare in here as well including `` Working Girl '' which sounds like a song that should 've been on the soundtrack to the Melanie Griffith movie of the same year , and `` Critical Times '' which is what one would probably call filter before ending the whole thing with the rock ballad `` It 's Been Hard Enough Getting Over You '' which ironically , Laura Branigan ended up covering a few years later . So for the casual fan there 's a million Cher compilations out there and for the extremist , they would want all the crappy albums Cher 's put out over the last hundred years but for the semi-fan I would recommend buying one compilation and this album cause you really need to hear the songs that are the cream of the Cher album .	1
My favoutite albums by Cher are her Geffen-albums , made between 1987 and 1992 . It 's this one , & quot ; Heart Of Stone & quot ; and & quot ; Love Hurts & quot ; ( and the & quot ; Greatest Hits 1956-1992 & quot ; , containing three new songs ) . If you like any of the songs you 've heard from these albums , you should buy all of them , because they are great . They sound quite the same , but are still , by some reason , very different . Diane Warren , Desmond , Child , Jon Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton have written many of the songs on these albums and they are great songwriters . Buy this album , you 'll love it ! I like the guita solos ( some of them by Steve Lukather ( Toto ) or Richie Sambora ( Bon Jovi ) ) .	1
Cher 's I PARALYZE album flopped very badly and it was not very exciting news for Cher . But Cher was not out of the game yet . This gave her a chance to really broaden her acting skills . She appeared in five films from 1983 to early 1987 , and they were : SILKWOOD , MASK , MOONSTRUCK , SUSPECT , & THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK.In 1987 , Cher returned to her original roots : Music . She released her nineteenth album entitled simply , CHER . This album is her second album with this title , the first being released in 1966 , with such songs as `` Alfie '' , and `` Bang Bang ( My Baby Shot Me Down ) '' . This album brought Cher back onto the charts , with three chart-topping singles . This album is beyond amazing and displays Cher 's experiements with an excellent combo of Rock & Pop music.I FOUND SOMEONEThe first single from the album . This song was originally recorded by Laura Branigan back in 1986 . Laura 's version was the more than less popular version , reaching # 90 on the charts . But Cher had given us the ultimate definitive version . Even though Laura Branigan had recorded this before Cher , this song , to me , is Cher 's song . It 's a classic song that only Cher can do.WE ALL SLEEP ALONEThe second single from the album . Another amazing song . This is another song that displays Cher 's amazing voice and great 80s image.BANG BANG ( MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN ) ( 1987 Version ) The third single from the album . Back in 1966 , when Cher had released her second album entitled , THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER , she had recorded this classic tune , which was written by Sonny Bono , himself . The song was released as a single then and was a huge hit , later being covered by Frank Sinatra . Well , just 21 years after recording the original , Cher decided to re-record the song into an 80s Metal version and release it as a single . This is another huge successful song and I love it.MAIN MANThe fourth & final single from the album . Awesome ballad.GIVE OUR LOVE A FIGHTIN ' CHANCEEverybody would love to Give Their Love A Fightin ' Chance . Most men or women are to blind to see that . This song is for anybody who would seem to prefer not to give their partners a fighting chance.PERFECTIONI love this song , because : No . 1 ) It is definitely an awesome song , and No . 2 ) It fits me to a tee . I 'm a perfectionist and everything has to be of my satisfaction . You 'll also notice that the refrain sung in the very beginning is sung by DARLENE LOVE & BONNIE TYLER.DANGEROUS TIMESThe 80s were Dangerous Times , but we need to realize that it is now the year 2005 , ( 2006 or 2007 , depending on when you read this review ) , and it is far much worse than it was in the 80s . Listen to this song and be careful with how you live your lives out there in the real world because it is n't easy.SKIN DEEPNot bad.WORKING GIRLAwesome.HARD ENOUGH GETTING OVERI believe that if you had just broken up with your boyfriend or girlfriend , it will be very hard to get over , depending how much in love you were with that person . So , if there is anyone out there who has dumped or has been dumped by your girlfriend of boyfriend , just remember that it is hard to get over that fact , but the pain does go away . While you are waiting for that pain to disappear , let Cher help you by listening to this amazing song.This album definitely defines 80s image Cher and it should be owned by every Cher fan . NO EXCUSES ! If you do n't have a copy already , than you are wasting time . So , get up off your a**es and buy a copy of this incredible album from Cher .	1
... of a boring Monday night.I bought this album on cassette when it came out in 1987 . I 'm listening to the CD as I write this review . It is one of Cher 's over-the-top albums , and I say that lovingly . It 's fun , full of catchy tunes , with an overblown production with credits that read like a who 's who in studio musicians . It is perfect listening when you are stuck in a traffic jam , or when you need music to propel you to clean your house . The high energy songs will help turn washing your windows or dishes into a tightly choreographed routine . Some reviewers refer to it as a comeback album , but for some of us , Cher never went away . There might have been a few years absence from the music charts , but does it really matter ?	1
After a string of albums that unfairly were overlooked by the mainstream ( albums like Stars , Black Rose and I Paralyze especially ) , Cher signed to Geffen in 1987 and recorded a rock album that finally got people to take notice. & quot ; I Found Someone & quot ; may have not been written for Cher ( Laura Branigan recorded it a few years earlier ) , but Cher makes the song her own . It is a rocker ! & quot ; We All Sleep Alone & quot ; is an all-time gem that even Cher had remixed to put on her BELIEVE album . Some of Cher 's best vocals are on this song . & quot ; Perfection & quot ; is an underrated gem , you hear Cher at her diva peak on the album.While some of this albums production sounds dated 13 years later ( Jon Bon Jovi , Desmond Child , Michael Bolton were all at the top of their game ) , for anyone who remembers this period , this album is a must-have .	1
Although aware of Cher as an actress and someone who 'd sung with her then-husband Sonny Bono , it was n't until I was alerted to a new song by Cher . Upon hearing it , I discovered she 'd covered a Laura Branigan song I 'd so adored on her Hold Me album . The song was of course `` I Found Someone , '' which consisted of Michael Bolton 's synth-oriented production , the same way he 'd do Jennifer Rush on Passion . Cher 's eponymous 1987 album was a vehicle to her second comeback following a string of movie successes , and is a snapshot of the slick synth/pop music of the 80 's , when hard rock and pop consisted of layered synths and power ballads , the genre Bon Jovi succumbed to in Slippery When Wet.As a diehard Branigan fan , I prefer the original , but there is a place for this remake , given the wall of synths production , and Toto 's Steve Lukather giving help on guitar and on a solo . Cher 's version scratched the Top Ten compared to Branigan 's # 90.Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates give Cher lots of help here , whether it be on instruments or backing vocals , or songwriting . `` We All Sleep Alone , '' the # 14 single , was co-written and featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi , Richie Sambora , and rock producer Desmond Child . Another backing vocalist here is legendary songwriter Holly Knight , late of Spider and Device . There is that sage acceptance that sooner or later , we all sleep alone . The same team contribute on a souped up version of `` Bang Bang , '' which she had done in the 60 's with Sonny . There is an operatic quality to the backing vocals , which is then given a harder-edged sound thanks to Richie Sambora , and a wall of synth sound by Holly Knight and Chuck Kentis . I heard this version before the original , and in a rare move , find this to be my version.Desmond Child wrote and sang backups on the ballad `` Main Man , '' something Cher has had difficulty hanging onto ironically enough . No , really , this is actually a great power ballad . He and Diane Warren also co-wrote `` Give Our Love A Fighting Chance '' and `` Perfection , '' the first a power song that could fit on a Bon Jovi album , Slippery When Wet-era of course . On the second song , Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love sing the first two lines and are the featured vocalists joining Cher . The song 's theme of being at perfection at work AND at love reflects Cher 's choice in singing it , given her marital track record with Sonny and later Gregg Allman . `` Skin Deep , '' though an upbeat number , managed a # 79 showing on the charts . The Desmond Child-Michael Bolton written `` Working Girl '' is a commentary on the hard work and harassment office women get . The last track the Bolton-produced and co-written `` Hard Enough Getting Over You '' lists the painful reasons why one is reluctant to allow someone back into their life , be it the hurt from lies and the fear of latent pain becoming manifest . One of the better non-singles here.Cher 's comeback is also a testimony to the 80 's synth-oriented music produced by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton-okay , I 'll give Bolton credit for his songwriting and production , but not his singing ! Cher would further her comeback on her next album , but alas , how some short some comebacks last .	1
I have not heard a lot about Cher when i was growing up.And when i was 16 she releases what i still consider one of the best examples of adult-oriented rock albums.There is such an energy flowing throughout this CD you can practically feel it coming alive.Let 's start from the writers : mad shout-outs to Cher 's A & amp ; R of the time to pick up these nuggets.Michael Bolton , Desmond Child , Diane Warren , even the guys from Bon Jovi ... the only song out of the whole collection i do not like is a freaky tune called SKIN DEEP ... just because it wo n't fit with the omogeneity of the rest of the album here ( and that 's the reason i give this CD 4 stars & quot ; only & quot ; ) .I FOUND SOMEONE and WE ALL SLEP ALONE deserve to be the chosen singles off the album , MAIN MAN and HARD ENOUGH GETTING OVER YOU are great rock ballads.The other tune that might have been doing REAL good in the charts is the Child-Warren-penned PERFECTION ( thanks god the lady relieved it BIG TIME live during her 1989 extravaganza tour ... ) .Same goes for the desperate cry of GIVE OUR LOVE A FIGHTING CHANCE and DANGEROUS TIMESShe even has one of her signature tracks with ex-hubby Bono being re-produced and re-arranged for the '80 's ... BANG BANG never sounded sooooo good ! And if you like big choruses , take a closer listen to WORKING GIRL : the musical pattern of the vocal arrangements is simply ear-blowing.I am so glad i got to become fan of such a talented WOMAN ! Do a favour to yourself , buy this .	1
I have to say , as a hard rock and metal fan I never thought I 'd be writing a review of a Cher album , but like Michael Bolton 's brief hard rock flirtation ( seeEverybody 's Crazy ) the actress and pop diva had a short , though very popular arena rocking phase starting with this self-titled 1987 release . The label called in the big guns for this one , including Bolton as songwriter and producer and no less than Jon Bon Jovi , Richie Sambora , Desmond Child and Diane Warren as songwriters . Toto 's Steve Lukather contributed session work , as did pretty much all of Bon Jovi.Musically , Cher 's comeback album is very similar to what Heart was doing with their revamp at the time . It 's a very pop-oriented , very melodic , keyboard-heavy AOR album with a direct line into the kind of sound that was so popular at the time . I 've never been a big Cher fan , but I ca n't deny she 's got a very unique and powerful voice , and she uses it to great effect here . `` I Found Someone '' and `` We All Sleep Alone '' are the two biggest hits from this album , and they remain the album 's best songs . The updated version of her ` 60s hit `` Bang Bang '' is another highlight , as is `` Perfection , '' which features an appearance by Bonnie Tyler . The rest of the album is less dazzling , but it 's still full of catchy , rocking songs.I know I probably lose a few `` metal points '' for having a Cher album in my collection , but this one is pretty hard to resist . I grew up in the arena rock age and still love the albums of that era by Heart , Pat Benatar and Scandal , and this Cher album fits in that crowd perfectly . It does look a bit odd sitting next to the Chastain and Children of Bodom discs though !	1
It was 1987 and forty-one-year old Cher had been the star of a highly rated television series ( with former husband Sonny ) , had won an Oscar ( and had received several acting nominations ) , and had become a fashion icon . However , she had somewhat alienated herself from the younger record-buying public . She had to show the kids that she could still rock with the best of them.Well , she really showed them with this self-titled album , a collection of hard rocking tunes that exhibits the singer 's passionate vocal and distinctive style.She also pays tribute to her past with a hard-hitting remake of `` Bang ! Bang ! , as well as the dance-flavored `` Skin Deep . `` Of course , the quadruple punch of `` I Found Someone , '' `` We All Sleep Alone , '' `` Working Girl , '' and `` Dangerous Times '' are the album 's highlights , but this is an excellent release from a legendary performer.It is also one of the best albums of the 80 's and it 's sometimes good to `` turn back time '' and reflect on monumental music .	1
I stumbled upon this album one day while browsing through music . I was familiar with her 1989 `` Heart of Stone '' release but not this 1987 self-titled album . It really an underrated treasure.I liked `` I found someone '' and `` We all sleep alone '' but I also liked the overall song of `` Main Man '' . I really like the opening notes of `` We all sleep alone '' .There 's not a song on this album I dislike , Cher 's powerful vocals sound great performing album-oriented rock material . I can hear and feel the emotions each song is supposed to convey . Diane Warren 's songwriting and the production assistance from members of Bon Jovi were the perfect formula.I wish Cher had stayed with this type of material instead of trying to go into techno-disco .	1
In 1987 , Cher was enjoying a successful comeback that had begun in the early '80s with acclaimed roles in films such as Silkwood and Mask . So , by 1987 , Cher , confident in her acting career , decided to set sights on the area which launched her career : music . She had n't had a top ten hit since 1979 's disco anthem `` Take Me Home '' . Cher 's self-titled 1987 album is very much a 1980 's album . It 's a little dated , but the songwriting and production were so strong , they hold up well . Songs like `` I Found Someone '' , `` We All Sleep Alone '' , `` Main Man '' , `` Hard Enough Getting Over You '' and a cover of her own `` Bang Bang '' are strong and well-produced . I would argue that this is a better album than its follow-up , 1989 's Heart of Stone , which was even more successful .	1
Cher is always on the cutting edge , but often its do to the fact that the record company is on at the time is really striving for a hit . In the case of her self titled 1987 LP , it was David Geffen 's brain child to bring back Cher as a hard rock queen , but with songs that are n't to rough . Its power chords meets a light AC feel for the most part on the album & quot ; Cher & quot ; .It begins with three big hit pieces . First is her big comeback hit in & quot ; I Found Someone & quot ; . It 's edgy with a lot of force . She battles her way to find new love with smoky vocals on top of guitar rock sounds . & quot ; We All Sleep Alone & quot ; is a smart power ballad with Bon Jovi 's style as they craft this work with a combo of rock sounds and biting lyrics like & quot ; You may have lovers wherever you roam , but sooner or later , we all sleep alone. & quot ; It 's meaningful in a world that has too many people desperate for love . & quot ; Bang Bang & quot ; is a semi interesting rock take on the original , which was kind of an odd folk rock number.Then the album just goes into another area all together . You get Cher combining her voice with the womanly anthem of & quot ; Perfection & quot ; with Darlene Love and Bonnie Tyler . It 's pop perfect indeed with a slight rock edge . You also get really hard numbers like & quot ; Dangerous Times & quot ; and & quot ; Give Our Love ... & quot ; not to mention pristine ballads like the lovely & quot ; Hard Enough Getting Over You & quot ; and the solid lyric work of & quot ; Main Man & quot ; . Cher strikes an even more rebellious song for the working gals with the pop rock of ... well , & quot ; Working Girl & quot ; .The real winner is a dance track out of the realms of Madonna 's club scene . & quot ; Skin Deep & quot ; is an outrageous blend of bass , drum and keyboard that resembles eighties pop fever . It does n't really fit on this Cher rock album , but its an unexpected joy and separates from the near sad tones of love , loss and fighting for independence in the other songs . It 's just kooky dance that is simpler yet more magical then her sexual disco records.In all , a great short set of Cher songs , but not her most famous of even the eighties . That would be the full on AC rock of & quot ; Heart Of Stone & quot ; , but & quot ; Cher & quot ; with it 's new ideals on even old music is trend setting . The sad fact is though , many credit Cher 's huge name in motion pictures for making this set a hit , while others just the unbeatable rock sound of the time . I would hope that fans will check this one out for something different and really appreciate the woman for trying new things and making them work .	1
Great and sadly last solo effort from guitar hero Jimmy Page . Now that Zeppelin has reunited the world can be at ease . But if you want to hear an amazing piece of zeppelin style guitar magic this is for you .	1
Man ! can you belive the price ? Jimmy toured on this lp . And it wasgreat ! The opening song was WASTING MY TIME . Sad though thateverything he does is compared to Zeppelin : - ( Three instramentals included . Robert pops in on THE ONLY ONE . Good job Bob ! PRISON BLUES starts off with a wicked overdriven blues riff that just screams all the way through to the other side of your skull , man ! HUMMINGBIRD is light mix radio stuff . BLUES ANTHEM is probably the only song ever by Jimmy I dare call boring . After the FIRM ( who were great ! ) and before COVERDALE . ( also great ! ) OUTRIDER stands on it 's own as testament to a man & amp ; his guitar , against the world ! Still cant belive the price ? Should be $ 18.00 or more . Get it now before they get wise ! Only question Jimmy , Who cut your hair , man ?	1
For those dogs that like their Led Zeppelin without any frills , this is the bone for you . Years after the tragic end to Led Zeppelin , Jimmy Page released Outrider to very little fanfare , but if guitar rock is your thing , then this is definetly one for you , not a single keyboard used , and do n't let that fool you into thinking the sound is n't full , think again this is Mr. Jimmy Page we 're talking about here . Jason Bonham occupies the drum stool for seven of the nine tracks , and a more than adequate job he does of it to , you can never compare two musicians fairly , but let us just say that his father would have been more than proud . To these floppy ears it 's the instrumentals on the album that really take the biscuit , showing the likes of Eric Johnson & amp ; Kenny Wayne Shepherd how to play with flash but keep it interesting . Although all the songs sound as if they have been recorded by a band who 've known each other for years , actually Jimmy uses 2 drummers , 3 bassists & amp ; spread over the 6 vocal tracks 3 vocalists , the very underrated John Miles ( he of `` music '' fame ) handles the first brace with his usual aplomb . Chris Farlowe ( `` Tears Go By '' , Atomic Rooster & amp ; Colosseum ) takes the final curtain calls , when he engagingly stutters his opening delivery of `` I 've be a b-b-b-b-b-bad b-boy and I 've been a bad boy all night long '' you can actually hear him smirk & amp ; wink over Page 's bleeding electric guitar , of course after this the lyrics descend even further into bloke rock , and the guys seem to be having the time of their lives . The final vocalist used is of course Jimmy Page 's old sparring partner , Percy himself Mr. Robert Plant , and it 's a credit to the other two that this song is not the stand out track of the album , I think that has to go to the 12-bar of `` Prison Blues '' , if Mott could get his paws round a guitar neck , this is the way he 'd play guitar , with legs astride , head thrown back , in front of 250,000 screaming women . As in the last quote this album may be a little self indulgent , but they sure do n't make albums like this anymore , and to make sure it was just right Jimmy Page even produced the whole thing himself . If you still not convinced , try lending an ear to Jimmy Page 's latest release with the Black Crowes where he revamps his old Led Zeppelin Catalogue as well as bashing through some old chestnuts . Listen & amp ; Believe . Mott the Dog .	1
When Jimmy Page disbanded The Firm late 1986 he started work on what would come to be Outrider . At first he had a double album in mind , each of the four sides covering rock , blues , acoustic , experimental . As it happened he unfortunately released it as a single album.With Jason Bonham on drums on seven of the nine tracks - the other two featuring Barrymore Barlow - he was definitely focused on the project , after all it was his first proper solo album . The Firm had been a disappointment and he had to show himself he could still produce great music . And that 's what he managed to accomplish - Outrider is not a classic by a small measure of creativity.By using three singers - John Miles , Robert Plant & Chris Farlow - Jimmy brought versatility to the music , although ultimately this might 've been its main flaw because it also created an inconsistency.The three instrumental tracks , on the other hand , sound great on their own and they are worthy of Jimmy . Also worthy of credit is the production which makes the music sound live and strong - far from the terribly dated productions of the day.So overall this is a great album that should n't be overlooked if you are a fan .	1
I 'm not sure how I missed this album when it first appeared . I was in graduate school at the time and not buying many albums . Maybe that explains it . Anyway , there are some great tunes here . & # 34 ; The Only One , & # 34 ; a blistering reunion with Robert Plant , is the first one that jumps out . & # 34 ; Prison Blues , & # 34 ; with Chris Farlow on vocals , is a stellar blues guitar workout . Then there 's & # 34 ; Blues Anthem , & # 34 ; again with Farlow , to close out the album . These are the most obvious highlights , but there is n't a bad tune here . Highly underrated .	1
When the world appears to be totally messed up , the tough turn on , drop out and tune in to music . Now it sure do n't bother me none what gets ya through the night , and it do n't make a lot a diff'rence as to what grooves ya , but the blues sure grooves me at times like this . So when I went rummaging through the bargain bin at my local used record store a few weeks ago and found `` Outrider '' by Jimmy Page for less that a pint of Jack Daniels , I scarfed it up right away . After stripping the shrink wrap off and plopping the shiny metal disc into my mobile cd changer , I cranked it to five ( but what 's numbers ... it was way loud , dig ) ? What I heard is simply the best 40 minutes of blues drenched heavy rock that 's gotten my attention in a long time . This record never received much airplay when it was released back in September 1988 , because there were a slew of Zeppelin imitators that had gotten onto the radio first . So when the real thing arrived in the form of a Jimmy Page solo album , with special guests Jason Bonham and Robert Plant , the radio folks said , nah , it 's not commercial enough . The record charted and then fell like an iron dirgible , or something like that . The result was that the record has and continues to languish in bargain bins all over the Western Hemisphere . But give credit to the wonderful folks at Geffen who released it in the first place and who are now doing us a favor , by cutting the price to , `` rock bottom '' to get the , er `` lead '' out of their inventory , so to speak.I had heard some of the record 18 years ago on cassette , but it did n't hit me how good it is until now . Most of the old Zep themes are revisited including wasting time , makin ' love , and yes a song entitled `` Prison Blues '' ( How ironic in light of recent world events involving blonde wannabe celebrities , eh ) . If you want guitar riffs that totally cut AC/DC , Jimmy Page was the man and on this album he really outdid himself reworking riffs and ideas he carved into rock riff legend on 'Led Zeppelin I ' and 'In Through the Out Door ' . Sadly , no music this good has been released by Jimmy since , in my humble opinion.So trip out on this one and be sure to turn it up to really annoy your landlord or your passengers on your way to Chicago , or heaven or Kashmir .	1
Look at the price for this one . I can tell you that you will never find more of a bargain . The Plimsouls were simply brilliant . One simmering , sizzling , weel-crafted pop/new wave composition after another and they still sound freash today . I highly recommend this one .	1
i 'll make this short and sweet ... this album is amazing . ... i 'll take you back to '84 . new music was growing ... Valley Girl ... that movie with the fanatstic soundtrack ... the plimsouls & quot ; million miles away & quot ; jammin in the bar scene . i was sold . the ultimate record from the early eighties that still reigns true today . great words ... great music ... great production ... yet the sting of that pure raw garage band sound . simply put ? get the CD ... you 'll thank me when you do . as soon as you hear & quot ; oldest story in the world & quot ; , you 'll thank me again . i thank peter case everytime i jam ... everywhere at once .	1
This is one of the best power pop albums ever made , with great songs like `` Oldest Story in the World '' , `` Inch By Inch '' , and of course the classic `` A Million Miles Away '' . A little history : in 1976 a band called the Nerves , made up of Peter Case ( later of the Plimsouls ) , Paul Collins ( later of the Beat , a.k.a . Paul Collins ' Beat ) , and Jack Lee , recorded a 4 song EP . One of the songs was Jack Lee 's `` Hanging On The Telephone '' , which became famous in 1978 when a cover version by Blondie became a hit . By this time the Nerves had broken up , with the various members each gone their separate ways . Jack Lee released a solo album , `` Greatest Hits Vol . 1 '' , in 1981 on an obscure label , Maiden America records . Paul Collins ' band , the Beat , made 2 albums and 1 EP . Peter Case 's band , the Plimsouls , made an EP followed by 2 LPs , the best of which is this album , `` Everywhere At Once '' . Both Case and Collins had subsequent solo albums , and the Plimsouls reformed for a later album in the late '90s , `` Kool Trash '' . So there is a wealth of material for fans to track down for their collections . Much of it has never been issued on CD , and some of it is very hard to find . Now for the good news : in 2001 a Spanish label , Penniman Records , reissued the original Nerves 4-song EP , combined with 2 other Nerves studio tracks , on a 10 '' vinyl-only collection called `` 25th Anniversary '' . Only 2000 copies were issued , I do n't know if it is still available but if you can find it , I highly recommend it - great stuff . There was also a French reissue in the late '80s , now long since out of print , of the same 6 Nerves songs , plus 4 more live tracks . Anyway , I had been searching for those Nerves songs for years before finally finding the Penniman Records release just a few weeks ago . If anyone reading this has been searching for the Nerves like I had been , I hope this helps you find it . Beware , though , of recordings by a different band also called the Nerves , which has made a few albums recently . Check the record label or personnel info carefully . For further collecting , the Paul Collins stuff is still not too hard to find on vinyl , but the Jack Lee album is very rare .	1
Originally released in 1983 , who could honestly forget this fun-to-listen-to new wave , power pop , alternative ( call it what you like ) band ? Guess they disbanded after this record came out . Never one of my favorites but I remember this lp on the turntable at several college parties I hung out at back then . Tunes here I found to my liking were `` Shaky City '' , the catchy `` Lie , Beg , Borrow And Steal '' , their unforgettable 'signature ' song { if you care to call it that } `` A Million Miles Away '' , `` My Life Ai n't Easy '' , `` I 'll Get Lucky '' and the surf guitar-like closer `` Hobo '' . Nice ! Followers of the Romantics , Goo Goo Dolls , The dB 's and The Knack should really enjoy this reissue .	1
I ran across this album by chance one day when I borrowed my sister 's car . She had the tape of this in the cassette player . It did n't take long before I was out on the road rocking out to this band that I had never heard of before . Then & quot ; A Million Miles Away & quot ; came on , and I was sold . I had to have this one . I do n't usually discover great music this way , but sometimes even my little sister has a musical jewel or two hidden up her sleeve . This album is really a pop classic , which makes it that much more surprising I had n't heard it before . But this band , who was huge on the west coast in the early 80 's , disappeard just about as fast as they came in . That was the story of a lot of good pop bands I liked from the late 70 's early 80 's period . This was an especially talented band though . The bigtime production and the big guitar sounds off of this are something you did n't hear on very many pop albums back then . There 's much more to be found here than just a one hit wonder album . There 's some other great songs like & quot ; Oldest Story In The World & quot ; , & quot ; Play The Breaks & quot ; , & quot ; How Long Will It Take & quot ; , and & quot ; Everywhere At Once & quot ; to round out a very solid album all the way through , with no weak filler tunes to be found . I 'm surprised when I see this in the cut-out bins , and at such a bargain price . About all I can say about that is & quot ; if they only knew & quot ; . I 'd rank this one in my top 3 pop albums of the 80 's , and if that shipwreck ever happens , I 'd probably have to tote this along to the desert island . Because I 've never gone long without listening to this cd since that first chance encounter in my sister 's car . It 's the best driving music you 'll ever hear ... .Promise	1
The Plimsouls second album was very nearly as great as the first . Not since Big Star cranked out # 1 RECORD and RADIO CITY a decade earlier had American pop seen music that was so edgy and melodic at the same time . The prime mover behind The Plimsouls was the great songwriter/guitarist/singer Peter Case . He enjoyed a find solo career after leaving The Plimsouls , but he never wrote as many spectacular songs as he did for their two albums together.I 'd love to share my favorite cuts on the album , but I would simply end up reduplicating the contents . But the best of the best stand comparison with any of the great power pop singles of the entire decade , or indeed of any decade . While I have some personal favorites like `` The Oldest Story in the World , '' I would like to see anyone who is n't moved by the power of a song like the title track or the amazing `` A Million Miles Away , '' which just might be the Plimsouls single greatest song . But there are n't any weak cuts on this album . Every song is distinguished by good lyrics , taut playing , stellar guitar lines ( though very little in the way of solos-the guitar work consisted primarily in countering the vocal melodies and in brilliant texturing ) , and superb melodies that will hook you and keep you hooked.Over the course of time , I have encountered one amazing band after another-Big Star above all , but also bands like Thin White Rope , Eleventh Dream Day , the Rave Ups-that should have been huge , but were n't . I hate to turn this into a diatribe against the music industry , but with downloading and file sharing threatening the existence of the record companies , I 'm wondering if it would n't be a good thing if they went by the board . Though not entirely , a great deal of the fault with the untimely demise of so many of these great bands has to be laid at the feet of the record companies who failed to properly support these great artists , their pushing instead a host of inferior and second rate performers who possessed little or no artistic merit , and the narrow refusal of horrid airwave monopolies like Clear Channel ( a satanic organization if ever there was one , politically as well as aesthetically ) . If you got rid of the record companies , I suspect the cream would be allowed to rise on its own to the top . I truly do think that record companies have outgrown their usefulness .	1
Maria soothes the soul with this , her second solo album . Backed by the Jayhawks and old-friends from her Lone Justice days , she rips through the songs -- some originals , some cover versions -- with abandon . For proof , listen to `` I 'm Gon na Soothe You , '' which basically wraps you in its warmth . `` My touch is gentle , my body is warm ... '' she sings , stepping out from the speakers . She 's sexy , saucy , inviting and sweet all at once ; and envelops you with her passion . Further proof : Her wondrous remake of the Goffin-King classic `` I Ca n't Make It Alone '' ; and her raucous ode to her Lone Justice days , `` My Girlhood Among the Outlaws . '' A true classic - and for $ 7 , a no-brainer . Buy it .	1
Mckee after left Lone Justice , ( 80s Mtvs favorites ) wanted to lead her music to a new level , she had folk , southern and country influences she wanted to capture in a studio , so with the help of Justices former keyboardist Mr. Brody and Don Was in production she started with her Van Morrison favorite tunes and musical references as well Tom Petty teachings and some of his musicians too , the result is an album with all the melancholly of southern , the beauty of the depressing lyrics in some tracks and the emotion of love , lost love and hope of love , life , childhood memories and even some sense humor for a broken heart such as in `` only once '' , only a few girls have followed the path that country southern and blues legends ( cash , Petty etc . ) started and Maria Mckee is one of them `` You Got ta Sin to Get Saved '' is one of the highest points in her career same as in `` Life is sweet '' HM	1
After the commercial failure of her occasionally brilliant but mostly tepid self-titled debut album , apparently Maria McKee decided upon a throw-enough-styles-at-the-wall-and-see-what sticks approach for her follow-up , presumably so she could perhaps give Geffen a successful , sales-wise album , but still be able to indulge her muse . So we get Maria-does-Patsy ( Only Once ) , Maria-does-Motown ( I 'm Gon na Soothe You ) , Maria-does-gospel ( I Forgive You ) , Maria-does-alt.country ( Precious Time ) , and no less than two Van Morrison covers . And while she does them all well , there is a pervasive feeling of playing it conservative and taking no chances throughout this otherwise excellent album , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but one comes to expect a risk or two from Maria McKee ; that she mostly fails to deliver here only subtracts from my enjoyment slightly.The aforementioned Morrison covers are outstanding-especially My Lonely Sad Eyes ( which I saw her perform on Chevy Chase 's short-lived late night talk show ! ) which gets an almost Los Lobos style arrangement , and she does a swooping , frenzied rendition of Young Lovers Do ( one of the few times she really cuts loose vocally here ) . I absolutely love I 'm Gon na Soothe You , which is smooth and soulful , and the Jayhawks help make Precious Time a lovely country ballad . The album 's closer and title track is a rollicking , enjoyable tune , and one imagines that they had a lot of fun recording that one.Do n't get me wrong-this is a great record . It 's just a little more mainstream and safe than I like to hear from MM . And that alone might make YGSTGS the McKee album of choice for a lot of people . Of course , it might have been mine too if the commercial demise of YGSTGS had not prompted Maria to go on and record the brilliant , nervy Life Is Sweet , which is one of the bravest , most exciting records I 've ever heard . Unfortunately , Life Is Sweet has been deleted , so you ca n't buy it except second-hand , but it 's worth the effort to track down , believe me . So really , you should get You Got ta Sin To Be Saved , and you will enjoy it , but keep an eye out for Life Is Sweet as well .	1
She 's only known by hits like `` Show Me Heaven '' and a song written for Quentin Tarantino 's soundtrack Pulp Fiction `` If Love Is A Red Dress '' . But she 's on a scene more than twenty years . She started in early eighties as a lead singer and songwriter in the roots rock band Lone Justice . After they disbanded in 1986 she went solo . Three years later she recorded her first solo album Maria McKee.This is her second album . A mix of soul and country music . The covers ( Van Morrison 's My Lonely Sad Eyes and The Way Young Lovers Do , Gerry Goffin and Carole King 's I Ca n't Make It Alone ) sounds like they are recorded for the first time and like her own . Few country songs Only Once and My Girlhood Among The Outlaws are beutiful love songs that could be done by Gram Parsons or Emmylou Harris , not to mention Precious Time or Why Was n't I More Grateful , You Got ta Sin To Get Saved or I 'm Gon na Soothe You.This album is a masterpiece .	1
This is most definitely a classic album from Maria . In fact , it 's her best . I am sorry that it has n't received more recognition from the new country community , but that 's how the cards fall sometimes . Everything from the sweet memphis sound of & quot ; I 'm gon na soothe you & quot ; to the bittersweet & quot ; Only Once & quot ; , is a showcase for the endless talents of Ms. Mckee . Like most of the alt-country she was bred on the punk sound of the eightees and traditional folk music that was ignored at the time . Her only misfortune was bad timing . The decade of Van Halen and Poison would have had a difficult time appreciate a work of art in this vein . If you like Chrissie Hynde and/or Janis Joplin , this album is perfect for you .	1
This album album became a phenomenon in the mid-90 's which was a weird time for pop music . Grunge was pretty much dead , Gangsta rap was huge and teen pop was beginning to bubble up to the front of the line . Somewhere amongst all of this , No Doubt and their album `` Tragic Kingdom '' became one of the decade 's biggest hits . One listen says why.This album was truly unique and sounded much different than anything that was on the radio at the time . `` Do n't Speak '' is the pop hit it 's most remembered for . An awesome power ballad , it was the # 1 song of 1997 . Not bad . The other singles were huge hits on MTV and on alternative radio . `` Spiderwebs '' is a punky piece of ear candy and `` Just A Girl '' has since become a punk/pop anthem . `` Sunday Morning '' was also a minor hit . Other stand-outs are the poppy , yet angry `` Happy Now , '' the soaring `` Climb '' and my favorite song , the title track `` Tragic Kingdom '' which is a complete head-trip to listen to . I would 've loved for it to have been a single.No Doubt have gone on to have successful projects with `` Return of Saturn '' and their latest more pop-ish effort `` Rock Steady '' which gave them a decent handful of hits . Yet , they have n't matched `` Tragic Kingdom '' in sales or musically . This is highly recommended . A great CD just to blast in your car and sing along to .	1
I bought this album waaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1996 when I was still a college student and it quickly became one of my favorite CDs ever . The style goes from bouncy quick ska-punk ( Sunday Morning ) to cute gimmick song ( Just A Girl ) to mature wistfulness ( Do n't Speak ) and all the way back again . No Doubt are certainly talented artists . I had the privilege of seeing No Doubt play live at RockFest in Texas in 1997 and I was absolutely blown away . They are n't one of those canned studio acts that sound [ bad ] live ... .they really rock .	1
I bought this album after hearing ( and loving ) & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; on the radio . I fell in love with it the first time I heard it . The only song that is not too good is & quot ; World Go Round & quot ; , but all the other songs are just too good to drag the record along . My other faves on the album include & quot ; Sixteen & quot ; , & quot ; Different People & quot ; and the title track . Sadly , thier other albums ca n't compare to this one . If you only buy one No Doubt album , this is it ! This is one of the best CD 's I own ( Melanie B . 's & quot ; Hot & quot ; is the other ) and I absolutely adore it . Get ready for a great ride through a & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; ! ! : )	1
this was a first for me , liking a band with a ska sound , but I do not regret it . I still rock the album today . Have fun hearing Gwens thoughts on being young , a woman , in a relationship and a breakup .	1
Released all the way back in 1995 , this album went on to sell over 20 million copies worldwide ( over 15 million in the US alone ) . This CD includes the hits Just a Girl , Spiderwebs , Do n't Speak , Excuse Me Mr. , and Sunday Morning.The album opens with 1 . Spiderwebs ( 5/5 ) This song is pretty much instantly catchy , and if your a person who likes to bang your head around , the chorus is perfect for that . 2 . Excuse Me Mr. ( 4/5 ) This song is a pretty hardcore , in-your-face kinda song . It 's probably the worst of their single releases from this album , but it 's still really good . 3 . Just a Girl ( 5/5 ) Now this is THE song that put No Doubt on the map . It 's a girl anthem , but unlike alot of them , it is n't a man hating one ! It opens with that famous , catchy guitar riff , and the song just goes from there . 4 . Happy Now ( 4/5 ) I think it 's pretty obvious that this song is about Gwen and Tony 's break-up , but , it 's not a bad song . It 's pretty catchy to . 5 . Different People ( 3/5 ) . Another catchy song , about people being , well ... different ... It seems like a bit of a filler , but it 's still an okay song . 6 . Hey You ( 4/5 ) Lol , the chorus is kinda weird ( `` Your just like my Ken and Barbie doll '' ) , but weird in a good way . The song is catchy , and I love the way they use the Sitar . 7 . The Climb ( 4/5 ) Definitely the longest song on the album , topping the 6 minute mark . The only thing that keeps this song from reaching 5 stars , is the fact it seems to drag . Other than that , it 's a great song.8 . Sixteen ( 5/5 ) One of my favorite songs not to be released from this album . It 's really catchy , and has a great chorus . Great song . 9 . Sunday Morning ( 5/5 ) I think this is one of No Doubt 's most underrated songs . The big long drum roll at the beginning is great . Everything about this song is great . And , it 's so damn catchy . 10 . Do n't Speak ( 5/5 ) My favorite song off of this album , and maybe my favorite No Doubt song ever . I mean , who has n't heard this song . It 's one of the most beautiful break-up ballads of all time . This song shot straight to # 1 , and became No Doubt 's biggest single ever . Gwen sounds so heartbroken in this song , it gives me chills . Believe me , if you listen to this song when your sad , you might just cry . 11 . You Can Do It ( 3/5 ) Another song that seems like a filler , and is probably the worst song off of the album . It 's not a terrible song mind you , and is pretty catchy . 12 . World Go 'Round ( 5/5 ) This is my other favorite song not to be released off of this album . Everything sounds great on this song , and it 's so catchy . 14 . End It on This ( 4/5 ) This is pretty good song . Another song that is most likely about Gwen and Tony 's break-up . It seems to drag a bit at the end though . And finally , 15 . Tragic Kingdom ( 4/5 ) I think this song is the perfect way to end the album . It 's a good song , but it can be kind of confusing . It drags a bit at the end to.All in all , this album is great . I recommend if you 're looking to become a fan of No Doubt 's music , you start with this album . But , if you only like a few of their songs , I 'd recommend buying The Singles 1992-2003 .	1
I have this on cassette , that 's how long ago this came out ! I love it and still play it often .	1
My favorite No Doubt album , and one of my favorite albums of all time , which speaks well for this album because I had always considered No Doubt just another pop band with no real talent . I gave this a listen because I 'm a fan of Sublime , and had some people on the Internet tell me to give it a chance . I 'm glad I did . Aside from the songs you 'll hear on the radio ( & quot ; Just A Girl & quot ; , & quot ; Spiderweb & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; ) this album includes many gems such as & quot ; Different People & quot ; , & quot ; Sixteen & quot ; , & quot ; Sunday Morning & quot ; and & quot ; The Climb. & quot ; This is the definitive No Doubt album , and if anyone is looking into buying anything from them this is it . Whereas & quot ; Return of Saturn & quot ; is especially mature and beyond some listeners ability to relate and & quot ; Rock Steady & quot ; is especially immature and practically an insult to the band 's talent , this one is just where it should be . Somewhat playful and easy to listen to , but also expresive and interesting . Plus there 's a great ska feel to this album that is somewhat lost in the others . This one is a must have .	1
This particular album from one of the best California bands ( if not THE best ) , NO DOUBT , is my favorite from them . The album flows so extremely well from one song to the next , it 's almost like one complete entity , instead of song by song . It is a very eccentric album with wild guitars and strings and it contains just about every musical instrument in existence played on the album ! The songs have a very rich sound to them with all the instruments played in them , including trumpets and keyboards . A good example of this is in & quot ; The Climb & quot ; and & quot ; Happy Now ? & quot ; , two of my favorite songs on the album , but really all the songs are my favorites ; there is not one song on this album I do n't like ! I really recommend this album to anyone and everyone who likes great , melodic music . Also , Gwen 's voice in the album is superb as well . It has kind of a hypnotic sound to it at the same time as a beautiful voice for a female . After all , she 's just a girl and she deserves respect and credit where credit is due .	1
They are AWESOME in concert ! LOVE HER PASSION and her HUGE ATTITUDE ! Classics of mid-nineties with STYLE ! I love her music now !	1
No Doubt 's members cite a strange variety of musical influences : Kiss , Prince and Madness , to name a few . And it 's easy to imagine that their hometown itself , Anaheim , California ( home to Disneyland ) , may have played a part in forming the band 's schizophrenic , high-energy sound , which took TRAGIC KINGDOM , the band 's second album , on a slow , steady ride up the pop charts . It finally hit No . 1 in December 1996 , 14 months after it was released.This is ska-punk-new wave-dance music , with instrumentation ranging from hardcore guitar to mellow , reggae-style horns . Singer Gwen Stefani 's voice is by turns peppy , almost adolescent ( & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; ) and emotionally wailing ; she can sound a lot like Concrete Blonde 's Johnette Napolitano ( & quot ; Just A Girl & quot ; ) . When Stefani sings , & quot ; I 'm just a girl , little ol ' me/Do n't let me out of your sight , & quot ; she does so without a hint of girlishness ; her voice is all attitude , with a warbling edge of melodrama . For the most part , these are happy songs , though No Doubt do get philosophical on & quot ; Different People & quot ; : & quot ; Once in a while I sit back/And think about the planet/Most of the time I trip on it/To kick back and think of how massive it all is. & quot ;	1
Although & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; was terribly overplayed on the airwaves , ( so much so , that after a while I used to change the station whenever it came on ) this album as a whole is excellent . I enjoy it more now than I did when it first came out . Gwen has a voice that is different from the run-of-the-mill girl vocalists these days . And the band is very talented , the songs are melodic with great riffs and hooks throughout . No Doubt are one of those bands that write , play and sing their own songs . True talent . The booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos .	1
I knew it would n't be right for me to just own Gwen Stefani 's debut solo album , I had to get my paws on a No Doubt album , I finally after much deliberation with myself decided on Tragic Kingdom . If you think Gwen is just a Madonna wannabe , forget it , she was one of the original modern day rock queens . She along with the rest of No Doubt led the 90 's movement of Ska-rock . Her voice is perfectly suited to the genre , she has the range and the expressiveness.I found upon first listening to this album everything seemes clangy and a bit 'hyper ' . After listening to this album more I found that it was clangy , but that 's just their style . It showed some real potential and the songs started to reveal themselves as gems.Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of 1995 , though it could n't come close to the success of Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette . Still it provided bored Orange County teenagers with role models and something to listen to.I love No Doubt 's style , they were doing something no other 'mainstream ' band were doing and having huge success with it . Their mixture of Ska-rock-pop and tiny elements of ragga propelled them into the musical spotlight . This album is like a soundtrack to California at the time , this is what California sounded like in 1995.No Doubt are Gwen Stefani , Tony Kanal , Tom Dumont , Adrian Young ( and then Eric Stefani was part of the mix ) , they sound like the best band in the world on this album . With Gwen 's unique , angelic voice , Tony 's pulsating bass strums , Tom 's catchy guitar riffs , and Adrian 's super syncopated percussion ( also those fab keyboards from Eric ) made No Doubt top of the music industry.Tragic Kingdom contains some great songs most famous of those is undoubtedly Do n't Speak . Other highlights of this album include : Spiderwebs , Excuse Me Mr. and Just A Girl.This album is the perfect length , not too long yet not that short . Also I like the fact there are only 2 quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden ' affair.Overall , Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and they bring back memories , that is an integral part of what music is about . Whether it be the fact that this album shows you that Gwen is n't just a plastic pop doll but a geniune rock chick or you get to listen to Do n't Speak all over again you must own this album .	1
So many good songs on this one ! Try tracks 1 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 14 . Whether they 're doing punk or pop or jazz or whatever , No Doubt makes it sound good . Gwen Stefani gets compared to Madonna , which embarrasses her , but she 's a cute little blonde chick with Italian roots , so how could we not picture her as a mini-Madonna after Do n't Speak , even though some of us ca n't help but gag at the comparison LOLDavid Rehakauthor of & quot ; A Young Girl 's Crimes	1
& quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; is classic , that is all I can say despite not even being 7 years old , numerous songs off this album have classic status , such as the ballad & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; . This was the breakthrough album for No Doubt giving them national and worldwide exposure and a legion of fans . Gwen Stefani has the right attitude , look , and voice to be a lead singer and she is phenomenal . The Standout songs on this album are : & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; , & quot ; Excuse me Mr & quot ; , & quot ; Just a Girl & quot ; , & quot ; Happpy Now & quot ; , & quot ; Sunday Morning & quot ; and of course & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; . Do n't Speak & quot ; has to be one of the best power ballads of all time up there with & quot ; I Will always love you & quot ; by Whitney Houston . My favorite song off of the album is & quot ; Sunday Morning & quot ; very upbeat and happy song . This album made No Doubt who they are today , and it 's a shame to think they they almost never finished this album , the 11 million people that have bought this album are glad that they did finish it . A must Buy .	1
No Doubt 's TRAGIC KINGDOM is a classic album from the mid 90s . It has a unique sound that no one else was making at the time . There is a unique mix of reggae , punk , and pop found on this album . I remember how huge it was at the time . It has really aged well ... 10 years on and it 's still a very listenable album . Singles included `` Just A Girl '' , `` Spiderwebs '' , `` Sunday Morning '' , `` Do n't Speak '' , and `` Excuse Me Mister '' . The album has a whole is great and there is no filler ! Classic !	1
The best thing about this CD is that its original . If there are other bands like it I havent found them yet . Its cool.Still , at first I thought this CD was weird . I had to teach myself to like it . If you read my other reviews , youll see that this isnt like anything else I listen to , so thats part of the reason . I had to listen to this CD 3 or 4 times before I started enjoying it very much . I was used to headband music , and I had to learn that you get a different kind of enjoyment out of this CD . But I did learn to enjoy it . Gwen has a great voice , and the band itself is pretty talented . The songs are nothing really special , since they 're usually cute love songs , but the lyrics are still usually clever , if not masterful . I like almost all the songs . Chances are you 've heard Im Just a Girl . Not all the songs are like that , but thats pretty much what No Doubt is like . They 're sort of punk , sort of reggae , sort of I dont even know . But they 're cool . Bottom line : if you 're a headbanger , dont touch . If you like punk or reggae with a different twist , buy it .	1
The breakthough effort of ska meets 1940 's & quot ; No Doubt & quot ; is - without a doubt - an incredible album . Full of wonderful melodies , and other delicious musicalities , & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; offers music lovers everywhere a taste of that California sunshine ! Led by Gwen Stefani , & quot ; No Doubt & quot ; sizzles with hit singles & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; , & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; , & quot ; Just a Girl & quot ; and so much more . Other swinging and equally notable songs include the melodramatic & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; , the roudy & quot ; Happy Now & quot ; , and the anthem-esque & quot ; The Climb & quot ; . Stefani 's voice is truly a unique and powerful instrument , belting it 's way into mainstream , backed by the talented stylings of other members Tony , Adrian , and Tom . & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; is a great little album , really different from anything else with its spunk , style , and spirit .	1
Before No Doubt released Tragic Kingdom they were n't well known . They actually just released this so they could get their songs out , then they would go on with their lives . Luckily their first single `` Just A Girl '' hit well and they did n't have to do that . Tragic Kingdom in my eyes is No Doubt 's best work , filled with all good songs . I do n't there are many cd 's where I happen to enjoy all hits , but this is definitely one of them.The cd starts of with `` Spider Webs '' which is an ingenious song . One of my favorite songs in No Doubt history is `` Excuse Me Mr. '' which is just an awesome song . Next is `` Just A Girl '' which was their first single and possibly the `` star '' of the cd . Another one of my favorite songs from no doubt is `` Different People '' which is just so awesome . Then later comes their other hit from the cd , `` Do n't Speak '' which is still getting radio play today . `` You Can Do it '' is also a fun song , though it kinda sounds like something the Spice Girls would sing . Then comes my favorite song on the whole cd ... '' Tragic Kingdom '' . It 's so fun , heavy , deep , imaginative , and basically has a nice flow.The whole cd is just loads of fun and I would suggest it to anyone who has only heard their new stuff .	1
I 'd like to start by saying that this is one of the better albums of the 90 's and the No Doubt album that is most popular among the fans . It was also the band commercial breakthrough album , although it was acually their second . No Doubt from Anaheim , CA was defenitely a fresh and unique band when they came out in 1995 with this one . They mixed Rock with Ska and Reggae but were also able to create good hooks on most songs and occasional tear jerking ballads like `` Do n't Speak '' . No Doubt with lead singer Gwen Stefani was some kind of new wave band of the mid 90 's just like Debby Harry and Blondie had been in the 80 's . Although they were diffrent musically , the 2 singers had something in common . Needless to say , `` Tragic Kingdom '' is No Doubt at their best and nothing short of excellent . It 's fun , catchy and with a fresh and unique sound that certainly got the attention of most people at the time.It all starts with the excellent hit single , `` Spiderwebs '' The song is about a relationship that is almost like a spiderweb and the song is a trademark No Doubt song with all the Ingredients they mixed to create their special sound . Gwen 's energy is amazing . `` Excuse Me Miss '' is slightly slower but does n't lack the goodies either . `` Just a Girl '' sound alot like `` Spiderwebs '' but it 's more of a girls anthem . It was their first single and a very good one . `` Happy Now '' is very good too , a very energic song with good guitars . `` Diffrent People '' is the opposite , a happy mood song . `` Hey You '' is another No Doubt standard in midpace . `` The Climb '' shows that the band also can make ballads . `` Sixteen '' is perhaps for a younger audience , a song about teenagers with an energic hook.The upcoming two songs are 2 of the best . First comes `` Sunday Morning '' that also was released as a single and is one of the more rock influenced songs of the album . `` No Doubt '' is my personal favorite and infact one of the best ballads of the decade , can you believe a band that sang ska-pop on `` Just a Girl '' could make something so diffrent like this one . A beautiful and tear jerking ballad . The song is co-written between Gwen and brother Eric and is about her previous relationship with bandmember and bassist Tony Kanal . Tony broke up and the song was made to cover the pain that Gwen went through . It still gives me goosebumps . `` You Can Do It '' sound disco influenced , it 's odd but who 's surprised ? . `` World Go Round '' is a mix between Ska , Jazz and pop , It 's really catchy but a typical album song . `` End it On This '' and `` Tragic Kingdom '' the title track both are solid standards that melt into the album concept well.Overall , Classic 90 's album that was and is special in it 's own way with the bands Ska revival , some reggae , some rock and pop . It got diversity , energy , it 's fun and catchy . If You are new to the band start here cause it 's their best album and the one that made them famous too . 5/5 stars .	1
`` NO DOUBT '' finally brought ska to the mainstream . For reasons unknown , this bouncy and rather laid-back music style has always remained on the fringe . Why ? Probably , because , in addition to being fun music , ska at times , can get rather juvenile . Examples are : `` Everything Sucks '' by Reel Big Fish , anything ( and everything ) by The Aquabats , or even No Doubt 's first two albums . The playfulness works when you are just hanging out , but when your soul is bleeding , or even just dry heaving , you want more than ten ways to hang out at the 7-11 . There is a sweet and sensible maturity about this album that still retains the whimsicality that is ska music . But that is how life is-valleys of sad and peaks of sunshine . `` Tragic Kingdom '' is a step foreword and up ward , nor only for the band , but for ska groups everywhere . You have this killer , rolling beat under-girding profound lyrics and thoughts penned by fluent Gwen Stefani . Like Bono , she has a poetic spirit that makes her ideas and sentiments very powerful , years above the normal gutter clap-tap that is blared out of most FM stations.The production quality of this album is also years ahead of run of the mill ska . I realize that Sublime intentionally skunked their sound , and I agree that the roughness worked for the Beatles on `` The White Album , '' but it can get overdone at times . No Doubt recognized this , and it made the album sound professional.This album is not only ska at its best , but also what ska could and should be . I just hope the other bans pick up on the direction that No Doubt is going , and follow lead . And I hope No Doubt keeps it up .	1
No Doubt is one of the few bands who improves with each album. ! Gwens vocals are far less whiny on this album , and the lyrics are more serious then their debut . ! Althou their debut was a flop for them I *Love* it you should check that out as well . ! This album spawned such major hits as & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; , & quot ; Just a Girl & quot ; , and & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; . ! Which brought this ska band to super stardon they sold over 10 million copies of this album. ! I bought this album without hearing a single song from it . ! And I am proud to say I was NOT disapointed it is actually a good album . ! If you are looking for something that is not over produced and more original then Britney Spears then check out No Doubt 's & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; ! ! ! The best songs here are & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; , & quot ; Just a Girl & quot ; , & quot ; Excuse me Mr. & quot ; , & quot ; Sweet 16 & quot ; , and & quot ; Different People & quot ; . ! But that 's just my opinions ! ! ! Just check out this album ! ! !	1
Up until `` Tragic Kingdom '' , Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream . After the release of the song `` Just a Girl '' , all of that changed . It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.Back around 1995 , when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani . Her voice was excellent ( has gone downhill since ) , and she just had an attractive energy about her . She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.This album , Tragic Kingdom , was a masterpiece . I can listen all the way through , without skipping a song . Standout songs are , `` Just a Girl '' , `` Spiderwebs '' , `` Sunday Morning '' , `` Do n't Speak '' , `` Happy Now '' , and `` Different People '' .A must have !	1
This album made NxD famous . It made Gwen Stefani into a star.The first four tracks on the album set the scene . The whole album is represented by those tracks.The rest of the album is amazing , but some of the songs go over your head . But that just gives this album more replay value.I hope NxD release their new album soon . Till then fans , myself included , have `` Tragic Kingdom '' and the acclaimed `` Rock Steady '' to tide them over.Favorite tracks : `` Spiderwebs , '' `` Excuse Me Mr. '' `` Just a Girl , '' `` Happy Now ? '' `` Sunday Morning , '' `` Do n't Speak ''	1
No Doubt beared platinum fruit with this delectable collection of charttoppers and sparkling So Cal/ska-meets-punk-meets-pop . This is an incredible album which showcases the amazing versatility of each member of the group and highlights Gwen 's incredibly expressive and confessional songwriting . This album just gets you jumping up and down , and happy . With sing-a-longable songs and irrepresibly irrestible rhythms , how could you go wrong ? They stay in your head and they make you happy . Perfect music for listening to on the freeway an hour before dusk . Ascension-like . Very recommended .	1
Tragic Kingdom is a totally great CD , I heard it once and I was totally hooked . & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; is a fast paced great song , as is & quot ; Just a girl & quot ; . But the slower , sweeter candence of & quot ; Do n't speak & quot ; weaves a spell that makes you want dance .	1
In my opinion , No Doubt 's Tragic Kingdom is a post grunge classic . Somehow they manged to mix ingredients of ska , rock , pop , and even a little bit of punk onto their album and it worked for them . I honestly ca n't think of a band that sounds like No Doubt . They were very original and were probably the last great female fronted act before bubblegum music took over . Tragic Kingdom may have some filler , but there are excellent songs that make up for it . 'Just A Girl ' is everything riot grrrls stood for in the early '90s and Gwen Stefani took that attitude and brought it into the mainstream . 'Do n't Speak ' was the biggest hit and captures a certain sort of '80s nostalgia that tears you apart . And when all else fails , No Doubt proves they can really rock out to tunes like 'Excuse Me Mr. ' and 'Sixteen ' . It 's a shame No Doubt took all they had and wasted it on the dreck that was 'Rock Steady ' . Hopefully they can pull another great album out before their career ends .	1
This is one of my favourite albums of all time . The themes are consistent through-out the entire album , and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out . This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis , especially if you love 90 's music . The singles on this album are superb , but even the non-single tracks are awesome . The title track is epic . Also good are Happy Now , End it On This and World Go Round . Classic Ska , Classic 90 's , and just good stuff all around .	1
`` Do n't Speak '' was my first song that i learned in English , after that i try to undestand the rest of the `` TRAGIC KINGDOM '' cd and as result i love this cd . `` SpiderWebs '' '' Just A Girl '' `` Excuse me Mr. '' `` Sixteen '' `` Tragic Kingdom '' and `` Different People '' are amazing . Buy it .	1
Do n't speak while I am playing this album because I want to hear every second of it . Gwen Stefani 's voice is awesome and unlike anyone else 's that I know . It is no surprise that she made it big . And the format for the music is great too . She has excellent support from her band . It all comes together to make very good music , and a very enjoyable album .	1
This was the album which made it big for No Doubt , and it deserved to do well . Spawning the hit singles 'Do n't Speak ' , 'Just A Girl ' and 'Spiderwebs ' , the former has entered into modern classic status . It shows a wide variety of musical styles , meaning it appeals across the borders , with Gwen Stefani 's vocals simply being out of this world.No Doubt manage to do what many bands before them have failed to - write contemplative , angry and almost sad songs to punchy rhythms and not sound ridiculous . Each track is quirky and original , with insightful comments of the old topic of relationships gone wrong or vice versa , particularly on standout 'Hey You ' . Whilst maintaining their roots , No Doubt have produced a pop record of epic proportions , sounding fresh and original . Although there are several songs here that probably deserve special comment , yet 'Do n't Speak ' is absolutely outstanding , with yearning vocals that do n't pass over into sappiness . However , my favourite track would have to 'Spiderwebs ' , a success in the very fact that it crosses over with pop and a more alternative stlye . The band 's songwriting , vocals and powerfully persuasive image helped 'Tragic Kingdom ' to become a roaring success . It 's bouncy , fun and different and a definite album to treasure.If you enjoyed this , chances are you 'll also like their other albums , all of which are superb .	1
Many children that grew up in the 80s will say that they grew up listening to Madonna . I grew up listening to No Doubt-I remember this cd well , Do n't Speak , SUnday Morning , You Can Do It , and End it on this were my favorites ! Still are actually . This album is a classic .	1
This cd , which richly deserved its diamond status , brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity . While the ska fever has died down , this album and band remain vital in the music scene . This album is , for the most part , a happy affair . Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac , someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects . Anyway , this album is fantastic . The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments , and other tracks , such as & quot ; Do n't Speak , & quot ; & quot ; Sunday Morning , & quot ; & quot ; Spiderwebs , & quot ; and & quot ; The Climb & quot ; are also spectacular . If you do n't own this album now , what are you waiting for ? Buy it , listen to it , and love it .	1
This CD is amazing ! It is so high energy and fun ! This is No Doubt at it 's finest and it 's most fun ! The songs on this CD make me get up and jump around like nothing else . I would recommend this CD at anyone looking for something amazing , fun , and full of attitude.Bottom Line : Buy this CD ! You wo n't regret it ! : )	1
Their best album . Although return of saturn was great also . I ca n't believe this album is 15 years old . WTF . I remember going to see Bush and No Doubt opened with the Goo Goo Dolls . Time flys !	1
I LOVE NO DOUBT AND THE CRANBERRIES ! GWEN RULES ! I NEVER REALLY LIKED THIS KIND OF MUSIC UNTIL THEM ! THEY ARE DOPE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 5 STAR STUFF~ ! *****	1
Though not a fan of much ska or hard rock music , this is a band I ca n't help loving . Beautiful , brilliant , thoughtful , creative and expressive , the sister and brother team of Gwen and Eric Stefani come together with three of their friends to create an album that knocked the socks off of everyone in the industry.From the satire in & quot ; I 'm Just A Girl & quot ; to the metaphorical & quot ; Spiderwebs , & quot ; & quot ; Excuse Me Mister , & quot ; & quot ; Sixteen , & quot ; and & quot ; Tragic Kingdom , & quot ; the album displays what a rock band should be able to do . It 's not just five people screaming about leprechauns only know what , it 's five people dealing with problems of life- coming of age , discrimination , and unpleasant relationships . No candied apples or rainbows for this one of a kind band , only life experiences are expressed on No Doubt 's debut album & quot ; Tragic Kingdom. & quot ; A must-own for anyone who loves music .	1
No Doubt came from out of nowhere to reach the top of the charts with this ska-tinged cd . The album is a therapy session for lead singer and main songwriter , Gwen Stefani . She and bassist Tony Kanal were a long time couple and just prior to starting work on the album they broke up . Gwen wrote many the songs about the demise of their relationship . & quot ; Excuse Me Mr. & quot ; , & quot ; Hey You & quot ; , & quot ; End It On This & quot ; , & quot ; Happy Now ? & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; all deal with Gwen 's hurt over the break up . In songs like & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; , & quot ; Just A Girl & quot ; , & quot ; The Climb & quot ; and & quot ; You Can Do It & quot ; , Gwen is trying to cope with life after the breakup and her anger towards Tony . Matthew Wilder , who was a one hit wonder in the 80 's , tempers the heavy ska music the band played with a more accessable sound . The songs are about the hurt and anger of a broken relationship , but the music has a bright and sunny feel to it . In the tradition of Fleetwood Mac 's Rumours , the tensions between former lovers create great music .	1
I listened to this for the first time in a long time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds.This is the ultimate No Doubt album - terrific sound of ska/new wave/pop . Listening to this album again during our present penchant for 80 's revival made me realize that `` Tragic Kingdom '' was about 10 years ahead of it 's time . `` Spiderwebs '' , `` Excuse Me Mr '' , `` Just A Girl '' , `` Sunday Morning '' and `` Do n't Speak '' are all great singles.Hopefully this band will truly return to their great roots and return to this fine form in the near future ... I think it 's the perfect time !	1
This cd was the essence of the ska/punk genre , this cd definateley represents the best of the ska/punk mix as well . Then to top it all off Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt 's best release out of all of their albums . From songs such as Do n't Speak and Spiderwebs , Gwen shows off her amazingly strong voice , and does it very well . From the punk riffs , to the bright ska sound from the horn players No Doubt made a huge impression on the world of music .	1
No Doubt is probably the best alternative band out there , with second runners up by Garbage . My favorite tracks listed on TRAGIC KINGDOM are & quot ; Spiderwebs & quot ; , & quot ; Just A Girl & quot ; , and & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; . I could actually really care less for the other songs on this CD , but I still enjoy No Doubt which was the reason why I gave this 4 stars . Anyway , if you love bands like Garbage than you should definitely get TRAGIC KINGDOM . Also get RETURN OF SATURN , which is No Doubt 's new CD-release . Highly recommended .	1
Before this CD came out ska music was mostly isolated in its popularity to California , and had a small following in other places . Then along came No Doubt and kaboom , ska was launched into the public eye finally getting the recognition it deserved throughout the United States . Most modern ska bands can thank No Doubt for a good portion of their following because their fans probably owned the epic & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; at a time .	1
I just love Tragic Kingdom it has to be the best No Doubt album to date . It has four great singles Spiderweb , Just A Girl , Sunday Morning , and Do n't Speak . This has to be the best album of the 90 's and of '95 if you ask me . The whole album is a true rock album so do n't think twice about getting this album because you might just miss out on a great thing . If you are looking for a great rock album it has to be No Doubt 's Tragic Kingdom . Put this one in your collection today or you might miss out on a real true rock album .	1
This is one of the best CD 's I have . But I think that they did a better job at their new album , return of saturn . Tragic Kingdom was released in 1995 , and now it is 2001 , so people still listen to their 6 year ago songs . NO DOUBT 'S SONGS NEVER GET OLD ! ! ! ! ! ! THIS BAND ROCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I just keep loving their songs more and more and more , , , ,and I am sure that I will still keep listening to TRAGIC KINGDOM EVEN IF I HAD IT FOR 6 YEARS NOW ... . You are doing great guys ... .KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK ! ! ! !	1
I bought this album on a road trip with some friends on tape and when I saw it in this format i had to have it . Well worth any one 's time , weather your a pop fan or just like a good beat , you 'll love this album .	1
The alterna craze of '96 was an era not an error . The musical genre was full of eerie and haunting music that was moving but it did n't exactly get you all cheery . No Doubt was different . Their music was not sad or depressing at all . Maybe the lyrics were n't the most harmonious ones in the world , but , the music certainly was . Catchy tunes that put you in a good mood and make ya wan na dance are what No Doubt are all about . The attention-drawing lead singer Gwen Stefani has a knack for really getting into the songs and making them emotional and believable . She really is the empress of ska . From the amazing singles & quot ; Just A Girl , & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; , and & quot ; Spider Webs & quot ; to the more underground but fun songs like & quot ; Happy Now & quot ; , & quot ; Sixteen & quot ; , & quot ; Hey You & quot ; , and & quot ; Excuse Me Mr & quot ; , No Doubt give you plenty to enjoy for as long as you like . Although there are songs on this album that are less enchanting and not as memorable like & quot ; Different People & quot ; and the title track & quot ; Tragic Kingdom & quot ; , this band is still not a jester in their kingdom .	1
Not knowing anyone who does n't own this , or love this , is not surprising . Tragic Kingdom is what brought No Doubt up the charts , with the classic ska ballad Do n't Speak . A lot happend to the band during this album including the band 's jealousy of Gwen being the only one noticed . As you listen , you can actually hear the true closeness this band has . This album in particular heads toward a rock-edge , with enough trumpets to explode the sound system . What makes Tragic Kingdom noteworthy is the bands adorable , yet rock-hard tune , and the incredible , fun-loving band itself .	1
Some of you kids out there are not familiar with NO DOUBT . Its hard to believe , even you kids who are fans of the most recent GWEN STEFANI record , have no clue . At least not this album , which , is easy for me to say , the best record of her career.Ten years now , its been since this one got released , and man , did they stir up some pop radio waves . JUST A GIRL hit radios hard in late '95 early '96 , when pop culture was undergoing serious changes . Rock and marijuana hip hop were on top still , but sugar pop and boy bands were coming up the ranks ( we had no idea . ) This song was very crazy sounding , a mix of ska , punk and pop . It was completley unique , and this is when most of us were introduced to that blonde firecracker , GWEN STEFANI . Sure she 's still bangin ' , for sure , but back then this chick was part of the rock world , and was surely putting a young Wally Gator into a frenzy of hormonal insanity . I purchased this disc in 1996 , and really enjoyed it . SPIDERWEBS is another song that rocks the pop envelope to the hilt . The rest of this album is well written and much more stripped than anything else that would follow . If you have never heard this gem and are a fan of GWEN you outta check it out , it will blow you away . The sound and feel of this album has never been matched by anyone , even that sweet chick who wrote it .	1
Tragic Kindom has turned out to be one of the most successful and recognized albums of the early 90 's . Tragic Kingdom is unlike most No Doubt albums . The sound and feel of the album is true to their sun-shine California ska and third wave music . But Tragic Kingdom also offers songs like `` Dont Speak '' and `` Spiderwebs '' to a crowd of alternative listeners . This is a true album of talent .	1
My favorite singer of all-time flourishes with this piece of Latin history called AMOR PROHIBIDO . Her most recognized Tejano recording boasts charming pop/Latin tracks like & quot ; Amor Prohibido & quot ; and Selena 's very own penned & quot ; Bidi Bidi Bom Bom & quot ; , and the ballady & quot ; No Me Queda Mas & quot ; . I give this album 5 out of 5 stars because it shines poignantly like no other of Selena 's Latin CDs ! It 's not hard to guess why Selena would 've been up there with the likes of Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin . This is a Classic and a MUST BUY in my mind - and I 'm not even Hispanic ! She rules .	1
Everytime I hear Selena I think I might cry . This cd is perfect . RIP Selena .	1
unfortunately , this was her last spanish album . when you listen to her sing , you just know that she had such great potential . not only did she display her talents through singing , but also in fashion . she created her own outfits when she was performing on stage . of all her previous spanish albums she had released , i would say that this one is definately her best . this one put her more into the spot . the love the album cover and the colors . pink is my favorite color . i do n't usually listen to spanish music or tejano but if I had to , it got ta be Selena . She puts the spark into tejano music . i love her and i wish she could have live longer to display all her special talents to the world . all selena fans should definately pick up this album . it has more variety ... .pop , cumbia , mariachi , tropical , and a lil hint of reggae.my top 5:1 ) no me queda mas2 ) bidi bidi bom bom3 ) si una vez4 ) fotos y recuerdos5 ) techno cumbiahonorable mention : el chico del apartamento 512	1
Selena is a true artist of the people.While working on her English language album she decided to put out this album.I am glad Selena Y Los Dinos put this out because it spawned the most hits ... Every song on this album was a radio hit.It reached # 1 on the Latin charts and stayed # 1 for 53 weeks and it was a success ... It reached # 29 on Billboard 200 and achieved 2 platinum status.There is not a song on here I do n't like1 . Amor ProhibidoThis is an amazing track.This was a # 1 smash for Selena and still played on the radios today.2 . No Me Queda MasA true latin classic.This song is amazing.I never get tired of hearing it.Everytime I hear it..I feel like I am hearing it for the first time.3 . CobardeA radio hit song.She sang this one live at the Astrodome concert in 1995.It 's a great song.4 . Fotos Y RecuerdosAh.This would have to be my favorite track on the album.The song was taken from the Pretenders hit `` Back In The Chain Gang '' but of course Selena did a much better job.This a true latin classic.5 . El Chico Del Apartamento 512Hit after hit..This a great song.A song that you never get tired of hearing.6 . Bidi Bidi Bom BomWho does n't know this song ? This a true Selena signature song.It was a # 1 smash for Selena and I still hear it on radio stations today.7 . Techno CumbiaSelena took a new way to her music.Selena is sort of raping in this song.The song came out great and I think would of continued her music in this type.8 . Tus DespreciosThis is a great song.Selena still shows she has her Mexican influences in her.9 . Si Una VezAh.This is another favorite of mine.This is an amazing song and was another # 1 smash for Selena.It 's also a diffirent sound.10 . Ya NoGood way to end the album.This was a major radio hit.This is an amazing song and her first basically to have heavy metal guitar break downs.Make sure you pick a copy up of this album.You Wo n't Regret It !	1
First of all I love this CD to death . My favorite track is Ya No number 10 because it shows her rock side of her but the whole album is my favorite there is not one bad track on this album and she explores with different sounds with this album compares to her others . She was just so funky with this album and you can tell how much hard work her and the band put into it . They had four number one singles from this album Amor Prohibido , Bidi Bidi Bom Bom , No Me Queda Mas and Fotos Y Recuerdos ( Back In The Chain Gang ) . It was well produce and just a great album to listen to from start to finish so if you are getting into Selena this would be a good place to start to get to know what she did before her death because it shows you where she could of gone in the Latin Market .	1
This is one of the best albums ever recorded by any artist ever . I have the original 1994 issue , the version with the red sticker on the cover , and this , the best version available with excellent bonuses . YA NO , her best song she recorded , is on this disc . Fast-moving in a good way , this CD is probably the most essential Selena purchase . The commentary by her family is also informative and interesting . Anyone who does n't own this album is a fool in my book !	1
This is a great spanish album with sweet love songs and music you can dance to . Lots of variety . Selenas style is unmistakable ! Recommendations Selenas Anthology/Dreaming of You	1
For some odd reason , I 've been bumping a lot of stuff that came from the Jersey area this week.Lords of the Underground ( L.O.T.U.G. , DJ Lord Jazz , Doitall , and Mr. Funkee Man ) are probably one of the missed groups that came out from Newark , N.J. area . This was their debut album , `` Here Come The Lords '' that dropped back in '93 . This album was entirely produced my Marley Marl and K-Def . This album alone has some of the most excellent production I 've heard from the East Coast in a minute . Most of the production is unique and garunteed to make your head bob . When I first heard `` Funky Child '' , I could n't stop bobbing my head to the loud horns that K-Def and Marley Marl hooked up for this group . Other awesomly produced songs were the hit song `` Chief Rocka '' ( I believe that 's their well known song ) . `` Keep It Underground '' is also another song with great production.As for the trio themselves , they bring many lyrics to the mic on this album , and it seems like they were having a lot of fun doing it . `` Mad Skillz '' shows exactly what the group has . One humorous track would be `` Sleep For Dinner '' . The song will make you laugh but at the same time they were being serious . `` Grave Digga '' and `` Psycho '' are also standouts . DJ Lord Jazz even gets some love on the song `` Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time ( Make It Funky ) '' .As for anything bad . There is n't much at all if you ask me . One thing I found a little aggravating was the fact they kept shouting out their name throughout most of the album . Other than that , this is one excellent album from the Brick City . This album is full of East Coast flavor that has some great production . Given this , I will make an effort to check out their sophomore album `` Keepers Of The Funk '' . This is one that I highly recommend that you listen to , because you will love it.Lyrics : AProduction : A+Guest Appearances : N/AMusical Vibes : AOverall : AFavorite Tracks : Here Come The Lords , From Da Bricks , Funky Child , Keep It Underground , Check It ( Remix ) , Grave Digga , Flow On , Mad Skillz , Psycho , Chief Rocka , Sleep For Dinner , Lords Of The Underground , Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time ( Make It Funky ) Peace Everyone .	1
In 1993 , Newark 's own Lords of the Underground dropped their slept-on classic debut , `` Here Come the Lords . '' This album is one of my favorites from a great year of hip hop , and it 's terribly underrated . Recently I 've been reviewing some of my favorite slept-on albums and this one immediately came to mind . This album has so much going for it . Besides the obvious talent and ability of the MCs Doitall , Mr. Funke , and DJ Lord Jazz , this album was produced in its entirety by the legendary Marley Marl and his gifted young protege K-Def . The beats on this album are absolutely insane . Every song has a soaring horn line and full instrumentation , usually heavy saxes or trumpets . The beats are always hard and the bass is thumping , giving it a rugged yet polished underground type of feel . It 's not the grimy type of east coast underground rap that would later emerge , if I were to compare it to someone I would compare it to Das EFX with better production . Lyrically the rappers are crazy , as one reviewer noted they have similar voices and flows to Dre and Skoob of Das EFX but lyrically they are quite different . They display an often wild style , representing their hometown to the fullest but often tackling very interesting issues like the state of hip hop and growing up poor . This album has huge entertainment album , and its consistency is amazing , no track is really much worse than the previous one musically or lyrically . `` Here Come the Lords '' is an awesome , underrated album that I highly recommend to 90s hip hop fans.The album starts with the title track , which has a pretty subdued beat for this album and a yelled chorus , it 's a nice introduction . `` From da Bricks '' is hard and bass-heavy , and Doitall and Funke speak strictly of their hometown of Newark . `` Funky Child '' might be the standout , an absolute standout with an awesome trumpet line . I love the beginning ( `` the year is 1971 ... '' ) and the whole track is just crazy . `` Keep It Underground '' gives props to `` real '' MCs and disses fake ones , it has a great sax line in the hook . A cool organ beat and angry lyrics are to be found on `` Check It ( Remix ) , '' and `` Grave Digga '' boasts a wild synth . `` Lords Prayer '' has a cool intro that gives to another nice track , and `` Flow On '' is a product of great sampling and verses . `` Mad Skillz '' and `` Psycho '' are two especially funky tracks , full of boasts and bragadagio . `` Chief Rocka '' has my favorite beat , with a tuba on it and another nice hook . `` Sleep for Dinner '' is lyrically the best song , recalling a childhood of poverty where they often went to bed without being fed ( `` Everyone today prob'ly knows me as Mr. Funke / but back in the day you could 've called me Mr. Hungry '' ) . `` L.O.T.U.G . '' is another jazzy cut , and DJ Lord Jazz rips his number `` Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time . '' The closer , `` What 's Goin ' On , '' is another expertly produced track slamming the `` pop '' rapper . `` Here Come the Lords '' is the rare album where truly great rapping meets impeccable production . A totally slept-on classic . I highly recommend it to fans of Das EFX , Black Moon , and DITC , and other similarly minded east coast rappers from the 90s . This album has never received its due attention , but it 's just entertaining and totally enjoyable the whole way through .	1
Back in '92 alittle known Jersey group released the songs `` Funky Child '' and `` Psycho '' and immediately got the industry buzzing with their high octane delivery and flows . The almost apocalyptic samples and beats , particularly on `` Psycho '' made them stand out from the other groups at the time like ONYX or DAS EFX . When a legend like Marley Marl and his protege K-Def decide to produce your album it gets people talking and paying attention . So when the album followed the next year it had been hyped up and alot of fans were dying to hear it , myself included . Ive no idea what took me so long to review this but it probably has something to do with the fact hiphop sounds very stale at the moment to me so Im digging out alot of my older cd 's to listen to . Anyway even now nearly 14years on it sounds tight as a facelift . With tracks like `` Here comes the lords '' , `` From da bricks '' , `` Funky child '' , `` Madd skillz '' , `` Psycho '' ( amazing ) , `` Chief rocka '' ( still unbelieveably good ) , `` L.o.t.u.g . `` , `` Lord jazz hit me one time '' and the finale `` What 's goin ' on ? '' its a classic without a doubt . There 's afew speedbumps that take away from it but heh its from a long time ago so you got ta excuse that . Hiphop could do with groups like LOTUG right about now .	1
In the past year or so I 've been on an early 90s kick and somewhere in my searches I came across Lords of the Underground . I put on some sound clips . What hit me immediately was that it sounded so ... pure . It was taking it 's hyper pounding funk sound as far as it could go , pulling no punches . I put the album in my cart and got exactly what I paid for.Lords of the Underground are a group from Jersey consisting of Mr. Funke , DoItAll , and DJ Lord Jazz , with production from Marley Marl and K-Def . This came out in '93 , but the vibe is very old-school . DoItAll and Mr. Funke come from a school of rhyme that predates other '93 releases , when MCs were n't so lyrical and did n't take themselves very seriously . The rapping has a humorous tone throughout , but the Lords do n't focus on content . What 's important is their charged delivery , loud and fast , with yelled chants instead of hooks . It 's enough to get any crowd hype.But the truth is , Marley Marl and K-Def added at least as much as the Lords to this disc . They provide banger after banger , steady coming with the heavy-hitting bass and blaring horns . I 've never heard so much crazy energy fused into tracks as on this album . They have an old-school sound but with a kind of chaotic quality , as opposed to the overly-simplistic beats from the 80s . Song after song will get your head banging right from and start and keep it going till the fade-out.There 's no wack tracks on here , but some are better than others . The more conceptual songs , which are missed from a lot of other rappers ' albums , are actually the weakest ones on here because they 're not what the Lords do best . The beats bang a little less and lyrics come to the forefront , but Funke and DoItAll are n't really accomplished lyricists so these slow down the album . `` Lords Prayer '' and `` Sleep For Dinner '' serve to show off the Lords ' sense of humor , but `` Grave Digga '' and `` Psycho '' are less impressive.But for the most part , this album is very solid and could be considered classic . That is , if you like to nod your head . The truth is , Lords of the Underground sometimes feel like a one-trick pony , but the trick is so damn good you wo n't even care . Plus the old-school vibe gives it a feel of 100 % pure hip-hop , removed from the politics , watering down of sounds , beefing , etc . that were starting the plague the growing rap industry at the time . Definitely a worthy part of any Golden Age hip-hop collection .	1
Very tight New Jeru classic . Every joint is a hit . I ca n't pick a favorite . They all bring a lot of energy and charisma when they rap and Marley Marl kills it on production*	1
i can not say anything bad about the lords of the underground 's first album , man . it 's raw , it 's hardcore , and it 's good hip hop with enough head noddahs on it to satisfy the cravings . it 's dated , yes , but it 's enjoyable to listen to if you are an '88 cat like me ... ... ..or if you are a young cat who wants to dig deepah . boom shack-ah-lacka indeed .	1

& quot ; Funky , funky sh*t. & quot ; In three words or less , that 's the only way to do this debut LP justice.From the grimiest ( One can only envision w/ hearing this CD ) part of Newark , NJ emerges the Lords of the Underground . Influenced by fellow NJ rapper Redman ( It seems all NJ rappers give mad props to Red ) and backed by legendary funky producer Marley-Marl , the LOTUG create a GEM of an album.Although their style is in the likeness of a more clear and coherent Das-EFX , the LOTUG come off with high-energy originality . This is not a mellow album , it 's a fast-paced ride through Newark 's dirty underworld ( at least that 's how I see it ) .The best track ( because it 's so hilarious and original ) is the & quot ; Sleep for Dinner ( Remix ) , & quot ; with it 's woeful tales of hunger in the ghetto ... they somehow make it seem humerous . Also look for & quot ; Chief Rocka , & quot ; & quot ; L.O.T.U.G , & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; What 's Goin ' On ? & quot ; These four tracks alone have beats that blow my mind.You should know that every track is sick . This is one of those albums that can be listened to straight through again & amp ; again ( the likes of which we really have n't seen any of in the past few years ) .Bottom Line : Amazing funky beats & amp ; on-point original lyrics make this a masterpiece of an album . I recommend this to any fan of REDMAN , ARTIFACTS , DAS-EFX , MARLEY-MARL or any fan of funky hip-hop . 5 stars . Peace .	1
3 cats from Newark , NJ going by the individual names of DoItAll ( Dupre Kelly ) , Mr. Funkyman ( Alterik Wardrick ) and Lord Jazz ( Bruce Colston ) after graduating from Shaw University and singing with Pendulum records , release the answer to Das EFX 's Dead Serious debut with Here Come The Lords . The feud between these two is on the the not so talked about beefs in hip hop but the public and on recording disses back and forth were memorable . Credited with production was split between the legendary Marley Marl and Kevin `` K-Def '' Hansford . 1993 was an excellent year for the Lords with the head banging debut single `` Psycho '' with the wild and wicked flow of DoItAll and the perplexed style of Mr . Funkyman . ( This was truly a blessing to Funky especially since his mother passed a year prior to this album being released ) . The follow up single `` Funky Child '' in terms of context was a continuation of `` Psycho '' and the third single `` Chief Rocka '' came across as a little more laid back and not as extravagant as the first 2 singles displaying the the Lords had more in the reportoire ( the spelling might be off ) . Along side fellow Newark representative Redman . The Lords definitely represented the Brick City well .	1
An incredibly special release , Edgar Froese , Christopher Franke and Johannes Schmoelling shape incredible soundscapes in the 1983 release.The use of a sitar on No Man 's Land delivers a new dimension to the TD repertoire , while the title track flows into Cinnamon Road for more than 12 minutes of artistry . Sphinx Lightning is an electronically-charged gem.There is a fine crispness to the performances and is a foundation to a prolific output throughout the decade ... and beyond .	1
Hyperborea ( 1983 ) would prove to be the last Tangerine Dream album released on the Virgin Records label , and the mood throughout is contemplative ; even reflective at times . I have to say that this is a fine album and along with Tangram ( 1980 ) is certainly one of the better albums released by Tangerine Dream during the 1980s.The lineup consists of Johannes Schmoelling ( synthesizers , programming , keyboards ) , Edgar Froese ( synthesizers , bass guitar , electric guitar , and keyboards ) , and Christopher Franke ( engineer , drums , synthesizers ) . Although heavily synthesizer oriented , electric guitar parts do turn up here and there , along with drum parts ( both electronic and acoustic ) . Synthesizer tone colors are generally warm sounding . Other instrumentation includes a sitar on a few tracks.The four tracks range in length from 3:54 ( Cinnamon Road ) to the lengthy 20:01 closing epic Sphinx Lightning , with the total running time around 40:15 . Overall , this is a subdued album that may take a few listens before it fully reveals its subtleties.The individual tracks sound quite different from one another and range from the art music of India - No Man 's Land features very subtle electronic `` drones '' and tabla-like effects generated on synthesizers , to the quirky , melodic track Cinnamon Road , which sounds like an electronic pop tune . Whereas Cinnamon Road is the most 1980s sounding track on the album ( and is not totally satisfying ) , No Man 's Land is one of the more interesting compositions on the album . On the other side of the coin , the gloomy and brooding title track and the epic Sphinx Lightning encapsulate the finest aspects of the `` classic '' Tangerine Dream sound . In fact , I could hear the faintest references to albums like Force Majeure ( 1979 ) and possibly Rubycon ( 1975 ) . Throughout the entire album is a rhythmic element that is alternately subtle and `` gently insistent '' .This definitive edition is not so hot although the sound quality is very good . The liner notes are very skimpy and feature the covers to the albums released on the Virgin Records label , along with some generic notes on the band.All in all , this was a fine way to close out the Virgin years ; a period of incredible productivity and creativity . Recommended along with Tangram ( 1980 ) and Force Majeure ( 1979 ) .	1
With some exceptions , I think TD 's music from the 70 's is horrible . But not all of it . Ricochet is good and the song Green Desert I still think stands as one of their best . By my standards , Hyperborea is one of the best things they ever did . The sound is lucid and not a jumble of crazy , unrelated noises like I have experienced on some of their other recordings . Christopher Franke was still with the band and for my money , Tangerine Dream was one half Froese and one half Franke . The songs on this CD move well and are truly creative and original although you still have the same distinctive sound . With Franke gone TD is just not what it used to be . Every song here is good and the 20 minute `` Sphinx Lightning '' is the kind of stuff Tangerine Dreams are made of . The gradual changing of rhythms on this album is what makes it unique . Hyperborea , from 1983 , still has to be one of their best .	1
I listened to this CD during a journey through the Austrian Alps a few years ago , and I found the music very stimulating . Taking a closer look , & quot ; Hyperborea & quot ; is just an arty patchwork of difficult anti-rhythms and well-known space-rock ingredients . And that 's exactly the point why TD 's early-'80s work is so attractive and easy to listen to . The title track with its slow , relentless beats and mighty synth sounds is impressive and corresponds to the cover image . & quot ; Cinnamon road & quot ; is sparkling and refreshing high-tech pop in the style of TD 's early-'80s soundtracks like & quot ; Flashpoint & quot ; and & quot ; Risky business & quot ; . & quot ; No man 's land & quot ; and & quot ; Sphinx lightning & quot ; are densely percussive tracks with a somehow claustrophobic atmosphere . Although this album contains music which is as stiff and desolate as an Icelandic glacier , it 's well-devised and enjoyable . After this , Schmoelling 's departure proved to be a severe blow for TD 's creativity . When Franke also quit a few years later , this once pioneering band had already slipped down into the realm of mediocre adult alternative music . So , I would say & quot ; Hyperborea & quot ; is TD 's last album which shows some progressive elements .	1
Hyperborea ( 1983 ) . Tangerine Dream 's 18th ( ? ) studio album.After indulging and pioneering the way throughout the 70s as an experimental free-form synth-score instrumental group , Germany 's Tangerine Dream decided to start broadening their audience by adding in rhythm sequences and a more set structure to their themes . Force Majeure ( 1979 ) was the first real one to do this , but it was n't until Exit ( 1981 ) that they started including more than 3-4 songs per album , sometimes shortening their lengths . During the early 80s synthesizer and keyboard technology were rapidly improving in quality , and oftentimes TD was frantically trying to keep up with the pace by releasing a multitude of albums in a rather short period of time . I 've always enjoyed listening to their progress in both the sound and technology over the years , seeing as this electronic/rock group has existed since the late 60s.While Exit and White Eagle ( 1982 ) both had a really high-reverb keyboard sound , by Hyperborea the technology had evened out somewhat , enabling a more fully exploitable array of sounds to be produced . Also , Hyperborea stands out a bit from the preceeding few and succeeding albums due to its more calming pace , though dark themes are still as prevalent as they had been at the time . Other sounds with cultural references to Middle-Eastern and West African instruments were starting to be incorporated into the music , so the keyboard themes are given plenty of breathing space for variety in tones . At times , the music can sound dated , but it 's a bit less noticeable than some of the other albums . The feel given off by the album is that there is a dreamy and deep ( sometimes dark , and other times melancholic ) air all around , but when a frantic moment erupts from the calm its presence is felt to be contrasting and more powerful . I know all of this kind of sounds weird , but just listen to the album yourself and you 'll also notice that the music here is very picturesque.It begins with 'No Man 's Land ' , the track bearing the most usage of this cultural instrument incorporation . In fact , most of the 9-minute opus is made up of these varying instruments . Other reviews here do a great job explaining which is what , so look there for more information . This is probably my least favorite track on here since it kind of drags toward the end , but that 's not saying much because it still rules . Then there 's the gloomy 8-minute title track which opens very powerfully with a ethereal keyboard melody and a dominatingly slow pace . Over time , it fades into a beat-driven ending section which to me sounds almost like a minor-take on the end of 'Kiev Mission 's ' ending section from Exit . 'Cinnamon Road ' is Hyperborea 's only short-length track , sporting a strong upbeat baseline and a catchy melody . It serves as this album 's 'Midnight In Tula ' , 'Chorozon ' , or 'Le Parc - LA Streethawk ' so to speak . Then we arrive at the final track , the masterpiece 'Sphinx Lightning ' which spans about 20 minutes in length . It starts off with various synth flashes , and throughout the next 10 minutes or so it slowly builds up from an airy atmospheric distance into a more pulse-pounding rhythm array and strong keyboard line . It then calms down into a more somber and melodic low key , often reminiscent of Pink Floyd . Other instruments pop in at times , and then the song closes with a more optimistic finish , contrasting the dark passages of the beginning.Replayability : Lower than some of the other albums , though it fits PERFECTLY if you 're in the right mood for it.Though Hyperborea may not be the best place for new TD fans to start , it 's definitely well worth your time to look into once you 've gotten your feet wet . Actually , if you prefer the more eerie and experimentally freeform styles of 70s TD , then Hyperborea may actually be a good place to transition the two eras due to the album 's dreamy nature . It gets 4.5 stars easily , being that the album manages to last over 45 minutes even though there are technically only four tracks . It 's not for everybody though , and some people may be put off by the sound , as indicated in some of the negative reviews , but Hyperborea is a somewhat forgotten and underrated gem in the vast TD back-catalogue . It was the final Virgin Years album after 10 years of collaboration , and so the Blue Years period would begin soon after ( from Poland ( 1984 ) all the way up to Tyger ( 1987 ) ) . Find them cheap online somewhere due to the fact that the old and remastered cd editions seem to be out of print in most stores . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO TD FANS.Other atmospheric TD albums : -Phaedra ( 1974 ) , Rubycon ( 1975 ) , Stratosphere ( 1976 ) , Force Majeure ( 1979 ) , and Tangram ( 1980 ) If you prefer 80s-styled TD , then get : -Exit ( 1981 ) , Thief ( 1981 ) , White Eagle ( 1982 ) , Logos ( 1982 ) , Poland ( 1984 ) , Le Parc ( 1985 ) , Underwater Sunlight ( 1986 ) , and Tyger ( 1987 )	1
This is one of my favorite albums from Tangerine Dream . Virgin definitely has most of the most important of the more than 100 albums from Tangerine Dream . And yet Virgin really only had about 14 Tangerine Dream titles . `` No Man 's Land '' has a beautiful indian influence with its altered synthesized sitar sound . Next is the title track which is so soothing and ethereal . This is one to be played loud with yourself , somehow buoyantly floating , in between your speakers , and you must not be on your feet . You must find a way to simulate actual floatation to truly embrace this track . `` Cinnamon Road '' give the impression that Tangerine Dream is going to try to make more shorter recordings . It 's a great track but I was afraid that Tangerine Dream may get a strong pleasing response from this one track , and therefore , their longer album side compositions were going to become less and less prevalent as they leave Virgin Records and start becoming more pop sounding with their instrumentation . But , of course , Tangerine Dream still gives us that one great long soundscape with `` Sphinx Lightning '' to close this album and this chapter in their sound career.So Tangerine Dream ends their contract with Virgin Records on a strong note . I do n't know how Virgin could just let them go . Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield has to be the best selling artists in their catalog . I call these two kinds of artists `` The Pioneers of Technical Sound Invention '' along side of Klaus Schulze and Jean Michel Jarre .	1
This is a really cool cd . Very mellowed-out , seductive , chilled-out , whatever you want to call the style . A great example of trip-hop/downtempo tunes , especially the title track and & quot ; Heat Miser & quot ; which are my favorites . Recommended .	1
Massive Attack have gotten a lot of praise , but most of it is either for their first album Blue Lines , or for their third album Mezzanine . Protection tends to get lost between those two . But in fact , it 's Protection that 's really the best Massive Attack album . I can listen to it the whole way through , and when it 's over , I find myself wishing there was even more . I ca n't even remember the last time I bought an album that I could say that about.Perhaps Protection does n't have the same reputation as Blue Lines and Mezzanine because it does n't have any `` obvious '' hits , deliberately powerful songs like `` Safe From Harm '' or `` Angel . '' The biggest single here is `` Protection , '' a long eight-minute rumination without any particular build-up or dramatic climax . The chorus is n't a pop chorus , either , because it does n't repeat a hook . But nevertheless , the song is beautiful . The gentle mid-tempo rhythm steadily draws one into the mood of the song.The lyrics in the album do n't matter so much . Massive Attack were never known for being great poets . But the words do contribute to the mood . In `` Protection , '' Tracey Thorn encourages `` you '' to take care of someone who needs help , which first means some girl , but later seems to become `` you . '' The choice of words is good : `` You can lean on me / And that 's more than love , that 's the way it should be '' and `` She 's a girl and you 're a boy / Sometimes we look so small . '' I really like Massive Attack 's style of romanticism -- instead of dramatizing individual angst and professing eternal love ( okay , except for `` One Love , '' I guess , but even that was more about how Horace Andy believes in being faithful than about star-crossed bliss ) , they usually refer to smaller , everyday situations and imply that small changes in these situations might have a great impact . No wonder they make the best make-out music . By the way , Protection is excellent for that purpose.Then there 's `` Karmacoma , '' another candidate for a big single that also does n't quite fit comfortably into that role . The song does have a pop chorus , and features Robert del Naja and Tricky in a Blue-Lines-like rap exchange , but it 's driven by a very curious reggae-inflected rhythm and a groovy keyboard break that resembles old Latin music more than techno or hip-hop . The song is upbeat , but it has the same hushed production as `` Protection , '' which makes it sound disconcerting and vaguely ominous . This is very different from the band 's earlier work , and it 's all the more impressive when you consider that , by 1994 , other bands had just begun catching up to Blue Lines , which had been released three years earlier.Protection is very different from Massive Attack 's other albums stylistically . I usually say that Blue Lines is a modern-day soul album , with elements of rap and techno . Those things are still present here , but the overall atmosphere is closer to some kind of old-style , early twentieth-century romance than to smooth 70s soul , albeit with a techno production . There are two instrumentals which use pianos and strings for the main melodies . Both of them are gorgeous . `` Weather Storm '' in particular anchors the pianos with a deep electronic bass groove and dub-style keyboard textures . `` Heat Miser '' repeats what sounds like someone breathing through an oxygen mask . Somehow , next to the strings , this has a poignant effect , creating a sense of fragility.Protection also has the least reliance of all Massive Attack albums on the band 's core vocalists . Robert del Naja appears on only two songs , compared to four on each of the other albums . The ever-reliable Horace Andy has one turn on `` Spying Glass , '' a remake of one of his own old Jamaican standards , with a great deep house beat and some reggae-style drum breaks . The other songs are either instrumentals or use guest vocalists , and by the way , Protection also has the best guest vocalists of any Massive Attack album . Nicolette Suwoton in particular has a very distinctive vocal style , but both women perform with subtlety and dramatic restraint , compared to Shara Nelson 's occasional soul-diva histrionics ( not that that 's altogether a bad thing ) or Sara Jay 's angsty spoiled-teenager voice.But even though Protection does n't have any obvious hits , I liked it immediately , whereas it took me a long time to really enjoy Blue Lines and Mezzanine as albums . That 's because those other albums also have a bunch of lesser songs that do n't make strong impressions when compared to the big hits . But the songs on Protection are consistently excellent . The second side is just as good as the first . For instance , `` Better Things '' might seem like a rewrite of `` Protection , '' because it features the same vocalist and uses a similar musical backdrop , but in fact , it stands up perfectly well on its own . The lyrics are knowing and bitter , and Tracey Thorn delivers them with a weary understatement that almost makes one feel vicariously ashamed for whoever it is that she 's addressing . Immediately after that is `` Eurochild , '' which has the kind of noirish menace that I really wish someone could depict these days . Tricky and del Naja 's relaxed , gravelly half-whispers are perfect for suggesting danger underneath the surface , and halfway through the song there 's an instantly catchy keyboard hook . This would be a good candidate for a big hit , but it was n't released as a single.The only flaw of the album is the very last track , a live cover of `` Light My Fire '' by The Doors . The recording is so muddy that only Horace Andy 's voice is audible , and anyway , that 's not the sort of song that Massive Attack are best at . I prefer to think of it as an unnecessary bonus track rather than part of the album . The album itself , however , is perfect , and I highly recommend it regardless of whether or not you usually enjoy this kind of music .	1
When Massive Attack 's Blue Lines first appeared in 1991 the music was completely ground breaking and the lyrics hauntingly simply and beautiful and so welcomed by the world ready for that sort of message and the way of its delivery . Protection , delivered in 1994 by pretty much the same people grouped under the banner of Massive Attack not only did not disappoint us , but in many ways reinforced and upgraded the original feeling . Most of us where so glad to be able to place Massive Attack at the top if our then current music scene and watch them reap the rewards of their well deserved success . The significance of their music and lyrics was their focus on what brings us all together and their desire to work towards the good and common of all of us , by setting their vision straight ahead , rather than looking around to point out what bothers us about ourselves . There was good uniting energy layered between the novel sounds if our chilling , down tempo experience.The atmosphere of Protection feels as interesting to me today 15 years later as it did when it first came out . Protection is my favorite album by Massive Attack and it is not an easy choice to make . Fans of this band are most likely fairly equally divided between calling any one of their first 3 albums as their favorite . They are all great and I am choosing the middle one because I sense and I am attracted to the variation of mood which Protection delivers . I am very influenced by the lightness and the ambience of tone of this music.The title song Protection is my favorite song of this album . The lyric is simple and powerful , the voice of Tracy Thorn is perfect to bring her message across . Melodically this title song has two layers mixed into it . There is a rather simple bass and drum based melody but the underlying electronic mood escalates and develops beautifully . I would love to have that ambient background on its own , without the drum and bass and vocal tracks . That ambient mood dances around the base melody and sound which gives us the full effect of this song . Karmacoma might have he most techno feel to it . It is the first of 2 songs on this album where the song is performed by Tricky and 3D singing or rapping it in alternating succession and this song has their jointly singing parts as well . Three is one of the most beautiful songs of Protection . It is a soulful down tempo mood with great vocal by Nicolette and intriguing lyrics but the texture becomes much more dimensional by the echo of ` three ' rapped in the background . Weather Storm is an electronica ambient instrumental Craig Armstrong style with his unique piano playing . Spying Glass is sort of a distorted reggae song placed against the atmospheric background . Better Things has a dubbed bass feel to it musically but vocally and lyrically it is one of the best songs of the album . The difference of sound and mood and the overall dimension between Better Things and following it Eurochild is a perfect example of the greatness of this moody Protection . We are being taken from one place to another , completely different , with such ease and comfort . Eurochild is a beautiful dialog between Tricky and 3D and the sound is again Protection specific . This song is like Karmacoma played in the background with a beautiful melody playing over it and overpowering it . It is a great song with many elements and sounds coming together and taking us from place to place during these five minutes . Sly is another song sung by Nicolette . It is less complex musically and lyrics are leaving us ... 'wandering ' ... It is one of the weaker songs of this album and that is a complement . It is still a nice song . Heat Miser is a very nice instrumental reminding me of Craig Armstrong 's influence again . He is the master of the mood created and sustained so well here . Picking a song by The Doors as a song to cover shows great taste on the part of Massive Attack as well as the desire to build new bridges between us . However it is not my favorite cover by any means and the sound of this recording could be more interesting as well . To be honest , this is the only song of this album which I might end up skipping over , if I was to listen to this music on repeat with a remote control right next to me . Here are some of my favorite songs of Massive Attack and Tricky ( up to 2009 ) : Unfinished Sympathy . Protection , Dissolved Girl , Trinity Dub , Car Crash , Heat Miser , Three , Contradictive , Teardrop , Safe From Harm ( perfecto mix ) , Evolution Revolution Love , Blue Lines , Angel , Better Things , Inertia Creeps , Hymn Of The Big Wheel .	1
This second album from the pioneer group Massive Attack entitled `` Protection '' is a very good but also a very uneven album in it 's own right but compared to their other stuff , `` Protection '' is an unfortunate victim to their later two albums `` Mezzanine '' and `` 100th Window '' in my opinion.One thing that really stands out though is that this album has a very hazy summer evening kind of mood , kind of like those hazy sunsets : that 's what the music on this album evokes . Most of this album is very lightweight compared to `` Mezzanine '' but on it 's own `` Protection '' has plenty to offer.My favorite tracks are the title track , `` Karmacoma '' and `` Weatherstorm '' .The title track is easily the best track on this entire album . This track to me is one of the best mid 1990s chill-out tracks featuring a very nice hip-hop beat , and Tracey Thorn 's absolutely crystal clear vocals which dominate this track . Wow ! She sounds absolutely incredible on this track . This album is worth buying just for the title track alone . `` Karmacoma '' is another favorite track of mines with an excellent blend of chill-out dance and some reggae elements . The somewhat subdued rapping is actually quite good.ALthough no bad songs by any stretch of the imagination , this album starts to kind of go all over the place and somewhat meander aimlessly in places . `` Weather Storm '' is actually quite a fantastic and a great romantic relaxing song to listen to while basking in the sun on a summer evening but even though I really love this track , this one belongs on a smooth jazz Cd or on a smooth jazz station . I could actually recall hearing this on a smoothe jazz station one time a while back but had no idea that it was actually Massive Attack . But because I love smooth jazz , I actually enjoy this track but it feels way out of place on this album . Still `` Weather Storm '' is a great track and one of my favorites so it 's completely forgiveable . It 's just that `` Weather Storm '' felt like someone else 's recording was accidentally put on this album . That 's all.The album picks back up on `` Spying Glass '' which is a really cool trancy dance song with a slight reggae-ish edge to it and great , if somewhat , weird vocals by Andy.This CD starts to meander off from here forth . I actually found `` Better Things '' to be bland and unremarkable despite having the crystal clear vocals from Tracey Thorn . The beat is weak and the song feels unfinished almost like a demo tape . Still , not bad but nothing to write home about.Although the remaining tracks are enjoyable to an extent , they are n't a lot to write home about either . The live version of `` Light My Fire '' though is interesting.It 's really ironic how this album showcased almost nothing of the darkness and dark inner psyche that would ultimately culminate in what I consider the greatest trip hop album of all time `` Mezzanine '' three years later . `` Protection '' may be their weakest album but do n't let the word `` weakest '' I typed here deter you from getting this album . Do not look for anything in the vein of `` Mezzanine '' nor `` 100th Window '' but if you are willing to check it out on it 's own merits , this album will be better than what most have made it out to be , perhaps even more than I have written it out to be .	1
& quot ; Protection & quot ; is another classic Massive Attack album that breaks the mold in what trip-hop/dub music is . Not as strong as their debut & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; or the phenomenal & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; , & quot ; Protection & quot ; still impresses with its sinsiter grooves , nigh-disturbing lyrics and poignant vocals .	1
This is a terrific album dating from 1995 . Massive Attack use many different vocalists and instrumentalists , and the overall style is slowish urban 90 's music with beguiling rhythms and cool voices . It is well produced and quite sophisticated . The title track Protection is one of my all-time favourite tracks by anybody . Tracey Thorn from Everything But The Girl sings this excellent song . Other ones I like are the slow groove Heat Miser and the unusual rhythm of Karmacoma , which I grew to like . There 's a live recording of Light My Fire , which proves that Massive Attack are a good live attraction as well as being great in the studio . I listen to this album frequently and I can strongly recommend it to any people who like great music .	1
I love Massive Attack . Their music is dark and foreboding . & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; introduced the world to Tricky as well as established itself as a timeless classic . & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; really brought trip hop to the forefront on the US music scene . In between & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; and & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; is & quot ; Protection & quot ; . & quot ; Protection & quot ; is an underlooked and underrated album filled with some of my personal favorite songs from the talented UK trip hop group . I loved the title track from the moment I first saw the music video for the song on MTV pre-TRL . & quot ; Protection & quot ; is simply classic Tracey Thorn . Her vocals just makes me melt . There is something about her voice that I find comforting and reassuring . She does an outstanding job on this song . I immediately fell in love with & quot ; Karmacoma & quot ; within a matter of seconds . I love hearing the group 's reggae influences ring out through the entire song . & quot ; Weather Storm & quot ; is a gorgeous instrumental . I could hear Craig Armstrong 's influence throughout the entire track . Just a beautiful song that will haunt me for years to come . The production of this album is as raw as & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; and & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; , maybe even more so ( in my opinion ) . Their cover of The Door 's & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; is quite compelling and unique . Is it better than the original ? I didd n't think so but it is just as good . After listening to & quot ; Protection & quot ; , I have to say this album has to be my personal favorite of the three Massive Attack albums that I own ( at least until the new album comes out ) .	1
This album is often derided as the only misstep in the distinguished career of Massive Attack . True , it is not as immediate as & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; or as coherent as & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; , but & quot ; Protection & quot ; has an allure all its own . That the songs do n't seem to fit together is part of the album 's charm and appeal . Tracy Thorn kicks off the festivities with the epic title track , giving voice to one of the most poignant and evocative love ( or is it anti-love ) songs ever recorded . As is always the case with MA , the production is stellar and a harbinger of things to come ( Thorn also turns up on the pleasant , but bland `` Better Things '' ) . 3-D and a pre-solo career Tricky share rapping duties on the harrowing `` Karmacoma '' , a stark , head nodding blend of rap and reggae . Billie Holliday sound alike , Nicolette takes over vocals on `` Three '' , seamlessly navigating the song 's watery groove . Scottish composer/producer Craig Armstrong makes the first of three appearances on this album with `` Weather Storm '' . It 's not MA 's strongest track , but it succeeds in creating a late night , quiet storm vibe . Elsewhere , Armstrong , conducts the strings on the amazing `` Sly '' ( a Jungian tale sung with appropriate mysticism and mystery by Nicolette ) ; and tickles the ivories on the new agish `` Heat Miser '' . Tricky and 3-D return to the mic on the sleek , city song `` Eurochild '' . MA regular Horace Andy appears on the sinewy `` Spying Glass '' ( a reworking of his own tune `` Spy Glass '' ) , and the album closing live cover of the Doors ' `` Light My Fire '' . In both instances , his vocal stylings are a perfect compliment to MA 's reggae-oriented dance jams . Following up a masterpiece like & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; was always going to be tricky ( no pun intended ) ; but with the all-over-the-map & quot ; Protection & quot ; , MA managed to move forward without sacrificing any of their originality or spirit .	1
Massive Attack coupled with the vocal stylings of Tracey Thorn make for an incredible combination , that is what you get in this CD . Every track on & quot ; Protection & quot ; is great and there is something for everyone : ballads , reggae , dance , and a great live performance at the end . Highly recommended .	1
When I first heard this cd I was blown away . I love everything on it except the Doors cover . The beats are fresh . The bass is thick . The layers are perfect . Tracy Thorn has become one of my favorite singers because of this record . It really made me re-evaluate where my music was going . In a time when people swore grunge was the future of music these cats were playing it ultra cool . In the question of 5 cd 's I would take if stuck on a desert island this would make the cut without thinking .	1
the song Spying Glass introduced me to the band ... but my first actual album was Mezzanine , which I liked a lot . But this one I 'm starting to like much better . I like the more hip-hopish beats on this one , and its a lot more mellow . Spying Glass is just an amazing song to me ... and I also like Karmacoma . The whole CD is great . Pick this one up : ) Oh ... and ignore the last track .	1
While & quot ; Protection & quot ; might not be as good as their first album & quot ; Blue lines & quot ; and a bit overshadowed by other albums it 's far from a bad apple in any way , actually one of my favorites with a distance . It 's a bit unever though , some songs are close to perfection but some feels forgettable by now . The first song , the title track & quot ; Protection & quot ; is sang by Tracy Thorn from & quot ; Everything But the Girl & quot ; it 's this albums best song and was a hit back them aswell . Tracy 's haunting lyrics and voice fits the hip hop beats and samples perfect . The hook is also memorably good . & quot ; Karmacoma & quot ; is the normal Horacy Andy trip hop with rapping . & quot ; Three & quot ; is rather odd , decent song sang by Nicolette but could have been better . & quot ; Weather Storm & quot ; is a song to remember since it 's slow jazz , completely diffrent from the rest of the songs here , it really showed the many influents Massive got . & quot ; Spying Glass & quot ; is reggae . & quot ; Better Things & quot ; is another Tracy Thorn song , it sound like a train , it has good beats and beautiful sound . Defenitely one of the highlight to not miss out . & quot ; Eurochild & quot ; is yet another rap song . & quot ; Sly & quot ; is with Nicolette , beautiful sound . & quot ; Heat Miser & quot ; is another highlight , it starts with fast piano playing and the sound of someone breathing deep . It got this mysterious feeling , great for a horror movie . Those kind of song is partly what makes Massive so pleasant . The album closes with a live remake of the Doors & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; quite allright actually . Overall this is a very good album , forgotten by many but it has many highlight 's worth taking a look at . A very good variety of sound and genre 's and many songs with the great mysterious Massive sound . Recommended for anyone that likes something diffrent .	1
To say that `` Protection '' was Massive Attack 's worst album is being incoherently unfair , it is equally good as their previous and subsequent work.I like `` Mezzanine '' , `` Blue Lines '' and `` 100th Window '' but `` Protection '' is one of my ultimate favores ... most likely because Tracy Thorn teamed up with them on two of the cuts ( which were both releases ) . The title track `` Protection '' is definitely Massive Attack 's best cut ever ( vocally ) ... .It 's a pity that Tracy Thorn was only a guest vocalist then , its a real shame that she has n't teamed up with them again.Massive Attack would do much better if they 'd invite in- much more talented vocalists . For example ; Tracy Thorn , Nicollette , Madonna and Bjork are arguably the best vocalists Massive Attack has ever teamed up with , of course in Madonna 's case , they only teamed up with her once in 1996 in for the restructure of `` I Want You '' which was commercially released on the `` Something To Remember '' album and peaked a healthy 14 # In the top 40 Charts.In tracks like `` Sly '' you have the smoky and pining vocals of Nicollette which are just as captivating as Tracy Thorn 's and Tricky 's vocals . ''Weather Storms '' carries out possibly the best musical tune throughout this label , `` Spying Glass '' features rare fragments of Horace Andy . ''Better Things '' which carries out thin sharp and glass-breaking sound effects with a very much light beat , to me this track is the most accessible cut from this album with lyrics like `` Do n't Drag me down , Just Because you 're down '' , in addition to that you have Tracy Thorn 's voice which reaches its highest peak ... definitely able to send chills down your spine and keep your finger at the repeat button ... The only disappointment is that the track is short.The other tracks are ok , I did n't like the live version of `` Light My Fire '' . This LP may be the most unusual album of Massive Attack ... ... but that does n't make it a bad album ... on the contrary its one of their best , seeing its more humane and less involved than `` Mezzanine '' was ... In `` Mezzanine '' there was too much of everything , and too much can always end up insolvent .	1
Few weeks ago I bought this disk , after buying Mezz , Blue Lines and 100th Window a long time ago . Why did n't I buy it sooner , you ask ? For starters , I always wanted another CD first in stead of this one , I always moved it . And also because pretty much all the critici gave this album a bad review , saying the only worthly songs on it are 'Protection ' and 'Karmacoma ' . So with low expectations I bought this and putted in the disk-player . First there were 'Protection ' and 'Karmacoma ' wich I already knew they were great , so no surprises yet . So when 'Karmacoma ' ended I was preparing myself hearing really crappy and lame music . But it was n't ... to be honoust it was really good , extraordinary . Near the end I knew it for sure : Protection is better than Blue Lines . Blue Lines was revolutionary and very good , but it sounds so dated and Protection is more exciting with its fascinating and sometimes even strange sound . 'Protection ' and 'Karmacoma ' are the best tracks on the album and 2 of MA 's toppers , while 'Protection ' has very soft , fragile vocals and smooth instruments , 'Karmacoma ' sounds very Jamacian with its rap vocals ( Normally I do n't like rap but it seems to work very well on Massive Attack-tracks ) , I can hardly choose wich one is the best between those 2 songs . 'Three ' has a really fascinating intro , and a male voice who is always repeating the same line , and beautiful female vocals , that all together makes this another stand out . 'Weather Storm ' is a very nice jazzy instrumential with a playful piano and decent beats . 'Spying Glass ' is by far the weirdest track on this album . A strange combination between jazzy instruments and chilling vocals makes this track very special , but not all listeners might like it . 'Better Things ' has some nice jazzy bass-lines and a quit beautiful melody . Vocals are not less then amazing again . 'Euro Child ' is the darkest song on here , but it does n't lose the jazzy feel on this disk . Dark rap-vocals , with creepy jazz-sounds mixed with quit weird instruments makes this another stand out , my third favourite..Yet another fascinating track , and a single , is 'Sly ' . Again an outstanding combination between instrumentents . Vocals are mysterious and the Digiridu 's add that little extra a song needs to be good . The strikers give a more classical feel to it.Then we have another instrumential , but this one is more complex and less jazzy than 'Weather Storm ' . Synths were used instead of a piano . Good , but I must say , I like 'Weather Storm ' better.After 'Heat Miser ' I usually start over the album , because the next song is n't really good , it 's in my opinion the only disappointement on this disk . Maybe because 'Light My Fire ' is just ... well ... so non-Massive Attack . It has not instruments enough to be a worthy MA-track , it sounds so empty . And live-songs on an album usually do n't sound very good anyway.Nevertheless this is an incredible album , better then Blue Lines . Mezzanine is still my favourite , about half an inch ahead of Protection . I might say , Protection makes Mezzanine sound less impressive..	1
Many music fans believe Massive Attack 's & quot ; Protection & quot ; has 'the curse of the second album by a trend-setting band & quot ; . There 's no question Massive Attack had changed music with their debut & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; , we observe it even nowadays though most people are , unfortunately , not aware of it . In contrast to that , & quot ; Protection & quot ; is considered the least influential Massive Attack album and hereby is kind of a black sheep in the band 's discography . When people talk about Massive Attack , they usually mention & quot ; Blue Lines & quot ; and & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; . Let 's look at each song on the album in particular and see if there 's some reason behind the grave underestimation of & quot ; Protection & quot ; .Protection : here 's where the trouble begins . Well sung by Tracy Thorn , interesting lyrics , nice chillout music . However , the song completely fails its job as the opener- no proper intro into the album 's world , no invitation at all . You do n't get hooked even if you try to . Not a good sign when the opener is the first track to be skipped . 3/5Karmacoma : Let the show begin ! Tricky 's & quot ; laidback tension & quot ; contrasts 3D 's melancholy and they flow into a beautiful chorus . & quot ; Karmacoma- jamaican aroma & quot ; spoken over a tune likely to become your favorite . One of the best songs Massive Attack ever released . 5/5Three : Nicolette is a seagull cheerfully floating the blue sky to the melody of gentle waves : That 's the image you get when you hear this song . 5/5Weather Storm : To me this track is meant to be a pause between the first and second part of the album . A piano aimlessly wandering over a repeating bassline . They could have done much more with it . 3/5Spying Glass : Horace Andy 's first appearance on the album . He does a vocal job impressive as ever , displaying rasta wisdom . However , the outro is way too long and takes the focus away . 3,5/5Better Things : Excellent lyrics , touching vocals by Tracy Thorn.Groovy and effective : should have been the opener . 4,5/5Eurochild : Tricky and 3D take over again.The song wins in intrigue what it loses in grandeur to & quot ; Karmacoma & quot ; . The end of the Tricky era and hereby the last real rapsong on a Massive Attack album . 4,5/5Sly : Nicolette 's tropic warm voice blended with dramatic strings and lazy drums : an outstanding mixture ! 5/5Heat Miser : The best instrumental by Massive Attack.Irresistibly moving . 4,5/5Light My Fire : Good live cover of The Doors ' classic . Intended to be a hot goodbye kiss . 3,5/5In my point of view , & quot ; Protection & quot ; is exactly the opposite of the band 's latest work & quot ; 100th Window & quot ; . It 's nowhere as homogenous as the new album or even & quot ; Mezzanine & quot ; but it has a bunch of standout tracks like & quot ; Karmacoma & quot ; , & quot ; Sly & quot ; and & quot ; Eurochild & quot ; that make & quot ; Protection & quot ; a Massive Attack essential .	1
Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists . They masterfully out-do themselves on every album ( with their best album therefore being Mezzanine ) and with slow songs , gradual climaxes , and heavy beats , its irresistable to an electronica fan . There is no question that the best song on the album they put first , the title track , Protection . Its a sweet song , with tracey thorn 's smooth vocals ( I cant change the way you feel , but i can put my arms around you ) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats , at more than 6 minutes long . No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song .	1
MASSIVE ATTACK is one of the coolest fusions of reggae , hip hop , eletronic and jazz of all time ... this one , PROTECTION is another WONDERFUL MUSIC TRIP ! ! ! ! All the songs are amazing ! ! ! ! I do n't know which one is better ... this one or BLUE LINES ... PROTECTION is a modern MASTERPIECE ! ! ! ! If you like reggae , hip hop or jazz you got ta listen to this music pearl from MASSIVE ATTACK ! ! ! !	1
It 's Scarface , what else can I say . If you have n't heard this album before then you are not a real hip-hop fan .	1
The king of the south with no doubt brings some more heat for his 2nd solo project . Filled with some hardcore gangsta songs and some of the deepest songs ever but to a beat in rap , Face does what his fans have loved him for since he broke into the game in the mid to late 80 's . Not his best album to date , but like all his albums it 's worthy of at least 4 stars and better than most of the rap put out now-a-days . Only one song has a guest on it ( the pre-teen 2Low ) . Like with all his albums , not many songs ; only has 12 of them , 2 are classics , 2 are ok , the other 8 are good . Production is mostly done by N.O . Joe ( 8 songs ) , Face does 2 himself , and James Smith & John Bido collaborate for 2 as well . It definitely has that down south feel to it and a must have for fans of real gangsta hip-hop and real southern rap before all this gold tooth crunk $ h ! + that fills the radio waves now. # 2 - 8 # 3 - 9.5 ( upbeat gangsta song ) # 4 -8 # 5 - 8 # 6 - 8.5 # 8 - 8 ( about the worst people in society -- snitches ) # 10 - 8.5 # 12 - 10 ( CLASSIC very deep song ) # 13 - 7 ( f/ 2 Low ( 1 vesre from Scarface ) # 14 - 10 ( CLASSIC gangsta song -- part 3 of Mr. Scarface ) # 15 - 8 # 16 - 7.5Brad Jordan -- b . 11/9/70 -- b.

Scarface is a true emcee from the old school that can rap about any subject given to him . This ablum is dope from front ot back . It is the type of alum that you put in and just let it play without skipping not a single track . The lyrics and beats are sick . This is definitely a album for your collection .	1
I have always been a fan of Scarface since his first album . His aggressive stlye of rapping plus the social commentary puts him above the average rapper from the south . This second album has a lot of gems in it which are COMIN AGG , THE WALL , LETTIN EM KNOW , LET ME ROLL , YOU DONT HEAR ME DOE , DYING WITH YOUR BOOTS ON , NOW IF FEEL YA ( deep old school classic ) , MR SCARFACE PART 3 FINAL CHAPTHER , HE 'S DEAD and IM BLACK ( deep record about police brutality ) . Filler : Still that n***a , Strictly For The Funk Lovers ( stupid filler wher they pretty much say doodoochaser all over the record ) and Funky Lil N***a ( the little boy so wack its sidesplitting hilarious . Bottom Line : The World Is Yours is a classic that is that any Scarface fan will enjoy . Scarface 's raps are still on point , the production was solid and he gave you a little insight on certain tracks . A definite must-have !	1
`` The World is Yours '' is Scarface 's sophmore album and it is another timeless classic for Brad Jordan and Rap-A-Lot . In some ways , it 's even better than his debut `` Mr. Scarface is Back '' , especially in terms of production . The beats appear to be better than the first one , more polished - you may say clearer , more musical ... Producers include Bido , James Smith ( aka Prince J ) , NO Joe , Mike Dean and Scarface himself , and they all do a great job behind the boards . Scarface is young , hungry , agressive , hardcore . His deep voice with the Southern drawl hits you hard in the chest , yet there are a few laid-back songs , where Face 's style calms down and fits the calm beats perfectly . Face is more than just a gangsta rapper , with street credibility , his lyrics are smart , intelligent , and he menages to sound mature even over the most violent songs . Scarface talks the gangsta talk , and his lyrics are full of the gangsta talk ( yet on the highest level possible ) , but he 's not afraid to adress some social issues ( such as crooked cops , sniches , racism ) and personal issues as well ( on the all-time classic song `` You Do n't Hear Me Doe '' ) . I think the only song that you 'll skip is `` Funky Lil ' Ni*** '' - you get Rap A Lot 's kid rapper 2 Low ( maybe it was Prince J 's attempt to follow Kriss Kross ' success ) , and no Scarface on it . Stupid and filler stuff . But it does n't take a thing from this album . I mean , I listen to `` The World is Yours '' these days , more than a decade after it was released and it 's still rellevant , it does not sound out of date . Is there a doubt Scarface is the King of the South ? How could those other new clowns claim the title Scarface owns ever since the early 90 's ? ... Anyone who can appreciate talent and quality should love the album , and not only Dirty South rap fans . Scarface is a legend , and his early work is something you should n't miss . Who knows , these albums may become out of print and then you 'll be left without hearing some true greatness , one of the true pioneers of Gangsta Rap .	1
This was the third time I 've bought this CD cuz I 've scratched the cover off the previous two . If anybody wants legit Scarface music , this album is definitely the one . Not a single weak song on this CD at all . Still sounds good even in 2005 . You 'll bustas can keep G-Unit and Roca-Fella , give me this real gansta sh @ # $ $ t .	1
ANOTHER 5 MIC CLASSIC FROM ONE OF TOP 5 ARTISTS OF ALL TIME ... .GET THIS ALBUM IMMEDIATELY IF YOU DONT HAVE IT..EVERY SONG TO ME IS STRONG..	1
Scarface is one of those rappers that helped define an era of gangsta rap . He is a huge part of the Rap-A-Lot legacy . The World Is Yours from 1993 , is one of the hardest albums from this legendary label . The beats slap with that southern hard core melodic early 90 's G-Funk inspired horrorcore from the likes of N.O . Joe , James Smith , John Bido , and Scarface himself , with Mike Dean adding some additional mixing . Scarface 's raps are laced with relentless mainy flows showing that the 5th Ward ai n't nathan to mess wit . `` Lettin ' Em Know , '' `` Comin ' Agg , '' `` Dying With Your Boots On , '' `` He 's Dead '' among many others need no description , for the title tells all , simply put , angry gangbangin ' over bass heavy slap . `` Now I Feel Ya '' is different though , a nice laidback softer G-Funk beat giving homage to those who helped him come up in life and who gave him game to realize where he was heading in life and to change it for the better . `` Funky Lil Aggin '' is o.k . ; it showcases a youngster named 2 Low who would release his only solo joint Funky Lil Brotha later that year ( 1993 ) ; the beat is funky and twangy , and 2 Low 's flow is good and hardcore . One of my favorites is `` You Do n't Hear Me Doe . '' The beat is melodic in the vein of early Compton 's Most Wanted , but of course with a tangy southern lowrider G-Funk style beat . The beat is awesome , and Face spits fire like a tech , makin it known he ai n't playin . ' Overall , a bangin ' classic that took Scarface and Rap-A-Lot to a whole nother level . Houston is home to Face , and many of my favorite rappers of all time ; albums like this cement such sentiments !	1
Face top 5 rappers dead or alive and this album proves that ... Also check out The Diary , The Fix & Mr Scarface is Back	1
No other words could actually describe this C.D . absolutely great.This was when rap was real hardcore , not like ... these days.Rap has taken a turn for the worse , everyone wants to make music even if they do n't sell one damn copy.They need to take a listen to this album again and re-think their options.This is a classic , no doubt the greatest album ever made.Scarface himself could not duplicate his work on this album to this date ... he still is great though .	1
Yes it is very true that Scarface is very OVER-RATED but he still is a great MC.And all of his Rhymes on here are very hardcore somewhat Chuck D sounding.If your a fan of Scarface you will love this because the lyrics on this CD are dopeLyrics 10/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 8/10 Classic 9/10 Me 8/10Overall=42/50 This album will pick up 4 Mics are 8 Fingers	1
This is the album that helped him become the King of the South , a title the man still easily has . Short as with all his albums , 43 minutes and 12 songs : 1 is a classic , 1 I skip , and 1 is ok , the other 9 are good or great songs . Production is great for a 1991 release . Guests are on no songs so it 's all Face ! Lyrics are great as usual . He has some gangsta tales , some about the cocaine , and some of the deeper lyrics you 'll hear from a rapper . A must have album. # 1 - 10 ( upbeat CLASSIC ) # 2 - 6 ( dirty slower song ) # 3 - 8.5 # 4 - 8.5 # 5 - 8.5 # 6 - 9 # 7 - 9 ( good beat ) # 8 - 7 # 9 - 9 # 10 - 9 ( about gettin ' taken off for some cocaine -- hence his name ) # 11 - 9 # 12 - 9 ( very deep and good lyrics on this one ) Brad Jordan -- - b . 11/9/70 -- b.

This is one of my favorite albums of all time ! ! Scarface first solo album with no guest appearances ( how many mc 's can say that ? ? ) . If you think you know hardcore hip-hop and u do n't own this album ... ..WHERE HAVE U BEEN ! ! ! The beats are so dark and hard that it would bury the average `` gangsta rapper '' trying to flow over them . But put that boy Brad ( Scarface ) up to the task and he tames them . Every song ( yes i mean every ) is a must listen . There are no interludes or shout out trks on here to be found . This is not just mindless `` gangsta rap '' this is Harcore Hip-hop at its finest..Hotep ! !	1
Scarface has done a lot for the southside just as much as 2Pac has done with the west coast and rap music itself . I have as much respect for Scarface as much as I have for 2Pac because he puts it down for the southside always and his rhymes are incredible . Its like he 's killing us softly with his slow death process , his lyrics . He 's a murderer in music but does it so quietly and calm . His journey , which started from the Geto Boys , has ended up to where he is at now , President of Def Jam South and still one of the ruthless rappers to ever come out . Check this album out , you 'll see what I 'm talking about . His incredible killer Born Killer was an instant classic . Who else do you know who can make dope rhymes like this- `` See it ai n't no sweat to me/Coz in the fore place you 've f*cked up the minute that you STEP to me ! '' . I fell in love with this classic as soon as I heard his killa rhymes . Another moment I enjoyed was A Minute to Pray and a Second to Die . A tale about the streets , it has an eerie production involving Marvin Gaye 's Inner City Blues , which is a brilliant track . Money and the Power and Mr. Scarface is Back are two other nice touches that should be looked at.I do n't know about the rest of the world but I love the production , I guess it 's because I 'm more into old school hip-hop rather than the crap put out today . It has a real southside feel to it , which is another thing I like . But you should really look out for the lyrics here , this album is very underrated and I do n't understand why . He lived the tales he tells us to pass on to the next generation so he knows what he 's talking about . And this is n't strictly for the southside , like Scarface said- `` Even though I came from Houston , my music is for everyone from every side . '' 'Nuff sed .	1
Even in 1991 , one year before Dr. Dre released & quot ; The Chronic & quot ; , gansta rap was already a prominent force . Scarface 's debut proves that back then even the most played-out ideas had a better production value than today 's artists . & quot ; Mr. Scarface Is Back & quot ; tackles the usual topics of gangsta life ; dope fiends , drugs , guns , greedy rivals and vengeful women . However , Scarface 's attention to lyrics gives his storytelling a detail only Ice Cube 's early work could rival . The opening track is by far the album 's standout , in which Scarface tells of another day on the street corner , peddling coke , when things go wrong . Scarface also shares his apparent fear of insanity , while secretly seeming to embrace it while it serves as a tool for him to live his dangerous lifestyle.The music on this album is nowadays of a truly rare nature . No synthesizers or drum machines present , most of his back-up consists of organs , guitars , and heavy cymbals ( check out the drums on & quot ; Born Killer & quot ; ) . Unsurprisingly , there are many dialogue samples from the film & quot ; Scarface & quot ; , but they are used with such ingenuity you do n't seem to get sick of Al Pacino 's constant cameo appearances throughout the album . This is a rare , confident , aggressive and overlooked piece of gangsta rap history ( and far more sophisticated than the album cover suggests ) .	1
This is Scarface 's first solo album and he proved the world he could do it also by himself , and without his group The Geto Boys . As a result we get an awesome album . This is real hardcore , straight gangsta rap , from the streets and for people who are n't shocked easily . The lyrics are the rawest they can get . All over the album you get to hear stories about killing , jacking , selling drugs . etc . I think Scarface ( together with the Geto Boys ) should be mentioned as one of the pioneers of gangsta rap , together with N.W.A . This album is from 1991 and it 's way ahead of it 's time . At that period of time you did n't have a lot of rap albums dealing with murdering and dope-dealing . And this one does - Scarface just shines all over this album : his voice is so unique , and his flows and lyrics are some of the hardest you 've ever heard ! This is a VERY non-comercial album - you wo n't hear songs on it with Scarface bragging about his money , cars and Rolexes or chasing a girl or whatever all those sellout wanna-bees rap about these days . It 's that old gangsta s**t. It 's a classic and true gangsta rap fans will LOVE it ! !	1
MR. SCARFACE is BACK is the REAL DEAL..THE GOODS..This is Scarface athis greatest..Not many albums ever made have been this hard and this good..This is the real SCARFACE..The one we all know and love..Every track to me is banging..Buy a couple of these and pass it down to your kids..He 's much better without Bushwick and Willie D..LONG LIVE MR SCARFACE IS BACK ... TOP 5 Rap Album of All Time ... Easy	1
scarface on his first solo effort , and it was tight , this whole cd brad raps about-sex , drugs , and violence predating 2pac , and eminem , love good girl gone bad , that was o.g. , so was diary of a madman-where face talks baserk , love this whole cd rap a lot been in the game for years without being recognized .	1
This album is real tight.I decided to buy this album because I heard the Luniz on my homie Dru Downs album explict game , back in 94'.I liked they rap so I got this joint , and I was n't disappointed either.I mean the Luniz ai n't as good as Dru Down but they good enough to listen to.This album features Dru Down , Richie Rich , Shock G and others.The Beats on this joint is real tight nice and smooth grooves to ride to.The lyrics is what separates the Luniz from anybody else in the rap game thoy.Them fools be saying the funniest stuff you can think of and they just make it sound real tight in they street based raps.So if you like WestCoast music like me you 'll like this and if you wan na get a good laugh this the one for you too no doubt .	1
I 'll be honest with you , I only really bought this album for & quot ; I Got 5 On It & quot ; . The first time I heard it that was pretty much the only track I liked , there were some tracks ( especially & quot ; 5150 & quot ; and the one with Shock G ) where I did re-start the track but I did n't think too highly of the album.Listening to it later , I found that some of the lyrics were a lot funnier than I 'd given them credit for being - & quot ; Icecream Man & quot ; is a good example of this . Another thing which I did n't notice the first time round was the unorthodox style of rapping that Yukmouth and Knumskull bring to bear.One of the funnier tracks is the reprise of & quot ; I Got 5 On It & quot ; ( maybe not on this album , it was on the version I got over here in Australia ) without Michael Marshall 's vocals on the chorus . While most rappers would be happy to rap their respective lyrics over again and possibly forgo the chorus , the Luniz think otherwise . They begin by having a very funny conversation in a vaguely rap manner about not having enough money to buy a bag of dope and then re-do the verses of & quot ; I Got 5 On It & quot ; in the reverse order to the order they appear in the first version . If you think that 's enough , they then proceed to pretend to sing the chorus themselves - let 's just say that as singers they prove why they shouldn't.It 's certainly not an album for everyone , lots of listeners would be turned off by the passages of almost incoherence and the abrasive style of many of the MCs featured but those who are n't will find themselves a marvellous little gem .	1
funny , raw , powerful stuff ... i got 5 on it is still bumpin on every radio station ... i love this album ... has a lot of really good tracks on it ... open yer mind 2 this and buy it	1
The best Luniz Album . With I Got 5 on it-Both Versions , Sadly missing the remix featuring E-40 , Dru Down , spice 1 which later came out . Funny , Good Beats and rhymes . Luniz-Yuk and Num at it 's best . Good Cd .	1
I got 5 on it . Every one knows that songs . I got this when I was heavey on the bay sound in 95 . This album is the bomb and its kind of funny to , because of the slangs words they use and their clever wordplay . Just listen to song 13 where they use the barney songs chourus lyrics . THey have pimp songs , dance songs , smoke songs . I like song 6 the best , its smooth . This is the begging of yukmouths career he went solo after the luniz broke up and he hot . He isnt a to comical now though he is more gangsata now . Check him out also . Get the luniz too .	1
The Luniz debut album is a classic gangsta-rap album at gangsta-rap prime times . It 's 2001 and I still like listening to it . So ... I think it 's off the hook ! Maybe this ai n't a well-planned album but that ai n't a point of gangsta-rap . It 's about repping the OAK on their G-level . Some people may know them from 'I got 5 on it ' but there 's much way better tracks on the album . I do n't wan na dis ' 'I got 5 on it ' cuz that rtack a WestCoast classic but there 's songs with better lyrics . But I can admit that I really nod my head on `` I got 5 on it ( + the Reprise ) '' and `` 5150 '' , too . In addition , I ca n't dis ' the Luniz 1st album in no way ! That 's a classic and everybody should'a admit it ! Told : 5-stars !	1
the reprise of i got 5 on it is NOT the remix with spice 1 , e-40 , Richie Rich , Dru Down and Shock G. this album is a klassic bay area cd . i just got it , and i phuckkin luv it . the whole cd is good . i recommend u buy it if u dont have it awready	1
`` Operation Stackola '' , the debut album from the Luniz is one of the hardest rap albums I own . At first , I bought the album for the song `` I Got 5 On It '' ( which went all the way to # 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995 . ) Then I went further into the album . My three favorites are : `` Broke H* 's '' , `` Playa Hata '' , and `` 900 Blame a N***a '' . If you want to buy a tight rap album , and be slightly nostalgic at the same time , buy `` Operation Stackola '' !	1
Big Ups to Lil Flip for showing respect to the people who came before him and knowing who should be Kings of The South . if they cant be Kings , They 're Gods .	1
i love this cd ... all 3 of em can rhyme pretty well and tell a good story . u best be gettin this album if u can ... itz mad good ... only a couple songs 2 skip ... buy it !	1
The Geto Boys ' 1996 album `` The Resurrection '' is an enticing listen for many reasons . This is the album that reunited the legendary trio of Scarface , Bushwick Bill , and Willie D , arguably the greatest trio in hip hop , for the first time since 1991'sWe Ca n't Be Stopped . During the two years that preceded this album , each member had released the finest solo albums of their respective careers ( Face'sThe Diary , Bushwick'sPhantom of the Rapra , and Willie'sPlay Witcha Mama ) , and it was clear that the rappers had entered the primes of their careers . Rap-A-Lot Records was also at its pinnacle , and `` The Resurrection '' showcases the quintissentially Houston sound that would define the label . This showcases the deep , steady funk that was pioneered by the label 's in-house producers such as N.O . Joe and Mike Dean , and the music is great throughout . But this album stands out from the rest because of the performances from Geto Boys . More so than on any of their other group efforts , each song seems to have a predetermined purpose . Their lyrics are more socially relevant and conscious than ever before . The world they speak of in their verses is a dark and unjust urban world , where the black community is plagued by poverty , unrest , division , and disunity . They rap with a conviction that is very effective , showing why they really are one of the south 's greatest groups . Willie D in particular stands out to me on this album . He raps with a justified rage that sticks , rather than just his inherent craziness you might be used to.My only complaints are that , with such a long tracklist , a few songs are a bit forgettable . Also , the focus lacks a little when there are songs that focus more on other groups ( Facemob , Menace Clan ) than Geto Boys , although these songs are really good too . The album features a few interludes with interviews with Chicago figure and gang leader Larry Hoover , who would soon be incarcerated . His words complement the socially relevant lyrics in many cases.After a great intro , the album begins with the classic `` Still . '' This song is so great because it is effective on so many levels . With a hardcore , threatening hook and theme and a beat befitting of horrorcore , the Boys lace raps thick with fury , injustice , and purpose , announcing their comeback with a bang . The excellent `` The World Is a Ghetto '' follows , where they rap about the widespread poverty that persists through each city , and the problems which accompany it . A soulful chorus and twangy , funky production make this one a winner . `` Open Minded '' is rough and hard gangsta rap , followed by a very brief interlude . `` Hold It Down '' is a song by Facemob , the group of DMG , Devin the Dude , Chi-Ray , 350 , and Smit-D that Scarface mentored as his proteges . This song is a solid cut that sounds very similar to the music found on the group 's concurrent debutThe Other Side of the Law , the production and style sounds exactly the same . The Menace Clan aids Willie D on the deep `` Blind Leading the Blind , '' a powerful song that addresses problems with leadership and a way of life over a nice beat . `` First Light of the Day '' is a steady track , and Willie D anchors it with an energetic final verse . `` Time Taker '' boasts some creative production , and lyrically it 's pretty powerful too . `` Geto Boys and Girls '' does n't stand out , but is a great example of the slow , funky music and strong lyricism that this album delivers . I like when Willie D talks about his leaving and rejoining the group in his verse . On the nice `` Geto Fantasy , '' they humorously rap about their ironically lavish lifestyle over one of the album 's best beats . It would n't be a Geto Boys album without a Bushwick Bill solo track , and on `` I Just Wan na Die , '' he uses a horrorcore approach to rap disturbingly about life from the point of view of a suicidal person . The upbeat `` N ... s and Flies '' is lyrically enticing , where Scarface and Willie challenge such aspects of society as the NAACP . Following a final Larry Hoover interlude , the album closes with `` Point of No Return , '' a nice closer . `` The Resurrection '' is a very impressive piece of hip hop that showcases three of the south 's best rappers in their primes , rapping with great subject matter over excellent production . This is straightforward gangsta rap , and rarely has it ever been as effective . It blows my mind that this album could be out of print today , but for fans of Rap-A-Lot and Geto Boys , consider this one to add to the collection . I highly recommend `` The Resurrection . ''	1
Its the reunion of Scarface , Big Mike , Willie D , Ganxsta Nip , DJ Ready Red & Bushwick Bill back in 199Six , i do n't know that much about the geto boys but i do know they have some hard ass beats . my 2 fav . songs are still , and niggas and flys those songs have really hard beats like g-funk/horror core.geto boys are awsome man	1
G.B . Willie D , Bushwick Bill , Scarface , the boyz from Houston/5thward . heavy hitters . Willie D laying gritty and hillarious rhymes . Scarface , and Bushwick bill with some Deathloving stuff . The last song , is a bit offensive to me with the flag burning part on Willie D 's part . but it 's Geto Boys for the 199-. and this album is better than Da Good Da Bad Da ugly . Good C.D .	1
The resurrection of the original members ... Scarface , Bushwick Bill , and Willie D. If u are going to make a comeback this is how u do it . this album has some real strong subject matters.It deals with racism , mental illness , oppression , hood politics , and great story telling . The beats are so tight and co sign 's all the lyrics almost perfectly.But i must stress the lyrics ... this has to be the most lyrical the geto boys have ever been together . u can feel the words to the bone and without question about what they mean . Key songs are : POINT OF NO RETURN , WORLD IS A GHETTO , LIGHT OF THE DAY , GHETTO BOYS AND GIRLS , AND GETO FANASTY . just hearing those songs will make u buy the album and wait until u hear the rest.Plus they got Larry Hoover on it speaking from prison ... now how gangsta is that . How many of these so called rap gangstas can get Hoover to speak on their album ? ? ? ? None ... REAL RECOGNIZE REAL ( and you are looking familair ) ! ! ! Hotep ... .	1

Its the reunion of Scarface , Big Mike , Willie D , Ganxsta Nip , DJ Ready Red & Bushwick Bill back in 199Six , better & harder beats than their previous N.W.A . era kicks , the Kings of Houston , TX are back commin ' str8 outta 5th Ward ! A tight Horrorcore song on this track is I Just Wan na Die by that psycho Bushwick Bill , and the Hard-Thuggish Ruggish hit Niggas And Flies done by Willie D & Scarface !

The Geto Boys ' status was legendary even after a couple of albums ( `` Geto Boys '' and `` We Ca n't Be Stopped '' ) . But arround 92 Willie D left the group , and J Prince replaced him with Big Mike . The new formed crew released `` Till Death Do Us Part '' in 1993 , and it was a GREAT album ( and a classic ) , but it still was n't the same ! Big Mike is a top notch rapper , both lyrically and with his flows , but it seemed to me , that he just does n't fit the group . Geto Boys were all about being extremely hardcore , provocative and loud . While Big Mike was defintetly hardcore , his delivery was a bit more laid back and cool , and so much different that Willie D 's agressive screaming ... Anyway , in 1996 Willie D was back , and the Geto Boys released a new album . In many ways this album was different that the previous albums . Musically , the sound is crystal clear , with an obvious West Coast influence ( actully it sound different that other Rap A Lot albums musically , I think they were experimenting on this one and after that album , the label went back to their dirty south style ) . There was a change in the group 's approach as well . While the album has it 's few hardcore and violent songs , it 's much more laid back that the other ones . The group deals with a lot of social issues , all over the album , while it remains gangsta and gutter . Scarface has always been a legend and on this album it 's no diffrerent . Bushwick Bill is still his own crazy-ass self , and his social consciousness is high . And Willie D came back better than ever - he still remained raw and loud , but I think he 's improved in many ways . Geto Boys , unlike most gangsta groups , are very inteligent , and they have no problem talking about what 's going on in the streets ( and the world as well ) while still holding to their guns and blasting anyone who tries to f # $ % with them . This album is an all time classic , and a must-have to any rap fan .	1
Willie D rejoins the group after a few years hiatus , and is back with fervor ! Willie D , Face , and Bushwick Bill once again have that passionate chemistry and deliver a hard faced album with stone cold rhymes and great beats . As for the production , you get Mike Dean ( who does the majority ) , N.O . Joe , Scarface , Derek Edwards , all great beatsmiths . Stylistically , the album is Southern style G-Funk , like many Houston albums are , but the beats range from a few laidback cuts to some blood curdling horror beats that stomp and shake the ground . The horror joints are the awesome `` Still '' and `` Open Minded '' ( f/ DMG ) . The beats are really hard and loud , and the rhymes are lyrical terrorism . `` Geto Fantasy '' is gumbo style with lyrics about dreams about making it out the hood . `` Time Taker '' is real chill . The beats is laidback and phat , and the trio deliver some deep knowledge about the meaning of life , how time can just flow away , and judgment day , and making the most of time on earth . Bushwick Bill gets really personal and heart drenching on his solo `` I Just Wan na Die . '' The beat is crazy , gothic , and stomach churning as are Bill 's suicidal lyrics . I love the beat on `` N -- -as And Flies '' with Derek Edwards delivering the funk . I love the whiny synth in the hook and Willie drops some street and social knowledge . Facemob drops in with GB in `` Hold It Down '' for a nice mobb joint with an airy but simple beat . All in all , this album is a great reunion of the Houston legends , and the nice beats and crazy spits make this an easy mid 90 's classic .	1
In the era of trip hop , many of us ( Americans that is ) seemed to miss the influence this style had upon music . However , I got a taste of this band when I saw the trailer for the movie Cruel Intentions back in 1998 but I never really knew who sang the song until 2001 when I picked up a friend 's mixed CD . I immediately fell in love with `` 6 Underground '' ( one of my all-time favorite songs still ) and had to get the CD that housed the intoxicating hit . Becoming X still remains one of my very favorite CDs and actually introduced me to the world of trip hop . `` Low Place Like Home '' starts the CD off in an almost Garbage like sound but keeps to the trip hop genre while `` Tesko Suicide '' keeps you engrossed with Kelli 's vocals . `` Becoming X '' , `` Post-Modern Sleaze '' , `` Waterbaby '' , and `` Wasted Early Sunday Morning '' each prove to be very good tracks as well and `` How Do '' remains sort of haunting with the vocals and low tone and `` Walking Zero '' seems eery throughout , even in the lyrics . `` Spin Spin Sugar '' , a song still played in the clubs , makes you feel like you are on a sugar rush and spinning but for all the wrong reasons while `` Roll On '' becomes a come on and proposition . Finally , `` 6 Underground ( Nelle Hooper Edit ) '' still shines brightly on this album , very strong , passionate , seductive , all of it in one package . This is definately a strong CD with so much potential even years after it 's release and it 's a shame Kelli no longer sings for the Sneaker Pimps because this album truly was and is captivating to the last note .	1
love the pimps ! got this CD about two months ago , and it 's rare when a day goes by that i do n't listen to this gem of a recording . the fifth track & lt ; spin spin sugar & gt ; was worth the price of the CD alone ... .the lead singer , dayton , has a sweet , cutting voice , ( & quot ; she must be a thelma or louise & quot ; - track 6 ) and it perfectly compliments the dark , forboding trip-lounge/ hop music . get this album if you dig portishead , massive attack , tricky even just a smidge ... this CD is very intoxicating and you will soon find yourself addicted to the sounds of Becoming X. grab this Sneaker Pimps debut ... you will not be sorry .	1
You 'll find few albums of more importance for the entry of electronic/trip hop music into the mainstream than Becoming X , but you 'll also find few albums less heralded for it . It 's no mistake that nearly ten years after its release , its biggest hit `` 6 Underground '' is still on the radio - the song 's `` I 'm open to falling from grace '' come-on truly connected in relaying the message of the genre and the age , and so the record succeeds in being a perfect , seductive 11 song recapitulation of the type of desire that ropes you in even as you know it 'll harm you . Its opening , the aptly titled `` Low Place Like Home '' is as sneering as any punk song , but with Kelli Dayton 's voice guiding it , it 's emphasis is far sexier - much more lipstick than spit . As the record proceeds , it becomes full of moments that scratch and pant their way into a devastating s/m trip - the cry of `` Spin Spin Sugar '' that segues into eroticized laughter , the ecstatic moan that climaxes the title track , the strange command to start `` breathing through your elbows '' in `` Roll On . '' As the album closes on the moving `` How Do , '' you get the sense of the techno party finally going to sleep at dawn , and in that , Becoming X remains a fitting 11 song capsule of the entire techno breakthrough - a collision of technology and sensuality that is as evocative a story of its era and its listeners as any document at the time or since .	1
Once I picked up & quot ; Becoming X & quot ; , I felt like I became one of the lucky people who knew this for more than just the great single & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; . If you liked that song , most of the others are as good . & quot ; Low Place Like Home & quot ; and & quot ; Spin Spin Sugar & quot ; I like just as much . My favorite though is & quot ; Post-Modern Sleaze & quot ; . It consists of this odd combination of acoustic guitar and trip-hop beats , but works really well . Sweet lyrics too . Then the next-to-last song & quot ; How Do & quot ; is nice and mezemorizing . Some people say this disc sounds dated , but is n't everything ? I still play it often .	1
I will not have time to categorize the Sneaker Pimps , but one thing I can tell you is that lead vocalist Kelly Dayton was a great vocalist and Splenter is a completely different CD . If you were expecting the same because you heard Splinter , you might be dissapointed . This includes Ambient , Trip-Hop , and Techno without sounding too much like Tricky . The result ? Not nearly what I expected. & quot ; Spin Spin Sugar & quot ; I thought , was a club song . But when I listened to the CD version I found out I was fooled . But & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; is still excellent with electronic guitar . I still think the title track , & quot ; Becoming X & quot ; was a lot more clubby than the rest of the album . However the sound still coporates through the album . Im too lazy to make a description so either a- just buy it and if you have to look at a review to buy it you must not be interested , or b- agree that this review is a waste of time .	1
This would probably be a desert island top five album for me . It can literaly put you in a trance . I have not heard another album like this ever . They call it `` trip-hop '' but it 's pretty much extremely well written dance-house music with a one of a kind vocalist . I fell in love with Kelli Deyton just from listening to this album one time . She has a very young and innocent sounding voice but at the same time she 's singing these brilliant , sophisticated , troubled , and hurt lyrics , It makes for a VERY sexy sound . This is one of those albums that I never get tired of no matter how many times I listen to it . Chris Corner 's song writting and Kelli Deyton 's voice truly make for a one of a kind sound . If I had to compare them to one other band I would probably say Portishead but the Sneaker pimps are much , much better !	1
..And also another essential triphop-album . The Sneaker Pimps prove they have alot of talent and , like many bands , their debut is their best album . I 'm still searching for a bad track on this , but I 'm sure I 'm not going to find one . Kelli Dayton has a bittersweet voice , and I 'm quite missing that little extra of her voice on their other releases ( not to say that 'Splinter ' and 'Bloodsport ' are bad , not at all , but it 's just not the same ) .My favourite Sneaker Pimps-track 'Low Place Like Home ' opens the record . Some catchy guitar-riffs and Kelli 's voice ( wich is not as sweet on this track ) makes this an unbelievable track . Other high-lights are '6 Underground ' ( the reason why I bought this in the first place , I 'm sure everyone already heard it at least once before ) , 'Becoming X ' , 'Post-Modern Sleaze ' , 'Waterbaby ' ( one of the more 'rock'-songs but with some great soundeffects ) and 'Walking Zero ' ( Great Asian-like intro , alot of effect and of course Kelli 's sweet voice ) . But all the other songs are n't less amazing . How many times do you find an album with not a single bad track on it ? Exactly , so go buy it..	1
This is a great album -- no doubt about it . Their music was dark and subversively sensual . In my opinion , it 's a very different & quot ; feel & quot ; than either the Cardigans or Alanis Morissette . In fact , the Editorial Review above is a bit laughable . Anyway , the Sneaker Pimps mixed alternative , experimental rock with trip hop into what I like to call trance rock . The breathtaking spatial precision of the production and engineering is evidence of Howe and Corner 's obsession with the psychoacoustics of stereo sound and room reflections . Becoming X is very unique in its atmospheres , but tends towards the subtle , minimalist side of things . Chris Corner , for instance , initially poked fun at the Nellee Hooper version of Six Underground as being too glossy and commercially oriented . Sorry Chris , but this is not & quot ; commercially oriented & quot ; music ; I 'd call Madonna and the Backstreet Boys commercial , not this . Becoming X has a great basic sound and structure to it , and I think Nellee Hooper could have been used to help produce and mix all of their future material to perfect results . If this album had been totally remixed by Mr. Hooper , it 'd be an absolute masterpiece . Having songs & quot ; kicked-in in all the right places & quot ; is what music is about , not the lack thereof . The boys of the band gradually began learning this , and their later , lushly produced remixes and b-sides show it . Kelli was also taking on more songwriting duties as well as giving more production advice . Eventually , the band developed on their own into what Nellee Hooper could have instantly brought them to . Everything seemed to be progressing gorgeously , as evidenced by the track Velvet Divorce , then ZAP ! The boys got overly paranoid about what they thought was a generic `` 2 guys & amp ; a girl '' trip hop formula , seemingly oblivious to how truly special their sound was . Chris Corner also became increasingly possessive of their new material . Sadly , Kelli and the boys parted ways . ( & quot ; And there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth. & quot ; ) Because her wonderful voice was the backbone of the old sound , the new Sneaker Pimps are essentially a whole new band . The new Pimps , led by Corner , are good too , but the old pimps were becoming a revelation .	1
`` Becoming X '' sounds like the trip-hop of a cold , advanced tech future with an approaching apocalypse . Yet , the music slightly glows with a human factor.Founded by Chris Corner ( guitar ) and Liam Howel ( synth ) , The Sneaker Pimps released this debut record back in 1996 , with amazing production from Line of Flight and Jim Abbiss . This is also the only Sneaker Pimps album where Kelli Dayton ( later known as Kelli Ali through her solo career ) lends her spunky vocals ... and it contributes greatly to the attitude of `` Becoming X '' .The album spawned two successful singles . ` 6 Underground ' is a dreamy down-tempo techno-pop song that drove the success of the album . ` Spin Spin Sugar ' is fast , chaotic , bass-driven trip-hop that could fuel fire . However , every track on this record is great. ` Becoming X ' is one of my favorite electronica/trip-hop albums . I wish The Sneaker Pimps would 've made more albums with Kelli Dayton , because magic happens ! 5 Stars !	1
I am a big fan of most all types of techno . The Sneaker Pimps are n't the exception . With a hot lead singer who can sing with a band who make sounds basically , it makes me addicted at some points . The title track , Becoming X is my personal favorite because it reminds me of something Moby would make.On the other hand , Spin Spin Sugar sounds completely different on the CD from its version on the radio . It 's much more longer and weirder . She cries at one part of the song . Then she starts laughing . 6 Underground is a perfect song which I still push repeat on . The remix ( track 12 ) was n't really needed because the only difference is adding the & quot ; What 's up witchu & quot ; part in the background .	1
Finaly a team of DJ 's and samplers who actaully know whattheir doing.Every cut on & quot ; Homework & quot ; emphasises dancibility aboveall else. & quot ; Teachers & quot ; even offers a funky shout-out to every artistknown and unknwon who influenced the two and of course & quot ; Around The World & quot ; is & quot ; Around the World & quot ; .The memorable & quot ; Fresh & quot ; and & quot ; Pheonix also stand out , even ammong a little indulgent DJturntable noodling here and there.But no matter how they do itit seems Daft Funk would be a better name because these tracksGET DOWN ! !	1
Homework is considered to be a major influence on the electronic scene in the late 90s and the 2000s , with its innovative sound that depicts the influence and cultural impact of electronic sounds presented in early metal and rock bands are been inherited by musicians to create their own style and genre of the music . It is also the signs of our advance musical technologies in the industry .	1
As a music fan and review , it is always healthy to bring yourself totally out of your element . I love rock prog blues and jazz . House is a genre I know next to nothing about.When I go to get my hair cut and stroll in to hear BOOM BOOM BOOM , I am not to crazy about the feeling . It feels to me music very young people dance , drink and have sex to . But when I heard this Daft Punk album was top of the line dance music , I got it.And like it . The beats are there , at ranges a non-dance music fan is not used to . But hearing the synthesizer flourishes and the funky hooks here absolutely make this music to me . I am awed by the little needles of sound and rhythm shifts that pulsate through Daft Punk 's music , which makes it to me an amazing musical experience.Probably this will not be a mainstay for me , but when I need a diversion , I know where to go .	1
The very first time I 've listened to this album , I thought my player got broken or the CD was scratched , but then I listened again afterwards and noticed that it was actually the real sound of Daft Punk . No strings attached.After a few more times of listening and deep-diving it , I suddenly found myself hooked to the loops and beats of what could be considered the best Daft Punk album ever . A risky project which turned into quite a good electronic/house classic , as good for workout as it is for partying.Weird samples , extreme loops , mad beats and several other bizarre sounds made this album an essential if you 're in it for electronic . `` Around the World '' is a true all-time gem , for sure.Strongly not recommended for `` Easy Listening '' or `` Adult Contemporary '' fans .	1
The cd is in perfect condition ! No marks or bends and nothing is broken in the slightest . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone !	1
The French popmeisters have done their homework , and really well too . Daft punk presents their debut album here and the music could most definitely be described as genre defining.Combining modern synthesizers with retro vibes , they have created a brand of music that has a unique French flavor . The entire disc ounds like what you might expect of a night out at a retro-funk bar lounging away with ya favorite friends.Listen for that exquisite treat - both to tha ears and tha body ... .	1
I remember first seeing the music videos for & quot ; Da Funk & quot ; and & quot ; Around the World & quot ; on MTV ( believe it or not ) several years ago and just being completely blown away by the infectious dance beats . & quot ; Around the World & quot ; in particular really grabbed me by the jugular . It is by far the catchiest dance song I have heard in the past decade , next to Kylie Minogue 's & quot ; Ca n't Get You Out of My Head & quot ; . The bass-heavy beat is incredible . Listening to & quot ; Around the World & quot ; brings back memories of me dancing ( drunkenly ) to this song in the nightclubs back in my college days . & quot ; Da Funk & quot ; was and still is equally cool in its own right . It is extremely catchy . I just love the synthesized beats . Just like & quot ; Around the World & quot ; , & quot ; Da Funk & quot ; has that incredible deep bass hook that gets you on the dancefloor . As much as I love Daft Punk 's follow up & quot ; Discovery & quot ; , & quot ; Homework & quot ; has to be my favorite of the two cds . Granted that & quot ; Homework & quot ; lacks the warmth of & quot ; Discovery & quot ; , & quot ; Homework & quot ; has a raw , live feel that its predecessor lacked . & quot ; Revolution 909 & quot ; reminds me of something I have heard during my journeys to Chicago back in the day and my friends and I would be cruising to our favorite nightclub with the radio cranked up , and this song would be on the airwaves ( more like a song with the same beat ) . I also love the shimmering techno track & quot ; Indo Silver Club & quot ; as well . Despite being seven years old , & quot ; Homework & quot ; still holds up to this very day which is not an easy task to do because trends comes and goes in dance music but & quot ; Homework & quot ; is an exception to that rule and it still sounds fresh and new to me .	1
To think that it is nearly 10 years since this was released is incredible . I remember being freaked out by the Da Funk video with the talking dog and the video for Around The World was a clever piece of videowork . But anyway , it 's incredible to think that after nearly a decade in circulation , it has aged well.Despite , the previous two that I mentioned ( which have gone on to be dancefloor classics ) , the rest of the album is just as good with particular mentions to Indo Silver Club and Alive . Alive in particular , sounds very claustrophobic . Really gets you going . Still worth it after all these years .	1
This is a fun record ... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed , but if you want a fun , funky , dance record , then this is it ... I love it personally , and it always hypes me up when I listen to it ... just listen to the wicked ... beats on Revolution 909 , the soothing waves on Fresh , the funky bass of Around the World , the discoy feel of High Fidelity ... it 's great fun , and if you like dance music , you need this in your collection ... if you like music you need it , for some variety ... it 's great fun , pick it up ...	1
Daft Punk are into something new , when this Cd was released i had never heard something like this . They simply mix diffent genres and turn it into great dance music , this Cd is almost as good as Discovery , they are quite simular too . `` Revolution 909 '' is classic house for example . `` Da Funk '' is funk indeed , with some tough beats , probably the best track on the cd together with the mega hit of 1997 `` Around the world '' which had a very good video aswell with Robots , Mummies etc . dancing on stage . The track is dance-funk with a voice constantly saying `` Around the world , around the world '' . `` Burning '' sound like a Dj is scratching on a Cd , some cool backround beats too . Some people would probably call it a pain in the [ back side ] , i would call it a new fresh sound . Rollin ' & Scrating and Rock N roll are based on the same ideas but not as good . `` Indo Silver club '' is a good dance tune with the sound of bees , yeah pretty odd but do n't be surprised this is Daft punk afterall . Phoenix is also among the better songs on this Cd , it got funky dance sound almost addictive . `` Teachers '' is an weird one , two diffrent voices talking about Dre and Snoop dogg , dunno what they got that inspiration from . `` Funk add '' is almsot identical to `` Da Funk '' i do n't get why they made 2 songs instead of just 1 . Overall it 's a very good CD , they got new ideas and new music , a few songs are n't so good and 12 songs instead of 16 would make sense . But i rate the album very good cause of the new stuff they make and the hit songs i previously mentioned .	1
I love daft punk . Its so original . It was there at the beginning . This is an excellent album . Look at how many reviews it has . This album got around and its so popular . How can you not like it . Sure it has its flaws , but what album does n't . ( If you find one that does n't please email me - crome06 @ hotmail.com ) Its such a great one to listen to no matter how old it is . If you do n't have this album there is no reason you should n't , and i do n't throw 5 stars around mildly .	1
Repetition in house music has never sounded better than in Daft Punk 's Homework . Its not repetitive for the sake of stretching out a track 's length , but rather to build anticipation for and introduce the next element of the song . When it gets going , everything compliments each other beautifully , which is saying a lot when you take into consideration that most of this music was built from the ground up on tweaked samples . Aside from Daft Punk 's best known works from this album like `` Around the World '' and `` Da Funk '' , nearly every one of the other tracks stand up well on their own . My personal favorites have to be `` Teachers '' and `` High Fidelity '' , for the brilliant use of their samples . Daft Punk has never been better than they were on this album . Initially , its relentless throbbing sound may turn some new listeners off ( do n't let the first tracks you hear by Daft Punk be `` Rollin ' & Scratchin ' '' or `` Rock n ' Roll '' ! ) , but with some repeated listens you begin to better appreciate it . Once you do , Homework nearly becomes its own genre of music . Deserves no less than 5 stars !	1
Noone could make techno-music as funky as Daft Punk . Amidst the desert of electronic junk there are some real jewels and this CD is undoubtedly on of them . Turn it on on Friday evening , turn it off on Sunday night , be happy : )	1
Dogs , Androids , Firemen , & amp ; Tomatoes . Thats what Daft stands for or so they say . This is some of the best music to listen to the waves , horizontal , vertical , sprirals , tunnels , & amp ; ripples in the music . You hear it a lot better when you are frying , ( just a tip ) . Check it out when ya fry , ( call a radiostation and ask if they will play Daft Punk 's Around The World ) . I say 100 % of this album is good . Any questions e-mail me at yuckplace @ hotmail.com .	1
Whaaa ! ! ! Yeah ! ! ! Homework is all good . Homework is mostly Techno , but even those who hate Techno will like Homework because it is catchy and revolutionary as other reviewers have already reported . Homework actually made Techno mainstream for awhile and the beats will have you up and dancing around in no time.To be honest I flung their other album Discovery out the window . I was totally disappointed that they had gone for 70s retro music instead of sticking to what they do best - catchy techno tunes that evolve the industry , however people might like that other one but I certainly did not.Homework is probably one of the all time great Techno albums if not the greatest techno album of all time . It can easily sit beside Paul Oakenfold 's Traceport as the best electronica/trance/techno/dance album out there but Oakenfold would probably be second best because he was just a DJ and these boys cooked up their own tracks.In fact Homework stands out in a world of its own . It is almost like a compilation of all the best techno tunes but is in fact all original tunes from a very original duo.This is a must for any collection . Even classical music listeners will throw this one on for the sheer originality of it all . Yes , Beethoven and Mozart would be proud !	1
Including the hit song 'Around The World ' This album came out for my graduation from Art and Design school in 1996 .	1
All hail this Paris duo .They lost their way after this but homeworkIs IZmO the best dance album ever .Underworld and Homework is all u need .	1
This CD contains two of the greatest and grooviest `` Electronic '' songs of all time ! As far as the rest of the CD . I gave this CD 4 Stars because Daft Punk brought `` Electronic '' music into people 's homes with one of these songs ! I would probably concider this `` Disco Funk '' with a twist of `` Goofy '' ! These guys just wan na have fun ! Check this out , I think everybody likes these tunes !	1
First of all , if you are new to Daft Punk , mostly because of Random Access Memories or the Tron : Legacy soundtrack and looking for more of there music ; and you are not otherwise into electronica /house/techno , this is not a good place for you to start . Your next album should probably be Discovery , as that 's the closest thing to DP 's more recent work in there back catalog . If you ca n't get into that , you 'd be advised to just stop there.This debut album is really early -- 1997 , actually -- and is hard core club music : very loopy , very repetitive and mostly made to dance to . And very electronic . That is not to say that it lacks depth , however . Active listening reveals many surprises and subtleties that make trancing out to it a great experience . So if you like good electronic music , this needs to be in your collection .	1
Forever Your Girl by Paula Abdul is the ultimate pop dance album of the '80s . Paula 's voice has never been strong but her delivery and execution of these songs is amazing . Songs like Knocked Out , Opposites Attract , The Way That You Love Me , Straight Up ! , Forever Your Girl , and Cold Hearted were all hit songs and Paula 's dance ability did n't hurt either thanks to her videos . Check this trip down memory lane cd out sometime !	1
i have no problem with this CD . good old music nice and clear everyone should have this . besides this i do not know other one 's she gots .	1
Paula Abdul 's 1988 debut FOREVER YOUR GIRL sold five million copies in a year since the album 's release . The same thing happened with Mariah Carey 's self-titled debut 2 years later , Madonna 's LIKE A VIRGIN album in 1984 and Whitney Houston 's 1985 self-titled debut . This album remained on the charts through spring 1990 . When STRAIGHT UP debuted on the radio in late 1988 , the sales of the album rapidly increased . Other hits include THE WAY THAT YOU LOVE ME , KNOCKED OUT , OPPOSITES ATTRACT , NEXT TO YOU , COLD HEARTED and the title track . Another ten-track album with seven hits that I know of is Bryan Adams ' RECKLESS album . A must for urban music fans . Also it 's ideal for nightclub play .	1
`` Forever your Girl '' is probally the greatest dance record ever.All of the cuts are fantastic.The first time I heard `` Straight Up , '' I knew this was a HIT , but when I saw the video , I was blown away.Paula Abdul had what they call IT.If I was only to have a couple records from the 80 's , this would be one of them .	1
Though Paula Abdul first gained notoriety for choreographing Janet Jackson 's CONTROL videos , her debut FOREVER YOUR GIRL managed to thrust her into the pop stratosphere , firmly taking a place right next to ... Janet Jackson . How 's that for karma ? Of course , it helped that she was fully armed with an album full of strong dance-pop tunes -- 'Straight Up ' , 'Cold Hearted ' , and you know the rest . Even the non-singles here are terrific , particularly 'State Of Attraction ' and 'I Need You ' . The only real sore point is the album 's sole ballad 'Next To You ' , which did nothing but remind us that singing was never really Abdul 's strong suit . Otherwise , this is a nice reminder of what an engaging and sincere performer Abdul was , and why current pop princesses like Britney and Christina do n't hold a candle to our Paula .	1
And the results speak for themselves ! ! With her angelically squeaky voice , bubbly personality , and take-charge attitude , this chick was a real force back in the late '80s . Along with Janet Jackson ( & quot ; JJ & quot ; as she 's known to the playas of da world ) , Paula Abdul almost singlehandedly drove the music industry forward , back in '88 . Along the way she broke new ground in her videos . Remember that cat she flirted with in the & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; video ? It inspired Roger Rabbit and Beavis and Butthead . Remember the sizzling choreography in the risque & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; video ? It inspired & quot ; Melrose Place & quot ; and ABC 's & quot ; The Bachelor. & quot ; Simply put , Abdul paved the way for future imitators like J-Lo and even Gloria Estephan . ( What in the world ever happened to her ? ? ? ? ) . What a career Abdul has had ! ! From a Laker girl to a singer to an analyst on one of TV 's biggest shows ever , Paula A is a true hero to women and men of all ages ! ! I WISH HER LUCK FROM HERE ON OUT ! ! ! ! ! MAYBE SHE AND SIMON WILL FINALLY GET TOGETHER ON IDOL 'S 3RD SEASON ! ! ! ! ! LATER , DUDES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This 1988 debut album is straight up fun as the song of the same name suggests . Released in June of 1988 , Paula Abdul 's debut album `` Forever Your Girl '' is a classic album full of fun , energetic pop dance music that is one of the best examples of the glory genre New Jack Swing that lasted from 1988 through 1992 and `` Forever Your Girl '' is one of the best examples of the genre . `` Cold Hearted '' while a lot of fun is a somewhat disturbing track with a slighly orchestral sound to it . The lyrics are a bit disturbing but also really vivid and well-written . The opening track `` The Way That You Love Me '' has some suprisingly good lyrics even if they are rather cheesy at best . `` Opposites Attract '' is all out fun and was a huge hit in early 1990 and featured an unforgettable video featuring that animated cartoon cat dancing alongside Paula in the video . The version on here though does n't have the rap section like the hit version does . The only ballad on here is `` Next Two You '' which is really a very pleasant song and really good electrical 80s sounding guitar parts and beautiful synthesizers.While some of the tracks have since started to sound a little dated , others however sometimes while sounding dated sometimes sound new and up to date once again . Those looking for something deep and emotional should just continue driving on the road past this CD but for those who just want to take off the thinking cap for a little while and have fun , you ca n't go wrong with this and her next album 1991 's `` Spellbound '' . Highly recommended !	1
From 1986 to 1991 , I listened to Top 40 radio CONSTANTLY . Paula Abdul 's Forever Your Girl was one of the first CDs I ever purchased , and , listening to this album over a decade later , I am still surprised at how good it sounds . The music is slick dance-pop , but the grooves have a little bit of a funky R & amp ; B edge to them , which gives the music extra oomph . There is even a contribution by Babyface on the excellent single & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; , and this was back in 1988 , long before Babyface was well-known in the pop community . Other standout hits from this album are & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; , & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; , & quot ; The Way That You Love Me & quot ; , and the title track . Quite a setlist of pop classics ! Paula Abdul also had a certain amount of dignity that today 's bubble gum pop queens do not . She appeared fully clothed in her videos , and her sound and style came across as cute and sexy without ever crossing the line to vulgarity . Today 's dance-pop has a tendency to bombard the listener with bombast and over-production . However , on Paula 's first album , she kept it pure , simple , and & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; ! So , if you are looking for a fun , energetic pop CD that does n't overdo anything , this album is the one ! Great for its 80s nostalgia value , too !	1
i love paula abdul 's forever your girl . my favorite songs are knocked out , it 's just the wan that you love me , forever your girl , straight up , cold hearted , and oppisittes attract.the songs are still good today , this album is worth hearing .	1
This is Paula Abdul 's debut album , and she was already on a roll ! She set the charts on fire with FOUR number ones : `` Straight Up , '' `` Opposites Attract '' ( featuring the Wild Pair '' ) , `` Cold Hearted , '' and the amazing title track ! This CD has it all : great beats , cool vocals , and a lotta rhythm ! Buy now . It 's not too late !	1
This is my favorite album because it was one of those album that had those stand out songs . I mean & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; is a song that everyone seems to know . The only song on here I do n't like is & quot ; Next To You & quot ; because it does n't fit in with the rest of the songs . Paula my advice come out with a new album ! !	1
No matter what controversy Paula Abdul tends to generate these days , there used to be a time when she was much more well-respected , and rightly so with this high-energy , hits-heavy album . `` Straight Up '' and `` Forever Your Girl '' are two songs that really say `` bring back the 80s '' . A lot of people said that she had no singing talent , and while I can agree on the fact that her whiny , nasal wail is not the most pleasant singing voice that somebody could 've been blessed with , she still knows how to sing with energy and passion .	1
There was a time when & quot ; Paula Abdul & quot ; was a cheerleader for the & quot ; L.A. Lakers & quot ; . There was also a time when she was as popular as & quot ; Madonna & quot ; and & quot ; Janet Jackson & quot ; , and that was because of & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; . The album was huge when it came out , and seemed to produce an endless supply of singles . Included is probably her biggest hit & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , plus & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; , & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; , and & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; . All the other tracks are almost as good , and a favorite of mine is & quot ; Next To You & quot ; . She does actually have a & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; out as well , and six of these songs are on that , plus & quot ; Rush Rush & quot ; , & quot ; Promise Of A New Day & quot ; , and others . It 's too bad that now she 's mostly known for judging & quot ; American Idol & quot ; . Some people will never know she used to make videos with animated cats .	1
Sure she is 1/3 of the American Idol judges but before all the ear-spilting audtions and Simon Cowell brawls , in 1988 Paula Abdul was making her mark as a bonifide dancer/singer . She started out as being a hot chorographer for the likes of Duran Duran , George Micheal and soon-to-be-rival Janet Jackson but in 1988 Paula had decided to take her career to the next level . When she released `` Forever Your Girl '' , it did n't fare well and was n't flying off shelves even with the infectious 1st single `` Knocked Out '' . It seemed like Paula 's singing career was going to be short lived , till the release of the 2nd single , `` Straight Up '' and it did go `` straight up '' the charts . A slew of hits followed ( `` The Way That You Love Me '' , `` Forever Your Girl '' , `` Cold Hearted '' , `` Opposites Attract '' ) along with the re-release of `` Knocked Out '' and it made Paula Abdul become a household name and gave her a spot at the 80 's diva table . `` Forever Your Girl '' is one of those albums that is consistant . It 's funky , fun and entergetic . This whole album continues to be full of spunk and dance craze fun . When you pop this in you will be transported into New Jack dance bliss . `` The Way That You Love Me '' starts off the set with a bang , and from the start you know that you will be singing and dancing your butt off in minutes ! With it 's driving keyboards and rocking guitars you know that this is THE 80 's ! `` Knocked Out '' follows with a sly New Jack groove and who else better than to write and produce this but the masters themselves , Babyface and L.A. Reid . They seemed fresh off of working with bad boy Bobby Brown , because this song sounds like something he could 've done . Nice percussion work and a wailing keyboard courtesy of Babyface . Now I know when `` Opposites Attract '' comes to mind everyone immeaditely thinks of the hit video where she is dancing with MC Skat Kat . The song is cute and I like the `` 2 steps forward , 2 steps back '' part . The digital effects of `` State Of Attraction '' are up next followed by the drum machine , New Jack ( there it is again ! ) sound of one of my non-hit faves `` I Need You '' . It has a nice little `` breakdown '' session with a funky , suave saxphone solo . The poetic and charming title track makes me think of the video with Paula surrounded by kids who are dancing ( I love that video ! ) . It 's a very melodic song that has a soft side admist a driving beat . What 's to say about `` Straight Up '' ? I think everybody knows this song , with it 's infectious keyboard and wailing guitar . Nice rap , Paula ! `` OH , OH , OH ! '' `` Next To You '' is out of place on this dance oriented album due to it 's slow nature . It 's an okay song , the little keyboard solo is nice , but Paula was going to do some better ballads later on so usually I skip over this one , but it 's not a bad song it just seems like Paula sounds tired from dancing too much ! The driving funk of `` Cold Hearted '' are up next . I like the little breakdown part and wish that Paula 's little rap from her 1990 Shut Up And Dance tune `` 1990 Mix '' could have been added but that 's wishful thinking ... Last but not least is `` One Or The Other '' which is largely keyboard influenced . It 's a nice little dance track that is sure to please and surprise ! It was co-written by Paula ! `` Forever Your Girl '' is a great album and one to surely add to your collection . I 've been a fan of Paula since I was a child , I can remember hearing `` Straight Up '' on the radio in my mom 's car and singing along , and I was only 3 ! I even remember begging my grandma for some LA Gear Paula Abdul shoes with the little pink and white tassles on them . Ah , those were the days ! Though Paula is not the greatest singer she still pulls it off well and the music was outstanding and still remains outstanding . Check out her videos from this album , they are wickedly good , to this day I think Paula could out dance , Britney , Christina , Justin and Usher , her dancing was amazing . Still one of the most stellar debuts from an artist . Bravo Paula ! StarSprinkles Top 5 ( I love the whole album but I do have my faves ! ) 1 . Knocked Out2 . Straight Up3 . Forever Your Girl4 .

It seems like lightyears ago that Paula Abdul reigned atop the Billboard Charts with the irresistible hits & quot ; Straight Up , & quot ; & quot ; Cold Hearted , & quot ; and & quot ; Forever Your Girl. & quot ; Whenever an album features such smash singles , there is a risk of finding the rest of the effort to be a disappointment . FOREVER YOUR GIRL is no such case . Each track is impeccably crafted pop perfection ( save for the grating & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; ) , and , contrary to popular belief , Paula 's vocals are ideal to the style of the songs.No other performer could perform & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; or & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; with Paula 's feline growl , just as no other songstress could sing & quot ; Live To Tell & quot ; with Madonna 's urgent intensity . Paula 's debut effort secured her a place in pop history , and she is sorely missed . Her wholesome image was so refreshing amid the hormone-addled heavy metal-dominated late '80s , and her lush ballads & quot ; Rush Rush & quot ; and & quot ; Blowing Kisses in the Wind & quot ; were just as inviting in a time when the early '90s saw the pompous grunge movement was finding its footing.We miss Paula ... I miss Paula . Even with the critical and commercial disappointment HEAD OVER HEELS , Paula unveiled a stylish new image that saw the releases of her most sophisticated singles , & quot ; Crazy Cool & quot ; and & quot ; My Love Is For Real. & quot ; While fans lamented that the album arrived with little fanfare , I 'm sure we 'd give anything to see the same anticipation for HEAD OVER HEELS with the arrival of Paula 's latest studio effort . It appeared that people were eager to get their hands on a copy of THE BEST OF PAULA ABDUL , with its street date set for March 28 of this year . However , ONCE AGAIN , Virgin Records has delayed its release ... indefinitely . In the meantime , I suggest you purchase & quot ; Greatest , & quot ; the import release of her best-of compilation . While it does not feature & quot ; Cold Hearted , & quot ; it compiles Paula 's most unforgettable songs and all of her singles .	1
Paula can sing , entertain and this is a great , fun album ... enjoy this and take it for the fun and party feel that it is .	1
Long before Paula Abdul was a judge on American Idol she was a very succesful singer , actually she was among the most popular in the world for a few years 1988-1992 and had 5-6 number 1 singles in the US . Although she was not the best of singers , her voice was thin and girlish it was personal and unique and always interesting to listen to . On the other hand Paula was a great entertainer , fantastic dancer and very charismatic . She had initially been a cheerleader and choreographer but eventually those qualities would be useful for her own career . Not too surprisingly Paula is better on uptempo songs . Babyface penned first single `` Knocked Out '' was n't a hit and neither second single `` ( It 's Just ) The Way That You Love Me '' until it later was re-released . The album was n't going particulary well either , but everything changed when third single `` Staight Up '' was released . It went to number # 1 and made Paula a overnight sensation , the album eventually reached # 1 aswell , but it took 62 weeks , a record for an album . Midtempos `` Forever Your Girl '' `` Cold Hearted '' and the last single of this album , a duet with the Wild Pair `` Opposite Attracts '' would also reach the top of the charts , making Paula Abdul one of the most popular artists of 1988-1989 and `` Forever Your Girl '' has now sold around 17 Million copies . Some of the songs have dated but not everything , campared to alot of her peers this album is still full of good quality that not always sound like typical 80 's music and the hitsingles talk for themselves . The first of only 3 albums she released is undoubtly the best and worth a place in a music collection .	1
OMG , I had this CD too , used and tossed but bought it again for `` Next To You . '' I love the song and it 's one of the better ballads on here . I should have kept this CD but it was scratched it 's better than `` Spellbound , '' now thats a CD I should have tossed.Anyway , Paula is no Janet , but she had some memorable hits on this CD such as `` Straight Up '' and `` Opposites Attract '' . Oh , also forgot `` Cold Hearted Snake . ''	1
Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson ruled the early nineties with rap and freestyle-like music . `` Straight Up '' and `` ColdHearted Snake '' are very good dance songs while `` Next To You '' is a love song that would make a grown man cry ( in a romantic way ) . Little known fact : Paula Abdul helped Janet Jackson add some dance moves into her performances . THAT should tell you the REAL level of Miss Abdul 's talent which is too often overlooked . Recommended !	1
I got this on tape about ten years ago , and I loved it then and I love it now ( though I do n't listen to it as much because I listen to my CDs ) . I like all the songs , though I do n't like the versions of & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; and & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; that are on this CD . Get this if you LOVE the music of the last two years of the decade ( '88 and '89 ) .	1
No one can deny Paula had those # 1 's in 1989-1991 . What sticks out more in my mind is the endless push of her videos on MTV , starting with `` Straight Up '' , and yes , prophetically , the CD also shot `` Straight Up '' too . But looking back , Paula was VERY LUCKY this CD came back from the brink of death and even made the charts at all in 1989 . Remember , the CD was released in 1988 and went nowhere . I 'm not sure if she filmed her videos in 1988 or was it after `` Straight Up '' hit # 1 , that her manager demanded a video be made right away to be put on MTV.On a side note trivia -- the story goes : Aretha Franklin picked up the phone to congratulate Paula on her CD hitting # 1 on the charts . Paula hung up on Aretha TWICE , thinking it was a lousy joke from someone . Only , the THIRD phone call finally convinced Paula that Aretha was the REAL THING ! My question is : why would Aretha Franklin even call Paula THREE TIMES just to convince her that it was NO practical joke ? ! Paula 's manager told the press afterwards Paula was so overcome with emotion the `` Queen of Soul '' would even pick up the phone to call her that it was too much for her to handle . She managed to only churn out the words `` Thank You , Aretha '' to Aretha 's congratulations.No one is gon na argue that Paula Abdul does not possess the pipes of a Barbra Streisand or Mariah Carey , but she does pump her vocal performances full of vigor and energy . She gives it her all with whatever limited vocal abilities she has . It 's not a put-down , we ca n't all have the pipes of a Mariah or Celine , but Paula was helped tremendously by the endless rotation of her videos on MTV . Remember , in those days , they did n't have TRL on MTV , so can you imagine what her appearances on TRL might 've done to her CD . It probably would 've kept the disc on the charts much longer.This CD has hits that `` Spellbound '' WISHES it had , but in `` Spellbound 's '' defense , Paula 's vocals improved . You can hear the difference on `` Rush , Rush '' and compare that to the thinner vocals on the `` Forever Your Girl '' CD . Too bad `` Spellbound '' lacked any decent songs except `` Rush Rush '' , which still shot to # 1 on Billboard.Paula does have that lucky break to come back from the dead . Who knew she 'd be back in our lives once again and be seen every week on Fox TV ?	1
When this was was released , my friend loaned me a copy . During a get together , someone said that the album 's `` all trash ! '' But another giggled and admitted that he liked it . So it became the well loved trashy dance album of the 80s , giving Madonna and Janet Jackson a run in the pop dance market.The songs are very groovy . Besides the No 1s like Straight Up , Forever Your Girl , Opposites Attract and Cold Hearted , I especially like Knocked Out and I Need You . My only beef with this is that they did not put in the version of Cold Hearted which had Paula rapping.Many of of us ended up getting the accompanying VHS too to learn to dance like Paula .	1
I still like & quot ; Forever Your Girl ! & quot ; I still play it every year , namely during the summer ! I finally bought the CD in Atlanta in 2002 after 13 years of having the cassette . This album set the tone for the dancing and choreography that dominated the next decade in videos and live performances . It does n't sound dated like some '80s albums -- the music is heavy on the rhythms and the beats ! Very fun , danceable , escapist and so very funky ! ! ! ! I still love & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; , & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; , & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , & quot ; The Way That You Love Me & quot ; and & quot ; I Need You & quot ; . I like the other songs too like the ballad & quot ; Next To You & quot ; -- it sounds very Atlanta-like in its landscapes . I believe that it was the benchmark to what Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera and Jennifer Lopez are doing now . Paula 's voice is girlish and a little squeaky on some songs , but she did sound good on all of them . Janet Jackson was already hot too in '89-'90 ( though Paula 's album came out in June 1988 ) , but Paula really gave Janet some stiff competition . Paula 's recent judging on American Idol makes this album far more respectable now ! Her recent visibility will make more people and newer listeners to buy this album .	1
Yes I admit this was a good record , and sold over 7 million copies what ever ! MR & gt ; SKQUINTO again Paula was just new yes HOT was was predicted to last . But better than Madonna and Janet BOY you got issues . Wheres Paula now ? But I must say Forever your girl is a good album , But its forgoten , Even madonna 's true blue is still is notice especially the album cover , sold more than 7.4 million copies in the US alone ill throw that in for record . Paula had her time , but now shes KNOCKED OUT ! ! ! by madonna and janet ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .	1
Much ink has been spilled about how Paula Abdul had little talent and was mostly all style over substance . But let 's be honest , this has been going on in the music business since it first began . Other artists over the years who had a limited range to their voice , yet had hit after hit on the charts include : Lesley Gore , Nancy Sinatra , Diana Ross , Madonna , Janet Jackson , Kylie Minogue , Shania Twain , Britney Spears , etc . For all of these singers listed and many , many others , their style was almost or more important than their songs.Let 's face it folks , for every Petula Clark singing `` Downtown '' , there was a Janis Joplin singing `` Piece of my Heart . '' For every Madonna singing `` Vogue '' , there was a Tracy Chapman singing `` Fast Car . '' For every Paula Abdul singing `` Straight Up '' , there was a Tina Turner singing `` The Best . '' The point is , that there is always going to be more serious artists who sing with their heart and soul and there are going to be artists who are fun and frothy.If Paula Abdul 's music can brighten one person 's day , then she has done more for this world than many of the critics who want to tear her down.I originally bought this CD when it first came out , and it still to this day brings back memories of my wild , fun , adventurous youth . I can remember dancing at the clubs to songs like `` Knocked Out '' and `` The Way That You Love Me . '' I also liked album cuts such as `` State of Attraction '' and `` One or the Other . '' Listening to this CD still brings a smile to my face , and really , in the end , is n't that all that matters ?	1
Classic : Forever Your GirlBack in 1987 , Janet Jackson 's Choreographer , Paula Abdul , with the help of some friends in the business , managed to be one of the first females to be signed under the new music label VIRGIN RECORDS . By 1988 her debut album was already cooked . FOREVER YOUR GIRL was and is an infuation of pure maintream pop and the sound of those years new jack swing . The leading single , KNOCKED OUT , is a fine piece of street funk with a punch . The song produced by Babyface and La Reid , relates box with love , although the single hit the top 10 in R & B ; charts , it did n't spark the interest of people towards the album , the second single THE WAY THAT YOU LOVE ME was less succesful by the end of 1988 , produced by Oliver Leiber , was Abdul response to the phrase `` It 's all about love , not money '' , yeah , right . A very catchy and danceable number that would faired better in early 1990 upon it 's re-release hitting # 3 . The label decided to not give up on Paula , and release the clever , classic , sassy hit single STRAIGHT UP , and stand up for my love song , it 's funky , memorable and Paula 's voice stand out here , I can not picture another lady singing this tune , produced by Elliott Wolff , the song achieve the # 1 spot , and with this song , began what Abdul most be remember more , her superb dancing in the excellent videos she made hand in hand with David Fincher ( Panic Room ) , Following the mega-success of Straight Up , came the title cut , FOREVER YOUR GIRL , a cheesy , corny , funky take , the video feauture a bunch of kids learning dancin ' steps from no other that Paula , hit # 1 again , produced by Oliver Leiber , COLD HEARTED was the supposed third single for many people , but this song , it 's just , delightful , hot , and suggestive , the video inspired by Bob Fosse , is a great introduction to a very mature Paula , as many suspected Paula hit # 1 again , with this Wolff , produced track . OPPOSITTES ATTRACT okay , the cat song , if we forget about how corny the cat looks now , we can say that this song feauture one of the first collaboration between rap and pop , the WILD PAIR even got noticed by this single , and if you are wondering what position Miss Abdul achieve well , yes , # 1 . Other tracks in this album are joyful and funky like I NEED YOU , ONE OR THE OTHER , ore with a more rock feelin ' like STATE OF ATTRACTION ( produced by non other than Alanis Morissette producer Glen Ballard ) , if the album would have taken out NEXT TO YOU , it would have been better , beacuse it would be a perfect piece of pure late 80 's dance LP . At the end of the promotion of this album Paula took a break , and became an overnight celebrity , Miss Abdul has been killed by critics about everything she 's done , but the truth is , Paula Abdul voice is excellent in this album , her music sounds energetic and with attitude , and her persona is bigger than life .	1
Selling around 7 million , makes a good state , that this album is no mistake to buy it ! , Paula Abdul debut album embraces the music of the end of th 80 's and the welcoming of the 90 's , she should be remember as the top artist of that slack of time cuz she was , better than Madonna and Janet . For my taste 9 of the 10 album cuts are great . Next to you ( should be left out ) , The other songs are definetily great ! and the 6 singles release in this album are just classic , sadly as most of all the albums in the eighties the radio version were slightly different but if you want that The Greatest Hits will do you good ( beautifuly crafted all the singles version , way to go Virgin Records ! ! ! ) . But as for all Forever Your Girl will be considered always one of time best debut album .	1
My favorite songs are the way that you love me , knocked out , I need you , straight up , and opposites attract . this is acomment to one reviewer . I doubt a three year old would write the way that you love me . Great dance beats and paula can sing , unlike britney and paula can dance as well .	1
Ahhh ... it 's amazing what we think is cool when we are 14 , eh ? Just listening to this CD now in 2000 is like listening to a soundtrack of junior high . Back then , it was a fierce R & amp ; B-tinged pop album with strong rhythms and excellent production ; today , it 's more of a paint-by-numbers wafer-thin voice warbling over a drum track . No one ever called Paula Abdul a great singer -- sometimes it gets so bad , it sounds like she is singing underwater -- but at times , the production here *is* top-notch . & quot ; Cold Hearted & quot ; and & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; are simply two good-sounding , danceable songs . Verdict ? Dated lightweight pop that 's just fun , with no real substance -- just like eating frosting right out of the tub .	1
PAULA YOU DID A GREAT JOB , ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK YOU FOR MAKEING SUCH A MASTERPEACE ! ! !	1
Say what you will about Paula Abdul -- she does n't sing very well and her music is often derivative -- but one thing is certain : she came out with some of the catchiest songs of the 1980s . This album has all the ingredients of a hit : sharp beats , slammin ' grooves , and Abdul 's whiny voice , which , in a strange way , sounds good . Standouts include & quot ; The Way That You Love Me , & quot ; the Babyface-penned & quot ; Knocked Out , & quot ; and the memorable & quot ; Cold Hearted. & quot ; In the age of pale imitators like Britney Spears , we need an artist like Abdul more badly now than ever . She was never remembered as a & quot ; deep & quot ; artist like poseur Alanis Morrissette , but she delivered some well-crafted pop tunes in her day .	1
On this album , Roy sounds substantially as he did years ago . It is as if he never aged . His voice is as haunting as pure as his early recordings . The real shame is that he passed not long after he made this record . The wonderful thing is that we get to hear him one last time .	1
Sadly , Roy Orbison did not live to experience the success of this , his last , album . A heart attack claimed this talented musician 's life in December 1988 . He did live to experience the success of THE TRAVELING WILBURYS , VOL . 1 , released two months earlier . The conception of the cover is weird . The title appears upside down and so is a copy of a photo of Orbison at the lower right . This album spawned two hits . YOU GOT IT , which was later covered by Bonnie Raitt for the 1994 movie & quot ; Boys On The Side & quot ; , and SHE 'S A MYSTERY TO ME . A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL , written by Orbison and his fellow Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne , was covered by Michael Bolton which was a hit for Bolton in 1995 . All the other songs are pretty cool . I dedicate this album to the memory of Orbison .	1
After steadily reestablishing his place in the pop world beginning with his country hits in the late 1970s ' and his haunting rerecording of `` In Dreams '' from David Lynch 's 1986 classic `` Blue Velvet , '' Roy Orbison declared he was back and here to stay with 1988 's excellent `` Mystery Girl , '' a stunning testament to the timelessness of his voice and music , launching a remarkably lauded comeback that was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death on December 6th , 1988.Orbison had quite a bit of help from his friends on the record , namely his Traveling Wilburys companions Bob Dylan , Tom Petty , and especially Jeff Lynne ; indeed , that jangly Wilburys sound is all over the record , yet the record is still distinctly an Orbison record , and most of these songs could have just as easily been recorded at the height of his 1960 's heyday . This is especially true of the record 's lead track , `` You Got It , '' a perfect pop song that recalls `` Oh , Pretty Woman '' with its pulsating guitar riff and soulful Orbison vocal . This song deservedly became a major hit for Orbison at a time when most of his peers were doing county fairs.The rest of the record keeps at this remarkably high standard ; ballads like `` A Love So Beautiful '' and the haunting `` She 's a Mystery to Me '' showcase the power Orbison 's voice the same way `` Crying '' and `` It 's Over '' did 20 years prior , while `` All I Can Do ( Is Dream You ) '' is another perfect pop song . `` California Blue '' is a shimmering love song that Orbison finds himself at home with , but Elvis Costello 's `` The Comedians '' takes the crown as the record 's best song , with Orbison tenderly crooning some of the most original and aching lyrics ever in a ballad . The closing , regretful `` Careless Heart '' is also worth noting . `` Windsurfer '' is the weak link on the record , but is still worth noting . `` Mystery Girl '' is an absolute masterpiece , showcasing one of the greatest vocalists still at the top of his game . Listening to this record , you ca n't help but feel anguish at the peaks Orbison still could 've hit had he not died . Still , for a final record , you ca n't get much better than `` Mystery Girl . ''	1
I will never forget waking up one early December day in 1988 and finding out that Roy Orbison had died suddenly and unexpectedly shortly after performing in concert the night before . I , along with a legion of long-time fans , grieved the loss of this incredible singer and performer . Initially , his death at that particular time in his career seemed terribly unfair . After stagnating during the 1970s and early 1980s , Orbison was back and perhaps even better than ever in 1988 . His collaboration with Bob Dylan , Tom Petty , George Harrison , and Jeff Lynne in the form of The Traveling Wilburys had put him back in the national spotlight , and many of us longed for the new album soon to be released , an album we had heard nothing but incredibly good things about . Then , suddenly , he and the voice that touched our hearts for so many years , was gone . We , the fans , should have been rewarding Roy Orbison for all of the memories he gave us in song , yet , ever the selfless and humble man he was , Orbison actually presented all of us with a final , precious gift in the form of the album Mystery Girl . Roy 's widow Barbara deserves our heartfelt thanks for bravely putting the finishing touches on this album after her husband 's death.Mystery Girl is simply an incredible album featuring a reenergized Roy Orbison easily uniting his unique voice to a modern sound that appealed to any number of ears ; the released tracks from this album found ample playing time on both pop rock and country radio stations . Perhaps the first single , You Got It , got too much attention , as it was nearly played to death over the course of the first half of 1989 , but that is just a tribute to the wonderful beauty and infectious beat and rhythm of this song co-written by Orbison and Wilbury buddies Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty . The second track on the album , In the Real World , marks an abrupt change in tone ; bringing to mind Roy 's classic song In Dreams ; Orbison captures your heard on the first note and soars with it through the clouds that only he possessed the means of exploring . This haunting track is , in my opinion , the best song on the album . Roy decides to rock a little bit on ( All I Can Do Is ) Dream You before stopping to wax poetic and heartbreaking on the slow ballad A Love So Beautiful , a song featuring a little musical support from co-writer Jeff Lynne and George Harrison . California Blue ( another Orbison-Lynne-Petty venture ) , The Only One , and Windsurfer are great songs in their own right , but special attention must be shown the remaining three tracks . Careless Heart is a beautiful song of love and loss that seems to convey a sense of the type of feelings we felt over the loss of this man taken much too soon from our midst . She 's a Mystery To Me , written by U2 's Bono and The Edge , presents Roy with a slightly different type of song that he easily makes his own , hitting the high notes perfectly on the choruses . Then there is The Comedians , a song written by Elvis Costello ; this is vintage Roy Orbison , delivering a strikingly visual display of betrayal and loss , the very subjects Roy seemed to understand more than any other singer out there.Mystery Girl is a very special album that Roy Orbison fans will treasure and play often for the rest of our lives . I wish Roy would have lived to see the incredible reception this album received from fans , but one can take comfort in the fact that Orbison left this world on top where he always belonged .	1
Its really a shame this performer 's comeback was so brief . What a strong beautiful voice . The songs wonderfully combine a fifties beat with some eighties stylings and some excellent song structure . If you want to find the roots of rock n roll , this is an excellent choice to start with .	1
Mystery Girl is an inconsistent CD , with a couple of -- for me -- very weak songs , In the Real World and A Love So Beautiful . But while nothing matches his best work on Monument in the late fifties and early sixties , Roy 's voice was still fabulous here , showing not a trace of age or doubt as he hits those wonderful high notes . And some of the songs , particularly You Got It , Careless Heart , and the title cut , approach earlier classics like Pretty Woman and Only the Lonely . The Comedians , written by Elvis Costello , is Running Scared with a different denouement . The snare drum even sounds like RS . And Windsurfer reminds me why Roy 's music sometimes drew comparisons to opera . Like opera , in this song he takes a centuries old helping of plot corniness -- guy ca n't get girl , so he dies for her -- and through some lovely music ( OK , you do n't get drums very often in opera ) , a chorus for witness , and , especially , his soaring tragic voice makes the cliche both moving and fresh again .	1
Roy Orbison / Mystery Girl : After the great success of his work on the first Traveling Wilburys album , Roy made this one with the help of various excellent producers ( including his fellow Wilbury , Jeff Lynne ) . `` You got it '' became a huge hit but Roy passed away just before its release . This is a great , extremely entertaining album and a fitting remembrance of a man who had been making great music since the early days of Rock N Roll . Five Stars .	1
This was Roy Orbison 's last album , which came out shortly after his death . It went on to become his best selling album ever . No doubt the publicity surrounding his death helped sales , but a lot of it had to do with `` You Got It '' , which was Roy 's last hit single . `` You Got It '' is a great song , and there are several other fine songs here . I especially like `` She 's a Mystery to Me '' and `` The Comedians '' . This album makes a good final testament to the greatness of Roy Orbison . Recommended to Roy 's fans .	1
1989 was a very turbulant year for me , drugs , alcohol , crazy girlfriend , on my own for the first time , it 's a miracle I survived . I do not know why , when , or where I bought this album , but I 'm so glad I did . When things were quiet at night and I was alone in my apartment , I would shut off all the lights and listen to the tape over and over again in complete darkness . It just seemed like the right thing to do.Roy 's haunting voice and bittersweet songs described everything I was going through at the time , even Windsurfer ( I grew up on the beach ) . Comedians , Love so beautiful , and the title track haunt me to this day . It 's such a shame Roy died around the time of this album 's release . The yearning in his voice made him sound like he was so alone , and I was too . If he were alive and I had the chance , I 'd shake his hand and thank him for making an album that could touch the heart of this Speed Metal Headbanger.We could only wonder what else he could have done if given more time . Maybe there 's a lesson here for us .	1
Roy was a west Texan , raised amidst the blowing sand , rattlesnakes , oil rigs , and women eager to break your heart . Like Buddy Holly , it all shines in the timeless music that he made . This CD is as close to perfect as it gets , as far as come-back albums . The production is absolutely great , and while I love all his older stuff , this is in a whole other league . Music by another Good Texan -- buy a copy and put it with the SRV and Buddy Holly .	1
I enjoyed his greatest hits and essentials album . this last album of his is a great one to get if you like his music .	1
Mystery Girl is thirty-eight minutes and fifteen seconds and was released on February 7 , 1989 . Mystery Girl reached # 5 on the U.S . Billboard 200 Album and # 17 on the U.S . Billboard Country Albums and has since gone Triple Platinum . This was Roy Orbison last studio album before his sudden death . The album contained the songs that made the charts and his last number one song as well . To me this is classic Roy Orbison singing . Roy , you will be missed .

The great Roy Orbison was on the brink of a MAJOR comeback when he was taken from us , much too early . God decided he wanted the angel in black by his side . Released posthumously , the `` Mystery Girl '' album lived up to the promise that this great artist would show us much more . The CD opens with the hit `` You Got It '' , which was a breath of fresh air on the airwaves at the time . The lyrics to the next track , `` In the Real World '' , turned out to be so prophetic , if this song does n't move you , you 're made of stone . `` ( All I Can Do Is ) Dream You '' is a slice of rockabilly harkening back to Roy 's mid-50s roots , punchy and raucous . `` A Love So Beautiful '' tells of a love gone wrong , one of the subjects Roy sang of with authority . `` California Blue '' is an ode to the home he was spending an increasing amount of time away from , the song soaring and satisfying . The `` title '' track , `` She 's a Mystery to Me '' , tells of a love not quite as sunny as one might want , but nonetheless accepts on its own terms . `` The Comedians '' is so close in form and subject to `` Running Scared '' , but ends differently than that classic , in performance just as satisfying . Of the last three songs , only `` Windsurfer '' stands as a `` throwaway '' , but to my ears , it still satisfies with Roy 's soaring vocals ( how to describe his voice without using the word soaring ? ? ) and some sprightly guitar . `` The Only One '' tells of a breakup , and Roy was the expert on breakup songs , but on this one , he is looking on , and comes across with some sage observations . The CD ends with `` Careless Heart '' , this time Roy is on the receiving end of a heartache , and of course , delivers hindsight as to why . There was one more CD cobbled together after this , `` King of Hearts '' , but it is only a collection of songs finished in the wake of his untimely death . `` Mystery Girl '' , though only 37 minutes , is one of the most satisfying albums ever made by ANYONE , and certainly hints that Roy had a lot more in him , had he lived . If you can get it on the cheap , more 's better , but if you loved Roy , this is a stellar example of his craft , easily sitting in the company of his classic Monument albums of the 60s.Addendum : Lately , this album is offered for download with an additional track , `` You May Feel Me Crying '' . This is no `` from the archives '' , previously unreleased track , but is included in the wonderful boxed set `` The Soul of Rock and Roll '' .	1
Ultimately , most people remember Roy Orbison for his sixties classics , but his renaissance in the eighties should not be overlooked . He re-recorded many of his old hits during a legal dispute that prevented his old classics being re-issued ( at one time there was a threat to destroy them ) . Roy also teamed up with George Harrison , Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty to form the Travelling Wilburys , a group that lasted for just one album . Finally , he recorded this solo album of original material . The album provides a great showcase for Roy 's voice , appealing to Roy 's traditional fans while gaining a new generation of fans who previously had shown little interest in his music.The big hit from this album was , of course , You got it , a catchy up-tempo song that received plenty of airplay on radio stations across the world . It deserved all the success it got but there are other songs here that I regard as even better . While Roy was always good at up-tempo rocking songs ( as he showed in the sixties with Oh pretty woman ) , he could do so much else . With classic ballads and mid-tempo songs such as California blue , She 's a mystery to me , Careless heart , In the real world and A love so beautiful , this album maintains a high standard from start to finish.Every Roy Orbison fan should own this album , which was his last and best album of original material . And if you 're not already a Roy Orbison fan , this album may cause you to become one .	1
Every now and again I check in on my favorite albums to see if there have been any remasters or expanded editions released that I should know about . To my surprise , I learned that this is not even available in CD format anymore ( as of this writing in 2011 there is only the mp3 version available for purchase ) ! I suppose that nobody really buys CDs these days anyways but it still came as a shock that this incredible recording could be so neglected.There is probably little to say about this album that has n't already been said . It 's a flawless and powerful recording that served as the perfect vehicle for the legendary Roy Orbison to end his career . The song `` She 's A Mystery To Me '' is on my rotating list of favorite-ever songs , usually in the top 5 . It does n't hurt that the song was penned by Bono and The Edge of U2 fame , right at that legendary band 's peak ( during the era of Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum , and shortly before the band got to work on Achtung Baby ) . In fact , the famous collaborators ( Tom Petty , Jeff Lynne ) all serve to enhance this recording by placing the spotlight firmly where it belongs - on Roy 's incredible voice.If there is a recording for the ages , this is it . Hopefully this will someday receive the royal remastering and expanded edition treatment it deserves .	1
Roy Orbison , the greatest vocalist in Rock and Roll , had fallen on hard times commercially during the 1970s and early 1980s . However , during the mid-80s , his music began to be featured in films and people began to re-discover him . At the same time , he seemed rejuvinated artistically . His 1988 concert film and CD entitled BLACK AND WHITE NIGHT featured many top rock and roll stars , onstage with Roy , backing him up and lavishing him with high praise.At the same time , he was a member of the incredible supergroup , the Traveling Wilburys , who also featured Bob Dylan , George Harrison , Jeff Lynne , and Tom Petty . Their debut album , VOLUME ONE , was an artistic and commercial smash hit.Sadly , just as his solo comeback MYSTERY GIRL was being released , Roy passed away all too young , all too soon . What he left behind with this document is an extraordinary recording , filled with rich , poignant , powerhouse pop , rock , and countrified tunes . Not a weak moment here ! The Jeff Lynne-produced tracks shine , especially the winning instant classic , `` You Got It , '' and the lush `` A Love So Beautiful . '' Also of note is the Bono-produced `` She 's a Mystery to Me , '' which is one of Roy 's best recordings . I also get chills everytime I hear `` The Comedians . `` Some of Roy 's finest songwriting and collaborative efforts are on display here . This disc is sometimes hard to find , so you do n't want to miss picking it up NOW ! Also of note is the newly released ESSENTIAL ROY ORBISON on Sony .	1
A sad , sweeping swansong that easily rates among his greatest works . In fact , it is probably the strongest LP of his career as it is imbued with a coherence and a complexity that binds these shimmering pop songs together . His voice soars . Years had done nothing to diminish his multi-octave crooning ... and the wisdom of middle age had added a certain poingancy to each trembling note . These are songs about lost love and broken dreams ... beautifully arranged , breathtakingly sung . The production is a little slick and compressed , but Roy 's voice is captured perfectly . You can hear every nuance of his phrasing . Sadly , this album is often overlooked . I beleive it stands as one of a handful of great records from the last two decades ... this from some one who was supposed to be & quot ; irrelevant & quot ; by the beginning of the '70 's . Roy Orbison , we miss you .	1
This was a great point in Roy Oribon 's career b/c he was resurrected out of obscurity by his inclusion with the `` Traveling Wilburys '' supergroup.Back in the later 80 's , all of the Traveling Wilburys had albums that came out at around the same time with each other of the friends helping each other out.If youy like the Traveling Wilburys ( and who could not ! ) then you would have to enjoy this work . I think that Tom Petty , George Harrison and Roy all had their cds produced by former ELO frontman Jeff Lynne . This cd is an extention to Petty 's `` Full Moon Fever '' , Harrison 's `` Cloud Nine '' and Lynne 's `` Armchair Theater '' .Of course , the trademark sound of Orbison 's yearning vocals , twangy guitar , hook filled choruses and rockabilly themes are still there.Some highlights of the cd is the often heard `` You got it '' , plus the gems of `` Shes a mysrtery to me '' , `` California Blue '' and `` Dream you '' . The rest of the songs are great and there is definitely no filler on this final tributory album.There are a lot of collaborations/assistance from other noted artists but , unlike the Santana nonsense ( I hate it and see it as a corporate raid into otherwise sacred rock music ) , the help is very subtle thereby preserving this as a true Orbison work.This cd has the essense of a true classic and should always remain timeless .	1
One of the greatest comebacks ever . Produced by Lynne for big part sounds like great Traveling Wilburys . And Orbison is in top form again . Highlights : You got it , California blue , She 's a mystery to me.Roy Orbison like in his best years .	1
Mystery Girl is a mighty rock album filled with memorable songs of haunting beauty and grace , and it showcases a man at the peak of his powers . The tragedy of it , is that this fine artistic achievement would prove to be Roy Orbison 's swansong . Though Orbison enjoyed a successful career spanning back decades , listening to Mystery Girl you almost sense that he saved his best effort for last . These are songs that sound utterly timeless and universally appealing , and they fit Orbison 's voice like a glove . In anyone else 's hands a song like the momentous ballad 'A Love So Beautiful ' might sound cheesy or mawkish , however Orbison delivers it with such conviction , such sincerity , that you ca n't help but fall under it 's spell . Mystery Girl is spearheaded by three brilliant singles in the unforgettable 'You Got It ' , the quite wonderful 'California Blue ' and the spine tingling Bono-donated 'She 's A Mystery To Me ' . These singles are indicative of the quality of the rest of the album - such is the consistency of it . Also , miraculously , for an album released in 1989 it escapes unscathed from some of the more dubious production qualities of that era . Quite simply , Mystery Girl is the kind of album that speaks to the heart , and would hold up beautifully in any era , any environment , anywhere in the world . It remains one of my favourite albums of all time , and I would heartily recommend it to anyone .	1
This is a classic album , by far one of the best albums released in the late 1980s . Babyface composed beautiful songs for their debut album . My personal favorites are One Night , Ready or Not , and Ca n't Stop . This album is perfect with the lights down .	1
After 7 's debut disc was released at time when almost every R & B record released was A-1.Two-thirds of the trio are the brothers of producer Kenneth `` Babyface '' Edmonds , and the other third is the cousin of Antonio `` L.A. '' Reid ; the two produced the majority of the album , which features three smash hits and a host of other likable tracks . The singles released were Heat Of The Moment , Ca n't Stop and Ready Or Not . Ca n't Stop & Heat Of The Moment were both up-tempo dance numbers while Ready Or Not is one of the best slow jams released in 1989 . However the one song to me that makes the CD a classic is `` One Night , '' an urban adult contemporary composition that was never released ; it showcases Melvin and Kevon in an impressive vocal exchange over a mid-tempo rhythm .	1
This CD may only have 8 songs on it . But each one of them is seriously all that . Its like you can almost feel what they guys in After 7 are singing about . I still remember hearing `` Cant Stop '' . I didnt know who it was then . But when i found out . I knew i 'd found another great singing group . `` One Night '' is hot as well as almost every other cut of this standout CD.I dont care what anyone says . This CD deserves much props and After 7 deserves more recognition for bringing the goods on this CD.Check this CD out . You 'll wonder why you didnt get it sooner . Those are my words .	1
After 7 was so smooth and sounded great ... with fantastic vocals , harmonies and beats , this was an awesome group ... the sound of Edmonds and great dance and bedroom tunes .	1
This album has stood the test of time . As I write this review 20 years after its release , the album still is sweet music to my ears . I bought the cassette in the winter of 1990 and fell asleep listening to it every night for the next 6 months . No matter how much I listened I never got tired of it.Track listing:1 . Do n't Cha Think 9/102 . Heat of the Moment 8.5/103 . Ca n't Stop 9.5/104 . My Only Woman 6.5/105 . One Night 10/106 . Love 's Been So Nice 7.5/107 . Ready or Not 11/10 ! ! ! 8 . Sayonara 7/10	1
Babyface , oh , how I love you . I can remember hearing After 7 on the radio as a small child . I liked their music even then , but , of course , I did n't appreciate it then as much as I do now , since I 'm an adult and understand the lyrics . This is a remarkable album . Kevon Edmonds has a beautiful singing voice . `` Ca n't Stop '' , `` Ready or Not '' and `` Heat of the Moment '' were all released to radio and received a great amount of airplay and there is no wonder why : these songs define real R & B . ; All the ingredients of a good R & B ; song are incorporated here ; well-produced , memorable lyrics and chorus , and actual SINGING . `` Ca n't Stop '' is easily the best song on this album . The melody on the chorus is brilliant ! The way the instruments blend with the singing is a stroke of genius . You know what ? This song is worth the price of the album alone . `` `` Ready or Not '' is another great song . The men of After 7 slow it down with this sexy ballad . Certainly , these lyrics are 100 % unrealistic , ( seriously , who can really give someone the moon , sun and stars ? Lol ) , but music is not always supposed to be taken literally . `` Sayonara '' is a typical break-up song . Though it is enjoyable , it 's not their best work.If you liked what you heard from After 7 on the radio , surely you will enjoy their self-titled album . This album will be played in my CD player for time indefinite ! Pick it up ! Mikeisha 's Top 51 . `` Ca n't Stop '' 2 . `` Ready or Not '' 3 . `` Heat of the Moment '' 4 . `` My Only Woman '' 5 . `` One Night ''	1
i really enjoyed this disc when it first came out.despite the family connection with La & amp ; Babyface it never overides the talents of After 7.i always felt they were underrated.Ca n't Stop was a jam ready or not and one night were also good songs.these Brothers can sing .	1
After 7 is an excellant group.The hit 's Ready Or Not , and Ca n't Stop are on this disc.Very good for any occasion .	1
After 7 's debut is an almost-perfect r & amp ; B record . This takes me back to a time when R & amp ; B had its innocence , when people sang about LOVE and ROMANCE and wanting to treat you right . There were no lyrics about & quot ; freak & quot ; this or & quot ; thong & quot ; that . This record shows Babyface at one of his peaks as a producer , as he is involved in virtually every track on this CD . It 's difficult for me to point out a standout track since you can play this CD from start to finish without hitting the & quot ; next & quot ; buttom . Highly recommended . After you hear this record , you 'll never want to listen to anything that 's been released in the last 18 months .	1
The first time I ever heard Soul II Soul , I was on vacation in New York and the track `` Keep On Movin ' `` played on the radio . As I was heading back home to North Carolina , I was afraid I would never hear the song again . Back then , it was n't uncommon for certain songs to only get regional airplay . I arrived back home and began my search for this song . No one had any idea of who or what I was talking about . Three months later , the track began to get airplay on the local stations . I was so relieved and began my delve into the history and vibe of this fabulous group . In short , Soul II Soul was not only a great band , the name represented a series of party nights organized by Jazzie B ! The group was only a small part of a much bigger sound system . Their British invasion in full swing , Soul II Soul 's success rested on the strength of Caron Wheeler 's vocals and their mix of afropean soul . Til this day DJs can drop tracks such as `` Back To Life '' and `` Keep On Movin ' `` and still excite the crowd ! Caron Wheeler eventually left the group and embarked on her solo career . Soul II Soul went through a series of personnel changes and their later albums fell short of critical acclaim but die hard fans continued to support them . Jazzie B currently plays as one of London 's most sought after DJs ! Much respect to the Soul II Soul Soundsytem ! DJ COA	1
I liked Soul II Soul when they first came out on the music scene in the hey day of MTV . My favorite songs are `` Back To Life '' and `` Keep on Movin '' on this compact disc . As for the other songs , I was n't too crazy about this disc but I still liked those two songs and it 's worth it to me . If you like this musical style , you would like this collection very much .	1
Do NOT buy this version - buy `` Club Classics , Vol . 1 - 10th Anniversary Edition '' instead . That version is the 1999 remaster of the British edition of this CD . It has all the tracks on this CD ( including the original CD version and the single version of `` Back to Life '' ) , plus bonus tracks and improved sound.Now , once you do your search and find the 10th Anniversary edition , you should absolutely buy this CD . This was one of the best releases of 1989 . It almost singlehandly brought back 1970's-influenced soul music and contains some of the best house music of 1989.It is a very warm-sounding album , with a rich sonic texture . What the hell does that mean ? These are n't just some pre-programmed pop ditties ; Jazzy B. and Nellie Hooper put some thought and effort into this one . They also got screwed out of the 1989 Best New Artist Grammy ( the winner ? none other than those musical revoluntaries , Milli Vanilli - who were not the best , new or even artists ) .I 'm not going to go into the individual tracks , other than to say that if you like `` Back to Life '' and `` Keep On Moving '' you are going to like this CD . A hits compilation wo n't do Soul II Soul justice . Buy this CD and listen to the entire album instead .	1
Cracker may 've sucked by Camper were great . `` Jack Ruby '' is especially great . And `` I was Born in a Laundromat '' is a searing , angry ( got that sounded bad -- I sound like a mediocre rock critic ) story of a white-trash upbringing that just seethes . You ca n't go wrong for a couple of bucks . It 's a keeper .	1
This was the last Camper Van Beethoven album before leader David Lowery split with the band and went on to form the more conventional band Cracker . & quot ; Key Lime Pie & quot ; is musically quite ambitious and makes good use of a full time violinist , particularly on the ace cover song & quot ; Pictures of Matchstick Men. & quot ; Other CVB classics that inhabit this album include the brilliant Ronald Reagan satire & quot ; Sweethearts , & quot ; the wistful & quot ; When I Win the Lottery & quot ; and the brilliantly corny & quot ; All Her Favorite Fruit. & quot ; Not everything works , however , and overall the album is of uneven quality . Still , there 's enough great songs to make it worth your while .	1
This is one of those bands that I can simply not compare to anyone . But sometimes those are the best ones . It 's a great album from my senior year , that is probably better than I can put into words . My favorite song is & quot ; Sweethearts & quot ; . It 's just got great guitar work , and an overall happy strummin ' melody . Violin adds alot to many of these songs as well , especially on the great track & quot ; Pictures Of Matchstick Men & quot ; . They do it very well . Other cool songs are & quot ; Borderline & quot ; and & quot ; All Her Favorite Fruit & quot ; . After this album , & quot ; David Lowery & quot ; went on to do & quot ; Cracker & quot ; , and I think & quot ; Morgan Fichter & quot ; worked some with & quot ; 10,000 Maniacs & quot ; and & quot ; Jane 's Addiction & quot ; . But overall , not much satisfies like & quot ; Key Lime Pie & quot ; .	1
From start to finish , Camper Van Beethoven left us with a some times dark , twisted , but brilliantly sarcastic and moody album , that really shows-off their potential if they had stayed together beyond & quot ; Key Lime Pie. & quot ; Along with & quot ; Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart , & quot ; Key Lime Pie stands out in the suprisingly lengthy discography of Camper . It 's edgy , dark , funny , much more modern and electric than their past work , and leaves you wishing that they never broke up .	1
I bought this disc when it was released and actually had the pleasure of seeing CVB on the ensuing tour in Athens , GA . This disc is darker , deeper and seems more personal than some of CVB 's earlier material which ventured ( in a good way ) into , as I believe D. Lowery himself said , `` absurdist rock '' . This disc stands the test of time and still sounds great today with standout tracks like Borderline , All Her Favorite Fruit and Sweethearts which I consider one of CVB 's very best songs . It 's a classic album that was critically underappreciated when it was first released . As others have noted CVB was one of the many bands that really established 80 's college radio that set the stage for today 's indie rock scene . This was their last disc but in retrospect I believe their most creative . I 'd agree that it 's not their most challenging or `` envelope-pushing '' as some of the earlier material.Several tracks on this disc suggest that the songs were written during the brutal heat of summer ( June , The Humid Press of Days , Favorite Fruit with `` the heat drifts towards a line of trees '' , and obviously Come On Darkness `` let the pavement cool '' ) . I recommend that once this becomes a favorite disc of yours ( as it is mine ) you give it a listen on the hottest day of the year - it will really make sense . At the same time the heart of the disc and the middle set of songs obviously represent a break-up - I remember at the time ( a really hot Athens summer ) my girlfriend and I were also calling it quits and I think that 's one of the many reasons that this disc has stuck in my psyche all of these years later.Also if you are a Cracker fan who never really listened to CVB , I urge you to give this one a try .	1
Break up albums have that distinct charm of not caring that allows one to relax and bare their soul . It also finds bands gripping at something they once had but not quite reaching it . Like the Smiths & quot ; Strangeways Here We Come & quot ; , another good breakup album , there are good tracks and forgettable material alike.Their political side is highlighted in the mysterious & quot ; Jack Ruby & quot ; . & quot ; Laundromat & quot ; rocks and contains one of their best lines : & quot ; Just give me some tension release. & quot ; Their are some nice moments on side two . The uplifting spring heralding & quot ; June & quot ; , and the lovelorn & quot ; All Her Favorite Fruit & quot ; . I do enjoy this album , but there is an inconsistency to it that just makes me want for more .	1
More Like 4.5 Stars . It is not a perfect record , but it is very unique and creative . Key Lime Pie is slower than the albums before this one . Dave Lowery writes witty and ironic lyrics which can make you think , laugh , or actually picture the scene for yourself . The violin is absolutely soothing , even on the raunchy The Humid Press of Days . Borderline and I was born in a Laundromat are two best cuts . When I win the Lottery is down right hilarious . This album will take time , so do n't make your conclusion after the first or second listen . Let Key Lime Pie seep into your bloodstream and enjoy . Dave Lowery and CVB are genius ! I will have the pleasure of purchasing New Roman Times when I get the chance . Excellent !	1
It 's very easy to call this album `` boring '' in comparison to the rest of the band 's catalog , but it 's not to be written off . Gone is the experimental stuff , and for the most part so is the goofy sense of humor and eclecticism , but what 's left is some well-written clever pop . Imagine a Cracker album but with some mideastern violins once in a while , and you 've got the picture . It 's a bit heavy on the slow songs , so when there 's the rare one that 's a little less than excellent things can start to drag , but most of them are beautiful , and songs like `` I Was Born In A Laundromat '' and their cover of Status Quo 's `` Pictures Of Matchstick Men '' manage to punch things up at just the right places . While I 'd reccomend Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart over this for a first purchase ( it 's as accessible , but done with a lot more creativity ) , it 's still a very solid album .	1
Good late '80 's independent college rock title . Camper Van Beethoven has never been one of my favorites but I 've always liked their name . As fate would have it , I got to catch them at a special radio station show play a club for like $ 1.05 . This being CVB 's fifth CD , it 's the title of theirs that I do like the best . Tracks that are always nice to hear again { whenever I pull this disc } out for a spin are the edgy `` Jack Ruby '' , `` When I Win The Lottery '' , `` All Her Favorite Fruit '' and their superbly done cover of Status Quo 's `` Pictures Of Matchstick Men '' . Got to hang out with their violinist Morgan Fichter after the show . Also saw her like a couple of years later on tour with Jane 's Addiction . Pretty sure that was her .	1
This CD has been stuck on the shelves of my collection , unplayed for ten years . It is only now as I systematically work through the collection ... , that I realise what a gem I 've overlooked.I 've been trying to work out why , although her sales have been respectable , Julia has never achieved great commercial success . I guess her main failing is to have launched her career in the era of dance . In general the public wanted toe-tapping , extrovert singles . But Julia is more of an inward-looking chanteuse of jazz-tinged songs of her own composition . Singers have to be very , very distinctive to bring that segment to the masses.For this album , she 'd dispensed with the expensive US session musicians used on the first album and brought together a high-calibre band she could also tour with.There are some gorgeous numbers on this album . I particularly like 'Your Lovely Face ' . Many of the songs are best played when they can have your full attention -- I find that driving in the dark along very familiar roads works for me . I 'm slightly less keen on the Latin rhythm songs , but that 's a purely personal view .	1
Still fresh from the success of her breakout hit 'Happy Ever After ' a year earlier , this sophomore album sees Fordham in fine form as she doles out her smooth-as-chocolate Brit soul with her indescribably warm pipes ... She also betrays signs of her jazz roots in 'Your Lovely Face ' and 'China Blue ' , as well as toying with bossa nova beats in 'Genius ' ( the lyrics read like a follow-up to 'Happy Ever After ' with her concern for all that 's wrong with the environment ) .A great album to listen with the lights turned down , and cool drink in hand .	1
I 'm not normally a love song-type of guy ; most of the claptrap that passes for balladry on the radio nowadays is overarranged and filled with tired sentiment ; those who think Celine Dion is just the best should try Julia Fordham 's CD & quot ; Porcelain & quot ; ( to begin with ) and be converted . These are unabashedly direct love songs of joy , heartbreak and yearning ( save for & quot ; Genius & quot ; , more of an hymn to nature , to a samba beat ) and they sound great , owing to the impeccably clean and intimate production style , and Julia 's beautiful and soulful alto voice . It 's pretty slick-sounding . My favorite is probably & quot ; For You Only For You , & quot ; because it is a real torch song which harkens back to the days when girl singers were backed by orchestras rather than synthesizers and drum machines , though there 's tasteful , minimal technology here throughout as well . & quot ; Did I Happen to Mention ? & quot ; has a wonderful emotional sweep to it , detailing Julia 's plea for more than just friendship from her beloved ( you have to imagine that she would NEED to coax , I guess ) -- it reminds me of Anita Baker -- they share a similar style . & quot ; Lock and Key & quot ; and & quot ; Manhattan Skyline & quot ; are the uptempo side starters , and how Julia can sound so elated while singing about how & quot ; broken & quot ; she was is a wonderful mystery to me . Just beautiful . The ballads are uniformly excellent as well -- I suppose you can tell the talented songwriters from just mediocre ones from small touches like how she adds a beat in her rising melodic line in & quot ; Towerblock & quot ; to prolong the poignancy of the lyric just a tad longer . Sweet . Of course , she 's not that popular in this country ; another small injustice to popcraft that gems like these do n't have much of a place on even the easy-listening stations . There -- end of sermon . You can help -- go out and get this one ! And enjoy .	1
I got a chance to see Julia live in 1994 , and the concert she gave still ranks in my all time top 10 that I have been at . This is the CD that got me started with Julia . I was familiar with Happy Ever After from the video , but Porcelain is much better than her first release . I think that Porcelain , Falling Forward and East-West are all pretty damn good and rate 5 stars each . She got a lot more air play and video play 10 years ago . I wonder why she fell out of favor with VH1 ?	1
Her voice is like a songbird . Smooth and silky . Easy to listen to . I love & quot ; Genious & quot ; , & quot ; Your Lovely Face & quot ; and & quot ; Lock & amp ; Key & quot ; . Well recommended CD ! !	1
Julia Fordham 's second album stepped ahead of her smoky , intriguing debut . She reached for some universal themes in her songwriting and came up with ten great songs that spanned the range from lonely desire ( & quot ; Did I Happen to Mention & quot ; ) to the humorous ( the Brazilian inflections of & quot ; Genius & quot ; ) . All these are tied together by the strength of her voice , which mirrors both Sade and Annie Lennox.The problem then becomes that , in a world where subtle intimacy is often passed by for brash and obvious , an album like & quot ; Porcelain & quot ; will frequently slide through the cracks . Julia was fortunate enough to be a VH1 artist of the month back when the channels actually believed in music , and as such , remained something of a cult figure for fans of female singer songwriters . One of her best known songs can be found here , the coast-to-coast romance of & quot ; Manhattan Skyline. & quot ; & quot ; How could I resist , your American arms and your French kiss ? From New York to London , London to New York , With this broken heart , so British ? & quot ; This is music for a rainy day , when you can sit with the windows open and listen to the sound of the rain and the stereo at the same time . I ca n't recommend & quot ; Porcelain & quot ; enough for fans of current Dido and Norah Jones ' Cds .	1
An album that 's not much of a big deal for a band that closed out the '80s with a giant BANG . Soul II Soul 's follow-up is still a listening delight but unlike their monstrous debut , it lacks the aggressiveness , rawness , and most importantly , the absense of powerhouse vocalist Caron Wheeler . However , the group still trys to retain the formula that made them a household name with the hits & quot ; Get a Life , & quot ; & quot ; A Dreams a Dream , & quot ; and & quot ; Missing You. & quot ;	1
Naturally , the first thing most people will point out about this album is the huge void left by the powerhouse voice behind huge hits like `` Keep On Movin ' '' and `` Back To Life '' . Caron Wheeler 's shoes are n't easy ones to fill , but on their second U.S. release , Vol . II : 1990 - A New Decade , the voices of Lamya , Kym Mazelle , Marcia Lewis , and Victoria Wilson-James prove to be more than capable of carving out niches of their own . When you hear Marcia Lewis ' soulful vocals on the powerhouse jam `` Get A Life '' or when you witness the strength of Kym Mazelle 's voice on `` Missing You '' you begin to forget the fact that Caron Wheeler is even missing . What I thought was special was the fact that they did n't try to replace Caron Wheeler with a bunch of copycats , but opted for original voices who each brought something different to the table.While I love Caron Wheeler as much as the next person and would never ever dream of taking anything away from her vocal ability , I have to say that by the time you finish with this album you probably wo n't even notice that she was absent to begin with . I rated this album higher than their previous LP because it was more cohesive and consistent . While some of their biggest hits are contained on Keep On Movin ' , on this album Soul II Soul offers up some smooth jazz , R & B ; , and dance tracks with a hint of pop in a fluid blend that makes this album more enjoyable than their previous LP . I highly reccomend picking this up if you have n't already.Standout Tracks : Courtney Blows , Time , Love Come Through , Missing You ( My Favorite ) , Get A Life , and 1990 : A New Decade	1
Although vocalists Kym Mazelle , Victoria Wilson-James , Lamya , and Marcia Lewis perform well on their respective solos , the powerhouse performances of Caron Wheeler from the group 's first album drops this recording down a few notches.With that in mind , the instrumental selections are clearly the better offerings here : `` Time ( Untitled ) '' and `` Courtney Blows '' , are jazzy enough not to be pop and pop enough not to be jazz.That is Soul II Soul 's contribution to the music industry : being something for everyone .	1
Get a Life is a good example of Soul II Soul . There first album was good , but this one has a little bit of all kind 's of beat's.People has a house groove.Missing You has the original Soul II Soul vibe , like Keep on Moving.It is a great song for any occasion.I have alot of fun with this recording .	1
This is actually one of the first CD 's I ever owned so it holds a special place in my heart ... That said , this has actually held up pretty well over the years . It 's their second release ; features a great combination of dance music , r & amp ; b , and even a little jazz . It 's got a great vibe from start to finish ; very solid throughout . Very head-nod-friendly.Good stuff . It 's too bad this band basically fell off the face of the earth after this release .	1
around this time joe jackson was getting into a lot of less pop and more soundtracks and instrumentals.this cd was a full return to pop and its a good one.Obvious Song is a stand out as well as Stranger than Fiction.i think i like Hit Single the best because it contains Jacksons sarcastic humor he can be known for .	1
I agree with many of the previous reviews ; this is a grossly overlooked album . JJ is a lyrical satirist with a bulls-eye view . I love it when he sings `` Sometimes love grows like a flower or it grows like a tumor . Love shows that god has a sense of humour . '' Joe 's poetry crackles with verve , spunk and dash .	1
I do n't think Joe had made an album like this before its release and he definitely has n't made one since like it . It is a somewhat popish album and not all of the songs are on the mark , but others are excellent , in both a musical and lyrical sense . & quot ; Obvious Song & quot ; may not be mindblowing , but it 's typical Joe , as he vents about a few different social topics that he happened to have on his mind at the time . I absolutely love & quot ; When Your Not Around & quot ; , & quot ; The Other Me & quot ; , and & quot ; The Old Songs & quot ; . Most of the rest I would classify as good . In this case , the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its parts . Thus , a four stars rating .	1
Joe Jackson is a guy that I really did not discover until after his hey day as a punk / new wave star in the 80 's . Of course I had heard some of his hits , but like Warren Zevon I never really gave him much of a listen until later in his career . For me this is one of the great overlooked albums of the early 90 's . Jackson the songwriter is the feature here as he writes some incredible lyrics . The music on the album is probably some of Jackson 's most straight forward , but that is not a distraction as it fits the overall tone of the album so well . The album is also probably one of Jackson 's most pop oriented and at the time I think it was meant to get him back on the radio . For most artists this would be a turn off for me , but these songs are so good that they deserved a lot more airplay than they ever received . The album starts with `` The Obvious Song '' a great Jackson rant on society that is as relevant today as it was in 1991 . Next up is `` Goin Downtown '' which is one of my least favorite songs on the disc . Next is `` Stranger Than Fiction '' which is an absolutely killer relationship song . This is one of those that came out at a perfect time in my life , and was kind of my theme song for a while . I 've always loved the line `` I love her so much I do n't even know what planet I 'm on . I love her so much I wish she 'd just go away '' . Next is a cover of the Fleetwood Mac classic `` Oh Well '' . Joe puts his own unique spin on the tune and it is a cool version . `` Jamie G '' comes next and is a rather average song . Next up is one of my all time favorite Jackson tunes `` Hit Single '' with very clever lyrics mixing being single from a failed relationship with the pressure to have a hit single on the radio . It sounds weird , but it works in a way only Jackson can write them . Some more great lines in this one , `` When I die and go to pure pop heaven , the angels will gather around . They 'll ask me for my whole life story , and ask for that fabulous sound . But I know they 're gon na stop me as I start going through every line , and say please not the whole damn album , nobody has that much time ... .please ... just the hit single '' . The next song is `` It 's All Too Much '' containing yet another brilliant Jackson lyric and is another one that is still very relevant . More great lines in this one , `` What shall we do this evening , send out for some sushi and champagne . Stay in and watch TV , 50 channels ca n't all be the same . Maybe go to a movie , 50 films on 50 tiny screens . They say that choice is freedom , I 'm so free it 's driving me insane '' . `` When Your Not Around '' , `` The Other Me '' and `` Trying To Cry '' , and `` My House '' are the next 4 and are all great tunes too . Next up is `` The Old Songs '' , Joe 's lament on classic rock radio and the fact that he had been around long enough that his audience just wanted to hear the oldies . This could be a theme song about my own generation with great lines like ; `` play us another one , play us the hopes and dreams of twenty years ago . They 're all over the bloody radio . It 's like they 're telling us there 's nowhere left to go ... ... .me I blame the old songs , protect us all against a change of course . All our great expectations turn to alimony and remorse . But the old songs say - be my baby , and the old songs say - she loves you . All the old songs we 'll sing come what may be . I like those songs , but I 'd like something new . '' The last track is `` Drowning '' a mournful ballad of a lost relationship and more great stuff . Can you tell I really love this album ? This disc pretty much tanked at the cash registers and came and went very quickly , so many Jackson fans do not have it . If you are into Jackson at all this is a must purchase in my opinion . I would think that people who enjoy more modern piano men like Ben Folds would also eat this up . You can get this album used on Amazon for less than $ 5 bucks .	1
Joe Jackson 's music is energized with great melody , insightful lyrics that are easy to relate to , and his output of many classic albums in the 70 's and 80 's prove that he is a brilliant artist . This disc released in 1991 , is in my opinion , one of his best . The performances are dynamic , Joe 's vocals shine , and the production is perfect.Some highlights - `` Obvious Song '' kicks the disc into high gear with a rocking up-tempo groove . `` Stranger Than Fiction '' is a great pop tune with a slight ska/reggae feel that has a repetitive , but never boring , percussion fill ( think the SNL skit - I need more cowbell ) . My favorite , `` It 's All Too Much '' , is another upbeat tune with entertaining lyrics like ... `` I hate this supermarket / But I have to say it makes me think / A hundred mineral waters / It 's fun to guess which ones are safe to drink '' . Right on , Joe ! `` Trying To Cry '' , a moving ballad , is simply arranged with the guitar strumming the occasional lone chord and the percussion floats softly in the background - a very powerful tune . Finally , `` Drowning '' , another beautiful ballad , closes out the disc with only keys , guitar , and cello . The rest of disc ai n't too shabby either.I 'm surprised by the limited reviews of `` Laughter & Lust '' and recommend this as highly as any of his other releases .	1
I think Neneh Cherry is underrated . Certainly underappreciated . Since 1989 's & quot ; Buffalo Stance & quot ; , & quot ; Kisses on the Wind & quot ; and & quot ; Heart & quot ; , Neneh Cherry has been mainly forgotten in America . I think 1992 's Homebrew is the best of her three cds . It has great songs like & quot ; Buddy X & quot ; , & quot ; Peace in Mind & quot ; , & quot ; Red Paint & quot ; , & quot ; Move With Me & quot ; , & quot ; Trout & quot ; , & quot ; Ai n't Gone Under Yet & quot ; and & quot ; Money Love. & quot ; This is a great hip-hop/r & amp ; b cd that was generally overlooked by the public . A must have for any rock collector .	1
After Neneh paved the way with `` Raw Like Sushi '' in '89 , she came back to followup with `` Home Brew '' in 1992 . `` Home Brew '' , like it 's predocessor relies on a hybrid of singing and rapping.And a large pleathora of styles ( rock , pop , soul , R & B ; , hip hop , you name it ) that make a delicious styling . `` Home Brew '' is more instrospectiveand subdued than the defiant `` Sushi '' .Produced by husband CameronMcVey ( billed as `` Booga Bear '' ) , '' Home Brew '' was recorded in a schoolhouse turned home studio in Sweden.Opening perfectly with the jazzy `` Sassy '' which finds Neneh 's playful braggadido and defiant self awareness opposite Gangstarr 's Guru.With it 's upright bass sample , '' Sassy '' turns outto be one of Neneh 's best tracks . `` Money Love '' is a 'fierce ' rockpop-ish type track.While `` Move With Me '' has a unique ballad premise ( it was co-written by Lenny Kravitz ) . `` I Ai n't Gone Under Yet '' is a gem though.Poetic and effective , '' I Ai n't '' is a song about overcoming adversity under a jazzyhip hop track.The track also features a priceless intro featuring Neneh 's young daughter , Tyson : - ) `` Twisted '' is a tightmidtempo track that highlights love 's many complications . `` Buddy X '' is a funky and catchy diss to Lenny Kravitz when Mr. K was going through his `` unfaithful '' days.But `` Somedays '' REALLYstands out for a very intresting reason.It has to be one of the first trip-hop cuts to emerge in the early '90s.Produced by Geoff Barrows who 'd later be a member of the trip hop unit Portishead , '' Somedays '' has the moodiness and dark undertones thattrip hop music would later be made of . `` Trout '' , featuring R.E.M . 's Michael Stipe is a sex education track that was really popular on alternative and college radiowhen `` Home Brew '' was originally released.Yet `` Home Brew '' 's last two track really make an impressive . `` Peace Of Mind '' and `` Red Paint '' are both atmospheric mood pieces.Both make you feel different after you listen to them . `` Red Paint '' in particular is REALLY powerful.A atmospheric songabout a man who is murdered cold bloodingly in the streets while bystanders just walk over his blood.This is actually a real life experience since Neneh 's mother , artist Moki Cherry , hada similar one.At the end of the song , sirens blare and Neneh gently sings `` Guided by the blue light/I 'm on my way home '' .It 's a real meaningful moment . `` Home Brew '' proves yet again that Ms. Neneh Cherry was simply TOO ahead of her time . `` Home Brew '' does n't sound anything like1992 ! It 's diverse and forward minded.Ironically , Neneh 's next album , '' Man '' would leave off where `` Home Brew '' left off.It was more song oriented and leaned VERY much into trip hop.That Neneh , you just do n't know what you 're going to get with her.And that 's the thing that keeps us fans coming back for more .	1
The eclectic Neneh Cherry hooked me with Buddy X years ago . She has a rough quality to her , a creative edge that makes her music both gritty and interesting . I recommend trying her as well as others like Cree Summer .	1
An album that definitely deserved more attention than it got . Cherry 's voice moves from flat speech tones to song and back at will , highlighting what is a real hybrid of styles . She comes across well . The album flows , and contains two masterpiece tracks - the blistering rock-influenced & quot ; Trout & quot ; ( a statement on sex education co-sung by R.E.M . frontman Michael Stipe ) and the hard-swinging & quot ; Ai n't Gone Under Yet & quot ; .	1
Bought because of Trout , `` Pusher Man '' lead in , every song is good , Peace in Mind , Sassy , Money Love , Move with Me , Ai n't Gone Under Yet , Somedays , Twisted , Red Paint . I 'm a music nut , worked at US Pioneer , '73-79 on high end stereo , at Hitachi Sales Corp. of America , would play music like this on my Hitachi CD-ROM drives with Audio play software I wrote as shareware , we introduced the first CD Audio Deck , late '83 , CD-ROM drives in '76 , often would play a disc in repeat all day , my software stored all the track names , like Jazz , Blues , soul , New Age , study music , programming music , was right to give Hitachi a CD audio push in Japan in '79 , was the right decision , discs sell hardsware . Get this disc , must have , 20years later still great ! Like Billie Holiday , Summertime , Nina Samone , Janis Joplin , Turtle Blues and Take Another Piece of my Heart , Prince Purple Rain , 1999 , Ohio Players , it holds up very well . Like the phrasing -bluepuma Enjoy ! too good	1
Many people had very high expectations for HOMEBREW , given how well her first CD ( the excelllent `` Raw Like Sushi '' ) did . Of course , she had two top 10 singles off that one ( `` Buffalo Stance '' and `` Kisses on the Wind '' ) . Unfortunately , her second CD did n't fare as well , which is a crime . I think that the main reason for its lack of success is also what makes this CD so great - it was years ahead of its time . Unlike the fairly straight-forward pop of her debut CD , the songs on HOMEBREW display a stunning amount of variety.BUDDY X is more rock-oriented , TROUT ( a deut with Michael Stipe ) is alt-rock ( and was minor modern rock hit ) , RED PAINT is a beautiful ballad , MONEY LOVE is urban R & B ; , and so on . It 's really difficult to accurately describe this CD because it is so diverse and sonically challenging . A few years after its release , a prominent entertainment magazine named HOMEBREW one of the 100 best CD 's of all time ; however , since that time the CD seems to have been scandalously overlooked . Fans of great music of any genre will likely enjoy this CD . Most highly recommended .	1
I bought this CD in 1992 , without hearing a note of it on the radio , and I 've not gone a week since then without giving it spin ! From the jazzy , hard hitting groove of & quot ; Sassy & quot ; ( in my book , her best song since & quot ; Manchild & quot ; ) you will be instantly addicted to this album . Of the many highlights , you can sink your teeth into the dance/hard rock of & quot ; Money Love & quot ; ( wicked guitars on the choruses ! ) the bumpa-licious smooth balladry of & quot ; Move With Me & quot ; ( great production courtesy of Lenny Kravitz ) and the shining moment of the album , & quot ; I Ai n't Gone Under Yet & quot ; , which was recorded in her living room at home ( dig her young daughter introducing the song , and mom begging to ' lem me just do this tune , I wo n't be but a minute ' , it 's priceless ! ) . The emotional intensity increases with each song culminating in the pair of powerhouse ballads that close the record , & quot ; Peace In Mind & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Red Paint & quot ; a song detailing a stabbing victim lying on the floor of a store , while passersby step over him , into his blood , and tracking it all over , yet not offering him any help . Neneh 's delivery , the almost vouyeristic nature of the lyrics , and the screaming sirens in the background make this almost-too painful-to-listen-to song the perfect closer , and a final blow to insensitive , careless people who are oblivious to the world around them ( a recurring theme on & quot ; Homebrew & quot ; ) . This is an underappreciated masterpiece that has n't aged a day since it 's release , and demands to be heard . Where are you Neneh ? We 're eagerly awaiting your return !	1
By most artist 's third albums , the artist is beginning to rehash old ideas & amp ; lose their inspiration . Others start to finally find their footing & amp ; discover their own sound , which is what happened to Lenny Kravitz . After his bitter divorce from Lisa Bonet , Lenny had to have been both angry & amp ; bitter about losing his chance at love as well as with his dissatisfaction with the world in general . This not only brought a more pronounced edginess in his music , but maybe intensified his search for his own identity , which finally started to happen on his third album 1993 's ARE YOU GON NA GO MY WAY ? . 1989 's LET LOVE RULE was firmly rooted in Beatles-derived psychedelia , while 1991 's MAMA SAID had him ever so slightly updating himself towards early '70s soul . ARE YOU GON NA GO MY WAY ? finds Lenny backtracking a little towards the late 1960s , but not staying there totally.The opening title track was indeed the biggest hit from this album , a piledriving tune that could have easily been a Cream outtake . But I dare you not to start banging your head to this 3 1/2-minute slice of blues-rock that is sure to get any party started . The retro-rock continues on & quot ; Come On & amp ; Love Me & quot ; ( which is more suited for the bedroom than the bar ) , & quot ; My Love & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Is There Any Love In Your Heart & quot ; ( probably a raspberry to Lisa Bonet ) , establishing Lenny 's main personality as a rocker.But the real focus of the album is old-school soul on songs like & quot ; Heaven Help & quot ; ( later covered by Angie Stone ) , the album 's second single & quot ; Believe & quot ; ( could have used some lyrical help , but still enjoyable ) , & quot ; Just Be A Woman & quot ; , & amp ; & quot ; Sugar & quot ; . With all that , the album 's biggest surprise is the reggae-tinged closer & quot ; Eleutheria & quot ; , which in spite of its esoteric title indicates that a Bob Marley influence may be another part of Lenny we have yet to see exploited further.ARE YOU GON NA GO MY WAY surely does show that Lenny Kravitz was starting to make his influences a part of him & amp ; not the opposite . Whether it was agony over his failed marriage to Lisa Bonet or the growing critical scorn against him , something gave Lenny a kick in the pants towards making better music . As a result , critics really did start seeing the light & amp ; fans began to see that there was more to Lenny Kravitz than a musician born about two decades too late . Furthermore , it resulted in Lenny 's best album to date , one that would n't be equaled until 2001 's LENNY .	1
... P > Lenny Kravitz has the amazing ability to take elements of 60s and 70s rock and make them sound completely modern . There is no Jimi Hendrix imitation on `` Are You Gon na Go My Way . '' Kravitz and his musicians have no aspirations of being Hendrix ... they KNOW there 's only one . Some of the songs are driving and loud , others are soft and sweet , and Heaven Help is simply gorgeous . I bought this album as soon as it came out in the spring of 1993 and it has traveled with me everywhere I 've gone . Whether I 'm on a plane , train , long car journey , I can pop in this CD and know that I 'll be entertained by an absolutely perfect rock album . They are truly few and far between , and this one is a masterpiece .	1
Already two albums into his career by the time this came out Lenny Kravitz showed no signs of slowing down one bit on this third album album . He was not only still a big hit but all the same he was showing signs of excellent career momentum by not taking half a decade to release albums . I have kind of avoided this album because for a long time I 've heard it promoted as Kravitz 's `` rock '' album ( as if all his albums are n't rock albums in a way ) and that it 's also his most imitative . Neither conception of the album is all that accurate . Considering the success baught to him by the excellentMama Saidthis album shares a lot in common with that one in terms of it 's musical breadth and ideas . The main difference is , whatever style Lenny is involving himself in at any moment is married to very strong hooks and carefully crafted songs . The title song is actually the first Lenny Kravitz song I remember hearing . It 's an okay song , very Hendrix influenced despite the fact Jimi did n't record a WHOLE lot of songs this fast ( he had a good many though actually ) but even so this song is not my favorite Lenny Kravitz song , or even a favorite on this album even though it was a big hit for him . Overall this album tends to be dominated by somewhat slower , psychedelic soul/rock tunes in the place of `` Believe '' , '' Come On And Love Me '' , '' Sister '' and `` Is There Any Love In Your Heart '' . Whatever else is said about Lenny Kravitz and how he handles his flower power era influences these tunes all exhibit a certain kind of reserved positivity about life in general that not only has him sounding pretty grounded personally but does show him beginning to put everything that 's inspired him musically into a style very much his . He does repeat a couple of tricks here from the previous album and does that pretty well here with the John Lennon send up of `` Just Be A Woman '' , a veryDouble Fantasy-type tune with some likeminded and great use of vocal reverb as well as on `` Sugar '' another and somewhat broader toned ( musically anyway ) string filled northern/Chicago soul song not too far removed from the sound ofIt Ai n't Over Til It 's Over . `` Heaven Help '' actually finds him cleverly appropriate a folk/blues/funk acoustic guitar type groove with something of a 3+3 Isley Brothers influence but here you find some of Lenny 's own influence too which makes it one of his more individual and soulful tunes . This album flows very well from one song to the other even though it encompasses a lot of styles and it did do Lenny a lot of good careerwise . Even though it 's not his first album this is not too bad a place in fact to begin getting into Lenny Kravitz 's music .	1
Maybe not so much now , but when this album came out Lenny was the man ! If `` 5 '' is n't his most popular album , this is . The title track and video was everywhere , rightly so . I like the first two albums a bit more , but this is still solid . `` Believe '' was another cool single , and I really think `` Heaven Help '' is a smooth song . No hits in the back of this album , but I still think it 's almost as strong as the first half . I think the following album Circus was good too , but this was so huge it made Circus seem like it failed . Anyway , groovy album man .	1
GREAT ALBUM FROM START TILLFINISH I HAVE NOTHING BAD TOSAY ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT.I REALLY DIDNT PAY LENNY ATTENTIONUNTIL ONE OF MY HAD HIS CD INTHEIR CD BOOKLET AND SAID LET ME BORROW THATCD AND SEE IF I LIKE IT OR NOT AND IT TURNEDOUT THAT I DID SO BROUGHT ALL HIS OTHER MATERIALWHICH IS EQUALLY ENJOYABLE AND EVERY SINCE I 'VE BEENINGJAMMING TO HIS ALBUM .	1
The only other album besides his previous MS that will stand tests of time . Slightly more consistent than before ( keeping material solid the whole way through seems to be a problem for him ) although perhaps lacking more of his best compositions , it is argued as the consummate classic rock borrower 's finest assimilation .	1
I think Are You Gon na Go My Way ( AYGGMW ) marked the turning point in Lenny 's career . That point where he began to be taken seriously . I 'm reviewing this cd because I feel that it , like his other four cds , is a classic recording . The hits & quot ; Are You Gon na Go My Way & quot ; and & quot ; Believe & quot ; are here plus great non-hits like & quot ; Eleutheria & quot ; , & quot ; Come On And Love Me & quot ; , & quot ; Heaven Help & quot ; and & quot ; Just Be A Woman. & quot ; While AYGGMW may not be Lenny 's most experimental recording , it is a rock and soul album that should find its way into your rock collection . A must have for any rock collector .	1
I enjoyed his stuff is great to listen to . this is for any fan of his and his albums and b sides .	1
In the mid 1990s , I heard a concert promotion radio ad that was basically introducing the performer to be `` The World 's Greatest Rock and Roll Star '' . When they announced that star to be Lenny Kravitz , I must admit , I nearly drove off the road when I heard that . I had realized Kravitz had some commercial success and had a nice following , but `` World 's Greatest Rock and Roll Star '' ? - come on ! However , now about a decade later , as I have begun to get a deeper appreciation for what Rock music has to offer , I now realize that perhaps there is some real merit to that radio ad . I 'm still not ready to put Kravitz up there with the upper echelon of Rock with the Paul McCartneys , the Rolling Stones , Bruce Springsteens , or even Billy Joels - however , it is safe to say that Kravitz could easily be one of the great revelations of the 1990s . Kravitz established his potential on his debut album , `` Let Love Rule '' . On that album Kravitz utilized the `` Minneapolis Sound '' ( similar to the style made famous by Prince ) by incorporating a mix of Funk and Rock . By 1993 , Kravitz was soon expanding his sound and his third album `` Are You Gon na Go My Way '' would help to take things to the next level . Kravitz also integrates his personal life experiences into this album.Many have said that this album provides an `` edge '' - much of this probably resulting from his failed marriage to Lisa Bonet . While I can see this , ultimately I feel that this album actually shows more of Kravitz 's development as an artist as opposed to anger.Here is a song by song synopsis of the collection : '' Are You Gon na Go My Way '' : This song is all about Kravitz 's guitar work as it is going to set a high level of intensity . However the percussion blends perfectly here as well . One underrated fact of this song is how Kravitz uses the spoken word `` What I really want to know is ... '' right before the title of the song is sung `` Are You Gon na Go My Way '' . `` Believe '' : On this track , Kravitz extends his sound by introducing some an Indian sounding melody to open the track . However , I find the whole way Kravitz incorporates an orchestral sound with strings and horns an even stronger sign how he has grown as an artist . `` Come on and Love Me '' : The percussion and bass really set the pace for this tone . Kravitz perfectly layers his guitar work on this track . Some can argue this has a retro feel , but I think this is a case where retro can be considered modern . `` Heaven Help '' : Piano work is going to be the story here as it provides a retro styled R & B ; melody to it . Another great point is how Kravitz demonstrates terrific vocal ranges here . Kravitz 's words `` I 'm ready for love '' are indicative of some of his post-divorce feelings following his failed marriage . `` Just Be a Woman '' : On this track , Kravitz now effectively utilizes the acoustic guitar combined with some terrific string arrangements . This song is probably reflective on Kravitz 's failed marriage as he says `` You ask me ... how can I make it right ? `` `` Is There Any Love in Your Heart '' : Kravitz turns up the intensity with another hard-rocking sound here . While the title track has always gotten the attention , this track often gets overlooked . More reflections on his failed marriage surface here - not just in the song title , but in the lyrics such as `` Your whole life is a fantasy and I 'm playing the clown '' . There is a terrific guitar bridge about 2/3 of the way into the song . `` Black Girl '' : This song has another R & B ; feel to it . On the verses , the guitars are electric , but they take more of a complementary role to Kravitz 's vocals . On this song I suddenly realized something about Lenny Kravitz , he has his own version of a falsetto . It is n't a Barry Gibb falsetto , but nonetheless it is a falsetto that can be effectively used . I also like how Kravitz `` switches '' gears about 2/5 into the song in terms of the rhythm of the song . There is another great guitar bridge on this song . `` My Love '' : This song goes all back to the guitar . In fact , this song almost has a stripped-down guitar feel to it . Possibly this goes back to more of Kravitz 's feelings about his failed marriage as he uses this song to describe `` his love '' . `` Sugar '' : This song also has a retro-styled 1970s R & B ; feel to it . I like how Kravitz mixes up his vocal ranges on this track . On this track I feel the String and horn arrangements also help build to the appeal of this song . `` Sister '' : This is the most underrated track on the collection and demonstrates how Kravitz has completed himself as an artist . The song opens with some terrific acoustic guitars . This is followed up by some electric guitars that `` fold '' into the melody beautifully . Finally some outstanding string arrangements are also layered on top of things . One of the great guitar solos in Kravitz 's work is demonstrated on the middle of this track . While the guitar work is great , it ultimately is Kravtiz 's passionate vocals that really hit home - particularly on the line `` If they knock on your door ... '' '' Eleutheria '' : Very simply , this is a reggae-like track by Kravitz . While this was n't my favorite track on the collection , it still demonstrates that Kravitz is not a one dimensional artist . It still is a track worth checking out.The liner notes to this collection contain all of the lyrics as well as the musician credits . Overall , I think this is the album that really solidified Kravitz 's status as an artist . This is truly the kind of `` third album '' I would expect from an artist on the rise . This is not only a collection Kravitz fans will enjoy , but great material for new fans to check out .	1
to me this is his best album and where he was making a statement . the title track alone made him appear to be on to bigger and Brighter things . musically he continued what he had started on his first couple of albums and just fleshed it out more . he always wore his Influences and Heroes on his sleeves left and right , however he was on point with this album . this set has rare outtakes and interview and other rare things on it . his music Collaborator Craig Ross held it down on guitar and Cindy Blackmon threw down on drums . back then Lenny had a tough band behind him . he started to find a groove on this album and while his 5th album blew him up , to me this is his best album and to me he never reached those heights of where he was going quite again , however this album worked real good for him as a Artist .	1
Are You Gon na Go My Way firmly established Lenny Kravitz as a major rock star . With the alt-rock scene at its peak in 1993 , Mr. Kravitz 's straight ahead rock sound stood out from the crowd . Although he has been criticized for mimicking the sounds of artists like The Beatles , Sly Stone , Led Zeppelin and others , he plays his music with reverence towards his influences . He takes those sounds and makes them his own . The title track opens the album up and it is a cacophony of wicked guitar riffs , sledgehammer drums , pulsating bass and powerhouse vocals . A truly great rock song . & quot ; Believe & quot ; is an airy , mystical number while & quot ; Black Girl & quot ; is a funky come on . & quot ; Sugar & quot ; is a stellar track as & quot ; Just Be A Woman & quot ; . Are You Gon na Go My Way is a top notch effort .	1
I picked up this album in college . I am not been disappointed with Lenny Kravitz yet . He writes hard hitting great rock songs , period . His ballads are straight from the heart . True emotion is obvious throughout this CD . Any rock fan will love this album and become an admirer of Lenny Kravitz .	1
Are you gon na go my way was to me the album in which Lenny Kravitz finally came into his own . Before this it seemed as thhough he was trying to hard to be like his influences . Which is n't all bad except you really did n't get a the entire picture as to who Leny Kravitz is . Was he trying to be a modern day Jimi Hendrix , John Lennon or Curtis Mayfield or even Bob Marley . I also think he took himself a little to seriously at times before this album But on AYGGMY you really can see where he really started to come into his own musically . I mentioned the above names as influences that I picked out from listening to this cd . The difference is that on AYGGMY Lenny seems more confident in his own talents and only allows the influences to guide him musically instead of trying to copy them . The title track is simply a good ol ' fashioned fun rock song . It simply rocks and knows it . It 's loud and arrogant . It screams to be turned up to a high volume . Very hendrix-like circa are you experienced . Suprisingly AYGGMY is musically funky cuts like come on love me , black girl and sugar sound like they could 've been done by Curtis Mayfield . The ballads ; believe , Heaven help me and sister are suprisingly very well written and very good songs that have meaning to them . Even the last track eleutheria which sounds like a reggae experiment works . Overall AYGGMY is a great rock/funk album . it works because Lenny Kravitz finally lets loose and controls ihis musical influences instead of letting them control him .	1
I think when this album was made , the band was trying to follow the trend of popular alternative music at the time . the track `` Barrel of a gun '' barely resembles the band 's sound if it 's recognizable at all . I do n't like `` Barrel.. '' but there are some awesome songs such as the experimental `` Freestate '' , which reminds me of spain for some unknown reason and `` Sister of Night '' is a wonderful ballad that is deeply felt . It 's apparent that this album was made to try to attract a more alternative crowd but the cd has something to please everyone.At a glance : Best song : ( Tough one this time ... ) ... FreestateLeast favorite : Barrel of a GunOverall:1 . Barrel of a Gun : It 's obvious that DM was trying a bit too hard to win the hard core , alternative audience with this one . Too bad it just does n't fit into the album very well ; which is good because if the album totally sounded like this , it would 've been very very bad 4/10.2 . The love thieves : Soft , a bit sensual ( in my opinion ) , and thoughtful . This song is like an ' Exciter `` preview of what would follow this album . I like it . You will too if you like the softer DM ballads along side your basic DM sound 8/10.3 . Home : When Martin Gore takes the Mic , always know that it 's a ballad and it will either be sad or romantic or both . This is a little of both 8/10.4 . It 's no good : The very first DM song that I ever heard when I lusted over Dave in the music video . I was paying more attention to him than the song but I heard enough to inquire into the band 's music and the rest is history . Very modern for those who shy away from the 80 's sounding stuff 7/10.5.6 . Useless : An anrgy song that is a little reminissant of `` Barrel of a Gun '' but this one sounds better since Dave is actually singing and not taunting his words . A great song to put on when you 're in a bad mood and you feel like de-stressing without violence . Sing this one and I guarantee you 'll at least feel a tiny bit better if you 're mad at someone 6/10.7 . Sister of Night : One of the best songs on the album . Great beat , great imagery through lyrics , and the instruments used create beautiful sounds that remind me of `` waiting for the Night '' from Violator 8/10.8.9 . Freestate : A unique creation that reminds me of the color red and Spanish imagery . I would dance with a partner to this song in a red and black dress at a bull fight ( if that makes any sense ) .It 's slower than what I usually hold as criteria for a really great DM song and it is by far , a one-of-a kind , but it is strangely beautiful and surprisingly dancible 9/10.10 . The bottom Line : This has the most romantic lyrics of all the songs on the cd . I wish I had written this song ; it 's just so well written and beautiful but musicly , it tends to get old after listening to it a few times . Still , a good song , not great but good 6/10.11 . Insight : A nice ending song for this album . Lot 's of imagery on this album and this one reminds me of flying or `` taking off `` in life by making decisions that will alter it . It 's a nice change of pace after listening to `` The bottom Line '' ; which is also pretty slow ( notice a pattern here ? ) . One of the stronger songs on the album . Interesting extra instrumental track that comes far after this ... 8/10 .	1
Ultra was their first post Wilder album and whilst it is not as good as Exciter it is the most inspired work that DM had created for quite some time . Songs like home , sister of night and bottom line all show what Fletcher , Gore and Gahan are capeable alone and without the dominering attitude of Alan Wilder . It was also the first time that they had employed outside artists to play on their records and the end result is quite amazing . They needed new blood and the idea to have outside artists come in and help with the recording is a stroke of genius . Dave Gahans vocals are not as good as on Exciter but they are much better then on SOFAD . This is an awesome synth pop album that should not be missed .	1
Quite simply , this is one of the best albums ever made . You 'd have to be crazy to love Depeche Mode and not think this album is one of the pinnacles of their career . This album is as good in every way as Violator - if not better . There is n't one bad track . As with all their albums , there is such a plethora of moods and sounds throughout , yet it all contains a subtle dark quality that no one pulls off quite like DM . This has remained one of my favorite all-time CDs since its release . Three of the absolute best songs ever made appear here : & quot ; Home , & quot ; & quot ; Useless , & quot ; and the much underrated & quot ; Freestate. & quot ; & quot ; Home & quot ; is one of the most beautiful songs ever written , giving me tingles still today with its breathtaking chorus , and is Martin 's best vocal performance to date . & quot ; Useless & quot ; is just brilliant , with trippy synths , great guitar work , and great lyrics . & quot ; Freestate & quot ; is one of the most unique DM songs ever , using slide guitar , a sweeping intro that induces images of a lonely desert highway , a kickin ' electronic beat , and some of the best lyrics to ever grace a song ( I could almost swear it was written just for me ) . If you ca n't get past the lack of Alan Wilder or the goth look Dave was sporting during this album , then you truly are missing out on a true masterpiece . This album has helped me convert many many friends into DM fans . I could n't live without it .	1
Except for several hits , I was rather foreign to Depeche Mode . Strengthened by my dislike for techno music , I had never bothered to find out more about the band until I accidentally obtained a copy of `` Ultra . '' The song `` It 's No Good , '' with its upbeat rhythm and emotionally contradicted lyrics , possessed enough charm for me to give the album a try . To my tremendous surprise , after listening to `` Ultra '' a couple of times , I realized that I was hooked.Techno music had always been stereotyped by me as cold , inhuman , and mechanical . However , thanks to Martin Gore 's expertise , every song on `` Ultra '' is emotional and thought provoking . Although the band has gone through severe inner crises before the album was released , these calamities seem to have spurred remarkable depth in their creation . True , according to some reviewers , the album is somewhat schizophrenic : sometimes optimistic , other times dark and very depressing . Nonetheless , it amazes me that I can relate myself to most of the songs on the CD regardless of their diverse themes.The songs on `` Ultra '' are mostly subdued , especially on the later half of the album . `` Freestate '' and `` The Bottom Line , '' sung by Gahan and Gore respectively , are emotive and have glints of exotic feelings . `` Insight '' is a stunning duet featuring both Gahan and Gore and is eerily satisfying . Moreover , `` Home , '' the third single from the album , is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard . The background music , adorned by perhaps the guitar and strings , is remarkably captivating and creates the longing mood perfectly.Else , the more upbeat songs are no less dazzling . The first single , `` Barrel of a Gun '' is probably the only song here that I do not care much for , but it resembles the precursor of the blend of rock and rap which is commonplace in modern days . `` It 's No Good '' and `` Useless , '' both singles , are inspiring in their unique ways , despite the obscure lyrics . `` Sister of Night '' starts explosively but turns quieter when the vocals start ringing , and the setting of luscious desires really impresses me.The instrumental tracks actually invite some criticisms on the album . In my humble view , they serve fittingly as transitions `` Uselink , '' in particular , is pretty flashy as an interlude . The others are not as banal to me as some people commented , but perhaps my acceptance is due to insufficient understanding of the band . Not matter . `` Ultra '' definitely arouses my interest in listening to more of Depeche Mode 's recordings . If you used to loathe techno as I did , this album will certainly make you take on a new look of the genre .	1
Depeche Mode went through a dangerous period after their 1993 epic , & # 65533 ; Songs Of Faith & Devotion & # 65533 ; . First , David Gahan , their lead singer nearly died of a heroin overdose in 1996 but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the band . The other blow to the group was the departure of Alan Wilder . Despite the calamities , Depeche Mode returned in 1997 with their ninth studio album and their first as a trio and & # 65533 ; Ultra & # 65533 ; doesn & # 65533 ; t disappoint one bit . In fact this album surpassed all of my expectations.Dark , frightening , eerie , and mature are the words to describe the mood of this album . The blurry black , purple and white colors in the background perfect suit the overall mood of the CD . The black and dark purple portray the darkness of the lyrics , and of the music . The lighter colors portray the sense of hope , redemption , recovery , and moving forward after near demise . These are just how I see them . This album makes me think of running through a severe rainstorm and embracing it & # 65533 ; s darkness and intensity . That & # 65533 ; s how I describe the albums mood.This album is a departure from the heavily guitar driven style of & # 65533 ; Songs Of Faith & Devotion & # 65533 ; and more of a return to the keyboard based pop of their signature but maintaining some of the SOFAD elements . Overall though , this album has a completely different mood from SOFAD or Violator or the ones before them . Depeche once again morphed their style and for me , I like change even though a small part of me yearns for a Black Celebration Part II . This album is definitely an & # 65533 ; ULTRA & # 65533 ; masterpiece . There & # 65533 ; s some sense of joy and happiness meshed in with the angry , depressed atmosphere of the songs . This album is in my opinion , the extreme opposite of & # 65533 ; Speak & Spell & # 65533 ; . Every song on this essential CD is at least a 4 and a half but & # 65533 ; Home & # 65533 ; , & # 65533 ; It & # 65533 ; s No Good & # 65533 ; , & # 65533 ; Freestate & # 65533 ; , and & # 65533 ; Insight & # 65533 ; are by far the best on this CD with & # 65533 ; Insight & # 65533 ; being the best of all . There & # 65533 ; s plenty to find in every song on this album. & # 65533 ; Barrel Of A Gun & # 65533 ; starts things off with a guitar-driven , and menacing song that SOFAD fans will more than likely enjoy . This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track at times . & # 65533 ; The Love Thieves & # 65533 ; is a jazzier , and trippier song that foreshadows the lighter direction that the group would take on their next album four years later . I like this songs odd chord structure . & # 65533 ; Home & # 65533 ; starts with a somewhat scary melody and a screeching sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming in the distance . It starts as a dark , and disturbing song with a dark and eerie mood and becomes a warm , orchestral song . I love the climax with the rock guitars and the orchestras coming together at the climax . Martin Gore has never sounded better on this track in his entire career . & # 65533 ; It & # 65533 ; s No Good & # 65533 ; radiates with its pulsating bass , and punching beats . This song from perspective is about how searching for love is just in vain & # 65533 ; Don & # 65533 ; t say you love me , cause it & # 65533 ; s no good & # 65533 ; . & # 65533 ; Uselink & # 65533 ; is a cute electronic instrumental . & # 65533 ; Useless & # 65533 ; is a definite SOFAD-esque song with a somewhat of a Soundgarden-esque sound . This song reminds me somewhat of & # 65533 ; Black Hole Sun & # 65533 ; from years ago . Great song . & # 65533 ; Sister Of Night & # 65533 ; is a beautiful and textural song with a bitter and dark mood . I like the strange guitar , or keyboard sound effects . & # 65533 ; Jazz Thieves & # 65533 ; is another cute and instrumental . We then head into one of my favorite tracks on the CD & # 65533 ; Freestate & # 65533 ; . This song is one of the best songs of Depeche Mode & # 65533 ; s career . It starts off with a dark and eerie melody and some gorgeous 12 string guitars and becomes an intense and brooding song with rumbling beats and keyboards that remind of & # 65533 ; Enjoy The Silence & # 65533 ; from & # 65533 ; Violator & # 65533 ; . When I play this song , I can imagine myself tangoing with a woman dressed in black in a severe thunderstorm on an open city plaza . ; - ) The ending is really cool too . I wished that this song would & # 65533 ; ve been released as a single . & # 65533 ; The Bottom Line & # 65533 ; is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood . The closing track & # 65533 ; Insight & # 65533 ; is by far my favorite song on this CD . It starts as an ominous electronic number with a dark black & white mood , and then becomes an uplifting electronic Gospel influenced song with a sense of hope and looking towards the future . Wait and minute , it & # 65533 ; s not the closer . The real closer on this CD is actually a hidden track called & # 65533 ; Junior Painkiller & # 65533 ; . This short instrumental is an odd and bizarre song . It & # 65533 ; s a great song but & # 65533 ; Insight & # 65533 ; should & # 65533 ; ve been the closer . This is a good instrumental nonetheless. & # 65533 ; Ultra & # 65533 ; was a vital outing for DM , not only because it was great but because it showed that even with Wilder & # 65533 ; s absence , they could still crank out the good songs . While I enjoy & # 65533 ; Exciter & # 65533 ; a lot , & # 65533 ; Ultra & # 65533 ; in my opinion a sense of edge , heaviness , the darkness , and a bit of fright , that I feel was missing from the 2001 release . For me , Depeche Mode shines when they make dark , frightening , electronically intense songs than simply mellow , joyous songs but maybe it & # 65533 ; s just because I embrace dark music.Alan Wilder & # 65533 ; s departure could & # 65533 ; ve spelled the end of Depeche Mode or if they carried on , they could & # 65533 ; ve used every excuse to put out a dud of an album or even disbanded . Instead the threesome readjusted to their status as a trio , carried on and put out a masterpiece .	1
Ultra is simply an amazing collection of well crafted and produced songs written by Martin Gore , and NOT produced/mixed/remixed by Alan Wilder . A fascinating first since the departure of Wilder . Someday , I 'll update this review and give a track by track assessment . But for now , do n't even question it ... just buy it ! You wo n't regret it ! 1 . Barrel of a Gun : This is the very first song I heard from Ultra , prior to the single 's release in '97 . This song really sounds like it was leftover from SOFAD ... and I thought ALL of Ultra was going to sound similar . But it 's the only song on the album ( to me ) that sounds a little out-of-place . But in retro-spect , Ultra wouldnt be the same without it . Has kind of a rock/bluesy groove , much like `` I Feel You '' . A nice rockin ' song.2 . Love Thieves : Some people think this is a melloncollie/sad tune ... but to me , it 's very uplifting in spirit . The combination of punchy/crisp percussion , mellow-toned guitars , and unusually soft vocals from Dave sets this apart from anything they 've done previously . This was very refreshing to hear for the first time , and still is to this day .	1
Depeche Mode nearly fell apart after the gargantuan Devotional tour was finally completed . Dave Gahan was clinically dead for a few minutes and Alan Wilder had left to pursue his own project , Recoil . Once Martin , Dave , and Andy resurfaced to take a stab in the recording studio , their goal was not to make another Violator ; it was just to put down a few tracks and nurture the band back to health . It was n't time for another party album followed by another exhausting tour . It was time to just heal by doing something low-key and taking it easy for a while . And that 's why Ultra sounds the way it sounds.With this perspective in mind , Ultra is as good an album as we could have expected from Depeche Mode in 1997 , and is in some ways pleasantly surprising . The first single , `` Barrel of a Gun , '' is actually nothing like the rest of the album . It 's got a beat like an automated stapler and a funky guitar riff pulled from hell 's own orchestra . Not DM 's best song by any means , but it 's catchy and it hits hard . Other aggro offerings include : `` Useless , '' a very moody , bluesy , beat-up number well-suited to Dave 's post-recovery voice ; and `` It 's No Good , '' which might just be the greatest stalker anthem of all time ( perhaps second only to The Police 's `` Every Breath You Take '' ) . I was shocked to hear an ex-girlfriend 's younger sister and her friends singing along when I played `` It 's No Good '' in the car , but I guess this is just evidence that DM are not dead yet.The remaining tracks are much more subdued and introspective in nature . Many of the songs on Ultra deal with Dave 's drug problems , but `` Sister of Night '' probably handles the issue with the most heart and sensitivity . `` Freestate '' is a mellow , optimistic song with a closing guitar solo reminiscent of The Cure . This song and its kin `` Insight '' are the most upbeat songs DM had written in over a decade ; perhaps you can only be a sad sallow goth for a finite amount of time . `` The Love Thieves '' is the most narrative song on the album , depicting the kind of woman with more followers than she can count . A song rich both in wisdom derived from experience and in sympathy for the smitten . Finally , Martin 's vocal performances in `` Home '' and `` The Bottom Line '' stand shoulder to shoulder with anything he 's done in the past , yet keep in line with the mature , languid feel of the album as a whole.Ultra is not an album that even a DM fan will instantly love . It takes some time to win the listener over . That Depeche Mode actually managed to put together an album at this stage of their career is miraculous enough ; that they managed to put together a different yet GOOD album is just gravy on top of that . Four stars for an album that is not the best in the DM library , but still gets better with age .	1
Seriously . Just crank that puppy , and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living , and to the way it glides from DM 's trademark minor key into major and back again , and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.It clearly was n't , of course . These guys ( now minus Alan Wilder ) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy , cathartic , and occasionally quite moving . I 'd rank it right up there with _Violator_ , _Black Celebration_ , and ( if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite ) Mesh 's _Who Watches Over Me ? _ among the best albums ever released within its genre .	1
& quot ; Ultra & quot ; is the difficult album that Depeche Mode made after the drug-addiction period that lead singer Dave Gahan went through and the absence of former band member Alan Wilder . Despite the changes that the band suffered , this is still a great return and a very worthwile record , focusing the group in an exciting creative moment. & quot ; Ultra & quot ; has a dark , contemplative , nocturne feel to it , presenting deep and complex songs that may take awhile to get into . Gahan ` s vocals are better than ever , the electronic elements are contemporany without being too edgy and are not used in a way that makes them the dominant component of the songs . Most of the moments here are obscure and atmospheric ballads with powerful , creative songwriting and mature lyrics . The singles & quot ; Home & quot ; , & quot ; Barrel of a Gun & quot ; and & quot ; Useless & quot ; are three of the best pieces of the album , an example of the band ` s strenght and genious . All in all , this is one of Depeche Mode ` s best records , and that is saying a lot . Impressive and addictive .	1
As far as pop music is concerned , Depeche Mode is one of my favotites ( The Pet Shop Boys is my other favorite ) . Ever since Black Celebration ( i am not a big fan of their earlier material ) they have been creating great songs with memorable music and good , at times very dark lyrics . Although many songs on this CD have a sad tone , most of them have positive themes like hope , love , and gratitude . Occasional touches of electronica are nice too .	1
I had never heard of Depeche Mode before & quot ; It 's No Good & quot ; was released . At first , i felt that David Gahan was a Bono look-alike , and his voice just sounded like every other brit-pop star . After awhile I decided to listen to the whole album . I fell in love with the dark yet danceable sound of & quot ; Barrel of a gun & quot ; and the gothic sounds of & quot ; The Love Thieves & quot ; and & quot ; Sister of Night. & quot ; & quot ; Freestate & quot ; is an exceptional track , but the whole album could really kick Robert Smith 's ass ( though I am a big-time Cure fan too ) . Put simply , this is Depeche Mode at their best .	1
Since first hearing Violator last year , I 've purchased several DM albums but always concluded that Violator was their best , along with their earlier pre-Black Celebration material . I held off buying & quot ; Ultra & quot ; thinking I 'd be disappointed with the direction they 'd taken their music in . However , upon seeing it going cheap in a bargain bin , I had to get it just to see what it was like , fully expecting to hate it . To my surprise , I did n't hate it . . .I loved it . As with Violator , I had to listen a few times to really appreciate all the songs , but after doing so I 'd have to say this ranks right up there with Violator . & quot ; Home & quot ; is the best cut , followed closely by & quot ; The Bottom Line & quot ; and & quot ; Insight & quot ; . The singles , & quot ; Barrel of a Gun & quot ; and & quot ; It 's No Good & quot ; are next best . The rest of the songs fill out the album , but I feel if any of them were removed it would detract from the listening experience.If you 're still stuck in DM 's past as I was , give & quot ; Ultra & quot ; a listen and instead of looking back , you 'll be looking forward to their next album .	1
very overlooked album ! Hardcore fans may not like it ... they lost one of their band members and it sounds somewhat commercial at times and different than their past stuff ... but I love it ! It still has a DM feel to it.Barrel of a Gun is perhaps the most experimental ... .you 'll think & quot ; wait..is this DM I 'm listening to ? & quot ; Home is simply beautiful and breath taking ... Its No Good is great and catchy ... and from there , every track is fantastic ... be sure and check out Freestate ... another beauty ... this may not be a sure fire classic like Violator ... .but its a great disc if your very familiar with the band .	1
A very dark album , even by DM standards . Recorded after Alan Wilder 's departure , the record is soaked in cavernous bass synthetics and aggressive percussion . The 2nd half of the disc is a brooding suite that finally resolves itself in the gospel-tinged ending of `` Insight '' , a welcome relief after a long but compelling section of dark Euro-pop . Not their most accessible LP , but definitely worth the journey .	1
I 'll admit that I hated this when it first came out . In fact , I hated it for many years . I hated it until Playing the Angel came out and I was able to put this release in context . I suppose Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion are to blame . Ultra is a lot like the cigarette after sex . The excitement was over after Songs of Faith and Devotion . Wow , those are a couple of intense albums . It 's easy to dismiss Ultra as the also-ran for Depeche Mode.The fact is , though , that after listening to this again and again , something occurs to you . Depeche Mode had moved on and perhaps you had n't yet . It 's hard to let go of the past , especially with music . We tend to want to cement ourselves into an era that we truly enjoyed . That does n't mean that we should dismiss the future . After Alan Wilder 's departure and Dave 's well documented battle with drugs , Depeche Mode got themselves back up and moved on . This album proves that they had what it takes to provide music that matters.When I first heard Barrel of a gun , my reaction was `` Cool . This album is going to continue where SoFaD left off '' . I was then sadly disappointed when I found it was the only track that had that edgy , angst-ridden feel to it . The rest just bored me . Since then I 've come to appreciate Ultra for what it is . Depeche Mode had continued to reinvent themselves.There are several interesting pieces that prove DM 's continued relevance . Check out Home , It 's No Good , Useless and The Bottom Line for some Depeche Mode that could easily be called as classic as tunes like Halo , Sometimes , and the others we all love.I ca n't bring myself to give this album the five stars that so many others have . It 's certainly not their best work , but it is DM and so far , that 's more than enough.If you 're a casual fan or somebody who is interested in getting their feet wet , I 'd recommend Violator , Black Celebration , or perhaps Some Great Reward for some older material . However , anyone who considers themselves a fan should most definitely own Ultra .	1
It seems after all these years , DM is finally comfortable . That is what this CD conveys . There are n't many tracks that would pack a club floor . The mix is phat but minimal , almost stark . The campiness is gone . They have progressed from the old school analog synths , to more rich , complex , and deep sounds and percussion , fusing it all together with soothing vocals and harmonies . Growth . Experience . Life . These are the ingredients of Ultra.My favorites : & quot ; Barrel Of A Gun & quot ; / & quot ; The Love Thieves & quot ; / & quot ; Home & quot ; / & quot ; It 's No Good & quot ; / & quot ; Useless & quot ; / & quot ; Sister Of Night & quot ; / & quot ; The Bottom Line & quot ; / & quot ; Insight. & quot ; Other cool bands : De/Vision , Distain ! , Agnes Poetry , Iris .	1
After a long four year gap , depeche mode comes out with violator . The album sounds great showing that the band can still play well . There are great tracks like it 's no good , uselink and useless . Violator really shows how well the band has matured to this date .	1
Long before this album appeared in april 1997 , I had the Depeche Mode fever . I felt something great was going to happen , especially after hearing Barrel of a Gun . When it finally came out , the album turned out to be even better than expected . It still is getting better and better , after two years . I love all the songs . Personal favourites are beside & quot ; barrel of a gun & quot ; & quot ; sister of night & quot ; and & quot ; the bottom line & quot ; , but my opinion changes all the time . One period I am convinced & quot ; Insight & quot ; is the best track , the next I think it 's & quot ; It 's no good & quot ; etc . Now I would say it 's & quot ; Sister of night & quot ; . Black celebration is my second favourite album . It 's unbelievable that some peope prefere older stuff like from the Speak and Spell and Broken Frame period over this stuff . Those people have n't grown along with the band . This is serious stuff .	1
As Alan Wilder left the band after the making of SOFAD , DM was never the same again . Alan 's musical talent was truly felt after the release of ULTRA . All the great dark , punctual synth sounds that we all have come to love was suddently not there anymore . Although , I like this album alot , especially more than the later release EXCITER , it still didnt appeal to me as it should . I love the sad , dark , and soft side of DM , but hoped for a few more songs like the old DM . Martin does a great job in performing `` home '' and the symphony in the background was a great idea . I enjoyed `` its no good '' as is the only song that resembles the old DM sound that we all fell in love with . There are other great songs like `` sisters of night '' , `` freestate '' and `` bottom line '' that are full of sad , dark lyrics that only martin Gore can write . Dave does a great job on vocals and although I am not too sure about the new sound they have created , it is a great album altogather.This album is DM 's maturity at its peak but without Alan Wilder 's musical talent , as they didnt quiet acheive what I had expected from one of my all time favorate bands .	1
After many years away from the music scene Depeche Mode have come back with probably the best album so far . Ultra combines a huge variety of different songs which should pleases all of the fans . Ultra contains the hit singles Barrel Of A Gun , Home , Useless and Its No Good . ( y Favourite ) Ultra is the type of album that every fan should have as it shows us what we have been missing and longing for all this years	1
This is Depeche Mode doing what they do well , writing dark , brooding and hypnotic songs . Much more in the vein of `` Violator '' and far removed from the lackluster `` Exciter . '' When this CD goes in the player it usually stays there for several days and is played over and over and over .	1
It 's something of a miracle that Depeche Mode 's 1997 album even saw the light of day . Since their misguided 1993 release `` Songs of Faith of Devotion , '' the group lost key musician Alan Wilder , and singer David Gahan had a very public meltdown and battle with drugs . Impressively , Gahan was able to clean up his act and reunite with Martin Gore and David Fletcher for `` Ultra , '' which finds the Mode returning to their synth roots after they tried ( and failed ) to be a rock band on `` Songs of Faith and Devotion . '' Yeah , guitars pop up here and there , but this is an electronic album all the way . The album 's best cut is easily the single `` It 's No Good , '' which features rubbery , agressive bass set to Gahan 's trademark moan . `` Useless '' has funky drums , abrasive guitars , and bleeping synths . A favorite track , `` Sister of Night , '' is a near-ambient gem that radiates in its quiet beauty . Gore has n't lost his touch as a songwriter , and he comes up with lyrics that reflect Gahan 's personal tribulations in the single `` Barrel of a Gun , '' which vaguely refers to his battle with drugs . `` Ultra '' is n't one of my very favorite Depeche Mode albums , but it 's an impressive return to the spotlight considering the hurdles this trio faced during its making .	1
This album seems like an album people both love and hate . For me , I am closer to the love side , but then again , it 's DM , and some of these tracks make the album more than worth owning . Martin sometimes sings on some of the weaker tracks , but not on this album . His two tracks are some of the strongest on the album . The only thing that brings the album down a little bit is that the instrumentals do n't really do much , even the closing ( unlisted ) `` Junior Painkiller . '' It has my favorite DM song , `` Freestate , '' which has this kind of worldly and trippy feel , and shows a great maturity of the band . I think I prefer `` Violator '' and `` Songs of Faith and Devotion '' , but as it stands , those are my two favorite DM albums ( but I also like a few others more ) . While it may not have the kind of lively energy that made everything from `` Black Celebration '' to `` Songs '' great , it works perfectly fine on this record . Some mourn the loss of Alan , but for me , this group never put anything bad , and while I feel he is what turned DM into a great band , I would n't disregard everything else in particular . Totally worth a listen .	1
It is almost impossible to listen to the title track of this masterpiece without thinking of the cubist paintings of Braque , Picasso , and Duchamp . In the same way these fearless innovators tried to deconstruct painting into primary elements and start from scratch , Monk seems to be breaking the musical language into fragments and pasting it back together . But painters work alone . Monk had to make his revolutionary vision comprehensible to fellow players , accounting for the twelve takes required to get the title composition on tape and the observation by one sound engineer that , `` After working with Monk I 'll never be afraid of anything ever again . `` A jazz milestone , Brilliant Corners is celebrating its 50th birthday this year . The album was given to me as a gift a few years after being released and even after repeated playing I truly had no idea of what the heck I was hearing . What 's so strange is that it still sounds `` modern '' and abstract today , off-kilter , cattywhumpus , and a bit otherworldly . The 20bit re-mastering is glorious and offers a glistening precision my old Riverside LP never had , that much is certain.Not only has Sonny Rollins never sounded better , he must be given special consideration for walking into Monk 's world and making sense of it . Known for angularity and disjointed construction , Monk can also be one of the most emotionally compelling of composers and players . This is abundantly in evidence on Pannonica , an original composition , and on the standard , I Surrender , Dear , which is unrecognizable by the time Monk is through with it . ( Solo Monk interpreting standards is three degrees away from heaven , there are many examples scattered throughout his body of work . ) Bemsha Swing returns the tone home to the `` expect-the-unexpected '' style we met in the introductory bars . Max Roach , who performs the Herculean chore of providing a rhythmic bed for Monk 's creations throughout , really shines here , demonstrating that he too is comfortable throwing in accents precisely where you would never expect them and right where they satisfy most . Because this CD is such a lasting jewel in the history of jazz , purchasing this technically superior version is recommended .	1
The title track is a perfect Monk-style masterpiece ... edgy , dynamic , and captivating . It 's obviously a difficult song to play , but I 'm glad Monk had the patience to do it . & quot ; Bolivar & quot ; is a stately blues , and & quot ; Pannonica & quot ; is another catchy blues . & quot ; I Surrender & quot ; is a Monk solo song , and the 20-bit recording sounds great . & quot ; Bemsha Swing & quot ; is the liveliest of the group , with Max Roach 's tympanis providing the swing . Sonny Rollins plays sax on this , and is of course superb .	1
There are enough rave reviews on this classic disc to warrant Monk and jazz fans to buy it when you have Monk 's co-horts include players of the caliber of Sonny Rollins , Max Roach , Clark Terry , Oscar Pettiford , Paul Chambers , etc . The only complaint I have is that this CD lists that this session was in Stereo , which it plainly is not~	1
For all intents and purposes , this is Monk 's debut album as a leader : he had issued several 78s and an album of Ellington covers under his own name beforehand , but this was his first recording of all originals . Even for Monk , this is some weird stuff , especially `` Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are '' ( or just `` Bolivar Blues '' , as it was later retitled ) - it 's amazing how he twists a genre as familiar as blues to sound totally foreign , thanks to his bizarre melody . Always the compositional virtuoso , Monk threw a curveball at everyone with the winding title track , which was too hard for any of the musicians in question : it was composed by splicing several takes together . There 's also an odd beauty on the rarely heard `` Pannonica '' , where Monk plays a Celeste . A couple of these tracks became classics , such as the joyful `` Bemsha Swing '' ( which I believe was held over from the Blue Note years ) and `` Bolivar Blues '' . The only weak track is a dry recording of the boring chestnut `` I Surrender Dear '' - for whatever reason , I 've never been into Monk 's solo piano recordings , even though he 's a great piano player . Why ? I have no clue . I 'm just weird like that , okay ?	1
This along with `` Criss-Cross '' have been roundly acknowledged as among the best the Monk has ever done . Considering he had recorded dozens of albums , that 's no small praise either . This version of the classic album is a work of art in itself . The mini-lp sleeve replica is very well done and it reproduces very faithfully the cover art on the original lp release . In addition , all the tracks have been very well digitally remastered so that the sound quality is really very , very good . This is by far the best version of this album that is currently out there.Recommended for all fans of Monk and of great jazz in general .	1
& quot ; Brilliant Corners & quot ; was the first Monk recording I ever heard . It 's a bizarre composition , like a huge , lumbering elephant who had a bit too much to drink and is let loose in a skating rink . The behemoth rolls around clumsily , falling down , getting up , banging into the walls , you get the idea . When I heard it , I was hooked . Monk would n't have been able to pull it off without all-star accompanists ; Sonny Rollins contributes a great solo , and Max Roach 's drumming holds it all together . The other tunes are also wonderful , if a bit more normal : an eccentric blues ( Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are ) , a solo rendition of & quot ; I Surrender , Dear & quot ; , the beautiful ballad & quot ; Pannonica & quot ; ( where Monk doubles on celeste ) , and a bombastic interpretation of & quot ; Bemsha Swing & quot ; with Max Roach on tympani . This is an essential jazz classic and one of Monk 's best in a band setting . Pick up this , Monk and Coltrane , and Monk 's Music and you will be sold on this great musician .	1
Lovely job by Doxy of a stone classic . Sonny Rollins is consistently sublime . I have n't heard the newer Waxtime , but this is as good as I could imagine .	1
This is one of those ominous recordings that manages to somehow steal the spotlight away from some of the more in depth work of the artist due to this album 's attempt at `` getting everything right '' . Do n't ask me to explain what that means , all I know is that there are many albums that achieve legendary status due to their pitch perfect recipe that delivers all of the prescribed ingrediants in the right order . Somehow that formula for sucess yielded many jazz classics , but overshadowed more personal , detailed work . This applies to most artists then , and as a general forwarning into gageing many composer 's true strengths when it comes to buying most recommended titles . They are often ideal first purchases when discovering someone , but usually misleading as well.This album itself is perhaps 1/2 dominated by the man of the hour , giving way to yes..some brilliant corners . There are some amazing musical concepts going on brought on undoubtedly by a total collaboration at times with some pretty free form plotting by all players . As exciting as some of the swingin tunes can be , the problem of overshadowing genius can not be remedied when tunes like `` I surrender Dear '' are played , the depth of that writing on display towers over the majority of the disc 's mood of playfullness . Nonetheless , this is one of his more popular albums for a reason , each track on this album has stood the test of time and will continue to represent such a special hybrid of piano induced , frenzied yet organized beauty in it 's 5 eclectic compositions that go everywhere from avant garde to ballad to bee bop to solo .	1

I do not need to add much to the reviews of the original album , it is a classic.Legendary Producer Orrin Keepnews has been honored with a collection of Remastered CD 's of the albums he has been associated with ; complete with liner notes . Since I am a more recent fan of Monk , this remastering gives me a reason to buy this highly regarded cd for the first time . The high reviews do not disappoint ... and my education of thelonius monk continues ! BTW - A second version of Pannonica is not a bad thing as far as im concerned . it is a great song !	1
Granted that this music is not ( never was intended to be ) easy listening ( you would n't want to play it on a romantic evening or on your way to work , if that 's what you 'd want a jazz album for ) , it 's not free jazz either , and therefore it is a lot easier to digest these days than it was when it girst came on in 1957.Now , Monk 's work is something you have to LISTEN to or you will miss what he 's there to share with you . Other jazz albums you can leave in the background and they will work just fine : I 've tried that with , say , David Brubeck , and it works well , but somehow , with Monk it does n't work : he demands your attention , and it seems if he ca n't `` have it '' it will almost become annoying to listen to.This was Thelonious Monk 's breakthrough album after ten years as a recording artist and it features the talents and original works of Monk alongside Sonny Rollins on tenor sax , Max Roach on drums ( an incidentally on timpani ) , Oscar Pettiford/Paul Chambers ( Miles Davis ) on bass , Ernie Henry on alto , and Clark Terry on trumpet for the closing track . These musicians were demanded by Monk in the album as much as you will when you are listening through this work , but get ready for a great musical ride ! No wonder Coltrane once said about him : `` I always had to be alert with [ him ] ... because if you did n't keep aware all the time of what was going on , you 'd suddenly feel as if you 'd stepped into an empty elevator shaft . ''	1
In 1956 , Thelonious Monk was still not widely known . Revered by musicians , his reputation with the public sat on a handful of compositions , a few sideman dates , a bunch of sides for Blue Note and a handful of albums . It was into this that he recorded on his best , 1956 's `` Brilliant Corners '' . His first album for Riverside to be by and large a feature for his compositions ( only `` I Surrender , Dear '' , a solo piano piece , is a standard , and you would n't know it by listening ) recorded with a supportive band , this is Monk beginning to peak , and it shows.One thing that 's pretty clear throughout the album is many of the things that make Monk 's music what it is -- the fractured rhythms , the bizarre harmonies , that dry swing he mastered . Even the standard he performs is totally enveloped in his sound and concept . The first three cuts feature a band with reedmen Ernie Henry ( alto ) and Sonny Rollins ( tenor ) , bassist Oscar Pettiford , and drummer Max Roach . From opener `` Brilliant Corners '' , you can see the music is inspirational to the sidemen -- the odd harmony implies a third part , and both Rollins and Roach take remarkably powerful and lyrical solos . The remainder of the session finds the leader in rare form , with a slow , patient and breathtaking solo on blues `` Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are '' .And speaking of features for the leader , his arrangement of `` I Surrender , Dear '' is angular , exciting and extremely advanced , even for Monk . The album closes on a slightly different note , the ecstatic and exciting `` Bemsha Swing '' , with trumpeter Clark Terry and bassist Paul Chambers joining Rollins and Roach for what turns out to be a stunning performance.This edition features breathtaking sound -- this remastering process clearly worked wonders , and includes the original liner notes essay.As far as essential Monk goes , this piece is one of them , even for those who do n't particularly care for Monk , this one is well worth the investment . Highly recommended .	1
THis is a GRAND DISC HERE BY THELONIOUS MONK.THE MUSIC will BLOW Your Mind.His Talent is so Incredible that you ca n't explain it.Very Rich & amp ; Timeless Quality here.VERY ESSENTIAL.FROM THIS GENIUS .	1
Well , Monk has many masterpeices . Briliant Corners , however , is easily one of the best of all of Monk 's albums and one of the best jazz albums ever . Thelonious Monk is hands down the greatest piano composer of all time , second only to Duke Ellington . Monk is also working with an incredible band here , including Oscar Pettiford on bass , Max Roach on drums , and one of the greatest saxophone players of all time , Sonny Rollins . Actually , I do n't think that this album would be as good as it is without Sonny Rollins incredible playing . But Thelnious is the real star of this album , writing some of the best songs of his career . More then any other song on this album , the title track , Brilliant Corners , stands out . With a great sax line and some really great solos by all the players , Brilliant Corners is the highlight of the album . None of the songs , however , are anything less then outstanding . One of many brilliant albums by Thelonious Monk , but among the best of these masterpieces .	1
This album could easily qualify as Thelonious ' best . It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was added to the US National Recording Registry . This is my favourite Monk album .	1
Brilliant Corners would be Thelonious Monk 's next breakthrough album just after adecade as a recording artist and nine years after achieving worldwide celebrite for hisgroundbreaking debut album as this recording session proved challenging to listenersand all-stars whom had participated on it . With Monk already enhancing his works onwax to long extended notes , both the consoluted title track and the angular Pannocicawere particularly difficult to nail down as it required multiple takes , but yet the ultimateresults on Brilliant Corners provided a spectacular , where it proved an immortal albumthat have marked the definition of Monk 's dominance of the jazz since it was releasedin 1957 . Beginning with the convoluted title track , the stellar album makes space withother tracks for the sounds of Monk on celeste he performs well with unique charm onPannonica , while the brilliant band line-up consists of Sonny Rollins ( who gave one ofhis greatest and memorable saxophone solos ) , bassist Oscar Pettiford and even MaxRoach . Plus , Monk showcase an astringent piano solo on the 1930 's Depression-Eraballad I Remember Dear , while Roach strikes up the percussion on tympani where hehits the absolute note on Bemsha Swing , that make this brilliant session a lasting andimpressive masterwork from Monk 's rich highly creative legacy . Still as challenging toever , this immortal album will always remain as mesmerizing as ever .	1
Brilliant Corners is remarkable for bringing together musicians who had established themselves as major jazzmen in their own right and yet gave everything on this date to make an album that from the outset would reflect Monk 's peculiar musical world . Perhaps it is Monk 's most enduring masterpiece.The title piece is one of the single major works in the jazz canon . It proved so difficult to play that 25 separate cuts had to be spliced together to produce the final piece . Sonny Rollins was the tenor saxophonist on the date and leading guest musician . As a teenager , Rollins had rehearsed alongside Monk . His contribution to `` Brilliant Corners '' was devastating : he acquired a feel for the unusual structure of the piece -abrupt changes of tempo , bombast followed by bathos , sudden diabolical runs , jumps into double time- and became Monk 's voice through a horn , while retaining the unmistakeable Rollins attack . And all this drama was held together by the polyrhythmic adaptability of Max Roach , who had played so magnificently with Rollins a few months earlier on Saxophone Colossus.The rest of the album contains the eccentric blues `` Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are '' ( which appears on numerous early 1960s discs , including Monk 's Dream , Columbia , 1962 ) , the first recording of `` Pannonica '' , written for the wealthy jazz-lover Pannonica `` Nica '' de Koenigswarter , in whose New York apartment Charlie Parker had died the year before , `` Bemsha Swing '' , first recorded by Monk in 1952 and on this occasion featuring Duke Ellington 's chief trumpeter Clark Terry , and a solo reading of `` I Surrender , Dear '' . This is an essential modern jazz album .	1
That is one of life 's more difficult questions because the more you listen to Monk the more you hear . Certainly that is true on this Cd . It ranks as one of my favorites because the music is so unpredictable and the musicians that are on this particular Monk recording do an amazing job interpreting Monk 's compositions . Every cut is different and each has something that just blows me away every time I hear it . Pannonica , the 3rd track is one of Monk 's more understated and underrated tunes . His piano playing on that number can only be descibed as sweet . The Blues turnarounds on Bal-Lue Bolivar with Monk and Sonny Rollins are knock-outs and Monk 's version of I Surrender Dear is especially unique.I would be remiss not to mention Max Roach 's drumming on this entire cd is fantastic but he particularly shines on Bemsha Swing . Then the icing on the cake is a beautiful trumpet solo on that cut by Clark Terry.This is certainly one of Monk 's finest recordings and on certain nights it is my all-time favorite . Do n't miss it .	1
I have to admit , I thought at first that Thelonious Monk sucked . I used to make fun of him when I used to play the piano , telling my friends , '' I 'm Thelonious ! '' and I would start banging on the keys . One of my friends , who is kind of a mentor to me because he was the one that got me into jazz and the one that I look to for questions about other artists , was raving about Thelonious and I told him I did n't really care for him all that much . He was shocked and told me that Thelonious was one of the most brilliant pianists he ever heard . I asked him if there were any must-haves from Monk and he replied , '' Brilliant Corners . '' Then I went to Tower with him and picked this album up . I kind of regret making fun of him after hearing this album because this is definitely one of the most hard core swingin ' albums I have ever heard . The line up is featuring some of the most well established and talented musicians of the time , Thelonious Monk ( piano , celeste ) ; Ernie Henry ( alto saxophone ) ; Sonny Rollins ( tenor saxophone ) ; Clark Terry ( trumpet ) ; Oscar Pettiford , Paul Chambers ( bass ) ; Max Roach ( drums , tympani ) . If you were like me disliking Monk , this album will definitely change your mind . This is a true masterpiece	1
Perfection is a strange word to apply to something as spontaneous as jazz - but somehow it is applicable to this brilliant recording of Thelonious Monk - who is at the top of his game here . No other Monk recording compares to this one in my opinion - and the ensemble is top-notch . Check this one out !	1
On Brilliant Corners , the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past , but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing . Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece , and rightly so . Max Roach 's drumming on the title track sounds great -- tight , and full of impact . & quot ; Pannonica & quot ; made its debut on this album , and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time . Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album , the tender & quot ; I Surrender , Dear & quot ; sounds like you 're right there in the studio . & quot ; Bemsha Swing & quot ; is a bit sloppy , but Roach 's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version . The only problem I noticed here is a click at the beginning of the title track . Aside from that , it sounds fabulous .	1
I 've been buying Monk CD 's for a year now , and have half-a-dozen . Of the 100 or more reviews of Monk music I 've read here , the majority say & quot ; There is no bad Monk album. & quot ; So far , I have to agree . & quot ; Brilliant & quot ; is a 1956 effort with Sonny Rollins on sax and some other fine contributors . In 43 minutes , Thelonious challenges us , pleasures us , intrigues us . The moods and tempos vary among and within the five selections , four of them Monk compositions . In addition to Sonny 's tenor sax , there is Ernie Henry on alto and Oscar Pettiford on bass , Max Roach on drums . On one number , Clark Terry 's trumpet and the bass work of Paul Chambers are featured . But the star of this release is the pianist himself . One of Monk 's endearing habits was his recycling of original tunes from year to year and label to label and ensemble to ensemble . Do n't ever worry that the track listing on one Monk CD has some songs in common with another disc ... no two versions will ever sound quite the same . On this disc , for instance , & quot ; Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are & quot ; lasts more than 13 minutes . Named for a Manhattan hotel , the song shows up again in late 1962 on the equally famous & quot ; Monk 's Dream & quot ; album for Columbia , but at half the length and with only one saxophone . A similar fate occurs with & quot ; Bemsha Swing & quot ; which is nearly eight minutes on & quot ; Brilliant Corners & quot ; for Riverside , but eight years later was re-recorded for Columbia at half that length and with quite a different feel and sound ( it is included on the & quot ; Monk 's Greatest Hits & quot ; CD . ) While he seldom recorded the song & quot ; Brilliant Corners & quot ; after this album , due to its complexity and perhaps its perfection in this incarnation , the tune & quot ; Pannonica & quot ; also was redone in later years . Of the six Monk CD 's I have , I ca n't tell you which is & quot ; best & quot ; . I have n't lived with them long enough and heard each of them enough times . I like them all . Oddly , probably the least interesting is & quot ; Best of Thelonious & quot ; on Blue Note . Those performances are from 1947-51 and feature the initial recordings of 16 of his originals in brief 78-RPM singles versions . Of the other CD 's , & quot ; Monk 's Dream & quot ; and & quot ; Brilliant Corners & quot ; are essentials , and & quot ; Monk/Rollins & quot ; and & quot ; Monk/Coltrane & quot ; are delights .	1
Just a tad below his very finest work on record , but still a very impressive achievement . `` Serves Me Right '' disappoints somewhat , but `` Just One of Those Things '' cooks from the get-go . The other tunes are all very solid . Top-drawer Adderley .	1
I really hope that this CD has reissued the VERY beginning of & quot ; Things Are Getting Better & quot ; , where Cannonball tells the engineer ( Jack Higgins ) what the tune will consist of , who plays when , and then tells the lineup to & quot ; speak your little sermon , then get the **** out & quot ; . & quot ; Blues Oriental & quot ; is great , as is this whole CD , & quot ; Groovin ' High & quot ; being my personal favorite , but what makes it one of the best are the collaberators - Wynton Kelly , Percy Heath , Milt Jackson , and Art Blakey , who , by the way , plays perfectly behind this band . Cannonball is at ease and blowing so well here because of these players . I really believe that Riverside ( the label that originally recorded this and a host of other great classic '50s and early '60s jazz LPs ) got the best out of many of these artists , for whatever reason . Another great Riverside Cannonball recording was & quot ; Portrait of Cannonball & quot ; with Blue Mitchell and Bill Evans , with Philly Joe Jones , and Sam Jones .	1
I first came familiar with the second tune on this album THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER from an old Eddie Jefferson recording ( yes , he wrote lyrics to it ! ) and years later recorded it on my tribute to him ... finally , I got around to getting this baby , and what can I say ... anytime you have a rhythm section with Blakey/Kelly and Heath , is it possible to go wrong ? Then when you have Cannonball and Milt Jackson fronting it , tell me the session , recorded 10/28/58 for the RIVERSIDE label was n't guaranteed to be dynamite from the start ! ! ! As for what makes the album particularly interesting , it is probably the fact that both Adderley and Jackson came from the same bebop roots , but also had distinct styles ... Jackson being the king of cool and Adderley a bit more on the hot side , but also capable of playing cool ... the perfect meeting of these two styles is the slow blues SOUNDS FOR SID ... This tune is a great vehicle to hear just how much an influence Parker was on Cannonball , but yet how he also had his own distinct vocabulary of `` isms '' . - - I also like the engineering on this album ... Adderley is so sharp , crisp and out front over the lush bluesy rhythm section you can almost taste it ... like black licorice.SERVES ME RIGHT is another great vehicle for the ensemble ... a dark and moody minor key ditty that serves as a great vehicle for Milt Jackson 's preference for slower tunes , yet a tendency to play lot 's of almost Bud Powell-esque runs over them . - - Adderley 's playing on this one is appropriately Bluesy , somber and sedate yet swinging ... demonstrating also the fact that he had a very diverse tonal vocabulary that is easy to take for granted considering the fact that he also had a `` signature sound '' as well . - - Blakey plays Brushes on this one and the rhythm section shows the lost art of playing tight yet moody at the same time.Other moments of the album include GROOVIN ' HIGH - - another great vehicle to `` study '' the soul of Adderley , thanks to the unintrustive yet wicked pocket playing of Heath/Blakey and Kelly and the delicious engineering of the album ... Jackson 's solo is really driven by Percy Heath 's bass is so tight on Blakey 's cymbals and elegantly comped by Kelly that I 'd advice any young Jazz students to THROW OUT the Aebersold play-a-longs and get with this ... I 'll end by mentioning the set closer JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS which again highlights the fact that not only was Adderley a master of phrase-ology but also tonal expression - - in particular , there 's a warmth to Adderley 's playing that 's more typical of a tenor on this one ... and again , demonstrates the breadth of expression he has on his instrument ... Kelly 's comping on this is text book stuff on this , and Blakey opens up on this one too ( This might have been a throw-a-way warm up that they decided to include anyway . ) All in all , it was not uncommon for many leaders to get buried as sidemen on their own albums back then because back then Jazz was all about the ensemble ... however , this album is an all too rare example of two leaders who are working well together and also working closely with the ensemble , yet who are very much up-front and featured . For this reason , its hard not to stay glued to the album straight through and I consider it a timeless classic !	1
This is a very nice blow session , recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin ' Else . Unlike the earlier album , this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style . Unlike many later albums , this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live , working band.I 'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result . Milt 's playing is nice here , just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period , there is a healthy mix of ballads ( `` Serves Me Right '' ) , bebop ( `` Groovin ' High '' ) , interesting originals ( `` Blues Oriental '' by Milt Jackson ) and extremely funky material ( `` Sounds for Sid '' ) . Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one . Fans of Cannonball 's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here .	1
This has to be Cannonball Adderley 's greatest album . Milt Jackson is sensational . Liking this is just one of those things .	1
On a shopping spree , I bought this one , speak no evil and maiden voyage . Well , after listening to all three , this one just stay in my cd player . Some of the best music ever recorded in any kind of music . Beware : it was recorded by Mingus on a portable equipment . The sound quality is not for this age of 2000 bit digitally remastered . Sometimes the players are recorded at differnet volumes throughout the album . But dont let that prevent you from listening to this amazing , work of art . If No Parker , no Miles , no Coltrane , no Mingus , etc .	1
look at the line-up on this live recording from toronto , canada , circa the year 1953 AD . it 's enough to make a jazz fans eyes bug out . charlie parker on sax , dizzy gillespie on trumpet , bud powell on piano , charles mingus on bass , and max roach on drums . holy cow ! how could this not be the greatest jazz album of all-time ? but amazingly , it manages not to be . go figure . anyway , if it 's not the greatest jazz album of all-time , it 's still fantastic ; and it should be mandatory for any jazz lover to keep a copy laying around whatever one calls home . one further thing , then i 'll let you get on with your life : most people seem to prefer the newer release of this concert , where the charles mingus bass work is not overdubbed , like it is on the original release . well , call me knucklehead johnson , but i actually prefer the original overdubbed release . i know , i know , i know : i 'm a fool . but that 's my preference , and i think that i 'm entitled to one ( so please do n't go flying off to the unhelpful button ! ) . if you like the undubbed version better , then i say `` God love you . Differences of opinion sure make life interesting , do n't they ? anyway , you ca n't go wrong in purchasing this recording ( whatever version of it you may choose ) .	1
It was still at least a decade later that Jazz would expand its vocabulary to keep things consistently fresh , but as far as old-time , live bebop is concerned , it 's hard to think of a better starting , and finishing , point than this .	1
This cd is an amazing document . If this was the only surviving artifact of the 20th century , of human civilization tout cour , then future races and alien species will undoubtedly be in agreement ( however naively ) that we were giants , that we , as a people , humans , earthlings , had emotional depth , a refined aesthetic sense , humour , intellectual refinement , and anything else you would want and hope for in sentient beings . The music here is perfect , sublime , peerless in its execution , epic in its scope , minute and detailed like the most finely wrought baroque trifle . Everything that it is to live and die in this world finds expression and reflection here . Unbelievable . Unforgettable . Unsurpassed . ( 100stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) I do n't know where I find some of the words contained here , anyway ...	1
There are some pretty excellent reviews already written about this amazing recording ( C. Craddock 's in particular ) . It is one of my top five favorite jazz CD 's that I own and definitely my favorite 'live ' recording . I love hearing the applause of the audience after each solo . These cats were simply the 'DREAM TEAM ' of Jazz music - Dizzy , Bird , Bud Powell , Max Roach , and last but not least the incredible Charles Mingus on bass.From the moment the first song `` Perdido '' begins your heart starts pounding quickly with excitement and glee cause you just know you are in for some kind of magical journey . I still ca n't believe the story about Bird and his borrowed horn ( the infamous white , plastic alto ) . Talk about turning chicken sh.. into chicken salad ! How in the hec does he play like that ? ! ! Especially considering how much he was drinking and shooting up at the time . According to Miles , it never mattered how f ... ed up Bird was on booze and heroin , it seemed the more trashed he was , the better he played . Go figure.I do n't think any fan of jazz will be disappointed if they make this purchase . It 's difficult for me to comprehend how you could be a fan without this one in your collection . This one is a no-brainer !	1
No serious libary of jazz recordings could possibly do without this one , and if one had to buy , say , only ten records , it would be hard to give it a miss . To me , none of the five musicians ever played better and more excitingly than on this occasion , and the music is both stirring and profoundly moving . I remember that until I first heard this , many , many years ago , I had not actually been a Parker `` fan '' . He had always struck me as brilliant , clever , inventive , etc . - but generally just too intense . Also , many of the early tracks are too short for my taste . But here you hear `` Bird '' truly on fire in a way which is still intense , but not as exhausting as sometimes , as he has more time to develop his stunning solos . I still think that there is no better way to hear Parker than on this record , and it would be worth buying just for him . But all the others are great too : Dizzy tearing away with tremendous wit , suppleness and intelligence ; Bud Powell marvellously `` jazzy '' and profound ; and the other two crackling along in a melting pot that is a perfect fusion ( before `` fusion '' as a genre came to torment us ) . Highlights ? Difficult to choose , but `` A Night in Tunisia '' never sounds better than here , great tune though it is anyway , and `` Hothouse '' is an immensely moving theme , conceived - and here executed - with great originality . There are some other records probably as good ( e.g . `` Kind of Blue '' ) - but I doubt they come better than this , recorded on what turned out to be a very special musical occasion resulting in a real treat .	1
This is an excellent , but not & quot ; essential & quot ; recording of perhaps the five greatest jazz instrumentalists of the bop era . The legendary players include Charlie & quot ; Bird & quot ; Parker on sax , John B . & quot ; Dizzie & quot ; Gillespie on trumpet , Bud Powell on piano , Charles Mingus on bass , and Max Roach on drums . It would be difficult to ask for a better all-star lineup ; it is , indeed , a historic meeting.However , while the meeting is stratospheric , the results are mixed . Of course , each plays superbly , but the ensemble playing -- the empathic groove between the musicians -- is sometimes uneven . This is not to take away any superlatives from individual performances or those cuts where the band is tight and simpatico , but , in reviewing the performance , one must ( somehow ) suspend knowledge of each performer 's individual excellence.The biggest culprit is the very uneven sound quality obtained from Mingus ' backstage recorder ( ! ) . Mingus , in fact , had to dub in most of his performance later because he was recorded so poorly . Unfortunately , no one else redubbed their parts , and this , at times , dampens the performances of Powell , Parker , and Roach . The second overall problem is the apparent lack of direction in some of the music . Finally , the band 's ensemble playing seldom wanders far from the familiar bebop grooves . ( When it does extend itself , however , the band 's creative impulse will jolt you . ) Here , then , are the cuts : & quot ; Perdido & quot ; ( 7:53 ) : Dizzy Gillespie provides the only fireworks here . His dramatic dynamics ( volume changes ) are well-recorded , his rapport with Roach is unusually good , and he throws in a trademark whimsical musical & quot ; quotation. & quot ; Powell has a long searching solo that features an excellent fluid-yet-choppy solo . Parker is somewhat less well recorded , and Mingus is limited to keeping the beat with a walking bass . Parker has some good riffs , but , overall , the song lacks direction.The group hits its stride with & quot ; Salt Peanuts & quot ; ( 7:30 ) , the best song on the album ( along with track 4 , & quot ; Wee & quot ; ) . Parker is really kicking here , with Diz yelling encouragement in the background , and the rhythm section has an electric , punching pulse . Dizzy 's plays at a blistering pace : His bravado and virtuosity evident with every note . The great Bud Powell is not well recorded , but there 's a prototypical powerhouse solo by Roach. & quot ; All the Things You Are & quot ; ( 7:55 ) : Perhaps the least appealing cut . Dizzy opens nicely , but the rhythm section does n't mesh -- there 's almost a feeling that they 're & quot ; reading & quot ; different arrangements , trying to find their way back to each other . The sound does n't help either -- Roach drops out about midway through the song , and Powell and Gillespie are either not miked well or are just strangely absent . Bird plays well , but without the necessary support it lacks emotional impact . Dizzy finally enters with a wonderful ( if slightly over long ) muted trumpet solo , simultaneous daring and melodic . Mingus , and then the rest of the band , deliver a solid conclusion , but it 's too little , too late.I think the other standout here is & quot ; Wee & quot ; ( 6:45 ) , an up tempo blues with some of Parker 's best work on the album , backed with flair and empathy by the rhythm section . Bird and Diz have ample room to paint expressively across the vast bebop canvas . Powell is better recorded here , and gives perhaps his best performance here . Roach is an acrobat , deftly tossing fireworks with controlled abandon.On & quot ; Hot House & quot ; ( 9:18 ) the bass recording overpowers Parker 's nuanced , brilliantly colored performance . At one point , Powell seems to step closer to the mike , and the sound is that much more compelling . The drumming sounds muffled , and , overall there is a curious lack of energy ( though Powell wraps up with an outstanding bop solo ) . Mingus ' solo , though initially barely audible , picks up for some of his most creative work on the album.The famous Gillespie/Paparelli tune & quot ; A Night in Tunisia & quot ; ( 7:33 ) opens with a beautiful muted trumpet against an insistent , economical bass line . Excellent balance among the players , whether playing together , or trading solo adventures . I 'm a huge Mingus fan , but , for some reason , he adheres fairly closely to a walking bass ( although the range of notes is awesome ) ; a more angular approach might have lent more interest . The group brings the song to an exciting conclusion.I recommend this in the same way I might recommend watching an NBA all-star game . The players have not had enough time to play as a team , although individual performances can be awesome . At times , though , there is inspiring , flowing team work . By the way , for such an auspicious occasion , it is surprising that there are no liner notes . Brian Priestley 's & quot ; Mingus , A Critical Biography & quot ; ( available at ... ) devotes two pages to the concert . Obviously , there are some flaws here , but I still recommend it highly .	1
This disc features only the entire quintet comprised of Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet , Charlie Parker on alto , Bud Powell on piano , Charles Mingus on bass and Max Roach on drums . If you want the full concert I recommend that you check outComplete Jazz At Massey Hall , which includes the eight tracks where Dizzy and Bird leave the stage and Powell , Mingus and Roach take over ( on one track it 's just Roach on a drum solo ) . Not only does that album have the complete concert , but the sound is better and it has Mingus ' original bass lines.I will confess that I like the sound quality of this release better than my first copy of this concert . And while Mingus ' efforts at overdubbing are on this CD this is how the original album was released.Since there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review you can listen to snippets of the tracks on the MP3 version 's page atThe Quintet : Jazz At Massey Hall ( Limited Edition ) . The music is clear and the mix as good as can be expected considering the way the original recording was mangled ( Mingus had the tape recorded under the stage floor ) . Obviously fans will probably opt for the complete album I cited above , but if you are studying alto sax or trumpet this may be the only part of the concert that you need . Certainly the energy of the concert are present on these tracks and the sound is a little more natural than the complete concert album that sounds over processed and sterile .	1
I Got tons of stuff on Bird , Mingus , a few on Powell & amp ; Roach & amp ; a few on Dizzy.but having all of that Genius on Set makes up big time.The Music & amp ; Arrangements are Incredible.Bird changed the Game Forever.He is One Of Jazz 's Greatest Pioneers.DIzzy blows The Mind with His Tone.Miles Davis always gave him Mad Props.Roach is one of the Greatest Drummers ever in any Style of Music.Powell Rings up Keys & amp ; has been featured on Many Important Recordings.Mingus who I got turned onto a Couple Years back is Amazing.Simply put.His Tones & amp ; Drives are Gold too the Ears.Very Essential .	1
The amazing music at this concert is rightly famous in spite of the uneven levels and other recording problems that often trouble great jazz records.Being a fan of classical jazz who appreciates even the primitively recorded music from the 1920s ( `` squeek '' , `` screetch '' ) , I ca n't be very critical of problems that Mr. Greenbaum points to in his elaborate and extremely useful review on this site.For me , this recording compares to some earlier artists ' classical work like a theater performance given months ofter the opening night to the performance at the very opening night . When the actors know each other well and no longer worry about the outcome of the production and the reaction of the critics , they can relax and trully create.Compared to Gillespie 's and Parker 's recordings from the 40 's , this music is more relaxed but still trully creative and imaginative ; it seems that experience in be-bop idiom ( like in most any other idiom ) is beneficial for all the involved parties.I have mentioned only two players from this great quintet full of fire and rhythm but , let 's face it , they are the reason to buy this cd . The others , great musicians themselves , are ( `` only '' ) first class supporting crew at this historical concert.I 'm not really an expert in jazz , but I still want to contribute my five stars at this point ...	1
Five stars for the music ( a no-brainer ) , but as someone who owns both this Debut/OJC edition and the Spanish import , `` The Complete Jazz at Massey Hall , '' on the Jazz Factory label , I must echo the sentiments of `` shurbuilders '' ( below ) . The European edition is from the same company -- Disconforme -- that did such an excellent job of mastering the `` Complete Duke Ellington at Fargo Concert , '' and at an affordable price . Score them another winner with their edition of the Massey Hall concert . Not only does the Jazz Factory version contain 24 additional minutes of music , but it has more `` presence '' in the treble frequencies ( especially noticeable with Roach 's drum kit ) and features Mingus ' original bass lines , which to my ears are sufficiently audible without Mingus meddling with them after the fact . Moreover , the tunes are complete ( the OJC version begins `` Perdido '' after the bridge ) .The strengths of the Spanish import may not be so apparent to listeners who prefer a tighter and shorter program and who have become accustomed to bottom-heavy modern recordings . Also , the reduced crowd noise on the OJC edition may permit more exclusive concentration on the soloists . But this was an historic musical event , and no doubt many listeners will wish to experience `` up-close '' and in full the magical moment that occurred in Canada on the night of May 15 , 1953 . If so , the Spanish import is definitely your best ticket to Toronto .	1
This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection , capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax , Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet , Bud Powell Piano , Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums . From the first number `` Perdido '' you know this something special . A medium tempo version which never stops swinging . Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number . On `` Salt Peanuts '' Bud Powell plays a memorable solo , which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos , and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances . Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good . The only reason this does n't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete ' version of this recording.Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died .	1
If you have even a vague notion of jazz luminaries this album will turn your head . Piano/leader : Thelonious Monk , tenor saxophone : Coleman Hawkins and John Coltrane , drums : Art Blakey , bass : Wilbur Ware , along with the underrated Gigi Gryce on alto saxophone and Ray Copeland on trumpet , this is a formidable lineup . Many recordings boast star studded line ups such as this and fail to deliver at the level of those involved . What about this one ? Well lets just check out the tracks on this landmark album . Following the pastoral horns only & quot ; Abide With Me & quot ; , one is lead straight into one of the most fantastic recordings in jazz . & quot ; Well , You Need n't & quot ; , opens with its grand theme into an inspired Monk solo , right into Monk hollering & quot ; Coltrane ! Coltrane ! & quot ; to wake a snoozing Coltrane , a priceless injoke once you know the story . Following insprired solos by the entire listed personnell the theme is reprised and finished . That 12 plus minutes is worth the admission alone and is only the first two tracks of eight ! Hawkins ' interpretation of & quot ; Ruby My Dear is simply beautiful . & quot ; Off Minor & quot ; finds two takes of the entire personnel digging into the material and finding gold . Monk 's & quot ; theme & quot ; & quot ; Epistrophy & quot ; , he often closed live sets with it , is given a definative treatment . It all is finished with two versions of the laid back and playful & quot ; Crepuscule With Nellie & quot ; . This album along with & quot ; Brilliant Corners & quot ; solidified Monk in the jazz mainstream from his obscure & quot ; muscians ' musician & quot ; status , where he remains to this day . This album is a testament to the compositional and arranging skills of Monk , and the musical skill of all those involved . This is a must have for all serious jazz collections !	1
Man , this is one great CD . This and `` Straight No Chaser '' are my two favorite Monk titles , and Monk is my favorite jazz artist . It does n't get much better than this for me - until I came across this SACD hybrid version . I love it ! They obviously remastered the CD using DSD ( instead of just grabbing the latested PCM remaster and sticking it on the disc along with the SACD layer ) because this CD layer blows every other remaster of this title out of the water . It 's 1957 , this is one of the first stereo jazz recordings made , and they got it right .	1
Widely hailed as a masterpiece , but to me it 's just another good Monk album . This does contain my favorite version of my favorite Monk song , an extended `` Well , You Need n't '' features numerous memorable solos : there 's also a tender if slightly overlong `` Ruby My Dear '' and a swinging , fun `` Off Minor '' ; there 's also a painfully cheesy , thankfully brief `` Abide with Me '' ( still , those are some unbearable 55 seconds ) , and rather unenlightening takes on `` Epistrophy '' ( a remake of an old Blue Note single - the Blue Note take is far better , I can say that without any doubt whatsoever ) and `` Crepscule with Nellie '' ( which would later get several more touching readings on future Monk albums , most notably Criss Cross ) . So while it 's a distinctive good time , and has a great cover , it 's not as solid as several other Monk releases . Still pretty good , though .	1
Somewhat oddly , Brilliant Corners seems to be really popular here at Amazon while Monk 's Music languishes in relative obscurity . That 's too bad , because these albums are like twins -- the first albums consisting of primarily Monk compositions to hit it big with the jazz public.Like Brilliant Corners , Monk 's Music includes some older Monk tunes which , because of his earlier obscurity , were often new to the public . `` Epistrophy '' , `` Ruby , My Dear '' , `` Off Minor '' and `` Well You Need n't '' were all recorded by Monk in the late 40s on Blue Note records . But because the LP did n't exist in the 40s , all those recordings were pretty short -- 4 minutes , tops -- and did n't really let the musicians stretch out . On this album , they get that chance to stretch . Monk also introduces a new composition : the knotty but beautiful ballad `` Crepescule with Nellie '' .This album is also hyped ( deservedly so ) for featuring the only recorded meeting of Coleman Hawkins and John Coltrane . Hawkins was the first major tenor saxophonist in jazz , way back in the 20s ; Coltrane would be the dominant tenor of the 60s . Hawkins had hired Monk back in the 40s , when the language of bebop was still strange to many listeners and musicians ; Coltrane would soon be hired by Monk for their fabled engagement at the Five Spot . Anyway , it 's terrific to hear both the emerging giant and the mature master tackle Monk 's music.I guess I should n't sell the other personnel short either . Ray Copeland ( trumpet ) and Gigi Gryce ( alto sax ) round out the front line . Wilbur Ware would be Monk 's bassist for the Five spot gigs . And Art Blakey , who is in my mind the perfect accompanist for Monk , plays drums.This is one of my favorite Monk recordings on the Riverside label , and I predict that it will probably be yours too . Along with Brilliant Corners and Monk & Coltrane , it is a great introduction to Thelonious Sphere Monk . You might want to look for the slightly more expensive 20-bit remastered version , which probably sounds better than the original 80s CD issue .	1
By 1957 , Thelonious Monk had been on the jazz scene for more than a decade , but his genius was n't yet recognized by much of the listening public . His compositions had found favor with other musicians , and he 'd gained some notice as a sideman , but his unique style - both as a musician and as a person - obscured the depth of his invention . Having signed to Riverside in 1955 he recorded standards , Duke Ellington covers , and a widely recognized album of originals , Brilliant Corners , but it was this 1957 session that really solidified public opinion in his favor . Working with a septet that included both Coleman Hawkins and John Coltrane on tenor sax , you could hear history 's page turning between the former 's warm-toned balladry on `` Ruby , My Dear '' and the latter 's modern improvisation . Coltrane was also just emerging as a star , having established himself with Miles Davis , and having led his first session the previous month.The septet was anchored by the steady swing of Art Blakey and Wilbur Ware , and the horn section is filled out by Ray Copeland on trumpet and Gigi Gryce on alto saxophone . The four-horn lineup creates more solo variations ; when playing as a section they could sound orchestral , or with Monk and Blakey pushing the rhythm , like the front-line of a big band . The selections mostly revisit tunes from Monk 's catalog , giving the pianist an opportunity to rethink his compositions , and the band an opportunity to create new interpretations that , in a few cases ( such as `` Ruby , My Dear '' ) , might be considered definitive . The album 's one new composition is `` Crepuscule with Nellie , '' a song written by Monk for his wife , and the source of some frustration in the studio ; the album 's original take is complemented here with an alternate that edits together pieces of two other takes . Alternates of `` Off Minor '' and a studio blues jam are also included . OJC 's 2011 reissue features a new 24-bit remaster by Joe Tarntino , new liner notes by Ashley Kahn , and the album 's original liner notes by session producer Orrin Keepnews . [ 2011 hyperbolium dot com ]	1
This session always sounds as if it were about to fall apart at the seams , which is part of its incredible charm . While its underrehearsed quality makes a lot of the Prestige Records `` blowing sessions '' of this period sound almost studied by comparison , the resulting album captures the essential joy of Monk 's music with a sponteneity lacking in some of his other studio recordings . Drummer Art Blakey proves a particularly explosive partner , really driving things along with intensity and spirit , and Coleman Hawkins clearly is having a blast , turning the still-developing John Coltrane into the tense schoolboy on this session . It 's all utterly endearing , from the tune selection to the cover art , with the extended workout on `` Well You Need n't '' so much fun , it oughtta be illegal . If I were forced to choose the two most essential among Monk 's many great recordings , it would be Big Band and Quartet in Concert , and this one .	1
In what would be another of his greatest and most popular albums , Monk 's Music , released in 1957 , offers a fantastic showcase of Monk 's artistry in an enhancing formand audio attack that makes this high-octane masterpiece an unforgettable and high-swinging listening experience . Featuring tenor saxophone titans John Coltrane andColeman Hawkins , as well as Art Blakey in the band , this action-packed masterpiecehave dazzling solos , pulsating rhythms and blowing performances , which confirm thethe combustible atmosphere . The solid track set showcase hot expanded reinditionsof Well You Need n't ; Epistrophy ; Ruby , My Dear ; Off Minor and even the thorny newCrepuscule With Nellie , which makes it among his most important achievements andchallenging albums he have ever done with horns . The true meaning for the album'stitle exist just well beyone Monk 's artistry , as the opening sacred prelude Abide WithMe , where the brief only feature a horn quartet and foreshadowed it 's beginning untilthe angular strides of style from his thunderous reindition of Well You Need n't whereit is tackled in the same nimble authority in Monk 's completely unfettered solos . Andwhat adds to the chemistry of Monk 's Music is how he bought together Hawkins ( thefirst important voice of the tenor saxophone ) and Coltrane ( a major shaping force forjazz in the late-1950 's and 1960 's ) by literally looking back and far ahead ) . To thosewho truly wants to question his ability to swing and his own utilization of atomic clockaccuracy , the answer lies no further , and we will guarantee to you that Monk 's Musicwill live on for ages as one of his highly acclaimed and celebrated masterpieces .	1
Ok , this set has several of Monk 's classsic compositions and is solid throughout . How could it not be with Monk , Coltrane , Blakey and Coleman Hawkins . I will say this..You WILL NEVER hear a better rendition of Ruby My Dear than the one rendered here . Hawkins playing is absolutely magnificent on that track . It would be worth the price of this cd just for that one cut . The bonus is that the rest of the cuts are extremely well played Monk Music so you ca n't miss with this one .	1
Thelonious Monk was on a roll in 1957 . Finally , the jazz buying public understood his genius and accepted him in the ranks of other jazz innovators of the day like Miles Davis , Charlie Parker , Dizzy Gillespie , etc . He finally got credit where it was due.I think Monk 's genius is on full display here . Though , I will say it 's pretty remarkable that Monk does n't solo much on this recording . Since this is a larger band , he let the other guys stretch a little more . What is noteworthy besides the obvious musicianship are the compositions . Monk wrote some of the greatest jazz tunes ever recorded like `` In Walked Bud , '' `` Blue Monk , '' `` Ruby , My Dear , '' `` Round Midnight , '' `` Straight , No Chaser , '' `` Locomotive , '' `` Boo Boo 's Birthday , '' Green Chimneys '' to name a few . All of these tunes are jazz standards and are covered by just about everybody who sits down at a piano or picks up a horn.His group on this 1957 session for Riverside Records were the following : Gigi Gryce on alto saxophone , Coleman Hawkins , John Coltrane on tenor saxophones , Ray Copeland on trumpet , Wilbur Ware on bass , and Art Blakey on drums . This lineup is simply one of Monk 's best of the 50s . His next best lineup was for Columbia : Charlie Rouse on tenor saxophone , Larry Gales on bass , and Ben Riley on drums.The music on this recording will not only please Monk fans , but will also cause you to pick up more albums down the road . Highly recommended .	1
Is this the best Jazz album of all time ? Maybe . Monk is joyful , abstract , and totally in control on this June '57 session . But what really kills me is the quality of the compositions . Monk was , in my eyes at least , first and foremost a Composer ( yes , with a capital & quot ; C & quot ; ) of the highest order -- I put him right up there with Mozart , Ellington , or Lennon/McCartney . Every tune on this outstanding release is , quite simply , a masterpiece : & quot ; Off Minor & quot ; , & quot ; Well , You Need n't & quot ; , & quot ; Ruby , My Dear & quot ; , & quot ; Crepuscule with Nellie & quot ; , and & quot ; Epistrophy & quot ; are all stunning in their complexity and endlessly rewarding , even after dozens ( or , in my case , thousands ) of playings . This is Art ( yes , with a capital & quot ; A & quot ; ) of a rare and lasting beauty and a must for any collection .	1
Taken from three distinct recording sessions - with bassist Percy Heath being the only consistent sideman - the album was released in 1954.Featuring musicians like Kenny Clarke ( d ) , Art Blakey ( d ) , Horace Silver ( p ) and Charles Mingus ( p ) , the material is from May 19 , 1953 ; March 15 , 1954 and April 3 , 1954 . The eight tracks clock in at 30:05 , with Miles Ahead and the title track edging away from the tight pack of quality music.The playing may not be fast and furious , but the sound is smooth as Miles is churning out cool grooves .	1
This album took eleven months and three sessions to capture , but captures Miles ' flirtation with hard bop and transition to his more pensive 'Blue period ' . For me personally this is the beginning of a window that would encompass my favorite Miles Davis albums . Other fans may have different periods , but for me it was the Prestige years and his subsequent Quintet period culminating in 1959 . Of course that reflects my personal taste and is no reflection on Miles ' continuing evolution and reinvention . However , my personal tastes aside , the sound samples on this page will tell you all you need to know about this album . Listen to those and let your ears guide you.I mentioned that this album took three sessions . Here are the tracks , when and where they were recorded and by whom . The track sequence is not chronological , so I am going to provide the background info in track order.Track 1 was actually the last one recorded . It was laid down in Rudy van Gelder 's Hackensack , NJ studio on April 3 , 1954 . Miles is accompanied by Dave Schildkraut on alto sax , and backed by an all0star rhythm section comprised of Horace Silver on piano , Percy Heath on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 2 , 3 and 5 were recorded at the Beltone Studios in NYC on March 15 , 1954 . Miles is backed by Horace Silver on piano , Percy Heath on bass and Art Blakey on drums.The remaining tracks were the first ones recorded on May 19 , 1953 at the WOR Studios in NYC . Miles is backed by John Lewis on piano ( except on track 4 's Smooch when Charles Mingus sits in ( Mingus was a virtuoso pianist as well as a bassist ) , with Percy Heath on bass and Max Roach on drums.Give the sound samples a listen and decide for yourself . My copy is actually playing in the background while I write this review .	1
Good solid music.very Relaxin & amp ; cool too chill to.I 'll Remember April is A Good Song.Miles 's Tone Sounds Great .	1
Yeah , we know Miles went through many phases and stages , but this is where I started with Miles after I initially heard `` Sketches of Spain '' , then I went to `` Round MidNight '' with Coltrane , and then backwards to Mile 's Charlie Parker days , then I went forward to `` Live at the BlackHawk '' , then `` Kind of Blue '' . Whew . That 's alot of ground , but Miles was mercurial and great at everything he did , never stopping very long to smell a particular group of roses before moving on to the next challenge.The 'Piece D'Resistance ' here is the extended performance of `` I 'll Remember April '' . A huge , mind-opening performance ! ! Arrangement-wise ( very uptempo & Native-American oriented ) , performance-wise , it 's just wonderful , and I 've listened to it for decades with the same wonder and enjoyment . Kenny Clarke 's brushwork is too much , and Davey Schildkraut ( alto ) and Miles ( muted trumpet ) blow wonderful , inspired solos still fresh today ; but Horace Silver 's two piano solos steal the show and even his piano fills during the magnificent Percy Heath 'walking bass ' section are exceptional . Worth the entire CD ! ! Do n't miss this ! `` Tune Up '' and `` Smooch '' ( with Mingus ' amazing pianism and double stops ) are also great , but another gem is `` Four '' . Few times in the history of jazz music has so much wonderful stuff been done in so little time than on `` Four '' . Totally mesmerizing . And I absolutely love Miles ' solo , the ultra hip and clever Horace Silver piano solo , and Blakey 's wonderful rimshot groupings . WOW ! AFTERTHOUGHT : The song `` Tune Up '' later received a legendary extended and wonderful performance by Sonny Rollins onThe Very Best . Mingus also displays more of his piano work on his solo piano CD [ Mingus Plays Piano ] . Buy all three and enjoy the overlap .	1
At first glance I did n't think this front line would work . Certainly Eric Dolphy 's slashing frenetic style of playing would not work well with Oliver Nelson 's more mainstream bluesy approach . But not only does it work , it works very well indeed thank you . At times it 's fascinating to compare the two styles ; at other times it 's amazing how well they compliment each other . One is also reminded what an adventurous musician Nelson was . Another treat is hearing Dolphy on bass clarinet , an instrument not heard much in jazz . And while we 're discussing treats ... ..a big treat here are Nelson 's compositions especially the mysterious `` Images '' and the bluesy `` Six and Four . '' Richard Wyands contributes some smooth piano work while bassist George Duvivier and drummer Roy Haynes hold everything together . Duvivier 's presence is especially interesting to me . Somehow I think of him as being more of a mainstream player performing with the likes of Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster . It just goes to show what a versatile player he was !	1
This was the sixth of eight Prestige family of albums Nelson recorded ( March 1961 ) . As with all his work for the label , these are solid performances . The up-tempo STRAIGHT AHEAD might be the highlight of the CD , while the medium-slow blues ( the only blues piece on the album ) is also excellent . All the tunes are originals ( typical for a Nelson recording session ) , and all are distinctive . The rhythm section [ Richard Wyands ( p ) George Duvivier ( b ) Roy Haynes ( d ) ] is solid and Dolphy is , well , Dolphy . ( I liked him a tad better on the SCREAMIN ' THE BLUES Prestige album with Nelson and a lot better on THE BLUES AND THE ABSTRACT TRUTH . ) A very nice album .	1
This album , which features Arturo and the Chucho Valdes Trio ( Chucho on piano , Ron Mathewson on bass and Martin Drew on drums ) , is an instant classic . This album was recorded before Arturo left Cuba for the United States , and was actually recorded in England . While it does n't seem as if quite as many people have heard this one , there should be more people who have heard it . This album has the spark and virtuosity that is Arturo Sandoval , and is considered by many who really know his work , to be some of his best . This album combines all of his many facets : scream trumpet , latin sounds and rhythms , melodic ballad work , jazz improvisation and astounding technique . The album opens up with a lively & quot ; King Pete 's Heart & quot ; , which features Arturo playing some good stuff and interacting well with the group . He solos masterfully with a Miles Davis influence on & quot ; My Funny Valentine & quot ; , close to the microphone and everything . This proves Arturo 's versatility alone . Chucho and the band provide excellent support throughout . & quot ; Mambo Influencianado & quot ; will surely blow your socks off . This tune goes through some extremely amazing tempo and mood contrasts , and Arturo 's solo is unbelievable ! He uses his fast playing and technique wonderfully here , and reaches into the stratosphere . On & quot ; Claudia & quot ; , the band swings with a nice tempo and take it back to a more laid-back approach , and Arturo plays some cool licks aided by the group , and plays some awesome blues licks on & quot ; Blues 88 & quot ; . However , my personal favorite is the rendition of & quot ; Blue Monk & quot ; simply because of the great Arturo solo , he just rips right through it , jumping registers as well as anyone . This under-rated classic should be in any Arturo Sandoval fan 's collection . This is some great trumpet playing .	1
& quot ; Straight Ahead & quot ; is the third and final collaboration between tenor saxophonist and noted arranger Oliver Nelson , and iconoclastic reedman Eric Dolphy . The first was Nelson 's & quot ; Screamin ' The Blues & quot ; also on the Prestige label , and the second was the famous & quot ; Blues and the Abstract Truth , & quot ; recorded for Impulse a week earlier than & quot ; Straight Ahead. & quot ; On March 1 , 1961 Nelson and Dolphy went into the studio for the third time , along with Richard Wyands on piano , George Duvivier on bass and Roy Haynes on drums . Five of the album 's six tunes are Nelson originals ( & quot ; Ralph 's New Blues is a Milt Jackson composition ) , with & quot ; Images & quot ; and the title-track the standouts . The results were magical on this session , but not quite as impressive as the Impulse date . All the same , fans of Nelson and Dolphy will enjoy plotting this course & quot ; Straight Ahead. & quot ;	1
I 'll start by saying that this is not the issue of Straight Ahead that I own . I have this as part of the Eric Dolphy Complete Prestige box-set that I reviewed here however many years ago , which was remastered more recently than this issue . So , my review is just on the performance and the quality of the album , not the sound.I love this album ! It will always stand in the shadow of Blues & amp ; the Abstract Truth because unlike Abstract , this album is n't packed full of as many of the big names in jazz , but do n't let that fool you . This is also a classic album.There are times here where Dolphy swings like a demented circus performer , and Nelson is ( as usual ) , dripping with blues and soul . The tunes are great and the performances milk every last drop of loveliness out of them . This is one of those albums where I tend to think that no jazz collection could be considered complete without it .	1
This is the second of the 4 albums issued by Prestige at the end of Davis 's association with the label . Four of the six titles come from the 10/26/56 date and two from 5/11/56 , same personnel : Miles ( tp ) Coltrane ( ts ) Red Garland ( p ) Paul Chambers ( b ) Philly Joe Jones ( d ) .Sonny Rollins 's OLEO , based on the I GOT RHYTHM changes , is a great tune ; this version is not quite as good as the original one done back in 1954 when Rollins was with Davis , but it 's taken faster and really burns . YOU 'RE MY EVERYTHING is a slow ballad that goes to double time for Coltrane 's solo - a beautiful performance.All four of these Prestige releases are consistently fine ( all the titles were recorded in one take only ) . The epitome of hard bop in the mid-50 's . Great stuff .	1
Although this is fairly typical fire for pointed interplay of the time , there was no denying Davis 's uncanny ability to assemble the best units , producing a hot streak of bop throughout those years whose synergistic prowess would leave competing cohorts in a pool of stagnation when time had its say .	1
Lay whatever you have heard before aside . Put aside all your pre-conceived notions about what & quot ; great & quot ; Miles actually is . Try not to think of any & quot ; concept & quot ; albums , or story-line albums . This one will speak for itself.This , by far , is the best , and certainly my favorite , Miles release ever . What an incredibly broad thing to say about such a legend ! I know . And before you either wholly dismiss me , or begin cussing me , hear me out.Out of all the Miles I own , this is the one I reach for time , after time , after time . It is amazing . It is beautiful , from start to finish . This is exactly like & quot ; Chet & quot ; by Chet Baker . It just does n't get any better.You will love this , and if you give it the chance , you will understand what I mean .	1
During the mid-50s , Miles Davis out out a series ofQuintet which are worth gold today . I have 'em all & this one is my fav . You had Miles with his muted trumpet , Trane on tenor , Red Garland on piano , Paul Chambers-bass & the great Philly Joe Jones on drums . If you are judged by the company you keep , Miles had a gold mine here.This is `` the quinteswsential groups output from one day 's marathon recording session . '' It shows the outstanding talents of Trane who was just emerging as a great tenor man.I wo n't discuss the name of the tunes . It 's not the tune you play in the world of jazz , but what the guys do with it that matters.Thank you for reading my review , & I hope you will get this album & the other `` Miles ' Quintet '' gigs , like `` Workiin ' , etc .	1
Relaxin ' is a great record . the performances are smooth as silk and the playing is superb . it 's not quite as good as Workin ' ; which is my personal favorite of all these 1956 Miles Davis Quintet albums ; but ... you ca n't go wrong with this timeless and enjoyable slice of jazz history .	1
Miles Davis , John Coltrane , Philly Joe Jones , Red Garland and Paul Chambers formed one of the truely immortal groups in jazz history . This session which was recorded in the famous Rudy Van Gelder studio in 1956 was one in a series of recordings that the quintet made during the summer-fall of 1956 . The other recordings that this famous group made was Steamin , Workin and Walkin . What a series they made , and all of the recordings are an absolute must have to the serious Miles Davis/Jazz enthusiast.Highlights of this wonderful recording are & quot ; If I were A Bell & quot ; , & quot ; Oleo & quot ; , and & quot ; It Could Happen To You & quot ; . But each and every song are a pure delight . Highly , highly recommended .	1
I love all four of these 1957 Prestige Classics - Workin ' , Steamin ' , Cookin ' and my personal favorite Relaxin ' . On top of being one very talented trumpet player with such a singular , smooth sound , Miles always knew how to pick a great band , the perfect , confluent machine . He had an ear like Sinatra , and like Frank , Miles benefited greatly by having such great groups backing him up . Then again , who would n't want to play behind those cats ? ! These are four of my favorites , a quartet of hall-of-famers anyone would be gaga playing with - Red Garland , John Coltrane , Paul Chambers , and Philly Joe Jones.Miles is at his muted best , he is stellar throughout and his performance on `` If I Were A Bell '' is a work of art . Coltrane , the young , blossoming big gun to-be was a bit more temperate back then , but very clean all the same and I really enjoyed him on this one . Out of the four recordings that came from these sessions , this was his best effort in my opinion . The lyrical Red Garland performs perfectly throughout , as he and Philly Joe play together magnificently . I always thought Philly Joe saved his best for Miles . Those of you who have read some of my past jazz reviews are probably weary by now of all of the accolades I have bestowed upon Paul Chambers . However , no amount of embellishment can do that man justice . He is just that great.This is one of the gems of jazz music and a definite must-own for anyone who considers themselves a fan of Miles . As he was quoted saying in his autobiography `` Miles '' , ` That was some great music we made at both sessions and I 'm really proud of it today . '' You should have been proud Mr. Davis , very proud .	1
Miles recorded some amazing albums prior to Kind of Blue , and some , such asMiles AheadandPorgy And Bessare seminal works . However , this album speaks to me like no other.On the surface , there is nothing groundbreaking about the song selection . There are no Miles Davis or John Coltrane compositions . Ironically , the one composition written by a tenor saxophonist , Oleo , was written by Sonny Rollins . All of the tracks are standards , although the ballads are fertile territory for Miles.As a drummer I probably should be waxing enthusiastic about Philly Joe Jones and Paul Chambers , but the member of the rhythm section that most excites me is Red Garland . I love Red 's playing.Why this album speaks to me , though , is the energy between and among the musicians . Everyone seems to be totally in tune with each other and the album comes across as single , live session . It is n't - four of the tracks were recorded five months apart from the remaining two . Perhaps part of the synergy does stem from the fact that there were only two sessions - one in May and one in October.Each track stands on its own . What is remarkable is how the quintet took six standards and added elements of the sensual , exciting and even familiar comfort to them . It would have been easy for them to have given less of themselves considering the material , but , instead they created a masterpiece .	1
THis Disc is Rich in Sound & amp ; Quality.Miles Plays with Such Passion & amp ; Energy.His Band is Very Top Notch as well.Strong Chemistry makes for Classic Music.this is in a Long , Long , Long , Line Of Great Albums From this Genius.Not Only Was He Banging on His Instrument but His Genius at getting the Right Players is Amazing as well.Nobody Before or Since has had as Many Great Players Alongside as Miles.Maybe Duke Ellington & amp ; James Brown but Overall You Got ta Give Miles The Edge at Having the Best Talent Around.He is The MAN !	1
I first listened to this for real all the way through whilst i was hung over laying on my mattress on the floor in college at 10am . I had come back from class which i somehow managed to get to and take notes at.My room provided a great sanctuary type atmosphere over a huge tree and since it was spring i had my window opened.I felt proud having this emenate from my window so early ( for college ) and so loud that my hangover headache dissapeared.Every note floated off the speaker and Miles ' muted trumpet is like heaven sullen silent but yet still flowing.Words are hard to come by when describing my first listening of this album in this state at this time but it was definately otherworldly.I was readily familar with KIND OF BLUE and loved the smooth transitions but this was even better at the time though i still consider KIND OF BLUE better.Remember Miles and Philly Joe , Coltrane are still in a real Bop fire state of mind at this time and come thru with stellar hellfire on a couple of tracks but as its name suggest RELAXIN ' strives to be subdued and does so fantasticly ... Before KIND OF BLUE there was RELAXIN ' is the best statement you can make	1
right from the opening tones of & quot ; if i were a bell , & quot ; miles and company ( the classic quintet with john coltrane , red garland , paul chambers , and philly joe jones ) set the tone for a quietly swinging set of cool jazz . miles continued to explore his own version of cool jazz ( much more bop oriented than west coast jazz ) , but here the sound is becoming even more uncategorizable , more distinctly miles ' own voice and timbre . he explores melody and themes finding his own phrasing and expansions , leaving plenty of room for the song to develop as it will . in sum , he uses silence as part of the form , like ahmad jamal , for instance , creating tension and setting fires within the tune . the band is stellar and one can hear coltrane getting his own voice , as well , laying the foundations for what was to come in a few years . well worth any price !	1
Along with Steamin , Workin , and Cookin , & quot ; Relaxin & quot ; offers an up close and personal look at Miles ' group ca . 1955 , in their transition phase between Prestige and Columbia records.From the opening chimes of & quot ; If I were A Bell , & quot ; Miles dominates the proceedings as only he can- his tone , sense of time , style , and the use of his famous Harmon Mute never better . He was definitely a man on a mission , and his leadership on his trumpet is simply astounding.The band also cooks on saxophonist Sonny Rollins ' staple & quot ; Oleo & quot ; ( as in oleo margarine , for the kids out there..a simple form of clarified margarine ) , with Chambers ' fast walking bass complimenting Philly Joe Jones ' incomperable drumming , complete with his famous & quot ; Philly Licks & quot ; ( playing rim shots versus the snare to keep the beat going ) . & quot ; I Could Write a Book & quot ; is highlighted by great interplay between Miles , drummer Jones , and bassist Paul Chambers.The rest of the lp comprises slower , more laid back numbers , right for , well..relaxin , I suppose.A wonderful lp of great material , & quot ; Relaxin , & quot ; like the other 3 lps of the series , showcase Miles and the group enjoying themselves greatly . The results show as much .	1
Two takes of the title track open this minor classic . Milt & quot ; Bags & quot ; Jackson on vibes , Thelonious Monk on piano , and bop pioneers bassist Percy Heath and drummer Kenny Clarke join Miles ' cool toned trumpet to give both takes definative treatments . This is the infamous session where Miles asked Monk to lay out , or not play behind , his solos . Whatever the studio controversy may have been , the music certainly did not suffer as everyone is in top form . The last five tracks come from a session recorded six months earlier and features a pair of future legends in Sonny Rollins ' tenor and Horace Silver 's piano . Heath 's bass and Clarke 's drums remain as the rock solid rhythm section . This set features a trio of Rollins ' originals and one standard . Rollins is already displaying the form that would make him the top young tenor through the late fifties . He delivers masterful solos on his future standards & quot ; Airegin & quot ; and & quot ; Oleo & quot ; , infusing a spark and a swing that picks up the pace from the more laid back title cut . Silver displays his genius with a funky piano solo on & quot ; Oleo & quot ; . Miles ' tone is typical of this period . His parched mute , and laid back middle register solos the very definition of cool . This cd is another underrated gem from the period between & quot ; Birth of the Cool & quot ; , and his break through quintet sessions with Coltrane , Garland , Chambers , and Jones . This music is easily recommended to fans of the & quot ; Cool & quot ; school of jazz as well as those of the artists involved . Anyone who enjoys this cd is encouraged to check out its companion set , & quot ; Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants & quot ; which features more of the session with Monk and Bags .	1
The album title is a nod to vibraphonist Milt `` Bags '' Jackson , who appears on the album with Sonny Rollins ( s ) , Thelonious Monk ( p ) , Horace Silver ( p ) , Percy Heath ( b ) and Kenny Clarke ( d ) . The seven cuts - including two versions each of Bags ' Groove and But Not For Me - clock in at 45:53.Miles showcases the incredible songwriting talents of Rollins by recording Airegin , Oleo and Doxy . The two takes of the title cut are groove masters , but Rollins takes the spotlight through his work with pen & paper and the sax.The Prestige-era for Miles has a number of intriguing hard bop sides and this album again demonstrates the fabulous compositions , musicians and studio work that defined a generation .	1
This is a nice little album featuring Milt Jackson ( Bags ) , on two takes of the title track . He is masterful on vibes , and it 's a shame he did n't do much more on this release . The other tracks are pretty much fillers . One of my favorite songs from the time is `` Airegin '' written by Sonny Rollins ( which is really just Nigeria spelled backwards ) . However , this version is nowhere near as good as the take on the album , `` Cookin ' with the Miles Davis Quintet . '' The latter version is hard bop and this one is a lot more tame . Honorable Mention goes out to `` Oleo '' but I would look elsewhere for early Miles.If you read up on jazz history , you 'll find out that PRESTIGE was a label for heroin addicts who needed fast cash to score a fix and it shows in the majority of the recordings I own on the label . Apparently , the musicians got paid in cash on the day of the recording , but were only allowed two takes at the most . There are some highpoints on the label , though , and `` Bags Groove '' is one of them .	1
There are a multitude of reasons why Bags ' Groove remains a cornerstone of the post-bop genre . Of course there will always be the lure of the urban myth surrounding the Christmas Eve 1954 session -- featuring Thelonious Monk -- which is documented on the two takes of the title track . There are obviously more tangible elements , such as Davis ' practically telepathic runs with Sonny Rollins ( tenor sax ) . Or Horace Silver 's ( piano ) uncanny ability to provide a stream of chord progressions that supply a second inconspicuous lead without ever overpowering . Indeed , Davis ' choice of former Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra and concurrent Modern Jazz Quartet members Milt Jackson ( vibes ) , Kenny Clarke ( drums ) , and Percy Heath ( bass ) is obviously well-informed . This combo became synonymous with the ability to tastefully improvise and provide bluesy bop lines in varied settings . The up-tempo and Latin-infused syncopation featured during the opening of `` Airegin '' flows into lines and minor-chord phrasings that would reappear several years later throughout Davis ' Sketches of Spain epic . The fun and slightly maniacally toned `` Oleo '' features one of Heath 's most impressive displays on Bags ' Groove . His staccato accompaniment exhibits the effortless nature with which these jazz giants are able to incorporate round after round of solos onto the larger unit . Bags ' Groove belongs as a cornerstone of all jazz collections . Likewise , the neophyte as well as the seasoned jazz enthusiast will find much to discover and rediscover throughout the disc . The remastered CD includes both historic takes of `` Bags ' Groove '' as well as one additional rendering of the pop standard `` But Not for Me . ''	1
Wow ! What an album ( CD ) this truely is a recording of great Jazz giants that the world will never see again . Miles Davis is outstanding as always on this , Theolonius Monk adds his signature twist on the piano and Milt Jackson on the vibes makes this a MUST have recording for Jazz fans . The rest of the group include Horace Silver , Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke that are each giants in the Jazz world . Although Miles and Theolonius did n't get along , the first two songs on this recording & quot ; Bags Groove & quot ; and its alternate take , definitely groove to the sound . Each of the artists trade off riffs with each other and then they blend wonderfully well . The rest of the songs are wonderful to listen to . This is an expensive CD , but is well worth the money to spend on it . The remastering is outstanding and the clarity of sound is perfect . It almost sounds like the listener is in the studio with these artists when they record it . As stated before , this is a MUST get for any fans of great beebop or great Jazz in general .	1
This is without doubt one of Miles 's finest recordings , although he left so many of a superb quality that it is easy to engage in hyperboles every time . But I have no doubt that his solos on each of the title takes ( `` Bag 's Groove '' , Milt Jackson 's great tune ) are among his best and most lastingly satisfying . He plays , on those , with a beautifully clear , open horn , showing wonderful sense of direction at all times , producing truly inventive phrasing , and subtlety of a kind only he knows how to . There is deep emotion in his playing , but always of a controlled kind , and in remarkable taste . He certainly is one of jazz 's greatest masters , and his work , when it is at his best , as here , is truly fulfilling . The other musicians on these two tracks are pretty well on a par : Monk very definitely so , playing just as individualistically and profoundly as Davis . It is an interesting note that these were the two tracks where Davis told Monk to stay silent while he was soloing , which Monk did not appreciate . In truth , though , Davis was probably right to think that both he and Monk would flower forth more when presenting their own solos , and at the end of the day I feel it is Monk who plays the second track more differently from the first than does anyone else . Jackson is also in great form : dazzlingly fluent without superficiality , swinging with great refinement and assurance . The other tracks , i.e . `` Oleo '' etc. , are played without Monk and Jackson : thus Horace Silver stars on piano , in his typically `` funky '' , articulate and soulfully driving way , and Sonny Rollins is also heard to great advantage , though his best work was still to come ( which means that he is already no less than excellent here ) . The bassist , throughout , is Percy Heath , and the drummer Kenny Clarke , and they do very fine work on all the tracks . A totally rewarding and satisfying recording , unhesitatingly recommended for decades of great listening ( I have enjoyed it many times since its appearance in 1954 ) . - Joost Daalder	1
FYI : If you love this CD , you may want to consider buying the Thelonious Monk `` Complete Prestige '' 3-CD set , because CD 3 from `` Complete Prestige '' contains the entire Christmas Eve session from which the fantastic `` Bags Groove '' comes from . Then you do n't have to program a mix between Bags Groove and Miles Davis & the Jazz Giants CD .	1
Bags ' Groove title cut ( both takes ) was recorded in the same December 24 1954 session that gave us Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants . This is Miles , just as he was getting himself together . Miles ' deeply personal tone can be heard in its early stages . The remaining CD tracks are by a quintet that includes Sonny Rollins , Percy Heath , Kenny Clarke , and Horace Silver . I believe it would have been a more consistent release to put both Modern Jazz Giants and Bags ' Groove out as a single set but that 's life I guess . The notes on this package , considering it 's a limited 10,000 copy edition , are rather scant and there are n't any photos . But the music is great . I have to admit that I do n't really understand what Monk is doing with his solo on both takes but that 's ok too . If you are a Miles Davis fan , especially of the classic first Quintet , then you must own Bags ' Groove as well as The Modern Jazz Giants releases .

the talent assembled with Miles Davis here is solid.worth a Listen for it 's Mellowness and the solos.not as strong as Later Recordings but still worthy of repeated Listens.it is cool .	1
The 1954 album Bags Groove by Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants , who feature Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins , among others , is one of the best albums of the Miles Davis ' early career . The band is incredible , with some of the top musicians of the time and of all time . The songs Doxy and But Not For Me are the least impressive songs on the album and are n't very strong , which slightly hurts the album , but not too much . The title track is great with some inspired trumpet playing by Miles . The two Sonny Rollins tunes , Airegin and Oleo are the highlights of the album . Both are really great songs that would become standards for both Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis . True , this is not the best album by Miles Davis , and maybee not even one of the best . It is still great , however , and is worth it just to hear Miles and Sonny soloing being backed by Monk .	1
Basically , the entire CD is excellent , but since two inital numbers ( two takes of `` Bags ' Groove '' ) are so much superior to the rest of the CD , I simply loose interest in the follow-up songs ... The reasons for this are simple - not only do the rest of the songs lack Milt Jackson ( `` BAGS '' who wrote the first tune ) , on the rest of this fine CD Thelonious Monk is replaced by Horace Silver who ( although a great player ) is simply not that kind of genius.The most bizarre thing is that Miles did n't like Monk 's playing behind him ! He insisted that Monk kept his hands of the piano during the leader 's solos ! However , this is not so strange - great minds often disagree and , in addition to that , Miles ' approach to the trumpet sound throuoght the greatest portion of his carreer ( prior to his fusion-rock-electronics phase ) is quite lyrical in nature . Monk 's wry and cynical analysis of tunes he played is anything but lyrical ( btw ; in his `` autobiography '' called simply `` Miles '' , Davis explains how he had nothing but love and respect for Monk 's music , but it simply did n't fit with his style ) .Nevertheless , Monk sounds equally brilliant while soloing and while accompanying Milt Jackson ( and he did a fine job as Clark Terry 's sideman on another great album ) so I guess he might have worked well with Miles as well , making this somewhat incoherent album quite historical ...	1
I just received this remastered classic from Amazon and it is ASTOUNDING ! I ca n't believe it took me so long to pick this up . Miles sounds as good as I 've ever heard him and the rest of the musicians are also at their best particularly Milt Jackson on the title track . Monk sounds a bit tentative and the story is that Miles asked him to sit out while he took his solo but Monk came through when it was his time to comp behind Jackson 's solo and take his own solo . He sounds inventive and unmistakably Monk . Horace Silver and Sonny Rollins both sound wonderful and the tracks where they are featured really swing . The heart of this fine CD is the incredible rhythm section of Percy Heath and Keny Clarke . These guys were rock solid throughout this session and with the remastering Heath 's bass lines just jump through the speakers.Do not hesitate to purchase this . You will be glad you did .	1
This had to have been a most bizarre session , what with Miles telling Monk to lay out during his solos and all..BUT Miles was a man with something to prove at this point..he had more or less kicked his heroin habit and was on the road to full musical recovery , as well , when these sessions went down ( 29 June and Christmas Eve 1954 ) .The tracks are wonderful , with Milt Jackson 's famous & quot ; Bag 's Groove & quot ; leading the way . ( reocrded X-Mas eve ) With the exception of Monk playing in John Lewis ' place , this is Miles recording with the original Modern Jazz Quartet ( Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke bass and drums , as well as vibraphonist Jackson ) - which could also explain why Miles wanted Monk to lay out ... The rhythm section is solid , and Miles ' playing great , if not inspired . Jackson 's vibes hold the piece together nicely . Alas , other takes from that session , including Monk 's & quot ; Bemsha swing , & quot ; & quot ; Swing Spring , & quot ; and & quot ; The Man I Love , & quot ; were not included on this cd ... Sonny Rollins ' & quot ; Oleo & quot ; is another highlight ( recorded 29 June with Rollins on tenor , Horace Silver on piano , with Heath and Clarke ) and shows both Sonny and Miles in great form . Rollins was THE rising tenor star , and this track , as well as & quot ; Airegin , & quot ; & quot ; But Not For Me , & quot ; and & quot ; Doxy , & quot ; prove full well ; a year later , Miles would want Rollins to be in his 1st quintet , but Rollins , like many others in that era , had a heroin problem and would retreat ( not for the last time ) to clean up and & quot ; woodshed & quot ; ... Rollins suggested an unknown named John Coltrane for Miles ' group ... ... The cd is not as critical to have as others , but it is a great time period cd , showing Miles ' growth from just a few months earlier , when he was on heroin . His playing is weak at moments , but vastly stronger , as was Miles ' will and creativity . He would n't have to wait long before he would express his ideas to the world with his 1st great quintet	1
`` Bags ' Groove '' is an awesome recording . The sheer volume of jazz stars speaks for itself . Miles , Monk , Rollins , Milt Jackson , Horace Silver , Kenny Clarke , and Percy Heath . I think those names spark enough praise on their own . Anyone who 's interested in jazz and in particular the bebop movement should pick this album up . Some very swinging , lyrical music . Highly recommended .	1
Does Wes Montgomery live up to the boastful title ? That 's the main question any review should answer . YES . Wes ' playing is generally similar to his other jazz-era ( vs pop-era ) songs . He 's jaw-dropping on the faster songs . Wes is good on the slower songs , though he tends to be too nice . `` The Incredible Jazz Guitar '' is a better album , but `` Boss Guitar '' should be in every fan 's collection . The trio format works out fine . There 's a good reason Grant Green made so many albums with organ - it 's very compatible with guitar . Mel Rhyne gets to take the first solo in `` Dearly Beloved '' and in general provides solid playing . Jimmy Cobb is , as usual , fantastic .	1
Another vote for Boss Guitar for the best Wes Montgomery record of all time . These remastered series are limited , and the sound is so much better than the regular CD that you wont believe it . This is essential listening .	1
In high school `` Stroke You Up '' was the jam , so I went downtown and bought the cassette . Let me tell you something : It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring . Even `` Stroke You Up '' became unbearable to listen to . No funk , no groove- just lukewarm soul . That was the first *and* the last time I listened to `` Changing Faces . '' The two chicks who made up `` Changing Faces '' had airy , monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all . Even the album cover looked boring . These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all . Skip this at all costs and get Zhane .	-1
cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you ? me either . list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most . I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in . If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews .	-1
I never understood what 's the BIG deal behind this album . Yes , the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish . Brial Wilson definitly can not write great lyrics like Bob Dylan sometimes do . `` God Only Know '' and `` Wouldnt Be nice '' are indeed masterpieces ... but the rest of the album is background music..	-1
It 's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape , but from a second generation copy and DAT . Sonically , it is not bad , but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC . Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile .	-1
I am very disapointed ! After looking for this album for 10 years , at least I bought it and ... masterpiece ? C'mon people ! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds ? Any 60 's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better . And something else , if this is the sound that shape the American pop music , I might be wrong , but ... where is Jimi Hendrix , Muddy Waters , Miles Davis , etc ? Those are really masters of American music , not The Beach Boys.I ca n't give to this album more than half star .	-1
It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD . I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just does n't cut it . On the version I borrowed , out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Would n't It Be Nice , Caroline No , God Only Knows , and Sloop John B are of high quality . I Know There 's An Answer , Here Today , and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs . The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement . Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin ' USA . Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time . Geeze Louise , this album barely even rocks ! There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef ! fects . It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end . The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals . The lyrics may have some special meanings but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music . How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion , stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys . California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine . However , when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms , the result is a stony bore . Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard .	-1
I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone . Let me say that again . I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone . By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name , singing about the beach , girls , surfing , cars , and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys . It ca n't be . Why ? No beach songs ! I thought it was some kind of joke . All & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes , backed by elevator music . There 's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated .	-1
If you like Alison , you 'll probably like this CD . I found a couple of songs I enjoyed . The rest I ignore ( I recorded the ones I liked on to another source ) . If you are not a big fan of hers , there are better samples of her work .	-1
This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic . I had never heard the song in its entirety , and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long . Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs , but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole . This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks . I guess they 're still trying to make their money back from the first press . Did n't even include credits , and no lyrics in the package .	-1
Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean 's final run at chart success . The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80 's , `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' . It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80 's , but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun , innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days . It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr . Ocean had a top ten single . He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90 's as most 80 's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise .	-1
As a child and young adult when I tended to believe that all `` alternative '' music was basically noisy , unlistenable grunge likeNirvanaorEverclearorThe Presidents Of The USA , the pop songs of my 1980s childhood occupied my attention because they were the most readily available alternative . I used to adore the big hits on `` Greatest Hits '' and said they were my favourite songs.Today , however , as an experienced music listener , it is very clear to me that the material here is awfully dated and shallow . The huge beats on `` When The Going Gets Tough '' , which was his only # 1 hit , and his second biggest hit `` Get Out Of My Dreams '' were really catchy and even enchanting to me as a child , but if I listen to them now in the library at Melbourne University they seem awfully dated . The same is true of the earlier `` Carribbean Queen '' , whilst `` License To Chill '' is even worse in this respect.The slower material , to which Billy 's `` big '' voice was never suited , comes off as even worse . I always thought `` Here 's To You '' and `` Loverboy '' were terribly soppy , and it 's easy to imagine how I would feel about them nowadays.This is something I want to note as something I have given up , and it is so dated with its big beat dance track and so soppy on the ballads that one should steer clear of it .	-1
this disc is okay but it does n't show the talent & amp ; depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who deserves better .	-1
Should have been called disappointment , BDP is no PE . KRS1 's ` knowledge ' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric , not so cleverly put to music . KRS1 was always more ` preacher ' than ` teacher ' , inviting obedience rather than introspection . Here , in ` Ya Strugglin ' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates .	-1
The commercial failure of KRS1s didactic venom is a tribute to the good taste of American rap fans . He has done better .	-1
Aaliyah is not much of a singer but she has a style about her in her delievery that makes her credible.i really liked Back & amp ; fourth.R.Kelly dominates all thru this disc.she has a certain it about her that Brandy , Monica , Myia , etcc.. do n't .	-1
I HATE E-40 , BUT THE TRACK WITH 2 PAC IS GOOD.THE 2 STARS ARE ONLY FOR THAT SONG.DO N'T BUY THIS JUNK TRUST ME .	-1
Before I get any hate mail , I would like to state for the record that I own a copy of this CD . I am not bashing this CD because I love *NSYNC . In fact , I do n't intend to truly be bashing this CD in anyway . These are just my feelings about this particular album.Now , here I go : This CD is awful ! The production alone merits this as a single star . The drums and background portions of the music drowned out the vocals.The vocals are somewhat okay . Most of the album is done through their noses and , being a musician myself , this drives me crazy . When it is n't done through their noses , they strain their vocal cords ... which makes it even worse ! And could Nick be any flatter on half of the notes ? The actual songs -- the music of the songs and the lyrics -- are n't that great . They 're full of grammatical errors . There are also some points when the harmonies do n't blend correctly.This CD sounds like it was thrown together in a matter of seconds and had no hard work or effort put into it . I strongly recommend that you avoid this CD .	-1
The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music . 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent ! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy . & quot ; quit Playing Games with my heart & quot ; a great song has an rnB feel to it . & quot ; As long as you love me & quot ; Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy ! . & quot ; all i have to give & quot ; fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it . & quot ; everybody & quot ; the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain . The rest suck . Im sorry But after Artist like & quot ; Prince & quot ; , & quot ; Stevie Wonder & quot ; , & quot ; Michael Jackson & quot ; Paved the way for these young swill Merchants . You think Anyone Would make good music . Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended . if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent . these morons do n't and Im out !	-1
It 's amazing how these guys keep fooling people . I ask you : do they write their songs ? Or some clever professional songwriter do that for them ? I have absolutely nothing against ballads and pop , but when that sounds a complete fake , that pisses me off !	-1
Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack & amp ; The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands .	-1
I 'm not gon na say that I expected better of this album , because I seriously didn't.I knew this album was going to be the start of a horrible era ... the boyband era ALL OVER AGAIN ! I knew that this album was going to SUCK once I heard `` We Got It Goin ' On '' .But , I have to admit , I tried to be fair and like at least one song , but I just could n't ! Every song is so damn obnoxious and so manufactured , it 's almost as if you 're forced not to like them , unless of course you 're a girl in her teens willing to scream for any group with a little sex appeal.Sure , all the songs make you wan na kill yourself if you actually listen to GOOD music , but the most annoying are definitely `` Everybody ( Backstreets'Back ) ( back from where ? ) '' and the horrible vomit-worthy cover of `` Set Adrift On Memory Bliss '' .And the vocals : Lord save me now ! Nick Carter sounds like a deeper version of Alanis Morisette on crack ( sorry for insulting a music genius like you , Alanis ) ! I ca n't think of one good thing about this trash except that you actually like the songs for about 3 seconds until you come back to reality.Sure , they 're a manufactured boy band and that 's bad enough , but they could 've at least given a 2-star effort ! The Verdict : Why this sold so much is beyond me ! Recommended : I think you know my answer !	-1
Say what you will , but it 's patently unfair to say that the Backstreet Boys ` suck ' . Granted , those of us who have been raised on rock and roll will find it difficult to ascertain the musical appeal of five performers posing as a band , singing pseudo-soulless versions of pre-packaged pop emotional swill , but we are n't their target audience . These guys , or rather the people who have manipulated them into the image that they represent , have targeted them straight at the heart of pre-teen youth culture , and as such , they have done a better than admirable job . For those of us who might have selective memories , there have been other , MUCH worse examples of teen-based music that pre-dates the Backstreet Boys - Would anybody care to remember the Osmond Brothers ? Leif Garrett ? Fabian ? In comparison , the Backstreet Boys are downright respectable . While music by the aforementioned has been thoroughly forgotten , I think that the Backstreet Boys have done their job well enough to survive the ravages of time . So , for all the naysayers who dismiss the Backstreet Boys as irrelevant , I 'll try not to say I told you so when you find yourself humming along nostalgically to `` Quit Playing Games With My Heart '' in another five years , or `` As Long as You Love Me '' .

I Got Next is probably the last album from KRS-One that anyone owns ( although I 'm not sure if anyone will admit they own this ) . I listened to this album when I first bought it in '97 , and I did n't really think it was all that ... a shocker because KRS usually comes correct . But then I listened to it again and ... well , I did n't realize just how bad it was.When artists release classic albums at the beginning of their career and then some of their following albums do n't even come close ( and they usually do n't ) , people say that 's an unfair comparison because they ca n't be expected to live in the past , or , `` How can you compare this to THAT ? '' ( Check comparing any Nas album , or ANY album , to Illmatic . ) But after hearing this album , you 'll REALLY wish Kris stuck to his old style . There are many interludes where Kris is preaching , and they just do n't seem to fit . And the only real saving graces on this album are `` Heartbeat '' ( with Angie Martinez and Redman , who once again steals the show ) , `` The MC '' , and `` Step Into A World '' , even though the latter 's music is slightly irritating.The rest of the album is a downer . The production AND rapping are surprisingly bad . And I 'm not saying the rapping is bad because he stopped swearing , because his last album was all right ( remember `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' ? ) ; here , it 's hard to tell if he even tried . `` Blowe '' has a very unnecessary and incomprehensible skit at the beginning , and the music sounds like the batteries in somebody 's walkman suddenly went dead . KRS 's rapping is tired here , and even Redman comes off wack . It 's hard to tell if the title track is a rap or a low-budget movie , and you 'd be slapped silly if you were caught singing along to `` H.I.P.H.O.P . '' or `` The Real Hip-Hop Part II '' ( what great titles , huh ? ) .When Kris does come through on the lyrics , the tracks are ruined by the sleepy production , especially in `` A Friend '' ( when it was released , everyone pretended to like it ) and `` Over Ya Head '' ( the trumpet does n't fit and you almost expect KRS to start singing ) . But the two last tracks are the worst . `` Just To Prove A Point '' is mixing rap and rock . That 's commonplace NOW , but back then it did n't sound right , and it especially does n't sound right for HIM to be screaming like a rock star . He 's not even on any kind of beat . The final track is a remix of `` Step Into A World '' featuring Puff Daddy . Puff is being his typical wack self , but it also rubs off on KRS . And what 's KRS-One doing with Puff Daddy anyway ? Overall , this album is worse than I remembered it . I still kept in mind what year this album was made before I wrote this review , but like I said before , I did n't like it back then either . I hoped KRS would redeem himself with subsequent albums , but according to reviews , those albums are n't great either , and record sales show that they 're just collecting dust anyway . Wherever the real KRS-One is hiding , I wish he 'd come out .	-1
P. diddy should 've never be in a krs record i kinda felt like krs was tryin to sell out wit diz album ... Good tracks `` the mc '' & `` a friend '' krs even did a rock track ... Skip diz and get all his other albums .	-1
The best album ever , PLEASE , this album is not even close to being good . Of the 17 songs on here , 2 are good , about 6 are ok , and the rest are just plain bad . My least favorite No Limit cd of the 15 or so I have ( clkose with Snoop 's `` Da Game Is to Be Sold ... '' album ) . Not even the No Limit guests ( which oddly there are n't nearly as many as any other release ) can bring this up to even an ok album . Yeah Mr. Puzzleface can rap fast but that do n't make him good . His flow is way off beat and he ca n't rap either , and the sad part is this is his best cd . Production is decent , but not as good as Beats by the Pound crew usually is ( the wack rapper on the mic is probably the main reason ) . Craig B does 6 songs , KLC does 5 , O'Dell does 2 , and Rick Rock , DJ Darryl , Studio Ton , and Legendary Traxster all do 1 . So when he asks -- Did I Do It ? I answer yes , you made a horrible cd . Unless for some odd reason you 're one of the bunch of idiots who like him or comemrcial down south music save you money and ear drums on this one. # 1 - 8 ( f/ Master P , Silkk the Shocker , Fiend , Mac ) # 2 - 7 ( about his murdered sister ) # 3 - 6 # 4 - 6 # 5 - 7 ( f/ Silkk the Shocker ) # 6 - 5 ( f/ master P & Silkk the Shocker ) # 7 - 4 # 8 - 5 ( f/ E-40 , B-Legit , Master P ) # 9 - 4 ( f/ Mia X ) # 10 - 7.5 # 11 - 6.5 # 12 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) # 13 - 6 # 14 - 4.5 ( f/ O'Dell ) # 15 - 7 ( nice beat ) # 16 - 5.5 ( f/ Snoop Dogg & Master P ) # 17 - 7 ( deeper song ) Michael Tyler -- New Orleans , LAcheck all my reviews	-1
this was my least favorite 2pac album . that doesnt mean it wasnt good . it was . but i thought it was a dissappointment . some of the songs were pretty whack . there were a lot of songs that i really liked . disc 1 contained most of the good songs like open fire , r u still down , where do we go from here , ... i wonder if heaven got a ghetto , nothng 2 lose , and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor . that song was deep and real . disc 2 songs were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix , when i get free II , ... enemies with me , ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death . i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that . when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cds . overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album . i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been A LOT better.by 2pacs # 1 fan	-1
Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9 , only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 ( Heaven ) . This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac 's early work , most tracks were made around the times of `` 2Pacalypse Now '' and `` Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z ... '' , and it shows . Although Tupac ( as always ) comes with it lyrically ( for the most part ) , this album - like his old albums , suffers from poor production . But this LP is still a solid buy , it is just below average overall as an LP . Records like `` Do 4 Me '' and `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto ( remix ) '' , alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album .	-1
Well this is not quite the best Tupac album ever . Im not saying its bad im just saying compared to albums he has put out in the past for example & # 65533 ; All eyez on me & # 65533 ; and & # 65533 ; Me against the world & # 65533 ; this album is not as good.Ru still down features two disks but one must say that if they had just added the best songs onto one disk this album would have been better.For me standout tracks on this album are first off from disk 1 , Open fire , the title track R U Still Down ( remember me ) , I wonder if heaven got a ghetto and to be honest I can only pick out one good song from disk 2 which is Do For Love.Its not really a good example of what Tupac was really about . The beats are lame at times and don & # 65533 ; t really appreciate Tupac & # 65533 ; s lyrical capabilities . Saying that this album is way better than some albums other artists have been releasing and one the reasons I am a bit disappointed with this album is because of the quality of past projects . It really does give you the idea that someone has just put these songs together and hope they will please fans because Tupac is singing it.If someone picked up this album and had not heard of Tupac before this moment they wouldn & # 65533 ; t think much of it and it would be left picking up dust.If you really love Tupac you should get this album but personally if I were you I would try to find someone that has it and just borrow it off them for a few days . A bit disappointing .	-1
This band is truly terrible . First off , the music is terrible . It 's soft and wimpy and lacks any musical credibility . I 'm not just saying this because I hate punk . I do n't see how anyone can like this . The singer ( or singers ) have no excuse to BE singing . Do n't believe me ? Check out & quot ; Daddy Was a Rich Man & quot ; . Or pretty much any of their songs . The lyrics are so ridiculous . I appreciate anti-political manifesto very much . The reason they are ridiculous is because they could n't have made it more obvious that they do n't know what they 're talking about . All they do is whine . What 's the matter , guys ? Did n't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted ? They would n't let you take the car out last night ? What a joke ! As is all punk rock with the exception of a select few who decide to rise above the punk cliche . You want angry music with actual TALENT ? Listen to metal .	-1
Punk has had a long and proud tradition of being involved in left-wing radical politics . However , the best punk bands were n't just about the preachy lyrics ; they combined the polemics with a distinctive and memorable sound . Joe Strummer of The Clash knew this , as did Jello Biafra ( Dead Kennedys ) and D. Boon and Mike Watt ( Minutemen ) .Anti-Flag apparently does n't realize this . These guys hang their hat on their & quot ; radical & quot ; lyrics and not much else . Note that MANY punk and metal bands prior to Anti-Flag were spewing similar political invective with far more wit , flair , and intelligence than this band 's ham-handed , juvenile anthems . It does n't help Anti-Flag 's case that they frequently approach open hypocrisy . Case in point : Anti-Flag claim to be anti-violence . Riiiight . With songs titled & quot ; Kill The Rich , & quot ; how am I supposed to take this swill seriously ? Moreover , the music is just godawful . Yes , I realize punk is supposed to be amateurish , but this is plain terrible , not to mention about as & quot ; edgy & quot ; as a teddy bear . I 've heard junior high school NOFX ripoffs play better than this . Anti-Flag apparently has two singers , but both suck equally , and the band sounds about as instrumentally proficient as I am ( not very ) .In summary , Anti-Flag is another batch of inept fashion & quot ; punks & quot ; regurgitating the same ol ' protests and trying to pass them off as & quot ; rebellious. & quot ; Sorry , I 'm not falling for it . Spend your lawn-mowing money wisely kids , and pick up records by The Clash , Dead Kennedys , Black Flag , Bad Brains , Minutemen , Wire , MC5 etc . Your listening will be all the better for it .	-1
I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint , but this CD left me cold . If Drake ca n't be bothered to show a little emotion on this , he should n't have bothered to record it .	-1
This guy got passed me back in the day , even though I basically bought every album that came out back in the 60s and 70s . I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere , so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake . His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD . Quite frankly I find this to be interesting , but not something I would recomend to everybody . The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room , and it is a flatliner . I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of `` I wan na leave this world stuff '' but I get enough of it quick . Drake 's guitar work was a bit unique in it 's time , but as many times as I try , I just ca n't quite get with this program . It is good to listen to and then take a nap .	-1
I am a huge fan of Nick Drake but this is my least favorite of his albums and I have rarely listened to it since getting it ten years ago . In fact , I 'm glad this was n't the first disc of his that I purchased or I probably would n't have bought any of his other albums . This album is way too overproduced . The best example is `` At The Chime of a City Clock '' which starts out strong but is overwhelmed by the riffing saxaphone after each line sung by Nick Drake from the second verse on . The first time I heard `` Hazey Jane II '' I could n't believe it was Nick Drake it was so downright cheesy and dated . The instrumentals on this disc border on easy listening also , which ai n't my style . The only songs worth hearing are `` Northern Sky '' ( one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard ) and `` Fly '' , although I prefer the home version he recorded at Tanworth in Arden in 1969 to the studio version . It 's interesting that John Cale was a guest on this album , but the results overall were subpar compared to the rest of Nick Drake 's recorded work . I do n't think it 's a coincidence that Nick Drake 's follow up to `` Bryter Layter '' was the extremely sparse `` Pink Moon '' album . I think it was a direct reaction to the overproduction that weakened his songs on `` Bryter Layter '' . `` Pink Moon '' benefits from the setting of just Nick Drake and his guitar , while the songs here are marred and dated by the arrangements . I do n't understand why anyone would rate this as Nick Drake 's best work . While I would n't hesitate to recommend Nick Drake 's music to anyone , I would n't recommend starting here . Try `` Five Leaves Left '' or `` Pink Moon '' first .	-1
Apparently , a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration . That sense of despair , that sense of loneliness , irrelevance , that kind of thing ... Maybe that 's one reason why they walk around like tramps , loud-mouthed and stupid . The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage , Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression . But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound . Some bits are higher tempo and , so , more uplifting . The instrument playing is precise , like Drake 's voice , carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches . I ca n't really pick out the highlights because it 's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen . It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful , melancholic , classic on anybody 's list .	-1
This album had such a reputation that I could not miss it . What I must say , this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes ; or most other people I 'm sad to say . The songs are tuneless , melancholic droning without any distinct structure . Pink Moon is the only redeemable track . Nick Drake the 'tortured ' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone , but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record.If you 're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare . At least his songs have beautiful melody , harmonies , instrumentals.etc .	-1
I go waaaaay back with Bruce , back when his albums were all hard-to-find imports . I stopped buying him after the disappointment of BIG CIRCUMSTANCE ... and NOTHING BUT ... and DART TO THE HEART . Seems like he was still writing great music but I was n't connecting with it.So I 'm catching up and re-listening to everything after WORLD OF WONDERS . And realize I 'm not missing much . As always , his lyrics are exceptional but this is a dreary , monotone album where he & # 34 ; speak sings & # 34 ; pretty much throughout . & # 34 ; Pacing the Cage & # 34 ; is the & # 34 ; old Bruce & # 34 ; and a great , great song.The rest lacks hooks , melodies or refrains . Best to sit back and slip on the headphones and listen to his stories . You wo n't sing along but at least you 're listening to an artist . Not at all at the top of his game though .	-1
& quot ; Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ? ) & quot ; and & quot ; How Much I 've Lied & quot ; -- the tunes that open and close this collection , respectively -- are bold , affecting interpretations ; but the ones that come between them are misguided , poorly performed horrors . The whole thing 's like bad sandwhich : tasty bread , but the middle 's just junk food ... .	-1
This record was probably the beginning of the end for Costello the conflicted song conqueror . Apparantly his television duet with George Jones ( the b-side Stranger in the House ) pumped a bit too much Nashville into his veins . The songs on this album , which have worked for countless other American singers , do n't gel with Costello 's voice or his band The Attractions ' style . Add hack production from country veteran Billy Sherrill and this compilation ends up completely disasterous . It 's a pity , because Costello was coming off such a huge record with & quot ; Imperial Bedroom & quot ; only to release this mess . Perhaps if Elvis had used a country band ala Clover ( from My Aim is True ) there 's a chance he may have been more insprired . But Englishmen simply can not & quot ; do & quot ; country , not even the gifted Declan MacManus . Besides , if he wanted to release a C & amp ; W record , he would have been better off using the excellent & quot ; King of America & quot ; to support this desire . That album , which featured Americans James Burton and Ron Tutt , contained all original material and displayed the flair and performance Costello seemingly always strives for . The & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; outing is a muddy and boring mess . The reason I say this is Costello , when covering a tune , usually matches or betters the performance of the original artist . In each of these examples , he falls miserably short . Poorly planned and poorly executed , & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; may serve as an adequate primer for the unsophisticated new wave listener unfamiliar with country , but for those who have heard the originals , it 's pretty painful . I think even Elvis Costello would have to agree with that assessment .	-1
I do n't know . I loved EC and I loved country ... I even went to see him on the tour afterwards ... what a waste of my precious time back then ... and of my money . This is self-indulgent and badls played ... I do not understand the point really . Buy some real country instead ... George Jones , Johnny Cash , anything instead ...	-1
I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here . I also love Elvis Costello ; for the past week , I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach , `` Painted From Memory . `` *So with that as a perspective , I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog . Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do , but these songs do n't click , and about none of these covers can stand along side the original . I ca n't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals , but where they fail is in capturing the heart , the spirit , the feel of country music . They sound too much like an experiment . Years later , Van Morrison , another giant , would fail in a similar effort . *For sure , this is not a `` bad '' album , but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums .	-1
It probably seemed like a good idea in retrospect . Elvis wanted to go to Nashville and meet with an icon of a country classic producer , then cut an album of some of his favorites right there in music city . And after cutting some of excellent singles in a country format ( `` Radio Sweetheart '' being one ) , `` Almost Blue '' really could have been a great record.Instead , it was Elvis ' first big misstep of his stellar career . He failed to understand the hack mentality of the Nashville scene , and `` Almost Blue '' is the sound of a 9 to 5 producer ( Billy Sherrill ) trying to shoehorn a band of randy brits into a paint by numbers sound . While the album kicks off like it should ( `` Why Do n't You Love Me Like You Used To ? `` ) , the ensuing album finds the band in a straightjacket . The sole exceptions , naturally , were the ballads . ( `` Good Year for The Roses , '' `` Brown to Blue '' and `` How Much I Lied . '' ) The rest of `` Almost Blue '' then struggles to get out from under the limitations . It left Elvis and the Attractions , who had spent those first three albums exposing themselves as a volatile , high energy creative force , suddenly blanded into cookie cutter recordings robbed of an album worth hearing more than as a vanity project .	-1
Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic , but 'Bedroom ' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings . 'Beyond Belief ' and 'Man Out of Time ' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of ' compilation . 'Long Honeymoon ' , 'Human Hands ' and 'Every Home ' are somewhat interesting . However , beyond that I find little that 's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom ' recordings , thanks in part to Steve Nieve 's scorching work on the ivories . In fact , the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still ' and the toe-tap inducing `` From Head to Toe '' merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites .	-1
It 's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye ' is not one of Costello 's better efforts . I concur , but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists : 'I Wan na Be Loved ' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling , I find the songs musically enjoyable . Love the strange synth feel to ' Wan na ' and even the sax solo . The demo version of 'Only Flame ' on EC 's 'All This Useless Beauty ' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here . Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number . It 's kitschy but fun ! 'The Comedians ' , also recorded by the late Roy Orbison , is about the only other cut of significant interest . Like 'Only Flame ' , the demo version of this song on Rhino 's 'All This Useless Beauty ' bonus disc is better than the one here .	-1
Punch The Clock was an attempt to court the pop charts that worked . Goodbye Cruel World was the hideous follow-up . The only decent songs of note were the duet with Daryl Hall , & quot ; The only flame in town & quot ; and & quot ; I wan na be loved & quot ; , with Green from Scritti Politti on backing vocals , with maybe & quot ; Joe Porterhouse & quot ; an honorable mention ( it did n't become a really good song until he turned it into & quot ; ( I love you ) When you sleep & quot ; for Tracie 's Paul Weller-produced debut LP ) .The ponderousness that has marred much of Costello 's material ever since starts with the Impostor single & quot ; Peace in our time & quot ; - and we 've been suffering the consequences ever since . Get everything up through Punch The Clock , and then punch the clock .	-1
I love E.C. , I love the Attractions , I love Nick Lowe , so I was SO excited when this came out , as it was so hot on the heels of King of America . I was actually disappointed with King of America ( it has improved with age , like a fine wine ) , so I saw this as an obvious attempt to return to the fantastic form of his pre-Punch the Clock days . As I listened , I was so let down . I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs . As time passed , I thought perhaps I 'd been subverted by my own high expectations , so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance . Well , my opinion has n't changed . It 's still a struggle to listen to this album , possibly even more so as my ears have aged and the mid-range heavy production grates more than ever . I hate to say it , but I 'd rather listen to Goodbye Cruel World than this album .	-1
How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me , but there he is . For the most part , Hank sounds like just what he really is , a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star . He does hit the mark on occasion as with ` The American Dream ' and ` A Country Boy Can Survive ' but mostly this is just fluff	-1
This is my 2nd time out for Baez 's second album . I 'm a big fan of the first album and of her contemporary Carolyn Hester but I 'd forgotten that I traded this one in years ago . The arrangements are dull and pedestrian and it 's amazing how irritating Joan 's voice can be when the material ( or it just the arrangements ) are so weak.I 'm a folk fan , Dylan , Carolyn Hester , Peter , Paul and Mary , the Weavers , Journeymen , Roger McGuinn , Fairport , Kingston Trio , and Ian and Sylvia are special favorites . So , it 's not so easy for me to dislike a straight-ahead folk album like this one . However , I found Joan Baez 's 2nd album a very difficult listen the 2nd time out.It 's back in the trade-in pile ( for the 2nd time ! ) .	-1
Fantastic Voyage is the only good song on this excuse for an album . The rest of the songs are not even the least bit interesting . The other songs are n't even worth listening to . Unless you are Coolio 's # 1 fan , then do n't this unless it 's used for real cheap . None of the songs seem like & quot ; fantastic voyage & quot ; and that is what turned me off .	-1
Because suckers by it , quickly get bored by it , then try to sell it.Except there are more suckers than buyers.Gangsta indeed . Only an idiot thinks gangsta 's are good at making music.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the `` not helpful '' button , and the smart people can , at least , consider what I 've written .	-1
But sadly it 's not enough to save the album . Except for that one song the album fails on many levels ( Even for rap music ) with it 's anoying lyrics , bad beats , and even bad rapping ! Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it . He proved he 's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with & quot ; Gangsta 's Paradise , & quot ; and in the & quot ; Space Jam & quot ; soundtrack he ( With the help of other rappers ) helped make the best rap song I 've herd ! He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way !	-1
In an age of `` boom boom '' dance music and overblown , hyperamplified grunge , I was inclined to think that , when I heard Coolio 's `` Gangsta 's Paradise '' - even as I was knowing about what `` gangsta '' meant in relation to rap - was something a little better.The fact was/is , that this style of synthesised , semimelodic rap today sounds like the perfect prototype for , yes , the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears . Coolio clearly sounded like he wanted to remove the melodies and the hooks that at least made commcercial music from the eighties easy to listen to ( well , I listened to nothing but for the best part of two decades ) and replace it with a synthesised , airy , flyweight sound that would serve perfectly as background music on your commercial station . The song is not memorable like hit singles of the 1980s were , and the singer can never tell whether he wants to talk or actually to sing.This was perhaps the first song to be a hit AS background music on the radio , rather than from simple , catchy lyrics and vocals that had made hit singles before . As it stands today , this soundtrack rap album is almost a protype for the Backstreet Boys , who sound quite similar to Coolio , actually , even if they never rapped.If you like the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync ( no need for rudeness ) you 'll love this for the meandering melodies and total absence of memorable rhythms . if you want more substance , stay right away . Coolio copies Stevie Wonder 's `` Pasttime Paradise '' on this one : going back to the source would be most welcome .	-1
Very generic . No soul . No substance . No life . No emotion from the artist . No creativity . No nothing .	-1
You really have the impression somehow that she ca n't sing . Also the songs do n't seem spectacular . It 's weak dancey stuff - like DJ Bobo and all those acts . This is really a no-go for me	-1
if you read any of my other reviews you will hear my go on and on about the misfits and what an influence they had/have on me . so why only the one star ? because if youll notice the track list , it is simply the last 7 songs on the collection 1 album and the last 5 on the collection 2 ... so you may already own this and not even know it . just buy collection 1 and 2 and you WILL then have this album too !	-1
This review refers to the 180g vinyl edition , released on the Vinyl Lovers label .I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it 's original glorious analogue sound .Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !	-1
Please , somebody tell me what sort of `` trail '' Stryper blazed for other bands . As if a million other cheesy , Slaughter-like metal rock groups suddenly just dropped their immoral values to spread a Christian message back in the 80s , just because Stryper was doing it . As for other Christian rock bands that Stryper may have inspired , that 's absolutely wonderful , but did any of those bands ever really hit the mainstream ? Does n't seem so to me . Again , I fail to see these guys as trailblazers in any way , shape or form . If anything , I see them as cliched bandwagon jumpers of the 80 's heavy-metal scene.Musically , these guys had talent , but their slick sound is completely laughable . I 've no problem with the message they tried to spread , I actually believe in it . But to say these guys were trendsetters who `` paved the way '' for other Christian bands is a joke . Stryper was and is a one-hit-wonder rock group , over-produced and over-sheened , a cliched bunch of 80s hacks when you get right down to it . Hell , these guys do n't even get played on 80s compilation CDs , they 're that ridiculous , even by the heavy-metal standards of the 80s , of which there were many sorry bands.For a true trailblazing band that spreads a positive message without compromising themselves , their values , and their image , check out a little known band named Pearl Jam .	-1
I remember when this cd was released in the 80 's ... the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music ... .this album got immediate success , everybody liked it . Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd . I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I wo n't listen to it for the rest of my life , this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music . Instead , look for what these guys has made in the 70 's with their respective bands and you 'll see the difference ... .	-1
This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80 's , my least favorite decade musically . In the 70 's , you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching , jaw dropping prog rock . But in the 80 's it only amounted to overproduced , manufactured for mass consumption , calculated FM corporate rock . There is nothing prog about Asia . Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in their better days of glory with UK , Yes , ELP , King Crimson . My opinion on this one will never change with time . File with GTR under 80 's bad idea supergroups .	-1
terrible supergroup schlock . If this is their best cd , I wonder how terrible the others are . mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd , by the official `` prog rock supergroup . '' supergroups tend to suck hard , and I would say that this band blows more than most . Avoid at all costs , there is much better prog music out there . I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before , and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them . Maybe they did n't have that much talent in the first place .	-1
It 's really tough for me to come to terms with hearing '80s distorted guitar on this album 's title track , the cover of `` ( You 're So Square ) Baby I Do n't Care '' , where she honestly sounds like Sting on vocals , and `` You Dream Flat Tires '' . Did Joni think she was some sort of '80s hair metal star ? Similarly , it 's tough for me to hear all that '80s production stuff on `` Ladies ' Man '' ( ooh ! That 's my theme song ! ) , `` Man to Man '' , `` Under the Streetlight '' ( which has '80s guitar and '80s synthesizers ) and `` Solid Love '' . Now , when she does the Hejira-era jazz thing , as on `` Moon in the Window '' and `` Love '' , it can be nice , but when she does it again on `` Be Cool '' , it turns out awful . The album 's lone classic is `` Chinese Caf & eacute ; /Unchained Melody '' , which is a killer folk-jazz song with great lyrics about the passage of time and a lot of bass playing ( presumably by Jaco Pastorious ) . Arguably my favorite Joni Mitchell song , on one of her worst albums . Is that irony or what ? For the most part though , this is a boring record with a lot of unwise '80s production trends , saved only by Joni 's voice . It 's better than what would come next , though .	-1
When `` Here I Go Again '' comes on the radio , i always end up listening for a few moments just because I am baffled about how bad some songwriting can be . Its hilarious that when you hear a line , you can predict the next one . I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings ... he just picked the words cuz it sounds good ... to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better . The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem . Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards some rock zenith ... but when you hear the lyrics ... .all they are saying is `` Im horny ... gim me some '' . Hey , Im not opposed to songs about sex , but give me a break , dont pretend like you 're telling me something brilliant.All in all , Whitesnake is exactly what Spinal Tap was making fun of . I bet Whitesnake didnt even get the joke .	-1
Altoough the musicians involved in this album are all great British accomplished guys ( Sykes , Murray and Dunbar ) , it 's a shame to hear COverdale , one of the most authentic rock voices of all time , turn into Californian mainstream glam metal . Sad.. Anyway , there are great pices of musical hability .	-1
How bad is this . During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it . Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era ( metallica or guns n roses ) , is nothing compared too them . Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era . Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album ? come on . Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album . It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time . Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts . By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse	-1
Dancin ' Clown . My god . This might not be as patently awful as Dog Eat Dog but it gives it a run for its money . To think people like REM and The Cure were making great records at this time that still hold up among a pretty great punk and alt scene and stuff like this just looks purely awful in comparison . I love Joni but this album does n't hold although there a few okay songs . Avoid or torrent or find for free . Who are the people that keep saying this has great melodies and that each and every record she makes is pure gold ? Tasteless people you should avoid . I mean some of the stuff here is not bad but it 's certainly not anything to get excited over . Cool Water has that weird 80s vibe with some decent lyrics and a guy singing that does n't sound too bad with her but it still is the bottom of the barrel with that 80s musical accompaniment . If you need an 80s album really bad from her than you might as well get Wild Things ... . that album while not very good is still ahead of the next two by a mile .	-1
I dug this CD out of my collection yesterday , put it on , and started working on the computer with `` Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm '' playing . The opening duet with Peter Gabriel was pleasant enough , but by the time I heard `` Lakota '' chanted over and over , I realized this CD was both dated and discordant . As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell , I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there , but Ms. Mitchell 's better works do not , in my opinion , include this album . I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently `` ignorant '' or worse , and I 'm sure that I 'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon 's work.Guess , I 'm the skunk at the picnic on this one .	-1
Like that '80s depth of field , enjoy the synthesizer when it 's used sparingly and tastefully , as it is here . Funny that the '80s now sounds more dated than some of the music Joni references from the past , a cool cover of `` Cool Water '' , plus a few other songs recalling `` Johnny Angel '' and `` Corrina , Corrina '' ( Mitchell 's got ta be thinkin ' 'bout Big Joe 's version , yeah ... ) .Opening song , `` My Special Place '' , is pretty okay - sounds like the theme to an unsold 1987 TV pilot about a coffee shop run by two 36 year old divorced feminists.Once again , her lyrics stand alone as poetry - and there is n't , and never was , a whole lot of rock and rollers who could seriously sell their words separate from their music . And this keeps Chalk in a Rainstorm on the home carousel .	-1
This is not one of the strongest albums Joni Mitchell has released . The are a lot of guest vocalists and they do n't always match with Joni 's voice or songwriting . The lyrics are ok as well as Joni 's voice , but the synths sound so dated by now . Most of the songs suffer from that . There are a lot of albums who have a distinct 80 's sound but this one has n't hold up that good . I own all of Joni 's albums and hate to talk bad about her but this album is not one of my favourites . There is only one song on this album that is really good , the closer A Bird That Whistles . A simple acoustic track with saxophone from Wayne Shorter . The photography on the cover is beautiful as well . So , not one of her best but she has made so many exellent albums that this one pales compared to those .	-1
Together with the other guys in Eagles , Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history . I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [ bad ] bunch of songs ? I just do n't get it ! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to `` weed out '' my cd collection I decided that this one have to go . But before I sold it , I wanted to record the best songs from it , but I must admit that I could n't find a single song I really like . So , now it 's gone , and I have not missed it for even a split second !	-1
As usual with Audio Fidelity releases the sound is awfull . Compare this cd with the similar tracks on the Rhino 3 cd compilation-The Rhino beats it flat out . I do not know what Hoffman and Gray do with the rematering job other than their releases just sounds awfull . Flat , dull , veiled , compressed , like a thick blanket in front of the speakers.A complete waste of money to buy AF release of this album . A pity sins the music is very good .	-1
For those who like their saccharine straight up , this album poses few challenges . Rickie sings her slouchy style competently enough , serving up a a candy colored bouquet of easy listening tracks . Only three of these blossoms have any thorns -- 9 , 11 and 12 . Of these , 12 is a real gem of feeling and honesty leaving the cutsey crap well behind . Would an album filled with songs only like track 12 sell ? Probably not , but it would be glorious .	-1
Walked into my favourite record shop to see what stuff has been re-issued , as I love my 70 's and 80 's . My eye 's lid up to see a `` Siouxsie & The Banshees '' greatest hits sitting on the shelf . My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there ; `` spell bound '' , and ugh ! , I could n't believe it . This group finally releases a greatest hits here in Australia , and the best song is not even on it . As good as a hot chocolate in winter , without the chocolate ? ? .	-1
Lisa Loeb luck change when friend Ethan Hawke suggested that her cheesy track STAY should become the leading single for the soundtrack of REALITY BITES back in 1994 . The corny track rocketed to # 1 and Loeb was the first artist with a top single without owning a record contract . After that Geffen did n't hesitate and give this College Girl a chance . But little that they knew that Lisa Loeb cards where not that well played . She recorded a bland album , listening to this album is like sitting in a coffee shop in a rainy day with improvise lyrics and all about sadness and emptyness . So an entire record of the same thing you get extremely bored and wondering why was the fuss over STAY , DO YOU SLEEP was a follower , but none of the rest tracks are worth the listen , even she reply herself on LISA LISTEN , TAFFY it 's anoying , WAITING FOR WEDNESDAY is simple POP tune . No wonder this album did n't achieve platinum status just GOLD : meaning : well Geffen Records only shipped half million copies of this . Sorry Miss Loeb , you 're debut was weak , your sophomore work better , but after that you jumped into indies , but still , you need a great producer to get the thing that you do n't let out .	-1
I bought this album and found it to be very disappointing . I listened to sample clips online and thought they sounded great especially 'Taffy ' . Then when I listened to the entire album I found it to be dull and flat . A couple catchy songs here and there but overall it was n't as good as I expected . I 'm taking my copy back to the used CD store . Lisa Loeb seems like a nice person but I can see why she was a one-hit-wonder . =/	-1
I do n't know why this album gets the props it does . there does n't seem to be any point where the production or the emceeing tries to grab you ... .and yet this is heralded as not only a classic , but by many people as the greatest hip hop album ever . It 's nowhere near an Illmatic , The Infamous , Stress The Extinction Agenda , 93 to Infinity , any Kool G Rap ' early to mid 90 's stuff , Stunts Blunts & Hip Hop , Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde etc , etc , etc ... it does n't even come close to 36 Chambers . I think this album is boring .	-1
Honestly , White Zombie was techno-metal enough as it was . Why did they go and do something so stupid . These remixes are terrible . El Phantasmo and the Chicken Run Blastorama and Boogie Man are the only good tracks on here . This is just miserable . Seriously , this is a joke right ?	-1
I love Madness . I 've payed large sums of money for import CDs . And believe me , this is an absolutely TERRIBLE retrospective . First of all , you only have twelve tracks . Given the variety of the band 's work , how is it possible to paint an adequate picture with that few songs ! ? Secondly , the actual song selection is stunningly terrible . The group 's later period was n't bad , but it certainly was n't good enough that you 'd want to clutter HALF THE CD with songs from their last two albums ! Then we have two songs from Seven and two from The Rise and Fall -- decent enough selections ; perhaps if ALL their albums were thus represented this would be better . Unfortunately , they 're not -- Absolutely is entirely ignored , and all we have from One Step Beyond is the title track . It also has the non-album single It Must be Love , but as that 's found on the infinitely better self-titled compilation , that 's no excuse to buy this . And , of course , the track order shows no rhyme and reason at all ( One Step Beyond , LAST ? ) . All in all , even though it includes some good songs , this is absolutely ( not a pun ) inexcusable . Buy Madness -- it was released while the group was still around , so it 's not entirely authoritative , but it includes work from their best period , INCLUDING the excellent House of Fun , which you wo n't find anywhere else this side of the Atlantic . Star FAR away from this mess .	-1
This is a terrible retrospective which , without any other knowledge of the band , would lead many to conclude that Madness were little more than a crappy New-Wave band . Everyone knows `` Our House . '' I 'm glad `` One Step Beyond '' made the list . How come no `` Night Boat to Cairo '' or `` House of Fun '' ? Pass this up , and just get the first album instead .	-1
I 'm afraid to say this is an uninspiring album . The single most glaring deficiency which it exhibits is the songwriters ' respective inabilities to develop a tune . As a result , it is very , very boring . The ballads sometimes have interesting lyrics , but they are all delivered in a flat monotone with very little variation in the music either. & quot ; Let 's Go & quot ; is easily the best song on the album , with a good start and a driving progression , but even this runs out of steam/ideas towards the end of the chorus ; as a result they have to tunelessly shout the title and some other words just so they can move on to the next verse . & quot ; Everybody have Fun Tonight & quot ; is not quite as good , but at least is much better than passable and its ending is a strong as its start . Other than & quot ; Hypnotise Me & quot ; , which is mildly clever , the rest are very , very weak.Oh , and & quot ; The World in which we Live & quot ; ends this mind-numbing collection . Seven long minutes where the song goes nowhere and they just have to chant the title as a 'climax ' . Oh dear . The most memorable thing about the song is the obscenities at the start of it , which are totally gratuitous , unnecessary and are just another example of the bells and whistles this band will pull out to try to revive the album despite their weak songwriting.One star is probably harsh ( I thought hard about this ) , but it is nonetheless difficult to give it two stars on the basis of two good songs out of eight . Very , very disappointing .	-1
`` Everybody Have Fun '' and `` Let 's Go '' are terrific pop songs , catchy and with a beat . I must 've heard them ( involuntarily ) hundreds of times on my health club sound system over the years . They are quite good . `` Hypnotize Me '' and `` Eyes of the Girl '' are pretty good , too . The rest are dull and boring , and the last one , `` World in Which We Live '' is pretty awful.I bought this record on vinyl when it came out , and rarely had the patience to sift through the tracks by lifting and dropping the needle . Now , with all my music on my computer , I can pick and choose , and I 've put the above four tracks onto my hard disc . But for those of you looking to shell out money for a good new CD , it probably is n't worth it . The four good songs are probably on some best-of collection , a better choice .	-1
Jimmy Page is all over the guitar here , but the writing stinks . The vocals , the engineering that 's like driving nails into your ears -- I 'd rather hear two gerbils run up and down a Strat with a bent neck and strings about to snap.If you want latter day Jimmy Page , check out `` Live At The Greek '' with The Black Crowes as a backing band or his duos with Robert Plant . There 's a reason `` Outrider '' is selling for 3 1/2 bucks .	-1
Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated . The songs released were pretty good but after all these years , this album is dated and annoying now . This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular , no wonder they had to change their sound after this album . Do n't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it . The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning , great hook and chorus . This album is considered their masterpiece , but I 've heard better .	-1
I hate Gwen 's yelling , screeching vocals and all the songs accept for `` Do n't Speak . '' The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of `` Spiderwebs , '' but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt .	-1
This CD is n't so great ... the only really good song is & quot ; Do n't Speak & quot ; ... it 's a shame , I was hoping for more songs like it , but they are all & quot ; strange & quot ; . I should have known better than to get a CD with rotted peaches on the cover ! Oh well ... at least it DOES have that one song on it ...	-1
It 's a testament to the band 's strengths that Massive Attack 's worst album still works on any level at all . But compared to the albums immediately before and after it , it 's nothing to write home about . Their first album BLUE LINES was a milestone in the world of trip hop , and it seems like the group was n't sure how to follow it up . Unfortunately , they did the worst possible thing : they basically made the same album again , but not as well . If I ever make an album as great as BLUE LINES , I 'll be tempted to copy myself too , but hopefully I 'll do a better job than they did.Protection opens with a slow dramatic opener just like its predecessor , but `` Protection '' lacks the spare menace and singular production of `` Safe From Harm '' , and Tracey Thorn is a much more conventional vocalist than the last album 's Shara Nelson . The tiny `` Payback '' sample in the middle of the song 's main riff is cute , but otherwise this song eases into background music mode too much to be effective , and the rest of the album follows in this vein . `` Karmacoma '' is one of the better tunes of the bunch , with great vocals by the soon-to-quit Tricky and a jumped-up dub beat . It 's a poor cousin to BLUE LINES ' `` Five Man Army '' , but still not bad . The thing that really sinks this album is the instrumentals . `` Weather Storm '' and `` Heat Miser '' are completely inconsequential tracks that meander aimlessly and suck up eight minutes of the listener 's attention for no good reason . The production on this album is overall much warmer and less abrasive than their previous work , so these instrumental bits really turn into Muzak . There 's another minor triumph mid-album with `` Better Things '' , one of the few instances on the record where both the vocals and the music are equally gripping . The live cover of `` Light My Fire '' at the end is just the final nail in the coffin ; it 's abrasive , but in the wrong way . It sounds like it was made by a completely different , and much crappier , reggae rock band . I 'm getting pissed off just listening to it as I compose this review.Shortly after the release of this album , Massive Attack contracted the Mad Professor to remix it , and his version of the record , NO PROTECTION , is leagues better . After that , the band underwent a massive ( ha ! ) reinvention , and played up their more monolithic side for the enormous-sounding MEZZANINE . So there are lots of really great Massive Attack albums you could buy before you need to consider getting this one . If I had known beforehand what a disappointment this is , I probably would n't own it myself .	-1
This overrated album doesn ` t do much for me . I don ` t really see what ` s so special about it , and I believe it ` s the band ` s worse record . The title song is a good opener , and & quot ; Karmakoma & quot ; is a great moment as well , but after the third track , & quot ; Three & quot ; , it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record . The last song , a cover of & quot ; Light my fire & quot ; , is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album , & quot ; Protection & quot ; is alright as background music , but not much else .	-1
I bought this CD after being exposed to Nicolette 's amazing vocals on Plaid 's amazing `` extork '' . On `` Protection '' she sings `` Three '' and `` Sly '' . These songs are fine ( the music 's a little snoozy ) but her underground solo work is generally better . The other tracks range from dull to downright irritating . Sounding hodgepodged , there is no common style nor theme to this album.I even bought Massive Attack 's `` No Protection '' remixes hoping for better luck as well as different takes of the Nicolette tracks ( so I can cut and paste my own remixes on my MD player ) . Well , her voice is n't even ON that disc , and as a whole the music was even LESS memorable.Perhaps Massive Attack , though seemingly popular , just is n't for me . Maybe they just are n't strange and distinctive enough to suit my tastes . ...	-1
I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; , but then when I heard the rest of the CD , I was very glad that I did n't buy the CD and just heard someone else 's copy of it . The songs are nothing like & quot ; 6 Underground & quot ; and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent . Not a good buy . If you bought the CD , then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist . The original is almost terrifying . The rest of the CD is just garbage .	-1
I really enjoy 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar , do n't get me wrong . Those are great songs to have ! ! The rest of this CD was a big disappointment . It is unusual for me to prefer `` radio '' songs over the rest of an artist 's offerings since the latter is typically more creative , in-depth , and genuine . However , for the rest of the album it appears that the Sneaker Pimps focused more on producing a sleazy , hiply dark image rather than making music . I was expecting a darkly sensual album when I bought this but the actual musical content leaves me hungry . In terms of a truly full album in this kind of popular music , Garbage easily performs better . If I could do it over again , I 'd find the album and radio versions of 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar on singles or compilations instead .	-1
I do n't even know why everybody else likes this album so much -- it 's repetitive , drags on forever ... and the rhythms for each song do n't even sound very good to begin with ! I did n't even buy this album , it was so irritating . Instead , I previewed some songs on Grooveshark [ Grooveshark is a free online website where you can listen to any song you 'd like -- serious ] . I hardly made it through even the first song . Come on , Daft Punk -- you can still be fun techno robots , but STOP BEING SO REPETITIVE ! ! In Oh Yeah , these are the only lyrics -- Oh yeah/ Oh yeah/ Oh yeah/ Everybody on the dance/ Crazy on the dance/ Oh yeah/ Oh YeahMost other songs did n't have any lyrics at all ! The only good song was Revolution 909 , which is still repetitive . The other songs are n't for parties and clubs -- they 're for freaking torture ! This is something else I have to get out -- On `` Random Access Memories '' , DP 's newest album , why did some people think that some of the lyrics were sad ? They were actually quite embarrassing ! [ except for one or two . ] Read the lyrics for a Maroon 5 song -- do you think that person could they compare them ! ? In all , listening to `` Homework '' is worse than actually doing homework . It 's just a bunch of crap . Maybe I 'd recommend this album for people who want to give themselves splitting headaches . This was probably written by a robot who was broken .	-1
Okay , so I have to admit it . I own this CD . I do listen to it from time to time , but that is becoming rare . The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for & quot ; Around The World & quot ; that got me interested . But enough is enough . In & quot ; Da Funk & quot ; , how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off ? Give me a break . They have some good reiffs going , now they just need to get the rest of the songs going .	-1
I tried my best to like this cd but it just was n't happening . The tracks ranged in quality from annoying to unbearable . Consider Discovery first before buying this cd unless you are truly a fan .	-1
If Paula Abdul ever records another album , my ears will explode in blood . Her debut album was stealing the sound of the era The New Jack Swing , originally of GUY and many others , what Abdul had was the moves and the producers who knew how to cover her voice in extremely catchy beats so she can dance to it in the overproduced videos and people would run to the record store and buy her debut album ( wich by the way as many stated here outsold Abdul expectations , by selling more than 7 million copies in the US alone WOW ! ) , of course this slick record contains 4 # 1 singles but only two of them sound like # 1 , STRAIGHT UP wich I must confess to like , and COLD HEARTED dirty things always sells , but OPPOSITTES ATTRACT i do not respect an artist who dances with animated cats , and FOREVER YOUR GIRL sound sooo sooo DATED ! ... .I bought this album when I was a child so it 's soooooo long ago , Miss Abdul had her time , now she 's an AI judge ( wich in any way will make Paula look any cooler , just the other way around ) , Paula Abdul was in FACT very very LUCKY ... .because sadly this album lacks of consistensy and do not include the original video version ( boomer ) ... ..Paula surely knew people in the industry that 's why she got the type of marketing she got , a clever move for a cute sweet corny cheesy Cali Girl .	-1
I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s , but I just never got it ... or her . The & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; and & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; songs were awful pop tunes and that & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat . Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album . I did like the & quot ; Way That You Love Me & quot ; song . Now that was pretty sweet .	-1
Some songs are good ( especially & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; ) , but some songs are n't as good . Anyway , it 's pretty good to listen to .	-1
I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul 's voice now gets on my nerves , and that her songs though they had their place and time in 1989 just do n't hold up well today.Songs like & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; , and & quot ; The Way That You Love Me & quot ; , just do n't infect me like some old pop songs do like The Emotions & quot ; Best of My Love & quot ; or Lovin ' Spoonfuls & quot ; Summer in the City & quot ; ... .get the picture ? Unless your an Abdul fanatic , all I can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious hooks ... I think if Madonna , or Deborah Gibson ( who have stronger voices ) sang these dittys they may hold up better .	-1
Been there done that sound . I can think of a thousand bands that deserve the deluxe remastering treatment over this drivel .	-1
It 's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album . The instrumentation on 'Ultra ' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness . You simply get sleepy , 'cause they 're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun ' is embarrassingly boring . Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It 's No Good ' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of ' compilation , and 'Freestate ' , especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style . It can work . But it 'll TAKE some work ! A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra ' out on vinyl too ! !	-1
Ian Anderson 's 1st solo album , well what 's so different about that , virtually every Tull album since Mick Abrahams departure is an Ian solo album . Of course this had to happen in the early 80 's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one 's no exception . Like The Human League with a flute player . Very Un-Tull , so was Under Wraps ; at least 'A ' had Eddie Jobson , chops a plenty , and still a nod or two to the more earthy past . Pass on this one please !	-1
this cat is a one hit wonder clone.2nd tier BabyFace & amp ; Prince.aside from nobody knows the rest of his album is flat.he should just stick to song-writting.cuz his Productions and singing just ride off of Babyface 's & amp ; prince 's backs .	-1
Sure this CD has some good tracks , however the second CD is just plain wack , the only good song on the second CD is & quot ; all eyes on me & quot ; the rest is all filler , Me against the world was pac 's only good album , the rest of his albums are wack .	-1
I , for one will be glad when this west coast `` gangsta '' b.s . is finally put to rest . ( 13 years of anti-life thinking has got die sometime . ) This album which was blaring out of cars throughout 1996 and I was tired of hearing Tupac 's rants about women , Biggie , and jail.There are only two good songs on this trifiling 20 something song fest , `` California Love '' and `` I ai n't mad Cha '' . Pac was a gifted lyricist , but he is not the greatest m.c . in rap 's history . ( that goes to melly mel , chuck d , and run ) and frankly this is another example of black amerikkkan ghetto nihlism ( in which he never came from ) for profit . I get tired of hearing young brothers say to me that Pac speaks for me as a `` black man '' ( because he was stupid enough to get shot twice and the second one was fatal please . ) all he ever cared about was making money of black suffering along with Suge Knight , throw this cd in the garbage heap along with any L.A/Compton hip-hop outside of Hireoglyphics , Jurrasic 5 , and The Coup . Gangsta Rap has all but killed creativity inside of commerical Hip-Hop since 1990 it has got to go ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This ... was pretty weak . The beats were some of the worst I 've ever heard , and 2pac 's got a terrible flow . I really do n't know what people see in this album . There 's only like 10 good songs on this . I ca n't believe some people think this is the greatest album . This is n't even the greatest double disc .	-1
a good poet he was.but a average rapper.he was a better actor than anything else.his music does n't move me like public enemy or rakim.i find him to be way overrated.a few alright songs on this two-disc set but alot of filler.he ai n't no legend to me.self-destructive more likely.this album is pure garbage .	-1
2pac is wack . He 's no where near Biggie or Nas . People need to realize this . 2pac was all about image , his music was garbage . Buy `` Ready To Die '' or `` Illmatic '' instead .	-1
I downloaded this music for free thank goodness just because of all the five star reviews . After listening to this album I have my doubts about these five star reviews . Not much to say about the album except I was totally disappointed . The album was monotonous and boring to the extreme . Almost all of the songs sounded the same . The same guitar rifts , slow beat , and jamming on each song . The song Washer was so so , but was ruined by the lyrics of the lead singer . It sounds like a group of guys in their late teens/early twenties ( which they probably were ) in a garage just jamming with no common goal or purpose with each band member having their own direction or agenda . No band assimilation whatsoever . To make matters worse the lead singer is not actually singing but just occasionally speaking or telling a story . Fortunately he speaks so low that you ca n't even tell what he 's saying with headphones on . Not that it matters what he 's saying anyway.The band reminds me just a little of a much less talented and interesting version of the great band Bedhead . Bottom line this album was terrible and would never even consider listening to their other music .	-1
2 1/2Overly cited indiecency that barely maintains any lasting intrigue past an important lead-off track .	-1
Shellac is a great LIVE band , but on vinyl , except for the first singles , they are absolute crap ! -The folks here that give this `` art piece '' 5 stars are just Albini A** kissers , is all ! Great engineer , no doubt , but most anything post Big Black or Rapeman , his MUSIC just does n't translate on recorded media ! More like a `` fart piece '' because it falls flat like one . The only good song here is `` The Admiral '' , & it was on one of their singles . Albini should just stick to playing live , and quit recording his music , it 'll give him the most unique `` indie cred '' anyone could ever enjoy ! What a waste of vinyl , of which he & I most truly love ! The Only Good Recorded Shellac Songs List , in order , are:1 . Doris2 . Wingwalker3 . Copper4 . Prayer To God5 . Rambler Song6 . The Admiral7 . XVI8 . The Guy Who Invented Fire9 . Steady As She Goes10 . SpokeThat 's IT ! -now Steve , record these songs live , put it out as a `` best of '' comp , then retire from composing `` sound '' & just engineer it !	-1
I am admittedly frustrated with `` Don Caballero II . '' As a fan of bands like Rumah Sakit , Volta do Mar , and more recently , Battles and Lite , I am a late-blooming fan of math rock . Of course , research into the style inevitably led me to Don Caballero , and I picked up `` World Class Listening Problem , '' which I really liked . I decided to get some of their back catalog , and started with Don Caballero II . What I got was the auditory equivalent of having my eyes propped open to watch a documentary about humanity 's most amazing scientific discoveries , but randomly spliced with scenes of brutal torture . Yes , it rocked . Yes , it was brilliantly executed . Yes , Don Che has eight arms . There was no question as to whether or not I respected what it represented , but no matter how much I listened to it , I could not bring myself to genuinely like it.What I hear with `` Don Caballero II '' is an underdeveloped compositional approach . Structure is played fast and loose . There are lots of starts and stops , but very few beginnings and endings . Without a clear idea of when things finish , it is difficult to tell when new things begin . The result is often jarring . I get the feeling that the band is trying to capture a sense of improvisation , within which some meandering is permissible . Without a clear sense of when the journey begins , though , it is difficult to look forward to arriving at a destination . Instead , I get the general sensation of wandering from one 5/8 riff to the next , hoping to find a shortcut through the chainsaw/cymbal waterboarding scene in `` Please Tokio , Please This Is Tokio . `` Now , this may seem like I have a grudge against noise rock . I do n't . I like chaos a much as anyone . I own and enjoy listening to King Crimson 's THRaKaTTaCK , which can be quite an assault . But chaos , no matter how precisely it is executed , does n't build and release tension by itself.Notice , though , that I did n't say that I hated `` Don Caballero II . '' I said that I found it frustrating , this being because the album is absolutely brilliant at times . It is most successful when the material is allowed to evolve and morph through the rhythmic and melodic variations that are suggested by the riffs themselves . The resulting auditory roller-coaster is a compelling and surprising ride of the highest order , often seamlessly finishing in an entirely different place than where it starts . Unfortunately , we rarely get to see the end of the journey before the record skips.THE LOWDOWN : I understand that part of the math-rock aesthetic is a detachment from the audience , and perhaps it is too late for me to really appreciate that mindset . I will never be able to experience Don Caballero II in the context of 1995 . Maybe I missed out . Perhaps math rock itself evolved , and I am only a fan of its later iterations . Regardless , as much as I want to like `` Don Caballero II , '' I am OK with just letting myself be frustrated by it and moving on . I welcome constructive comments on Don Caballero , because I have not given up on them yet .	-1
A perennial favourite of the chattering classes , I purchased this hoping for some high quality soul music of a similar style to the excellent Lighthouse Family - sadly there is no comparison . Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family , so it 's easy to see where to go for value for money . Secondly , Mr Gayes ' anti war sentiments seem somewhat nave and foolish in today 's political climate . Thirdly , Mr Gaye ca n't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records . No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80 's ! Verdict : avoid .	-1
When listening to this record it 's useful if you 're a Christian hippie . An interesting point to make with all music is : does the listener have to be in the same state of mind as the musician in order to properly understand the music ? There 's nothing new to be said about What 's Going On that has n't already been said by many millions of other people . That is because What 's Going On was a revolutionary record addressing such issues as religion , racism , pollution , love , poverty and , of course , peace.All the main vocals are Gaye 's . Some may think that a lot of music of this time is nave , in that it 's so optimistic ( love this , love that ... ) To this must be said that a lot of the hippie artists had very many personal problems ( Marvin Gaye = Troubled Man ) . In a way , their music was a way to express idealistic dreams that are hard pressed to happen in real life.Really , the sound of this record will stay with you for a long time , from the religious wondering in 'God is Love ' to the realism in 'Inner City Blues ( Make Me Wan na Holler ) 'It could also be said that Christianity is a myth . If that is so , it 's a beautiful myth , one that has helped convey creativity .	-1
Watching BET 's Walk Of Fame tribute to Stevie the other day inspired me to write some reviews here.I do n't have the & quot ; perfect & quot ; view of this album that most Stevie fans have . Aside from Living For The City , Higher Ground , and Jesus Children Of America there is n't anything I like on this album.There is just something about Stevie 's languid , rather sappy , elevator-music ballads that I ca n't stand , and this cd has a bunch of them.Having said that , I absolutely love the great stuff on this cd , with Jesus Children Of America being the highlight for me . That alone makes it a disc worth owning , to me . Overall though , I think I am going to look into getting that multi-disc Stevie box-set that came out a few years ago or whenever it was . There just are n't enough Stevie tunes I love per-disc to make buying all his albums worth it to me . I do n't own any of those & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; types of box sets but depending on whats on that multi-disc Stevie set , I may buy it .	-1
Like always with AF releases , the sound is just so bad and lifeless . As ususal a reverse remaster job by the `` great '' Hoffman or Gray . The plot is suck the life out of the music and make it sound dull . Take away the sparkle and details . Why are not this company exsposed yet ? Why do people use USD 30 to buy these discs ? It really annoys me that this company still releases discs . It is an offense to the artists .	-1
Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases . They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you 're not using the Original master tape then you 're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD , but all of his CD 's are great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
If you like squeaking boys , accompanied by a mostly boring orchestra , then buy this CD . Otherwise , you may hardly wish to listen to more than three or four songs ( the well known Ben and a few others ) . Do n't get me wrong , Michael Jackson is a great artist , but not as a boy . Buy HIStory or Thriller instead !	-1
Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I 've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words & Music do n't match His overall presentation . I dig the cut with Him & Roger Troutman & also R.Kelly 's `` Someone to Love '' .but the up-tempo cuts do n't move me at all.this Album though is n't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material & this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary .	-1
In Square Circle had some of lame '80s product on it , but this whole album is lame '80s product . It does n't help its cause that there 's only one unqualified success on it . `` Skeletons '' and `` Get It '' were both hit singles , and they 're fun , but routine , funk , but the fact is you can find better songs that do the same thing on virtually every other Stevie Wonder album from 1972 on . ( The third hit , `` You Will Know '' , is awful . Unbearable . I dunno , pick a negative adjective and run with it ) . The song I 'm talking about is the stomping , long funkfest `` My Eyes Do n't Cry '' . Now that 's a total classic ! I love it ! Especially the percussion and keyboard riffs . And the melody . And the chorus . And everything else about it . Everything else is a zero . The funk ( `` Dark ` n ' Lovely '' ; `` In Your Corner '' ; `` One of a Kind '' ) is forced ; the ballads ( `` You Will Know '' ; `` With Each Beat of My Heart '' ; the space-soul , `` Rocket Love '' -like `` Galaxy Paradise '' ; `` Cryin ' through the Night '' ) are overwrought . Stevie was in sad shape here .	-1
Stevie , Stevie , Stevie ! ! Where has all the brilliance gone ? There are exactly 3 , count 'em , 3 good songs on this album and they simply are n't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary . The opener , & quot ; You Will Know & quot ; with it 's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody , & quot ; With Each Beat Of My Heart & quot ; , his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of & quot ; Skeletons & quot ; and it 's indictment of liars , cheaters and cover-ups ( Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays ) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release . Filler is one thing , but this is ridiculous .	-1
Perhaps the thing you should know first here , before you even think about plunking down the sixty bucks , is that two of Ross 's most identifiable , signature hits , `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' & amp ; `` Love Hangover '' are in their chopped-up three and a half minute 45 RPM versions . ( On their original LP 's they ran over six and seven minutes , respectively . ) For a work that 's supposed to be the exhaustive , definitive and long-awaited retrospective of so important an American singer , this is inexcusable.The last Ross single to even nudge it 's way into the top ten ( and then just barely , for only a couple weeks ) was `` Missing You '' in January 1985 . No Ross single since then has come close . Note that on this set , after you hear the song , you 've got a whole disc yet to listen to , much of it then-newly recorded 90s material meant to foster the impression that Diana was a vital , trend-setting force in pop music still . No , not that anymore , though yes , forever a diva.So why did I buy it ? In October 1993 , it was the first instance Motown released a good number of classic 60s Supremes sides back in their original mono , many that did n't make it to the `` Hitsville U.S.A. '' set , and on that score , it delivers . But this set falls far short of giving fans of the solo Diana ( which I remain ) the heartening and nostalgia-inducing reacquaintance of her recording career we 'd been waiting for . ( It was also a side-by-side failure if you 'd also bought her alleged ` biography , ' `` Secrets of a Sparrow . `` ) One has only to compare the masterpiece work done on the boxed-sets of Aretha Franklin ( `` Queen of Soul '' ) , the Temptations ( `` Emperors of Soul '' ) and James Brown ( `` Star Time '' ) with `` Forever Diana '' to know that the lady was done wrong here . Motown , it 's been 10 years - scrap this one , forget about it ( and we 'll try to too ) , and start over again .	-1
Berry Gordy and Diana Ross really Screwed up here on this 4-disc compilation . My first thought after finally getting thru the four discs was : WHAT were they thinking ? ? ? ? First , let 's start with the APPALLINGLY BAAAADDDD fourth and last Disc . The music they came up with is n't even worth a fourth-rate R & B ; singer . It 's hard to believe Diana Ross had to record such drivel . Apart from the gem `` Best Years of My Life '' , which really was a classic -- well arranged , written and performed . Aside from that one song , the entire fourth disc is a MESS ! ! And this is on a Diana Ross career retrospective collection ? ? ? Com'on Berry Gordy , surely you can do better than this ! ! While Diana 's star was on the decline as the 1990 's began , still considering her stature in the music biz , they could 've come up with better songs and choices for this career retrospective collection . Many reviewers have complained the Supremes stuff on Disc 1 does n't even belong on this retrospective and I 'd have agree . Call it `` Padding '' by Berry Gordy and possibly Diana herself for this collection . With the wealth of Motown material in the vaults from Diana the solo artist since 1970 after she left the Supremes , surely there was plenty of more material and unreleased rarities to add to this collection.They could 've taken notes from Barbra Streisand 's superb 4-disc 1991 retrospective `` Just For the Record '' , released two years earlier . On `` For the Record '' , Streisand was wise to include outtakes , alternative versions and unreleased tracks from the music vaults . THAT 'S how you do a career retrospective ! ! ! Instead here , Diana 's fans have to put up with lousy songs and the waste of an entire disc space on Disc 4 . On some selections , you can even detect Diana 's own indifference towards the lackluster material.Berry Gordy also skimped on the sound quality . It 's mediocre at best . Again , it just shows lack of attention to detail and the basics . In 1993 when this retrospective was released , improvements were already being made on sound remastering technology as record companies were re-releasing classic CD 's with improved digital sound . Since `` Forever Diana 's '' release in 1993 , there have been Diana Ross and the Supremes compilations with much better sound , especially those released in the last 10 years since the early 2000 's . If Berry Gordy and Diana had decided to spend as much time on the sound quality as they did on the vanity project that went into the accompanying booklet , then maybe results would be much , much better in the sound department.If they ever decide to go back and release another Diana Ross career retrospective ( which does n't appear likely ) , they would have to re-think and re-do the entire song selection process ( especially filter out the Supremes stuff ) and go with the best digital Remastering for sound . They would also have to release classic tracks in their original entirety , not skimp to the single remix versions ( with `` Love Hangover '' `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' as painful examples here ) . Her fans deserve much better treatment for sticking with this Diva for the past half century.Then again , the fans must be wondering , `` Why bother ? '' There are better Diana Ross two-disc collections out there with better sound , better selection of songs , so why bother with this lousy 4-disc compilation ? Too bad Diana Ross decided to call this career retrospective `` Forever Diana '' b/c the compilation does not stand the test of time nor deserve to be called `` Forever Diana '' . If she and Berry Gordy had decided to spend as much energy and time on the four discs as they did on the accompanying booklet ( a vanity project at best with self-serving photos of the Diva preening and posing in various guises ) , then maybe results would have been much different and better.Instead Berry Gordy decided to give Diana the reins to come up with a Vanity Project by sticking one too many needless , unnecessary tracks as fillers , especially on the last disc when they could 've come up with indeed material that was worth calling `` Forever Diana '' . Instead , the fans are saying : `` Forget It , Diana ! ''	-1
I 'll admit I 'm not a big Boys ll Men fan . Yet I got their first cd many years ago after a friend told me I was missing out and I was upset I wasted my money . All the songs sounded alike to me so I put it in a box and never looked at it again . Recently I went through that box and found this cd and put it on . I was surprised that some of the songs did n't sound so bad . The strong songs are `` Uhh Ahh '' , `` It 's So Hard To Say Goodbye '' , `` Under Pressure '' and of coarse `` Motown Philly '' which is the best song on the album.Those songs are the few high lights . When you take away those four songs the rest of the cd is still dry . It 's too sappy and the songs all sound the same . It sounds like they used the same beat on every song . While many are shocked B2M are no longer hot , I 'm not . I knew 20 years ago when they first started they were n't going to last . Their music was hot for the new jack swing era but when that trend faded so did they .	-1
I never liked this version of this album . It has too many extra songs that just did n't sound right to me . I love the original version of C.H.H . The one with the black and white cover and it has the men in the far background walking . I have that one in cassette and i 'm waiting for the CD to come in the mail .	-1
On CONVERSATION PEACE , the Wonder man tries too hard to please everybody . The hip-hop rhythms on `` The Edge Of Eternity '' , `` Rain Your Love Down '' , `` Cold Chill '' and the semi-acid jazz `` Sensuous Whisper '' sound forced and artificial , while message-oriented songs like `` Take The Time Out '' and the title track sound too preachy . `` Sorry '' and `` For Your Love '' are strictly album filler , while the lovely `` Taboo To Love '' , `` Treat Myself '' and the anti-gun `` My Love Is With You '' are the album 's highlights ( although those hip-hop rhythms pop up again on the latter song ) . For his next album , Stevie should just relax and be himself .	-1
Stevie Wonder is one of my All-Time Favorites Period.He is a Musical Genius.but This is n't his Genius here.Only two songs stand Out Sensuous Whisper & amp ; Cold CHill.His Writing is hurting on this DIsc.The Music is Lacking that Stevie Edge.After His Live Set I was Hyped for this Disc but it was n't Happening but you ca n't take away The Man 's Genius .	-1
Evolution was one of the most hyped albums back in 1997 my sophomore year of high school . Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak , especially the fast tracks . Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen ; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought . Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine , Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness . Shawn 's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album , however there 's is a lot of weak material on the album . Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine , Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and are n't song with that much heart . In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya .	-1

See , here 's the problem with Caribou : It is n't very good . There are hits , oh yes - what Elton album would be complete without hits ? Those are good . `` The B*tch is Back '' is a funny heavy rocker with a full brass section and is not sexist , unlike ... oh , I dunno , everything else Bernie Taupin ever wrote : the `` b*tch '' is the singer , you see . `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on Me '' , meanwhile , is one of Elton 's many classic love ballads with another one of those soaring refrains . `` Stinker '' is a rewrite of `` The B*tch is Back '' , but I do n't care - it 's a damn good time . And `` I 've Seen the Saucers '' is cool in its eeriness . On the other hand , I really wish Bernie Taupin would stop parodying country , since `` Dixie Lily '' just may be worse than `` No Shoestrings on Louise '' , which is an impressive feat ; `` Pinky '' and `` Grimbsy '' are yet more cheesy ballads ; `` You 're So Static '' is more unwarranted misogyny ; `` Ticking '' has no reason to exist ; `` Solar Prestige Whatever '' is a painful sequel to `` Sun King '' . Oh , and the cover image makes Captain Fantastic 's look like a Da Vinci .	-1
Of his 70s classic output , this LP is probably John 's weakest . Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour ( a little over a week of studio time ) , it 's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie . There simply are n't a whole lot of memorable songs here.The one most will know is ballad `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on me '' , one of the most enduring tunes in Elton 's canon . `` The Bitch is Back '' , while relatively slight , was a big hit for Elton as well . `` Ticking '' portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today 's newspaper clippings . After that , the good stuff is slim pickings . `` Pinky '' is pleasant enough , but alongside Elton 's other love songs clearly a lesser effort . `` Dixie Lily '' is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat . `` You 're so Static '' is `` Sweet Painted Lady '' part two.. '' I 've seen the Saucers '' is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens . `` Grimsby '' is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.The nadir of the album and possibly Elton 's catalogue is `` Solar Prestige a Gammon '' . Yes , I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for `` reading too much '' into his lyrics . But when John Lennon did the same thing , he came up with `` I Am the Walrus '' and at least the wordplay was clever . `` Stinker '' is also pretty aptly named.As far as the bonus tracks go , you get a decent Christmas tune ( `` Step into Christmas '' ) that still gets holiday airplay Stateside , `` Pinball Wizard '' is the song from `` Tommy '' first done by the Who and probably should 've replaced `` Solar Prestige '' on the album . A good cover is better than a misbegotten original . `` Sick City '' is a jibe at New York City . Again , it 's better than a lot of the material on the album . `` Cold Highway '' was a B side to `` Bitch '' that also should 've made the cut instead of some of what did.In summary : Only completists will need to own this , but if you 're a pretty big Elton John fan it 's worth getting for `` Ticking '' and the bonus material . All others should go grazing elsewhere.2 1/2 stars	-1
The only reason to buy this CD is for `` I 've seen the saucers '' and `` Dont let the sun go down on me '' ... .in my personal opinion ... the only 2 songs worth listening to ... ..This album was a complete flop ... compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it ... ..I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure ... ... Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired .	-1
The 1974 album 'Caribou ' is a fairly enjoyable glossy pop-rock album . 'Caribou ' is not a bad album , but it is not a great one either.Admittedly , most of the songs are enjoyable while this piece is playing . 'Dixy Lily ' is a country / show boat tune that is fairly enjoyable , though , honestly , if I heard this on the radio , I probably would n't realise it was Elton , does n't sound like him . 'Solar Prestige a Gammon ' is better than you 've been told , it 's slightly jazzy , and Ray plays the Marimba 's beautifully . However , it 's hardly memorable . There 's a pair of ballads , the sickly sweet country-flavoured 'Pinky ' and the more psychedelic / sci-fi 'I 've seen the saucers ' , that sound so great as they start ( both have a nice bongo-drum flavoured beat ) , but they soon fail , despite the good arrangements and nice melodies . Even the jazzy rocker 'You 're so static ' , feels sloppy , though it is enjoyable.If there is a song I dig on this thing it 's 'Stinker ' , a funked up blues-rocker that has real rock 'n ' roll soul , mixed with English eccentricity and an hilarious lyric , as well as perfectly appropriate vocals from Elton . 'Do n't let the sun go down on me ' is a gorgeous and melodic ballad , not quite as heartfelt as it pretends , Elton sounds quite happy as he 's singing this song , but it 's still a very memorable song . It has a very rousing chorus and plenty of spine-tingling melodies . The choice of trumpets was a wonderful addition to the arrangement . 'Ticking ' also has great melodeis , a haunting ballad about a mass-shooting , but the song focuses more on the psychology of the young man with the gun . The melody is great and there are some hooks in it as well . 'The b* is back ' is a sly rocker that is performed at break-neck speed , but is still fun , though I personally prefer 'Grimsby ' I think it has a good , memorable chorus and is quite a fun song.So there is some good material , and most of the rest of it is enjoyable , but hardly memorable .	-1
I am blown away by the plethora of positive reviews and only one negative review . I gave each track only about 2 minutes til i quickly fast forwarded it to the next . What a sad sad sad excuse for an electronica album . This is truly the worst electronica album I have ever heard ... nothing but mundande noise stuff with gay voice overs that sounded like it was created by some 16 year olds in their basements ... .after scanning through the album in under 10 minutes I quickly tossed it to my garbage can..The only plus side its five tracks ... fortunately I got it used off of amazon for [ ... ] cents plus [ ... ] bucks shipping ... got it cuz a buddy suggested it and cuz of its absurd amount of 5 stars ... .id rate it lower if i could ... i wouldnt even call it an electronica genre cd ... ..needless to say i wont be buying any other albums for this sad xcuse of a band	-1
This should have had Livin ' in America ! ! ! That song would make it complete ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
you wan na feel the godfather buy the box set which includes 80 hardcore jams made by jb and his disciples of funk .	-1
James Brown : The Godfather of Soul , Soul Brother # 1 , the founder of funk , the father of Hip Hop ( having been sampled by nearly everyone ) , a cultural icon , and the Hardest Working Man in Show Business . Ai n't never gon na be another.20 ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS consists of 20 tracks . These are some of his biggest hits , presumably from the 1960s and 1970s , but such information is not provided in this collection . Booklet does not provide any information , other than songwriting credits , about the songs included in this collection . Sound quality is good.While the packaging is completely lacking , the songs are great . There 's `` I Got You ( I Feel Good ) '' , `` Papa 's Got a Brand New Bag '' , `` Hot Pants '' , `` Night Train '' , `` Cold Sweat '' , `` Sex Machine '' , the ballads `` Try Me '' and `` It 's a Man 's Man 's Man 's World '' , and my personal favorite , `` The Payback '' , in its 7+ minute version.Get this collection as a James Brown sampler only . This is not for fans looking for a comprehensive collection or a historical album.Music : 5 starsPackaging : 0 stars	-1
Judging by both of their collections of `` hits '' , the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s , and unfortunately , beyond . These two `` pretend '' rockers hit the radio with junk like `` Crocodile Rock '' ( John ) and `` Uptown Girl '' ( Joel ) , thus cementing their respective geek reputations . Yuck ! Neither Elton John nor Billy Joel have made anything authentic ; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes , making them like the male equivalents of Gloria Estefan or Madonna . Yuck ! Zero stars .	-1
Fraudulent `` rocker '' Elton continues on his journey to the land of Yuckville with yet another collection of the most `` worn out their welcome '' tunes ever to land radio play . Who in their right mind would put this on at home and listen to it , when you can turn on any classic rock or '80s nostalgia radio station and hear these tired tracks any time of day or night ? Boring boring boring .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... it 's hard to determine a rating on this box set because although it shows that Elton had great non-album tracks , the best stuff in this box has been added as bonus tracks to his albums . So you probably want to skip this in favor of buying the expanded editions of his early 70 's albums .	-1
Seriously , folks ... this band SUCKS ! Every one of these hits ( Dancing Queen , Sugar Sugar , Mamma Mia , Take a Chance on Me ) is dated , sugary , and awful as awful gets . How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me . KEEP AWAY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Track 19 `` Waterloo '' is corrupt . The first part has been cut and it jumps when the song starts . I contacted Customer Service and found out that it 's located in the Philipines ( according to the tech ) ; they could n't understand what I was saying about it being corrupt and insisted that the download failed . Playing it on the Amazon Cloud Player results in the same problem . I insisted on speaking to a manager who said she would take care of it and with a an hour I received and email saying the problem was fixed . But the problem was not fixed as of this writing .	-1
Howdy fellow muzik fanz ! I love listening to easy going music like the next guy but these ABBA folks are really starting to irritate me ! I was up at 3am the other night ( i have insomnia LOL ! ) and woke up to an infomercial of an old geezer trying to sell ABBA cd 's because they are supposedly 'one of the best ' Euro-Pop bands ever ... ha ! I fell for his trick and actually bought this album . What a complete disaster ! The vocal talent of the vocals in this band do n't even compare to the legends Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj ! The instrumentals are just irritating ... why ca n't they include dubstep bass drops or lil wayne type hip hop beats ? ? ! Lastly , the lyrics are just awful ! `` money , money , money '' is a completely disturbing song about envious people who wish they had money ... trying to make the 1 % ers look bad ! Well guess what ABBA ? 1 % of the world owns 90 % of the wealth ... and they did it all legally ... ( I.e . Halliburton , Wallstreet , Oil Companies ) ... `` Dancing Queen '' is sooo lame.. they do n't shake their booties like the girls in 50 Cent videos ... ... . and `` Take a Chance on me '' is sooo cheesy ! I ca n't believe anyone would actually support these shams ! ! For good female vocalist ... stick with Nicki Minaj , Lady Gaga , Selena Gomez , Jessica Simpson , Britney Spears , and the ever so talented Milli Vanilli !	-1
aside from Dancing Queen & amp ; Fernando there was n't much to ABBA.formula Production & amp ; Music.catchy but forgettable for the most part .	-1
I for one am glad that the 70 's are over and even more estatic that bands like Abba no longer exist ... ... .Why the 2 stars instead of a one ? I feel sorry for them -- I mean they were sincere -- -they just stunk ... ..	-1
I have always enjoyed the Moody Blues having some vinyl and cd 's but all have been studio albums . This album can not be recommended as the recording is weak , very shallow and tinny . The vocals on this album are weak beyond belief . I thought this cd would capture an essence that studio recordings lack , however I wished I had not heard how weak vocally this band has become .	-1
Coming off the high and the worlwide acceptance of Yes I Am , I was a bit taked back with this album . It seemed a little fluffy and very overproduced . I just did not feel a connection with her on this one . I did however like a couple of the songs that were hits on the radio , but other than that , I was dissapointed . But even though Melissa may have missed on a couple albums altogether ( Breakdown and Your Little Secret , you could never walk away from a Melissa concert without being inspired .	-1
I have always had a soft-spot for 80s rock . I grew up on Van Halen , Motley Crue , Poison , Def Leopard , RATT , Skid Row , etc . So you 'd think I 'd love Bon Jovi , right ? Wrong ! I have always hated Bon Jovi.I actually think they are a talented band . Ritchie Sambora is a talented player and can definitely write catchy riffs and solo . The rest of the band is competent enough . I think Bon Jovi had the potential to be a good band . So , what is my main problem with them ? First , although the band has written some catchy songs-the band , along with Desmond Child ( who is the kiss of death to anything cool ) finds a way to ruin it ; by making it overly glossy , radio-friendly and assessable . Bon Jovi 's music is completely wimpy and lightweight and lacks any real substance.Second , I utterly hate Jon Bon Jovi . He has a good voice , I 'll give him that . But he is a lightweight , candy-ass who is n't a tenth as good as Diamond David Lee Roth or Axl Rose , or even Vince Neil or Brett Michaels.Bon Jovi 's music is corporate pap aimed at 12 year-old girls . If you want to get into some good 80s rock-pick up Guns N ' Roses `` Appetite For Destruction , '' Van Halen 's `` 1984 '' or Motley Crue 's `` Shout at the Devil . '' If you must buy a Bon Jovi album ( and stink up your collection ) then buy this .	-1
i just ca n't believe how this band ripped me off . many people and the band themselves claimed to be 'hair metal ' . nothing could be further from the truth . it would be impossible to call these guys rock , let alone metal . just because they dressed like motley crue and poison did n't mean they could ever amount to what the previous bands had . these square idiots predented to be heavy metal just to cash in on the late-80 's hair metal movement . stay away from this piece of fake rock . a word of warning : THIS IS POP , NOT ROCK .	-1
`` He was an idol then , now he 's an idol here . But his face has changed..He 's not the same no more..And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before . '' ( E.John-B.Taupin 1976 )	-1
Elton is a great artist , a real one . He made fantastic album in the 70'sand in the 80 's , but good things never last forever . I think he did great stuff but his star has faded . This album is n't great but Elton still is .	-1
For the inordinately curious.The Grant Green album is far superior to the Donald Byrd session , which is n't saying a whole lot .	-1
`` Crocodile Rock '' is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio , and it is the main hit on this album . OK , `` Daniel '' was also a hit , and is tolerable , but the rest of this album reeks . Elton John is vastly overrated .	-1
I 'm sorry , but this album is horrible . The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant , affecting & quot ; Honky Chateau & quot ; LP makes it clear , in retrospect , that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from & quot ; Artist & quot ; to & quot ; Entertainer & quot ; . Sure , & quot ; Daniel & quot ; still sounds great ; but & quot ; Have Mercy on the Criminal & quot ; is just horrid , and & quot ; Midnight Creeper & quot ; is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time . And the rest just reeks of early-70s tackiness -- all dressed up in baby blue polyester suits with nowhere to go ... .	-1
This is where it all started..well , if you do n't count & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; . I love Elton John 's music , I have for a long time , and this album is essential , but it 's not one of my favorites.. & quot ; Your Song & quot ; is still a nice touch , while & quot ; I Need You To Turn To & quot ; scores more points ( check out the & quot ; Live In Australia & quot ; version ) , but & quot ; Take Me To The Pilot & quot ; , this version of it is pretty horrid . It does n't sound as catchy as it would on different live releases . & quot ; No Shoe Strings On Louise & quot ; is one of the better songs on here , with a definite Stones influence ; & quot ; First Episode At Hienton & quot ; makes me feel like jumping out of a window ; & quot ; Sixty Years On & quot ; , while not a terrible song , the strings are too much at times ; & quot ; Border Song & quot ; , again , sounds better live ; & quot ; Greatest Discovery & quot ; , a touching song , but one I do n't find myself indulging in too much , & quot ; The Cage & quot ; , filler ; & quot ; The King Must Die & quot ; , there is something somewhat moving about this one , but it is still overblown . As for the bonus tracks , & quot ; Bad Side Of The Moon & quot ; is overproduced ; & quot ; Grey Seal & quot ; , I kinda like it , though I ca n't tell you why ; & quot ; Rock N'Roll Madonna & quot ; is a catchy , Jerry Lee Lewis type rocker . To sum it all up , I think all of Elton 's & quot ; Classic Years & quot ; albums are worth having , including this one , but this is my least favorite , with the possible exceptions of & quot ; Caribou & quot ; and & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; . I think the strings present the biggest problem on this album..just overly dramatic in a lot of places , and a little hollow at times as well . If you want to hear the strings put to good use , check out & quot ; Madman Across The Water & quot ; .	-1
`` I looked up/And saw the empty sky/If I could only/Could only fly ... '' If Elton only knew what was to come.The first Elton John , though only released in the U.S. in the mid-70s , after his run of big singles was beginning to dry up , has a feeling more of cleaning up after the elephants as much as it does of leading the parade . Elton 's voice , in the notable title track , the best song on the original track lineup , sounds as world-weary as it would on `` Blue Moves , '' recorded some seven years later . The lyrics of ES are less sharp than usual , though the subjects are less the broken relationships Bernie Taupin came to write about so obsessively later in his career , and more in line with pre-teen daydreaming about Norse gods and escape . Maturation was still to come , along with the pop chops and chart-topping savvy.There 's nothing great on this collection to recommend it to a non-completist , it 's a little too proggy and twee . That said , a casual fan will find worthwhile things . The melodies are pretty if unmemorable , with songs like `` The Scaffold '' and `` Western Ford Gateway '' standouts on the hummability meter . How 's this for an unusual complaint for a pop record : Too much harpsichord ! The song `` Empty Sky '' is the major revelation , because it really showcases a different Elton than we saw performing `` Your Song '' the following year . It 's an interesting peek at the artist behind the showman , just following his muse and trying to figure out what works , and the crunchy guitar licks are pretty sensational , though the song never quite gels in the way of a `` Philadelphia Freedom '' or `` Benny And The Jets . `` The best song on the CD is not from the original album , but `` Lady Samantha , '' which when released as a single some months before gave Elton his first ( minor ) radio success . That churns and burns in Elton 's characteristically pleasing manner.If you like Elton a lot , you will like `` Empty Sky . '' If you listen to his Greatest Hits packages once in a while and want to dig deeper , you might start with something more like `` Captain Fantastic '' or `` Tumbleweed Connection . '' This is a good recording , tarnished only by the fact its maker ( s ) would go on to do a lot better .	-1
Well , this is where it all really started . & quot ; Empty Sky & quot ; , 1969..If I could , I would would give this album another half star , because though it is lacking , there is still something rather charming , and enjoyable about it . At first , I listened to this album very little , and was n't impressed , but all the sudden , I would be in class , or doing whatever , and I would have & quot ; Val-Hala & quot ; stuck in my head , a very haunting song . The title track is probably my favorite , I 'm surpised it does n't get classic rock airplay , or performed live . & quot ; Western Ford Gateway & quot ; is a catchy one , along with & quot ; Sails & quot ; ( watch out for the lyrics on that one , though ) . & quot ; Skyline Pigeon & quot ; is a great song , but I am more partial to the versions on & quot ; Here And There & quot ; , or & quot ; Rare Masters & quot ; , and why oh why , did it have to be about a pigeon ... One thing that I do n't understand about this album , why was there a non-album single , & quot ; It 's Me That You Need & quot ; , released right before , but not included on the lp ? There for , the album has no singles , this never really made any sense to me . Overall , I would say this is a decent , experimental album , a little rough around the edges , but any true fan has to hear where it all started .	-1
First off , I am an EJ fan . I own everything he 's recorded . Nevertheless , I also try and be objective and this review is more for the casual/beginning fan who may not be familiar with Elton 's entire catalog . That said , Empty Sky is very much an album for Elton enthusiasts . It 's a sort of curio piece ( or artifact ) that only rabid EJ fans will find listenable . In truth , Empty Sky 's only value is the glimpse it shows listeners of Elton 's origins . Skyline Pigeon , is the one worthy track on this thing . From failed psycadelia ( Empty Sky ) to dull , cheerless , false antiquity ( Valhalla , the Scaffold ) , this is an effort that reflects the times ( late 60 's ) and Elton 's attempt to compete with all of the other once popular ( and now utterly forgotten ) & quot ; time capsule & quot ; , mock-atmospheric oddities such as Procol Harum or the Moody Blues . Elton was very much trying to find himself , musically , and he had n't yet realized his true gift : the ability to pen unbelievably catchy pop songs .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... this is Elton 's first album and it 's rough around the edges . A good producer could have improved this project and there are a couple of decent tracks including the title song .	-1
After a number of years with Bluesology and some moderately successful singles with lyricist Bernie Taupin , Dick James Music decided to give Elton the chance to record his own album.Because it was 1969 , this album is fraught with needless elements of psychadelia and overt experimentation . Moroever , even the remastered version of the album is incapable of covering up the poor production quality of this `` master work '' . `` Empty Sky '' plods along for well over 8 minutes until it ends with this silly fade-out and fade-in during which Elton provides some `` grooooovy '' overdubs . You really have to LOVE the harpsichord to like `` Val Hala '' . Beyond that , the album reads as an instruction manual on how to play the recorder . `` Skyline Pigeon '' is the great song of this album , and even so , this version if far inferior to the versions on `` Rare Masters '' or `` Here or There '' . Elton 's voice is whiney and nasal ; the harpsichord , omnipresent . I will give an honorable mention here to `` Western Ford Gateway '' which is a really good , catchy tune which struggles to get noticed amidst all the experimental debris surrouding it.Just when you think Elton is going to put out a good song with the grave and serious `` Gulliver '' , it suddenly jettisons into come fruity jazz number `` It 's Hay Chewed '' . Then , the `` Reprise '' is nothing more than a fragment of each song on the album meshed into a minute ... blah ! The bonus tracks like `` Lady Samantha '' and `` It 's Me That You Need '' are mere footnotes in Elton 's catalog and provide the listener with little consolation after having endured an otherwise dreadful album.I would seriously skip this album .	-1
If it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star , nice to sleep to though	-1
I ca n't stand this guy 's music ! I admit I bought his albums up to 1974 , but got rid of them shortly thereafter , and never heard them again , mainly because they were all over the radio all the time , and I got sick and tired of hearing Elton 's flat vocals and Bernie Taupin 's stupid lyrics . Can you tell I 'm not a fan ?	-1
Okay , people tend to overrate this one and I 'm not sure why . I think it has to do with the legendary , almost mythic , status of EJ circa 1970 , wowing 'em at the Troubadour in L.A . Thus , this live album is supposed to be evidence of his ivory-pounding roots . But live albums have always tended to be product ( like Greatest Hits albums ) and this one 's disappointing because it catches Elton on a bad night and reveals , perhaps , his biggest problem as a live performer : his penchant to get a ridiculously smarmy ( see his embarrassing MTV unplugged performance for proof ) . Instead of simply performing his songs and letting the compositions stand on their own , Elton tends to go over-the-top . His vocal antics on Honky Tonk Women are flat-out silly , and why would he ruin Burn Down The Mission by turning it into a medley ? Throw in the fact that Elton and his band do n't sound in top form ( nor rhythm ) and I 'm ready to move on to Dylan 's Before the Flood or Warren Zevon 's Stand in the Fire , two truly outstanding live albums .	-1
I really really really tried to like this album but it just does n't do much for me . The songs are mediocre and the performances do n't sound that great ( much like Leon Russel Live ) . He tries hard but too much yelling and piano bashing , and the end result is mediocre at best and annoying . Do not reommend this one .	-1
Tumbleweed Connection raised Elton to his initial peak audibly with the hit single Country Comfort , and that legendary epic , Burn down the mission . It was the energy of that album that inspired the recording of 11-17-70 , Live at the ANR Studios in New York City . In reality , this album was nothing but one long horrible noise . John 's talents were wasted , with his vocals drowned in layers of instruments , which unfortunately destroyed the albums ambience . The eighteen minute version of burn down the mission became panned out to the point of very overdone . As much as I love listening to Elton 's Music , this album was a rapid fall to failure . The modestly improved & quot ; madman across the water & quot ; and & quot ; Honky chateau & quot ; , were released in 1971 and 1972 respectively . but it would be the release of & quot ; Do n't shoot me , I 'm only the piano player & quot ; , and & quot ; Good-bye yellow brick road & quot ; in 1973 , that would bring him back to his audible peak , and steer him well clear of this brief trench in his career .	-1
This live album was only mediocre . Buy the studio versions . Some of the tunes on this go on and on until you have to move onto the next track .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... Elton live is rarely a good thing . This CD is no exception and if it were n't for his better than average version of `` Take Me To the Pilot '' this would n't even get 2 stars .	-1
It is amazing how quickly Elton fell from the heights of great pop music ( Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ) to the depths of this garbage . Totally unlistenable - and it does not get much better for a long long time .	-1
Ok , maybe I am wrong but this is for me the worst Elton 's album . The songs are not catchy . Someone said here that Elton 's tank runs out of gas . And that is true . GYBR is great album and also Caribou and other albums from 70'es but this just is n't . Only good song here is Island girl ( that is something like Crocodile rock ) . Dan Dare sounds like ugly interpretation but it 's funny.In all this rock songs there are not even a good song like Pinball Wizard or Saturday ... ! Only good thing is that this is Elton 's last album with songs like here . I do n't want even to imagine how will be sounded Rock of the Westies ( part two ) . I know that almost no one will be agree with me but do n't shoot me , I am just a guy with my opinion !	-1
This was a disappointment but it did turn up a few gems . `` Billy Bones and the White Bird '' was a great rocker with thundering drums , a must-have for any Elton John fan . `` Island Girl '' was a textbook Elton John single for that era , and `` I Feel Like A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford '' was a first class Elton John ballad ; do n't settle for live versions of the song that appear on compilations . Of the remaining six songs only `` Feed Me '' would be worth downloading.Imagine the shock of hearing an album open with not one but two awful songs before rolling into the single . This had been unheard of for an Elton John album up to that point . `` Grow Some Funk Of Your Own '' was a grade Z single at the time and in retrospect is better left forgotten.The few memorable songs make this the last hurrah of Elton 's seventies classics . One ca n't hold his subsequent recording history against him too much though given the string of great music he gave us in the early to mid-seventies .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... This is Elton 's transition album into his worse musical period . The difference between this and his next release `` Blue Moves '' is we do n't have to tolerate his mistakes through two CDs ! `` Grow Some Funk of Your Own '' is another classic Elton song and the last great song for the rest of the decade .	-1
So it 's late 1975 . Elton 's previous 6 albums have soared to number one : the last one , `` Captain Fantastic '' actually entering the charts at number one , a feat then previously unheard of . Elton is playing on the Muppet Show , getting his star on Hollywood Blvd. , and filling out Dodger Stadium in L.A. for two nights straight . `` Philadelphia Freedom '' goes to # 1 and his portrayal of the Pinball Wizard in the Who 's `` Tommy '' dominates the movie . Elton is the biggest rock star on the planet and can seemingly do no wrong . Predictably , when `` Rock of the Westies '' is released , it , like its predecessor , enters the chart at number one ... But Elton 's life is in turmoil . He is depressed and drinking . He dives into a swimming pool after taking an OD of sleeping pills in a failed suicide attempt ... with his mother present ! The sycophants around him convince him of his infallibility . This album , from its unintelligible jokes in the liner notes , to its goofy feel overall , are the testament of an burnt-out artist in pain.Unlike previous albums , where Elton and Bernie would allow themselves one `` silly '' song ... almost all the songs on this album are clownish . With Dee Murray and Nigel Olson gone , Elton 's new band injects his music with a harder rock sound , but the inherent silliness in the lyrics spills over badly . The `` Medley '' in the beginning complains of an ugly big woman down in New Orleans . Similarly , the protagonist of the # 1 hit `` Island Girl '' is black , island woman standing 6'3 '' who could drive her nails into you like a rake ... '' Dan Dare '' , finds Elton returning to the theme of space travel , only this time , rather than the thoughtful `` Rocketman '' , we get frenetic piano playing and Elton 's barking noises.The drivel just does not stop . An otherwise superb production effort by Gus Dudgeon is ruined by Elton/Bernie 's buffoonery as they relate songs about a bar fight in a Mexican cantina , a fight between an overworked married couple and the simply incoherent `` Billy Bones '' which takes us from the decks of a stormweathered ship to the flash and pazazz of some rock star 's entrance on stage ... '' Street Kids '' is the only discernible song with any punch here . `` I Feel Like a Bullet '' is the hit Elton tried to push on fans following `` Island Girl '' though it never took off , and its obvious why . While Davey Johnstone 's guitar work is beautiful , and Elton 's falsetto impressive , the song is just too sappy.The remastered version has a beautiful song called `` Sugar on the Floor '' . Elton is alone at his piano : all of the silliness gone . His singing is sorrowful and pleading . It is the most honest track on the album .	-1
First Band on the Moon by The Cardigans had the potential to be a great pop album but there are only 2 good tracks , Lovefool and Been It . Most of the time I do n't care for the songs that were huge hits but the rest of the songs are boring and lifeless . The Cardigans have a great sound but too bad they could n't churn out timeless songs .	-1
Lovefool song on this album was good , the rest were just crap , in my ( clearly not so humble ) opinion . To me , this was a one-hit-wonder band .	-1
Cardigans ` third record is , well , not all that different from their previous ones . This time the lyrics get a little darker and cynical at parts , although the songs remain poppy , acessible , and , unfortunately , a bit forgettable . This is easy listening , which isn ` t too bad but it ` s not that exciting either and becomes a somewhat repetitive album . This meld of pop , lounge and kitsch is mildly entertaining but & igrave ; sn ` t enough to make a solid record . Still , there are some good songs here , like the pretty & quot ; The Great Divide & quot ; or the catchy & quot ; Been It & quot ; , even if the rest ends up sounding the same . Cute and listenable , but that ` s it . The bands ` next release , & quot ; Gran Turismo & quot ; , is a more consistent and ambitious offering , stepping in a new and darker direction .	-1
I gave the Scorps one more chance after the major disappointment of Animal Magnetism , & I 'll tell ya , disappointment went to utter disgust , with the music & lyrics going backwards & gettin ' more immature than ever , but good for the intended 12-14 yr-old market . I said 'goodbye ' to the Scorps then and only listened to Lovedrive & all the ones before ... .-then awhile later , I heard `` Rock you like a herd-of-cans '' on the radio & it only cemented my belief that they sold out to commercialism & the big bucks , with any serious hard-rock songwriting tossed aside -- oh , well , at least they got the big bucks ! ( but not anymore of mine )	-1
Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion . Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard , especially in the genre of country/pop . Her voice is completely unoriginal , there 's no fire , range , or accessiblility . I ca n't believe how truly awful her songwriting is ! Terrible cliches , junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies . Songs like That Do n't Impress Me Much , Man I Feel Like a Woman ! , Do n't Be Stupid , and You 're Still the One just gives me the willies . The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You 've Got a Way . Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s . Stay clear from this over-rated mess !	-1
This CD is only good after three listens . The lyrical content is very shallow and baseless . The Woman In Me was great , but was dearly disappointed with this . I compare it to leaving the bottle cap of the soda opened too long : it goes stale.When a CD gets this kind of hype and have no content , we all know it is a fad and in five years will be forgotten. & quot ; Honey , I 'm Home & quot ; gets grating on the ears . The song does n't even try to stay county , except with some synthesized fiddles . And the & quot ; remix & quot ; CD , if you can call it that is even worse . Shania has sold out to become a part of the pop world.I only like & quot ; You 're Still The One & quot ; and & quot ; From This Moment On & quot ; . Shania should go back to her country roots and give up this pop trip of hers.I ca n't wait to see real country back because this & quot ; New Country & quot ; is starting to sound more like mainstream pop .	-1
she 's lucky she 's such a fox , that 's all i have to say . no way an average looking person gets away with songs like & quot ; Man ! I Feel Like a Woman. & quot ; I gave her a 5 for looks and a negative 1 for music , weighted equally that comes out to 2 stars .	-1
I think this is a very over-rated artist getting by , for the most part , on her looks . Many of her songs are based on the same heavy beat , reminiscent of Queen 's & quot ; We Will Rock You & quot ; , so they sound the same . Also , her lyrics are usually silly & amp ; superficial ( & quot ; Man ! I Feel Like a Woman & quot ; , & quot ; That Do n't Impress Me Much & quot ; , & quot ; Rock This Country & quot ; ... ) . Her first CD ( before she started writing her own material ) was her best .	-1
Well , let 's not deny the impact Shania Twain 's looks have on record sales . Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I 've seen and she can also sing - that 's good but not essential for success . `` Come on over '' is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like `` Man I feel like a woman '' and `` Do n't be stupid '' is alright . The big hit `` That do n't impress me much '' , which by the way is n't sounding anything like country is a great song , but the rest of the material is very mediocre . I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing , but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go . To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul . I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead .	-1
what is so special about Shania Twain ? she is a country Jennifer Lopez.all hype and no talent.Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out.Shania is pop.her songs and material have more in common with celine dion than Patsy Cline.that do n't impress me much is as pop as addicted to Love.she is great at marketing but her music has no roots.Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other material but considering her overall impact she is way overrated & amp ; overplayed .	-1
The whole Shania Twain phenomenon is still something that escapes me . Her musical success is confusing . Shania Twain is not really all that talented . To call her a country singer is an insult to true country singers . She is a Canadian pop singer whose pop music appeal was n't strong enough to make it in the U.S. market . So , she was repackaged as a 'country ' star in order to find a niche for her where she could sell some albums . The result is dreck like & quot ; Come on Over & quot ; & quot ; Come on Over & quot ; does n't sound remotely country , other than a few guitar twangs , and it does n't come close to sounding like good music . The ballads she sings are so bland and boring that I feel I 'm in danger of falling asleep anytime they come on the radio . & quot ; Still the One & quot ; and & quot ; From this Moment & quot ; are classic examples of how unoriginal and unappealing her ballads are . With her faster , more upbeat songs , it gets even worse . Rhythm , lyrical structure , and sophisticated lyrics are in absence here . & quot ; That Do n't Impress Me Much & quot ; is an embarrassment along these lines . Absolutely no rhythm exists and with lyrics like 'ok , so you 're a rocket scientist ... that do n't impress me much ' one ca n't help but wonder if this was a 6th grader writing these lyrics . & quot ; Man I Feel like a woman & quot ; seems like just an excuse for her to go 'whoo ' 'whoo ' every 30 seconds.It 's a sad state of affairs where these days where the music industry has become so geared to homogenized , pop-friendly music that albums like the ones Shania Twain puts out become huge hits , but daring , original music falls by the wayside . I fear the days of exceptional music are fast ending , and & quot ; Come On Over & quot ; is just one more example of that trend .	-1
After this CD came out i bought it , and i listend to it for a while , why i do n't know ? it had some cathy songs , yes , it has some fun songs , sure , but i really hate her voice . at first it 's fine to listen to her voice and she 's a good songwriter and seem to have a great personality , that i 'll give her , but in the longrun , her voice is very harsh on the ears ... i suggest you listen through one of her cd BEFORE you buy it ... cause her voice might not be as appealing to everyone ...	-1
It 's no secret that Shania is n't really country . Infact , she tries to be just about everything besidescountry . She done like alot of artist do ... Start outinnocent , then as time goes along she sells out moreand more to please the masses.What is it ? It 's production and marketing . I mean , ifyou are going to sell out why not try and reach outto everybody ? She comes with the ballads , a few slightrockers , pop songs ... Just about everything . She evencomes out with the international version ( which is theone I have ) that sounds at times like dance music.She 's like a new version of Madonna to be honest . Youca n't say she 's ALL bad ... But alot of her seems tobe about the attention and money . I bought into itwhen I was younger and I 'll admit that ... but about5 years ago my tastes started changing and `` artists '' like Shania pushed me to soul music . It 's somethingthat Shania really does n't have alot of.If I had to say which tracks on this album are thebest I 'd go with : You 've Got A Way and Rock ThisCountry ! and From This Moment On . The rest is prettymuch just catchy and cheap pop songs . Her secondalbum `` The Woman In Me '' is actually the betteralbum than this one .	-1
I will admit ... I purchased this CD ( albeit for $ 2.50 at the local used CD store ) , because I did like a couple of the singles on it . However , when putting this CD on and listening all the way through , one soon realizes that every song sounds just about the same ( okay , okay ... the fast ones sound like the other fast ones , the slow ones ... well , you get it ) . As I quickly tired of hearing the one or two catchy songs on the radio ( over and over and over ) , I have since traded this one back in to the store.If you like country , stick to Reba or Martina ... they wo n't soon be yesterday 's newspapers . And if you like pop ... there are far better artists out there who are making lasting music ( even Britney will be around long after Shania fades ) . And of course , if you just MUST buy this CD ... at least wait until one of the many millions shows up used at a store near you for a couple bucks . That way , when you come to the same conclusion I did , you wo n't be out much .	-1
I thought this cd was so wack , that I had to check the cd package to see if this was really Brian McKnight doing the performing on this cd . First off the rip-off jobs he was doing on songs as title track ( sounds like the riff to Outside Your Door by , Me'Shell Ndegeocello ) and the track The Only One For Me ( stealing the riff to the R Kelly remix of I Ca n't Sleep Baby , yall know what I 'm talking about ) . You Should Be Mine was another let down . And what 's up with Jam Knock ? I wish artist like Brian would stick to what they know instead of listening to their A & amp ; R reps . I guess I 'll just stick to the first two cd 's he released . By the way those uptempo cuts on the first two cd 's are way better than the crappy ones he 's got on the new one . I just ca n't recommend this to anyone . As a matter of fact , I 'm giving him two stars based on his past performances and hoping for a better outing next cd.Peace Xes Cainam	-1
Nothing new , still too cool for his own good.You 'd never know `` Back At One '' was only two years away .	-1
There are worse albums in Elton John 's catalogs than 1998 's `` The Big Picture '' - I 've already reviewed several of them . However , while it does n't quite sink to the level of `` Leather Jackets '' or `` Victim of Love , '' `` The Big Picture '' is Elton ( and Bernie Taupin ) at his most generic and uninspired.Unlike those previous efforts , there 's no real underlying factor ( drug abuse , attempting to stay relevant ) to why `` The Big Picture '' is a subpar effort . It 's not terrible , and it 's certainly more listenable than the other two atrocities I listed ( not to mention superior to `` A Single Man '' and perhaps `` Ice on Fire '' ) , but it suffers from a combination of maudlin lyrics and uninspired melodies and syrupy arrangements that do little to distinguish one track from the other . Several really good songs ( `` Recover Your Soul , '' `` Live Like Horses , '' `` Wicked Dreams '' ) lose their potential due to being smothered by garish , overbearing electronic arrangements that overshadow their more organic elements.The album 's best remembered track , the mega-hit `` Something About the Way You Look Tonight , '' ( the lead track on the double-single that brought forth the all-time bestselling `` Candle in the Wind 1997 '' ) , is trite lyrically but is sold by Elton 's passionate vocal and a subtler arrangement than the rest of the tracks . Do n't get me wrong , it 's certainly bombastic , but not nearly as bad as some of the other tracks here . `` The Big Picture '' is not a classic by any means , and is undoubtedly one of Elton 's weakest efforts .	-1
First of all , The Big Picture is n't a bad album . It 's just not what one would of hoped it would be . This album is a disappointment . Especially coming off a string of good albums like `` Sleeping With The Past '' , `` The One '' , `` Made In England '' , and the greatest ballad hits collection , `` Love Songs '' . This album is fairly low tempo . There are a few mid tempo songs , but not many . That 's alright . It 's just the low tempo ones are a little too long and unmemorable . There are high points . `` Something About The Way You Look Tonight '' , `` The Big Picture '' , `` Wicked Dreams '' , `` If The River Can Bend '' , `` Love 's Got A Lot To Answer For '' , are the high points . The rest are n't bad , they just do n't seem to hit the right notes . Elton , by the way , sounds great . He always does . This was just a disappointment . Not that great . Could of been so much better .	-1
This album is depressing . After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England ' this album was a big let-down for me . All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program , there are n't any interesting melodies or modulations , the arrangements are uninteresting , underplayed , and by-the-book , and even his voice , which can lend viability to substandard fare , sounds detached and bored . Except in the hit , `` Something about the way you Look tonight '' , where he sings with a bit of REAL soul . That 's why the album actually deserves one star , it is a good song in his finest tradition . To be fair , he lost a number of friends in distressing circumstances in the period this album was made ( putting it mildly ) , the album seems to have a mournful underlying mood , when there 's any mood at all .	-1
The Big Picture for me was as a step down from the achievements of the previous release , Made In England . The main problem is the over production by Chris Thomas who gives these songs a dense , wall of sound production that drains the melodies dry . The songs themselves however are not that bad . In fact , it 's a shame that several did n't escape to surface on a future album . Opening with Long Way From Hapiness , it 's a fitting opener in lieu of Elton 's recent personal tragedies , the death of Princess Diana and his good friend , Gianni Versace - though the album was recorded prior to those events in the summer of 1997.Taupin returns for another round of lyrics that are his least ambitious in recent memory . Partly based on a loose concept of writing big old time ballads that the likes of Sinatra would sing , the album never quites hits it mark . Most are too simplistic and lack his unique narrative to tell what amounts to basic love stories . Love 's Got A Lot To Answer For is perhaps the best example of this : `` love 's got a lot to answer for , I just ca n't sleep with this feeling anymore '' .Others like , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , which appears to be a grand attempt at a classic ballad , only succeeds due to Elton 's powerful delivery . The melody and lyric however are routine at best.And that 's the problem with the rest . Live Like Horses is a powerful ballad about the death of Taupin 's father but is mired by an over use of synthesizers and unnecessary effects ( if you ever heard this solo , it 's a great song ) . Meanwhile , The End Will Come and I Ca n't Steer My Heart Clear of You simply do n't go anywhere . Most of these songs are slow to mid-tempo with the only real upbeat song being the closer Wicked Dreams . That one , while probably the most interesting lyric , simply never excels into what could have been a great rock song . It 's just simmers , never boils.But all is not lost here . If The River Can Bend is a wonderful gospel rave-up with a fantastic piano solo . January has a melody that changes and shifts dramatically along side one of Taupin 's most romantic lyrics . The title track also has some nice moments , including a wonderful opening of just Elton and piano.As you can see , I struggle with Elton 's albums where I 'm torn . I just ca n't outright not like it because there are some great songs here and Elton sings with great passion throughout.My biggest complaint is the production . It would make a great bookend to The One , another over produced album . But this was five years since The One and Chris Thomas brought nothing new to the table for Elton and these songs . Elton and Thomas had disagreements during the recording according to a recent biography by David Buckley and Taupin complained that the album sounded cold and too technical.The Big Picture falls squarely in the middle of pack of Elton 's albums . And for me , that 's frustrating.Best Tracks : Live Like Horses , If The River Can Bend , January , The Big Picture and Something About The Way You Look Tonight .	-1
For me , this is just a British singer with a bunch of good songs , but let 's not fool ourselves with this one . THIS IS NOT ELTON JOHN ! ! I mean , which is the best song here ? ? `` Recover your Soul '' ? , `` The Big Picture '' ? And what about the 80 % of the album ? ? Believe me , I am one of the most devoted EJ fans from Venezuela , but I have to tell you that this record is depressing ! ! Even `` Leather Jackets '' is a masterpiece compared to this one ! ! Sorry ... .	-1
This Elton John release just is not up to par by any means . Yes there are some `` good '' songs : Long Way From Happiness , Love Like Horses , Something In The Way You Look Tonight , and The Big Picture . These songs are indeed well crafted . However , they fall a bit short of the best of Elton 's Classic 70 's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.The remaining tracks are n't terrible per say . However , they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say . Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long , its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.Furthermore , the pacing and stylings of the record are limited . Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve . On top of that , the arrangements are so identical . Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement ? Elton 's trademark keyboard runs just are n't present enough in the overall mix . Yes there are some good solos , but once the solo is finished Elton 's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings . The guitar , bass , and drums do n't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.A few good songs here and there , but I would recommend passing on this collection .	-1
Maybe , as another reviewer noted , Elton was going through a difficult time when recording this album . Or maybe he 'd been devoting the majority of his time working on songs for Aida and El Dorado ( both projects , according to EJ , were five years in the making ) . Whatever the case , this John/Taupin effort is awfully lukewarm . I was n't particularly fond of Made in England ( sappy self-help songs ) , but at least that record sounded like EJ put effort into it . The Big Picture however has the feel of product -- the perfunctory Elton/Bernie release to keep their giant wheel turning . It 's also not a good sign when the only bonafide hit off this thing , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , is a weak single . Like Healing Hands or You Got ta Love Someone , Something is soft-rock , adult-comtemporary complacency . The song does have wonderful , soulful verses , but the chorus is dull and cliched . The two best songs on this CD are Long Way From Happiness and Recover Your Soul , but neither are classic EJ cuts . Long Way is especially burdened ( as is the whole album ) with drum machines and grandiose electric keyboards . Gosh , how wonderful this song would have been if Elton had recorded it entirely with his piano.In fairness , though , the production is top-notch and Elton 's singing does sound strong . Now middle-aged , it seems Elton 's songwriting skills have dropped but his sense of how to use his voice have improved . Nevertheless , I 'd recommend passing this album by ( or , at worst , purchasing it VERY cheap online ) . Oddly , I recommend The Road to El Dorado , a soundtrack that features EJ 's best work since the early 80 's	-1
I 've been an E.J . fanatic for a long time . I 've owned everything he 's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love ( I think I can be forgiven for that ) . I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it 's worst . I wanted so much to love this album -- -and I tried -- -I really tried.Yes , the single , `` Something About The Way ... '' is catchy and is the saving grace of this album . Another great song is the haunting , `` Long Way From Happiness . '' Other than that though , I find this work completly forgetable . It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like `` Goodbye Yellow Brick Road '' or `` Honky Chateau . `` Luckily , from his next album releases , `` Songs From The West Coast '' , `` Peachtree Road '' , and now `` Captain & The Kid '' , we now know Elton had n't totally lost his edge . After first hearing this dud , I feared he had . If you have a hankering for some newer E.J . masterpieces , avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... '' Recover Your Soul '' is decent and adding the duet version of `` Live Like Horses '' would have been a slight improvement . The big single `` Something in the Way '' was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it 's nothing special .	-1
John Mellencamp is one of my all time favorite singers . I love his all American rock and roll , the feel good vibe ( most of ) his songs possess and pretty much everything else . That being said , `` The Best That I Can Do : 1978-1998 '' is a single disc collection that does not do this great singer justice.Now do n't get me wrong , I love every song on this collection . Basically what this is is a sampling of all Mellencamp 's big hits , including `` Hurts So Good '' , `` Jack And Diane '' , `` Pink Houses '' , `` Authority Song '' , `` Small Town '' , `` R.O.C.K . In The U.S.A. '' and `` Cherry Bomb '' . These are all true American classics , but this group of songs does n't even come close to including all of his best work.For a lightyears better collection of Mellencamp 's best work , try picking up `` Words And Music '' , a two disc collection which includes all the songs here ( with the exception of the new recording `` Without Expression '' ) , plus many other great classics such as `` This Time '' ( a personal favorite ) , `` Peaceful World '' , `` Wild Night '' , `` Human Wheels '' , `` Pop Singer '' , `` Key West Intermezzo ( I Saw You First ) '' , and thankfully , `` Rain On The Scarecrow - Blood On The Plow '' .Overall , this cd really is n't worth it unless you just want hits ( remeber these are all five star songs ) . Most people should buy the aforementioned `` Words And Music '' or seek out the original albums .	-1
I truly do n't like John Mellencamp . His music was always some of the most offensive classic rock that came from the 80 's because he hardly ever had any interesting musical ideas . Generic country rock with unmemorable vocal melodies . A weak Creedence Clearwater Revival ripoff . That 's my impression of his work . It was always straight-forward , predictable commercial country rock/hard rock that never really did anything for me personally.This collection of tracks captures every single overplayed moment in all of its glory . A disc you truly do n't need to own because even today all you have to do is turn on your radio to ANY classic rock station and find most of the songs on the disc featured there , making this disc entirely pointless.The songs I particularly dislike would be `` Pink Houses '' and `` Lonely Ol ' Night '' . `` Jack and Diane '' HAS to be one of the most overplayed songs of all-time . It was great the first time you heard SOME of these songs , but not anymore . Overexposure can ruin a musicians career in the long run.I have warmed up to `` Small Town '' over the years though . `` Hurt so Good '' has to be one of the corniest attempts at a ballad ever .	-1
Every album The Moody Blues has released after & quot ; Long Distance Voyager & quot ; has been fairly worthless . For some reason , I used to like this lame stuff back when I was in high school . As I 've grown older and wiser , I have come to realize the error of my ways . & quot ; The Present & quot ; is a thoroughly mediocre album from a bunch of washed up hippie has-beens that barely has enough energy to power your speakers . Stick to classic Moody Blues material instead .	-1
Bon Jovi 's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums . You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80 's rather than for the actual songs on here . This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces . Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album . Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start .	-1
I loved this album when it first came out on vinyl and waited many years to by it on cd.When I found this version on Amazon I thought I would take a chance on it although it did not appear to remastered . Not one thing was done to improve the sound quality for this release.The sound on this cd is as flat as a pancake.The magnificent music on this album has been reduced to a sound that 's not even fit for the cut-out bin.There ought to be a law against music this wonderful being issued in any medium that sounds this bad.I 'll probably never listen to it again.Please note , this review applies to the 1990 version .	-1
Just so you know where I 'm coming from , I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era . I am less familiar with their post-1981 output , but much of what I 've heard is likeable . I 'm glad you are interested in the Moodies and encourage you to explore their first five albums . With that said , I can not recommend Seventh Sojourn ( 1972 ) . Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet . The worst offenders are John Lodge 's two offerings on Sojourn . `` Is n't Life Strange ? '' is like gooey treacle . Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John 's `` Eyes of a Child '' on `` Children 's Children '' . `` I 'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band '' , with its forced energy and `` is it over yet ? '' conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name . Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John 's `` Ride My See Saw '' , on `` Lost Chord '' or `` To Share Our Love '' on `` Threshold '' . Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here , with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics : `` All we are trying to say is we are all we 've got '' . Compare them to the passion of his `` Gypsy '' on `` Children '' , The Actor on `` Lost Chord '' , or the perfect rock 'n roll gem `` It 's Up to You '' , on `` Question of Balance '' . Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who 's really putting effort into his songs , but the results are ponderous and do not wear well . Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album 's enormous sales ? Of course not . Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition . But because there is not one song in this collection that I enjoy , one star is all they 're getting from this loyal fan .	-1
Well shame on the people involved in this `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' project . Oh , maybe that 's a little harsh.First off , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the sound has been aggressively compressed , which means , by the time you 've reached the later stages of the album , you may experience some ear fatigue . The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix , which is a sign of over compressing . The song , `` House Of Four Doors '' comes off really well , actually . It 's never sounded so powerful . I did n't even know their was a kick drum on that song ! But , then a song like `` The Actor , '' has a strange moment , Justin 's vocal is almost buried by the normally mellow background , which is led by the mellotrons flutes . Has the music industry gone compression mad ? Or , were the Moodies worried that their back catalogue ( the holy seven ) lacked musical muscle , and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer ? Or even both ? Another thing about aggressive compression , about a year ago I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 `` Who Do We Think We Are '' album , and by the time I got towards the end , my ears were tired . So , recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression , and it not only sounded better , but my ears were n't tired by the end . But , since the Moodies do n't play as loud as Purple , it should n't be a real problem . Now that I got that off my chest ... Secondly , the `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' bonus track enticement , just ticks me off . Sure , there are some good rarities here . For example , `` Dr. Livingston '' is actually more convincing than the official version . So then , why not release a `` Rarities Collection '' instead ? Maybe they thought the material is n't strong enough to stand on it 's own ? I do n't know . But , it does make for good bonus track material.Thirdly , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover ! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded ! But , the booklet is really good , with rare photos , stories and lots studio information.In conclusion , after hearing a number of these `` SACD Deluxe Editions , '' I 'll be keeping my old ( 1997 ) re-masters , after all , they still look and sound great . But now I have two versions of each album , great , just what I needed ? !	-1
This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album . Take a couple of good songs , in this case & quot ; The Question & quot ; and & quot ; And the Tide Rushes In , & quot ; and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler material . You 're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album .	-1

The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix . Another sign of over compressing . It seemed to help at least a couple songs `` The Balance , '' where the bottom end was a lot more in control and `` Never Comes The Day , '' which sounded really clear and focused . But , overall , has the whole music industry gone `` compression '' crazy ? Or , are the Moody Blues worried that their back catalogue ( the holy seven ) was lacking musical muscle , and are super charging it with heavy compression ? Also , another reviewer talked about the bass being too quiet for the surround sound mix , but I felt the bass was n't as strong on the `` regular '' mix , as it is on the other `` SACD Deluxe Editions . '' It 's reasonable , but not as breathtakingly boosted as the others in this deluxe series.Another thing about aggressive compression , this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 album `` Who Do We Think We Are .

The Moody Blues were for my generation the Powerhouse Band that fused hard rock with classical to create dreamscapes . Their signature sound enthralled millions ! Yet they started to slip from their pedestals , beginning with this album.The Song `` Question '' was by far one of their most powerful , beautiful and brilliant pieces ever created . Yet the other songs and ballads on this album are , in my opinion , mediocre.The blues resurfaced and climbed their pedestal once again with `` Seventh Sojurn . '' From then on , they have never been as creative as they were on `` To Our Children 's Children 's Children . `` The best way to buy this album is to get on an online MP3 service and purchase only the song : `` Question . ''	-1
Buy only if you collect the M.B. 's . This release has three , maybe four songs worth capturing .	-1
After six long years without fresh Moody Blues music ( their solo work in the interim certainly did n't count ) , I jumped at `` Octave '' when the LP hit the stands back in the summer of '78 . I tried , I really tried , I so WANTED to enjoy it . I eagerly sought out the trademark blends , the right instrumentals , the right SOUND.Well , a fair try , this LP was , but it just did n't happen . Collectively , `` Octave '' clunked , excepting one track , `` One Step Into the Light '' by Mike Pinder.Pinder 's departure from the band after `` Octave '' was a sad closing of the door on my interest in anything the band did from there on . I listened from a distance , even saw them in concert in 2001 -- alas , Pinder 's balding pate so noticeably absent on stage and my evening 's enjoyment so incomplete . I 've come to appreciate his talents as true Moody Blues more than any of the others . Not to disparage Justin Hayward , John Lodge , Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge . Every one of them deserves favour as a true artist in a sea of wannabes . But Pinder best put forth the dream-like sound , the mood , the close-your-eyes-and-listen elements untethered to a 3-minute time limit . Such qualities had withered by the time `` Octave '' came out and were altogether dead on all of the band 's subsequent albums.Truly , we were spoiled with the above lineup 's seven masterpieces , not to mention Phil Travers ' fantastic cover works , from '67 to '72 . By the late '70s and especially into the shallow '80s , the threshold was met and the sojourn was over . The days and future of such quality work had passed . I feel fortunate to have experienced those works of art during that classic period . The real beauty , the balance if you will , is they 're still with us and , I hope , gaining a new audience , our children and their children , in search of the lost art of the classic Moody Blues .	-1
Most Moody Blues albums are spotty , usually containing a mixture of good and bad songs . But on & quot ; Octave , & quot ; they forgot to include any good ones . Released the same year ( 1978 ) as Yes 's worst album , & quot ; Tormato , & quot ; it may have had something to do with lumbering dinosuar art rock bands failing to compete in the brave new world of Punk rock .	-1
Someone wrote that everything will be released on CD sooner or later . This just in ... everything will be re-released and remastered sooner or later by greedy record companies trying to stay alive . Such is the case here . Take Octave for what it truly is , an uneven mish-mash of styles from a band trying to regain their focus after a long sabbatical . Yes , there are some nice moments but there are a lot of dreadful ones as well . Fast forward to the BONUS tracks . Five live cuts culled from various shows that sound like they were recorded over the phone from the 99th row . Save your money if you think there is anything revelatory on these tracks . The title for this album should have been `` Will The Real Moody Blues Please Stand Up '' . An embarassment !	-1
Even though it had been six years since their last album , the boys had been very busy . All members released at least one solo album , and Hayward and Lodge recorded together . So it 's not like they had a huge backlog of songs that had piled up , and it shows here . The song selection is weak , and the band seems to be going through the motions here . The first side of the album is pretty solid , but the second side is abyssmal . Skip this one and go right to the much better Long Distance Voyager .	-1
I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song ... '' Steppin in a Slide Zone '' . I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works . `` Driftwood '' and `` I 'll be Level with you '' are also good . After that , the quality severely wanes .	-1
After the Moody Blues ' superb album `` Seventh Sojourn , '' fans had to wait another six years before the band 's next album , having to be content with wading through various solo projects , and the decent , but uneven , `` Blue Jays '' album ( a collaboration between Justin Hayward and John Lodge ) . Unfortunately , it was clearly not worth the wait , as `` Octave '' proved to be , far and away , the band 's weakest album to that point ( later `` outdone '' by the dreadful `` Sur La Mer '' and `` Keys of the Kingdom '' ) .The album starts out promisingly enough , with the lively `` Steppin ' in a Slide Zone '' written by John Lodge . A closer listening though , reveals how thin this song is , and how it relies on gimmickry more that musicianship . Still , it is one of the albums best songs , and far better that Lodge 's other contribution , the cloying `` Survival . `` The two songs by Ray Thomas are over-orchestrated , boring , and immediately forgettable , all the more surprising in that every preceding album has at least one ( and sometimes two ) strong Thomas contribution . Edge 's `` I 'll Be Level With You '' is noisy but without much substance , and Pinder 's `` One Step Into the Night '' is simply awful , with the worst Moody Blues ' lyrics ever written ( i.e . `` the one thing I can do , is play my mellotron for you '' ) .As far as Justin 's four songs , I suppose `` Driftwood '' is the best one , but that is n't saying much . I find `` Top Rank Suite '' annoying , and `` The Day We Meet Again '' just too long.Luckily , the next album `` Long Distance Voyager '' would be a significant improvement , and , I suppose , that since `` Octave '' was the first album the band released after I `` discovered '' them and became a huge fan ( I think in 1975 ) , it will always have a certain amount of sentimental value for me .	-1
Yet another classic that only became popular because their audience was stoned . Blaring , muddy , unmusical crud .	-1
This `` Tom Waits '' guy sucks . What a horrible voice ! He sounds like a piece of raw meat ran over by a truck . Listen to REAL music like Nickelback or St. Anger by Metallica if you want a truly enjoyable listening experience .	-1
But I think this album is extremely overrated . It just does n't do much for me . Not too exiting . I dig BONE MACHINE and MULE VARIATIONS and I consider HEARTATTACK AND VINE to be quinessential Waits . But I 'll only listen to `` Downtown Train '' and maybe one or two others before I 've had it with this tedious album . Sorry if you 'd prefer me to jump on the critical bandwagon , but it 's my honest opinion .	-1
Grace Jones was renowned for her weird , totally off the wall recordings and performances , but she was also curiously fascinating in doing so with albums like Warm Leatherette ( 1980 ) and Nightclubbing ( 1981 ) showing a flair for verstality and imagination . However when she returned to the studios in 1985 , she seemed to have lost direction . Although the atmospheric Slave To The Rythm is an excellent track that became one of her biggest sellers , the remainder of the album is an eccentric , blatantly weird affair . The diverse musical arrangements may come across as highly imaginative to some but to me it really lacks any sort of depth . Grace sounds at her most vampish on the almost gophic opening track , Jones The rythm , which is too uncomfortably strange from an equally strange artist . Recommended to die-hard Grace Jones fans only .	-1

Derek and the Dominoes were , of course , a one-album band for Eric Clapton and `` guest '' musicians . The title song and `` Bell Bottom Blues '' notwithstanding , the album is , in a word , B-O-R-I-N-G . While the virtuoso guitar soloing between Clapton and Allman may enthrall some , this album is guaranteed to otherwise put to sleep the vast majority of the listening public . This is definitely NOT an album to play while driving down the highway late at night . ZZZZZZZZZ ... ..	-1
This CD title was falsely created on the Amazon system by an unknown , crooked Marketplace Seller . They removed the main Layla album CD from theLayla 20th Anniversary Box Setand created a separate listing for it , with a much higher price than the 3CD box set itself , in an attempt to fool an unsuspecting buyer into wasting a lot of money.DO N'T BE RIPPED OFF , just buy the box !	-1
You want a `` deluxe '' edition ? Go for superior quality and buy the SACD edition . It 's incredible . CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to the song list .	-1
Other than Layla , there is n't much of interest here , just more British white boy blues , I 'd stick to the comps .	-1
Another disappointment . The only good thing on the CD is & quot ; Too Many Walls & quot ; ... besides that , the CD is pretty much not good for much .	-1
Whoa ... .. Hold on , am I the only kid that has this cd ? I only have it cuz it was free , and I collect cds so I though , why not ! This is not that great to me , I prefer female artists like Mandy Moore and Christina Aguleria as opposed to this person . I recomedd it to the older audience , like 25 and older , actually its sorta like Sheryl Crow ? ! ?	-1
A typical example of the quirky electronic music the 80 's seems to have been dominated by ; the difference this time is the talent of lyricist and lead singer Stan Ridgway , whose bizarre little stories almost rise above the drum machines and repetitive electronica . I say almost because Ridgway is much more successful at getting his tales across on his solo works then this more than occasionally discordant CD . There are some good tunes here , particularly the insanely catchy `` Mexican Radio '' ( `` I wish I was in Tijuana , eating barbecued iguana '' That is a great line ! ) and the title track , a fever dream trip to a very wild west . I find Ridgway 's solo material more mature and interesting ; unless you really wanted to hear `` Mexican Radio '' and his early work I would skip this one .	-1
How is it that so many people think this album is great ? I 'm a fan of the Go go 's and I finally got this album . I 've heard some tracks here and there throughout the years . After listening to the complete album , I must say , the only reason I think they actually got their status was due to them being young female rockers with elements of pop . In my opinion , they did n't master their sound until after the broke up . This is evident on 'Return to the Valley of the Go go 's ' . You can hear in the arrangements of the music and vocals that the texture in the playing , along with Belinda 's vocal performance was more refined and listenable.As for Beauty and the Beat , I 'm completely disappointed . Belinda 's singing is awful on some of these tracks , very pitchy and off-key . A lot of the band 's work is also slightly out of tune . Their was n't the best harmony in their debut . Belinda even said it , along with the others , that they were pretty much self-tought , and some of their playing/singing was off . She also stressed that because it was the 'punk days ' they could get away with not knowing how to play , because 'it was punk ' . Well , let me just add to that , she tells no lies . It 's necessarily the songs or lyrics . I think the songs could 've been better if Belinda was more vocally trained , and the band was more in shape . Their most developed sound were the three new songs from 1994 's Valley of the Go go 's , and 'Bless the Go go 's from 2001 . I think if they were in this shape while recording this album , it 'd be so.much better . As for this album , I could do without it . Everytime Belinda trys to hit those high note 's I cringe and squint my eyes . I ca n't be the only one who knows that 'We got thee beat ' is played too high for Belinda 's vocal , you can hear that she sounds forced as if she 's struggling . I 'm pretty sure she was out of breath and winded after that recording session ... I also noticed how some of the songs have a very pop-country sound to them . Belinda sings with a twang as well throughout this album . Fading fast isa great example of this	-1
So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes~ NOFX is a not an awfull album but it is just not very interesting and sounds like any other punk album . Simply chords , lyrics that are laced with curse words and seem to be talking about absolutely nothing in particular and sounds like kids playing around with politics but they have no real idea what they are talking about so the end result is that it just sounds trite and forced . Someone should have taught these guys to write decent lyrics instead of these trite and boring schlock that they produce . Knowing how to sing also helps and being able to play your instrument also helps . This album is so boring..but it is not awfull enough to get one star .	-1

Insane Clown P*ssies ... or Posse , I mean , love to always attack people from the south in their trashy `` music '' . Calling us rednecks , bigots , hillbillies ... and other insults . But yet , they ( ICP , Juggalos and Juggletes ) `` claim '' that they are all about love ? ? ? Give me a f-ing break ! ICP and their little cult of followers , are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites . People from the south are so much more kinder , giving , humble and good hearted , then the people up north ever were . Up north , all there is , is a bunch of cold hearted , self centered , stuck up jerks . Down south they treat you like FAMILY . Big difference . ICP likes to talk alot of crap about the south , but I can PROMISE you , that they would n't run their mouths around a bunch of crazies down south , armed with shotguns . ICP are cowards . Just like all the rest of the cRappers out there !	-1
Weakest of all his works including no limit , maybe 2 or 3 good songs . this was when Snoop sold out Pac ' . Never respected him since then . Sell out .	-1
I cant find one good song on the whole thing , just ignore this record because it 's wack.get me against the world though .	-1
Another over-rated album by 2pac . This album released after his death is Pac 's most modest effort . The stand-out tracks , & quot ; Bomb 1 & quot ; , & quot ; Hail Mary & quot ; , & quot ; Toss It Up & quot ; are his best , but not powerful enough to save the rest of this CD . Supposedly the wrath of his alter-ego Makaveli , this CD covers no new territory , sticking to the same & quot ; been there , done that & quot ; themes on & quot ; All Eyez on Me & quot ; . Only HIS hardcore fans will call this a masterpiece . In my opinon , 2pac had already peaked.Peace El-715	-1
This is dr dre 's worst album ever.It seems it was rushed and made in a day.All the songs are boring and the production sucks.I will try and forget that dre ever made this cd.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
This was not one of 1996 's biggest hitters even with Dr Dre 's name on it . This is an album 's worth of artists on and associated with Dre 's then newly formed Aftermath Records . Although not a terrible effort , it was more of a public setting of a new landmark in Dre 's music career to show people ( perhaps the infamous Death Row Records too ) that it was the case that they needed him more then he needed them as implied on Dre 's own track 'Been There Done That ' . Still , there are some highlights on ' ... The Aftermath ' but very few artists really get to shine . RBX 's 'Blunt Time ' and King T 's 'Str-8 Gone ' are the album 's only worth while listeners apart from Dre 's solo track.Either his heart or his head were not really in this album as the majority of production held by the Doctor is not up to scratch compared with his debut 'The Chronic ' or various other produced tracks on ex-labelmates albums , Snoop Doggy Dogg - ( Gin & Juice ) and Tupac Shakur - ( California Love ) . ' ... The Aftermath ' is more of a declaration of independance rather then a wannabe platinum album as I believe Dre could easily have invested just a little more time into this album by adding a hit track or two , however the album fails to kickstart anywhere from the beginning through to the end . For hardcore fans only .	-1
I bought this a long time ago thinking it was gon na be full of the usual heat Dr. Dre brings . I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album . There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks , one after another . There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value , I still enjoy them to this day . Of course it 's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One , Nas , King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.KEEPERS : East Coast/West Coast KillasBeen There , Done ThatStr8 GoneThrow the rest in the garbage and press delete .	-1
Dre means well with introducing new artists to the populace , but these ones try to hit it hard and not to present the wow to us ... Dre does well with his songs .	-1
I 'm glad I did n't bougth this new , I bougth it used , and gave it away a couple of days later . Simply because the album hardly got any good songs , the only ones worth mention is the intro , eastcoast/westcoast killaz , been there done that and the mel-man track called shi -- -n on the world . And for does songs I would n't pay this much . Skip it , unless you 're a TRUE Dr. Dre fan that buys everything he touches . I recommend either & quot ; The Chronic & quot ; or & quot ; 2001 & quot ; if you want Dre at his best .	-1
The year was 1996 . Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records . Dre had started his own label , Aftermath , and was ready to sit back , renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in . While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop 's Doggfather album , Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation , and we did n't hear from him again for three years . The reason ? The album more or less ... and Dre 's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.It 's a shame , too , because the one Dre track on the album , `` Been There , Done That , '' is really good . The production is smooth and silky , with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line , and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions . ( `` I 've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It 's worth eight , but I only paid 5.3 . '' ) An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof , but alas , he had n't the creative energy for it.The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs . KRS-One , Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with `` East Coast / West Coast Killas , '' a Dre-produced track that picks up where `` Natural Born Killas '' left off . The vocal trade-offs are seamless , the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad @ ss as ever.Mel-Man , who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001 , gets his solo track in `` Sh**tin ' on the World , '' which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor , intentional and otherwise . ( Mel 's liner notes read , `` I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin ' the projects to the fullest ! `` ) The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy , sultry groove `` Got Me Open '' with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era 's `` No Diggity . '' And RC ( the only artist on the album with two songs ) turns in a decent , funky remake of David Bowie 's `` Fame . `` Otherwise , the album is indistinct , passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da , Floyd Howard , Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher . There 's a reason acts like Miscellaneous , King T , Nowl and Sharief never took off . As an intro record-label sampler , you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half- @ ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under . Either way , it was a mistake .	-1
I bought this album simply because I owned The Chronic and 2001 and I loved them both ... But this.. Well , this ca n't be considered a Dr. Dre CD.First of all , just one of the sixteen songs in this CD is Dre 's . So Dre is presenting something ( his label ) , but it does n't mean he 's presenting himself , if you know what I mean.This album has a lot of gangsta raps like Been There Done That ( by Dr , Dre ) , but also & quot ; soul & quot ; raps ( calm raps ) like Choices ( by Kim Summerson ) .But what you must really be asking yourself is : is this CD worth my money ? The answer is no , unless you 're a total hardcore Dre fan and you want to own every CD with his name on it . Well , because , in my opinion , he 's just a mere guest in this CD.So if you 're looking for a good Dr. Dre CD , look elsewhere for The Chronic or 2001 . If you 're looking for quality rap , look elsewhere too .	-1
The Lady of Rage was a vital component of the Chronic and Doggystyle albums . Dre knows how to bring different rappers together to produce a perfect blend of voices . The production on this album is good by the likes of DJ Premier and Daz Dillinger , but The Lady of Rage just does n't have the talent to pull off a solo album with so few guest appearances . Only a few rappers are capable of that . The Notorious BIG ... I ca n't think of another . Even Snoop Doggy Dogg has always relied heavily on having a large crew of rappers to back him up , and he was the front man of those two albums , not just a supporting rapper like rage was . I 'm surprised Rage has made a second album . I wo n't be buying it . I bought this because I was in need of another Chronic/Doggystyle fix but this is n't it . I believe that music can be judged by how often you want to listen to it . I never feel like listening to this .	-1
You ever have those friends that all start going on and on about this great band they have started listening to , and how cool the bass player is 'cause he plays bass so loudly due to his mommy and daddy not buying him an amp ? ... and then praise him like it makes him something special ? Trust me , it does not make him one of the greatest bass players of all time , he may be better then the alternative rejects who thought 6 string guitar was so hard they switched to bass 'cause it 's easier , those kind of talentless so called musicians that followed the trend of , learn 3 chords , and violate them.On this particular album here , the track those friends at the time flocked around was Load Up The Cannonballs and Shake Hands With Beef.I think my initial reaction was to just stop in my tracks and blink a few times wondering how the heck you come up with a title like that ? By the time it was over , and those friends at the time had over played it , I personally rate that song up there with whoever wrote `` Push The Little Daisies To Make Them Come Up '' as part of the top 10 worst songs of all time . Then the top 5 of the worlds most annoying songs . And top 3 of the worlds most overrated as something special as judged by people who are not musicians and can see it for what it really is list.The rest of the album was a snore fest too , no memorable tracks what so ever , except for the one i mentioned cause it 's the worst thing this band has ever put together .	-1
Well , I have to admit I had to buy it after hearing & quot ; Walking In the Sun & quot ; and & quot ; The Fonz & quot ; , which still are accessible after a while even though I hate the rest of the album , really . Anyway , I did have som high expectations about this one . so , there are those two tracks , which are nice , then there are four songs , which sound good for the 3-5 first times , but which slowly start to irritate ( Let 's rock , Why Ca n't ... , padrino , Flo ) . Then there are a couple of songs which are prettty neutral , but lame . And then there are the ones that have irritated me since the first listen ; for example , & quot ; Disconnect The Dots & quot ; is disgusting teen punk . Yuch ! . Well , anyway , to sum it all up , I 'd have to say , that ska may attract you at first , but in the long run it 's simply one of the most efficient vomiting tools . This album is just another commercially ambitious record with few catchy tunes , but not a bit of durability . And it sure ai n't real ska , is it ?	-1
This cd is by far the worst CD I have ever heard . Not one song beside the hit single & quot ; Walkin On The Sun & quot ; ie bearable . I hope and pray Smash Mouth disapear from music before they can flood the market with any more trash . In a few years I expect to find this cd overflowing in used bins in cd stores everywhere . I urge everyone to go buy a sandwhich instead and leave this cd right where it is .	-1
Absolute [ junk ] . This could have been a good album if more songs like Walkin ' on the Sun were on it . Some of the intros are great until the actual songs start like Padrino for example and then they unleash a barrel of noisy , monotonous [ junk ] that 's supposed to be music but bears little resemblance . Do n't waste your money on this one !	-1
I thought this was supposed to be software that had cheese recipes in it . Instead I get a lot of Bass and some guy talking through his nose . I finally was able to make some but it did not taste that good so I am going to return this because it no workie workie .	-1
Primus sucks ! I 'm serious . They do . Do they even have a bassist ? Oh , yeah , they do . Les Claypool or some redneck name like that . It 's so hard to hear him ! All you can hear is extremely simple basslines . Do yourself a favour and check out `` St. Anger '' if you want some killer bass .	-1
This was a huge let down out of the 13 songs 2 are good . And the songs that are good really arint that good in the first place ! 'Here Comes The Bastards ' and 'Jerry Was A Race Car Driver ' are the only good songs . This is a really really really bad record , Les Claypool should be banned from ever singing . The guitar work isnt bad , and thr Drumming is all right . The only really good thing about this bad is Les Claypools bass playing I mean I can name maybe two or three better bass players and that is it ! But no matter how good he plays the bass it would never make up for how bad this record is ! ! ! Dont Waste your money , I mean you would have really really high to get into this , and you still wouldnt think it was good you would think it was funny .	-1
Nothing GoodOwning this cd is bad for youDumb songwritingOfficially the worst cd everUnofficially bad tooBoring , Juvenile lyricsTragic Kingdom is 1000 times betterMy sister loves this garbage , a self proclaimed number one fan , but what does she know .	-1
`` What 's Up '' , the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune ( which , I always thought , would have been the perfect song for Heart ) , is the only thing good here . The rest of this album is a mess . Linda Perry has , of course , gone on to better things .	-1
This album is a little too sluggish at times . While I like What 's Up , the rest of the album struggles to find an identity . Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992 . But the strong standout is Linda Perry 's strong vocals . She sounds like she 's not having it ! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut . But the music does n't really match up . Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera , Pink , Gwen Stefani , Kelly Osbourne and countless others . Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy ! She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band , and I 'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music . Do n't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show ( which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days ) about this band -- she 's too busy making hits for the masses and I 'd rather hear her do that now !	-1
This is the worst Primus album , easily . Herb left the band right after the completion of this atrocity which says a lot about the state of the band . Tales is completely inaccessible ( which is good in a way ) but only because the music is incomprehensible . Claypool still manages to cram a nice amount of sick bass riffs in here , but the playing is uneven . Some of the tracks meander on for upwards of seven minutes and the lyrics are trademark ridiculous as always . Ler 's guitar playing is scattered but brilliant in spots . This is definitely the low point of the Primus catalog . Thank God for Antipop , this is for hardcore Primus completists only .	-1
After reading the reviews , I expected a disk full of creative efforts like Tainted Love . What I got was uninspired , drab drum-machining silly synthesized song after song ... except for Tainted Love and their remixes . Yes , this is a great song , but you might as well get the single because there is n't another song on this CD that 's close to it in quality .	-1
The stupid album title is an indicator of greater lameness to come . This album made me want to vomit . Actually , I 'm ashamed to admit I ever owned it , even if only on vinyl .	-1
ok this CD is mostly junk . [ i think ] It has many weird and unusual songs . I like about two songs on here . & quot ; Brass Monkey & quot ; and & quot ; Fight for your right to party. & quot ; Thats it . All of their other songs are so ... . different . My oponion on this album is & quot ; Do n't buy it. & quot ; I am personally saying that because I am a BIG rock fan and a big fan of some rap . [ like outkast ] If you 're into the Beastie Boys A LOT then go and buy this album . But i 'm warning you , this is definately not like their newer stuff like & quot ; hello nastie. & quot ; I personally think that the anthology is A LOT better than this album . If anybody wants this album and you 're a rock fan , DO N'T BUY IT !	-1
This album was supposed to be called `` Do n't be a Faggot '' originally . Does this say something about the mentality of the Beastie Boys at the time ? Not that we should blame them . They 've apologized , and they 've gone on to create way more positive music and contributed to causes that more than makes up for this one album they made as young guys in the 80's.The question is this ; Why should we keep listening to a piece of music that is dated and offers no redeeming value whatsoever ? Why does this album continue to be a staple of parties and the soundtrack for every jock and frat boy in middle America ? I 'm not uptight and I 'm not a prude , but somewhere we have to take responsibility and stop filling our heads with ideas that oppress others.The one good thing about this album is that it brought rap to new popularity , and songs like Slow and Low or No Sleep Till Brooklyn certainly do bring back an era of 808 drum machines and goofy guitar samples . But honestly , the Beastie Boys created much better music than this after the fact . Paul 's Boutique was more artistic , even though it still retained some of the sexism . Check Your Head and Ill Communication were masterful blendings of urban style , culminating in a sound that can not be duplicated and will never be topped . Hello Nasty is a brilliant piece of pure hip hop , which totally destroys everything on this album.Check Your Head . Enjoy the music , but think about what you 're listening to .	-1
Back in the day , no one took the Beastie 's seriously ; they were portrayed as brainless frat boys who wished they had been born black . Nowadays people regard them as genius innovators . Frankly I 'm inclined to agree with the original assessment	-1
T.H.U.G.S . is an okay album but it just does n't have anything that can give it that extra push . NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
Profound.Not.Foxy is rakin ' in money from suckers . Her pimp is a CPA.OK the dumbos who like to look at her booty and boobies can now press the `` not helpful '' button , and the smart people can , at least , consider what I 've written . Not too many smart people here .	-1
This debut album from Foxy Brown was weak . First of all , she made the HUGE mistake of making a song with Jay-Z ... he 'll just ruin any cut from the start , no matter how fresh the beat is . Lyrically , Foxy Brown is an airhead and she ca n't rip anything but her clothes off . I ca n't stand when people say that she 's the best female rapper ever ( especially Lil Kim - eek ! ) ... that is a statement which is TOO BOLD to make . None of the tracks on here are any good and the topics of money , sex with numerous men , and jewelry is already played out by No Limit 's Master P. Bottom Line : you wan na hear real female rappers , then check out old school tracks from Roxanne Shante , Queen Latifah , and MC Lyte , or Bahamadia and Lauren Hill .	-1
This album is straight trash ! Period . This a horrible album by an extremely average rapper . Yes I said it . I mean I just do n't get it . Will somebody please fill me in on what is so great about Jay-Z . I will say this , `` Reasonable Doubt '' was his best album and even that was n't a classic , but it did come close . Blueprint was a solid album worthy of about 4 stars . `` The Black Album '' was a descent album worthy of about 3.5 to 4 stars . All his other albums are grade A trash . Just to think this guy is considered to a great . Do n't make me laugh . This guy talks about the same thing over and over and over . It makes my head hurt . His subject matters are so tiring , not to mention his flow is terrible . If you want some real emcees check out this people : 2Pac , Nas , Common , Mos Def , Talib Kweli , Eminem , Big L , Outkast , and Jadakiss just to name a few .	-1
This is the only Jay-Z album that I do n't like . Jigga sounded like he was riding on the Puffy sound too much . And it 's obvious with the ones that Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy producers produced for this album . They sound like rejects from Puffy 's own No Way Out album . The one that he did with Babyface is not that good . The album 's songs do n't fit with Jay-Z 's rap style one bit and the album sounds so very uneven . The '98 album he did after this one was really his best to me . This second album is really his worst , full of lame songs !	-1
Reasonable Doubt was probably the best CD Jay-Z ever put out so we all expected In My Lifetime to be just as good or better right ? ? WRONG . With 1 less track then Reasonble Doubt ( not that it matters ) this CD just does n't sound good coming out of an extremly talented rapper , even the beats are n't really that good . If you want to hear this CD do n't buy , download it or just download & quot ; A Million and One Questions ( the intro ) , city is mine , and where i 'm from and those are the best songs on the CD , if there is any . I think if Jay stuck with the same formula he used in reasonable doubt in all of his CDs we would n't be hearing junk like Blueprint 2 or In my lifetime .	-1
This cd issssssssss nothinggggg there are only 2 good songs that i like on this album maby the ppl over at weast side love this kind of music but east coast isint down with this g funk garbage warren g isint all that with his lyrics this cd isint worth buying trust me .	-1
I 'm surprised that Warren G survived THIS era ! The lyrics on the album are bland and you would think that it was just another copycat album of `` G-Funk Era '' if you did n't know it was Warren G rapping on it ! I gave it a 2 because 1 ) he 's Warren G and does derserve some credit for trying to punch back and 2 ) because of couple of the songs were very decent , but most of the album was pitiful.The tracks that made the album worth listening to were `` Annie Mae '' , `` Smokin ' Me Out '' , and `` Relax Yo ' Mind ''	-1
This is the beginning of Warren G 's slump of sub par albums . The highlights on this album are few and far between , with one hot track , `` I Shot the Sherriff '' . Unless you absolutely need to hear more Warren G , I would steer clear of this . Warren 's lyrics are pretty bland and meaningless , which was ok on Regulate ... The G Funk Era because they were accompanied by tight beats , but here the beats do n't make up for the poor lyrics . Warren 's worst album .	-1
In September 2007 , a Japanese mini-sleeve version of this title was released , along with a re-issue of all the other S & G ; 'sleeve catalog titles.The Japan 'sleeve version of this title is remastered , whereas this CD is a 40-year-old LP-EQ 'd master , and sounds terrible.If you are looking to sonically match the `` The Graduate '' with the 2001 S & G ; remastered studio albums , the Japan 'sleeve edition is the only remastered version available.Link to the 2007 Japan mini-sleeve remastered version ofThe Graduate .	-1
Simon And Garfunkel were an unrivaled pair . Their divine vocal harmonies and brilliant songwriting have never been surpassed . This , their debut , is the only weak album they ever made.There are only three good songs on here : & quot ; You Can Tell The World & quot ; ( I usually do n't care for country music but this is an awesome song ) , & quot ; Sparrow & quot ; ( the song that introduces their aforementioned divine vocal harmonies ) and the original acoustic version of & quot ; The Sound Of Silence & quot ; . The rest of the album is rather boring.Thankfully , though , all their other albums would prove to be sheer masterpieces .	-1
Simon & Garfunkel would set both the folk and pop/rock worlds on their ear . This album , although pleasant in parts , is an inasupicious introduction and only mildly hints at what was to come.Paul & Art were both college students , after scoring a minor hit as Tom & Jerry in 1957 . Paul was ocasionally selling songs for the Brill Building as well as his own , taking legthy sabatacals to England to play and write . They reformed later and were signed to Columbia to cash in on the burgeoning folk movement spearheaded by Dylan.Although Simon was already writing , this album is mostly cover songs ; some standard folk tunes ( `` Peggy-O '' , `` Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream '' ) , some spiritual tunes ( `` You Can Tell the World '' , `` Go Tell It On the Mountain '' ... kinda odd from a couple of Jewish guys ) , the then obligatory Dylan cover , and a madrigal ( `` Benidictus '' ... Simon 's British influence here ) . Simon 's songs were represented , but certainly not his best work . `` He Was My Brother '' is a bit heavy handed , and the title track is , well ... filler . However , the future was hinted at with the beautiful `` Bleeker Street '' and the original version of `` The Sounds of Silence '' .The performances are quite good , with just their voices and their pristine vocals carrying the tracks , although in some cases the performances were a bit too eager and heavy handed . Although the exquisite harmonies are here , Simon 's guitar playing is almost too straightforward . Simon would later become a much better ( and highly underrated ) guitarist.The album holds its place in time well ... much like what you would hear in a Grenwich Village folk club in the early 60 's . For that alone , it 's worth purchasing to any serious folk music student . However , 40 years on , it has that `` you had to be there '' feel to it . Not a bad album by any means , but certainly not the first to purchase by them .	-1
I did not choose this . I already have paid you for it on Amazon Cloud and I am sorry about that . Take it off !	-1
First , before you decide to send a few guys in dark shades to break my arms , let me say that I am a huge fan of Donovan , and my other reviews of his work will attest to that . But I do consider Barabajagal to be his absolute worst album . The few flashes of quality can not obscure an overall patina of mediocrity . Supposedly , this was Donovan 's attempt at a heavier rock sound , but for the most part it is really simplistic and often cloying pop of the worst kind . Basic structures imitate country or ragtime , the lyrics seldom take poetic flight or deliver the kind of imagery that is associated with Donovan , and several ideas are borrowed and rehashed from his already-existing catalogue . On too many songs ( when including the bonus tracks ) he seems to take a stance of an old and wise man , although at twenty-two he hardly qualified , and speaks of `` chicks '' in a language that would be considered incorrect today and was certainly demeaning even then ( e.g. , we are told very sarcastically that Pamela Jo 's `` very secret '' job consists of filing papers all day ) .Couched in its time , Barabajagal was an anachronism : masterpieces such as Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club , Pet Sounds , and Beggar 's Banquet -- to name just a few -- had already been released , and Tommy and Crosby , Stills and Nash were just a few months away . The revolutionary ideas pursued in those albums make Barabajagal sound truly amateurish . Its massive success is attributed to the fact that , by then , a large section of Donovan 's constituency had shifted from a mix of folkies , jazzers , and psychedelics to teenyboppers , which explains why this baby food was supposed to be a `` rock '' sound . Interestingly , for many people Donovan 's best work ends here ; personally , I loved much of his output that was yet to come , and Open Road was decidedly a much truer , and infinitely better , rocker.Much has been made of Jeff Beck 's presence on some of the numbers , but do n't expect to hear anything outstanding by almighty Jeff , in fact , do n't expect to hear anything -- anyone with access to an amplifier could have played this , and except for a few pleasant licks on Trudi , there is not a hint that a major guitarist is in the studio.On to specific tracks : I 'd say that the bottom of the barrel is composed of I Love My Shirt , which is an embarrassment : so cutesy it 'll make your teeth rot , it 's a quaint idea if you were to sing it to your kid , but not for a major artist to put on an album , especially when he has already written songs supposedly for children that were some of the finest songs ever written for any age ; follows the meaningless The Love Song , with lyrics that are one clich & eacute ; after another , and the melody that sounds like a commercial for a toy ; Trudi deserves an extra helping of rotten tomatoes for being not only a boring song but also a dreadful rewrite of the beautiful Lay of the Last Tinker from A Gift from a Flower to a Garden . The above-mentioned Pamela Jo joins this group of downright awfulness.On the middle tier , where things are n't awful , just are n't very good , there is Where Is She . Like several other songs here , it follows a well-tried recipe from Donovan 's cookbook , yet somehow it just does n't make it . It should be gorgeous , in the cloud of ethereal harmonies that are Donovan 's special talent , but instead comes off as a completely characterless ballad for lite radio . Then we have Superlungs My Supergirl : this is its third incarnation . It was always an interesting song , not for its supersimple two-chord structure but for its sound experimentation , and here , with that contrived push for heavy rockin ' , it becomes my least favorite version , and those continuous two chords are way too little . Don sounds like he wants to be T Rex.To Susan on the West Coast Waiting has always been taken with gloves because of its `` important '' subject , namely Vietnam war protest . The supporters of the song have claimed that its subdued and gently lilting way of tackling such a serious matter was subtle , but I do n't detect anything profoundly subtle here , just a mellow flower-power attempt of dealing with something pop stars ( and most people , actually ) hardly understood at the time . The phrase about Andy , who is in Vietnam `` supposedly hating , '' avers that , according to Donovan , the young men who went to war did n't really want to go and did n't hate anyone . Obviously , this is always true for many , but not for everyone involved , and it does n't speak to the psychological shape in which those young men returned home . The song reduces the most conflicting and complex event of our history to very little.That leaves us with Barabajagal , Happiness Runs , and Atlantis . I wish I could say that in this top tier everything is fabulous , but really , while the songs are good , only Atlantis has the potential to send chills up my spine . Happiness Runs was for years a terrific stage shtick for Donovan , who 'd get people to sing the chorus in three parts ( heard on Donovan in Concert ) , but here it does n't have quite the same sense of fun to it . Still , it 's a lovely song.The bonus tracks are a mirror image of the original album songs in that there is a lot of meandering and a few excellent numbers . The bonuses are plentiful , and without them , as the title of my review says , the album would have gotten only one star . The Swan is that gorgeous , ethereal song that Where Is She aspired to be ; it is one of my all-time Donovan favorites , and if it were n't available on other compilations , it alone would make the purchase of this album worth the money . Little White Flower stands out as well ; it would have fit perfectly on Flower to a Garden or HMS Donovan , and speaking of the latter , the demo of Good Morning Mr Wind appears there in its final , polished version . It is unabashedly a nursery rhyme , and as such , excellent . Two songs are very interesting for those who have continued to follow Donovan 's career : A Poor Man 's Sunshine and Lord of the Universe appear on his latest official release , Beat Caf & eacute ; , and are astonishingly unchanged . I like both a lot . You get all this in stereo , so , if you can find it at a discount , enjoy . If not , for unconditional fans and archivists only .	-1
1 great tune ( Atlantis ) , a couple of good tunes and the rest is pretty bad . Get it if you are a completist , otherwise skip this one .	-1
-I do n't know . I love GG , and many of their albums are perfect.But this one , I ca n't wrap my head around it.It 's too simple , and a big step down from AQUIRING THE TASTE.Alot of people love it , so maybe it 's me.But , IMHO there 's only one good song here . Not enough to make me spend my hard-earned money.-	-1
This one could be a better cd , if the production was better . Has some really good songs . Music Man , Golden Country , Let Me Ride , Like You Do , and So the Story Goes . Kevin 's first cd as singer , something the group was in great need of , after their first outing . Rest of the songs are okay , and the cd would get a better scoure , if the production was better , sounds distant and muffled .	-1
Kevin and Gary have written a good cd , a shame Kevin left the group , and Mike came in and rerecorded the vocals . Ridin the Storm kicks butt . But rest of the cd suffers without Kevin . Mike 's vocals give the group too much of a country feel , and it would be even more so on the next two cds with him . Still there are some good songs in here , SOn of a Poor Man , Start A New Life , It 's Everwhere , and Without Expression . If you do n't go into this expecting your classic REO , you may just like this .	-1
You ca n't tell a book by it 's cover and you ca n't tell an album by it 's sleeve . See that guy with the cool red strat looking all rock and roller ? That 's not representative of what is on the inside . `` Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo '' is a classic , smoking , hard rock song . If you love that song , the rest of this album does not have that same type of sound . This was an attempt at connecting with a too wide of an audience by throwing everything out there to see what sticks . `` Hoochie Koo '' is great , `` Uncomplicated '' is passable and the rest of album is terrible.In defense of Rick Derringer , I believe that this was his first solo work coming off of the McCoys and acting as a sideman where he was trying to find himself . Rick Derringer operates best as a guitar shredding , hard rocker and not playing crappy , pop-slop.This is one of the few artists that when he formed his self- indulgent `` Derringer '' , playing extended versions of his best songs , with endless guitar solos , ... that forum served his talent the best.I feel is `` King Biscuit Flower Hour live cd '' is his best work	-1
Do not be fooled by either the release date of this album ( Feb. 2008 ) or the blurb about it being a limited edition 2007 Japanese pressing . What you will get is a standard CD with the same artwork and packaging that it has always had . The mastering sounds pre-1990 , claustrophobic and inauthentic . Yes , the price ca n't be beat and for some people that 's enough . But this album deserves to be heard with modern mastering . Anyone who cares about good sound , save your money , listen to your vinyl . Sony will probably remaster this shortly .	-1
Billy himself admitted this album , released less than a year after Piano Man , was probably put out too soon . He did n't have enough to say . And it shows . Two of these songs are instrumentals that could be seen as filler ... ..but I like both The Mexican Connection and Root Beer Rag which both show off his piano talents . In fact , if he is n't going to record actual pop songs with lyrics anymore , then I would like to see him create these kinds of pieces instead of the classical stuff he claims that he 's been writing all these years since The River of Dreams album . But a few of these songs are pretty banal pop songs , ( The Last Of The Big Time Spenders , Great Suburban Showdown , Roberta ) . The weak production of these songs and the use of session musicians also does n't help much . Of the songs I do like here , both Los Angelenos and the title cut are performed much more effectively on the Songs In The Attic live set from 1981 where Billy had his core road band backing him . A lot more power in the performances on that album . With a little more time to flesh out this album and write/ record a couple more songs to go along with the few that are good here and add Phil Ramone and what became Billy 's road and recording band and this album would have been a lot better .	-1
I dont care if someone think I am ignorant or anything but I never felt this was a great Dylan album . Many call this his best but I beg to differ . Definitly NOT his best ... but not his worst either . Average album with 3 great songs ... the rest are ok..not great .	-1
All of Bob Dylans music just blows and it sounds worse nowyour voice is boring and your voice is ignoring .	-1
Call me crazy , but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance ? Not since Creed 's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters . This one from Bob Dylan does n't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves . Some of Dylan 's acoustic work is good , and I give him props for his work at the controls , but where is the heart , where is the soul ? Where is the topnotch singing ? This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.Now , if you 're looking for good rock , check out Bush 'n ' Creed . Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek . Speaking of geeks , does anyone know when Coldplay 's fourth album will hit stores ? KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ... AND KEEP CHECKIN ' MY SITE ! ! LATER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I am trying to appreciate the creativity and imagery of Bob Dylan . Whereas I do admire the atmospherics on such cuts as Your A Big Girl Now and Tangled Up In Blue , too many of these songs are excessively long winded . Heck that Jack of Hearts number must have twelve or thirteen verses all at the same pace with absolutely no change in instrumental definition . This is oh so grating.Also annoying is Bob Dylan 's voice on several songs . Some people may find Idiot Wind to be an emotional performance . And the lyrics are indeed quite good in that vein . However , Dylan is so off key in many instances that it is a really pain to listen to especially over the course of seven and a half minutes.In general many of these songs are overlong and way too repetitive . Way too many verses which just do n't do anything special for me most of the time . I know Dylan 's aim was to return to his acoustic roots . However , the lack of an electric presence on more than the bluesy Meet Me In The Morning just hold this CD back.Tangled Up In Blue is a pretty cool song , Meet In The Morning has some nice guitar , and some of the other tunes have good atmospherics . However , I prefer other recordings by Mr. Zimmerman such as Blond On Blonde , Nashville Skyline , and The Basement Tapes ... .	-1
Fair album . About as good as Highway 61 Revisited.What annoys about his writing is the way he tosses in mindless lyrics that have nothing to do withANYTHING ... but the guy does it because he needs a rhymer . Way to go , Bob . You 've gotten away with it for decades -- and those who worship the ground you walk on do n't know any better.To be honest , I have liked some of this man 's work : Knockin ' On Heaven 's door is a clasic ; have liked TIME OUT OF MIND , have liked THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN ; think his CHRONICLES is a fine autobiography ... I just do n't happen to think every time the man sneezes that it should be hailed as a work of genius and/or a masterpiece.My 2 cents .	-1
There are many times when this album makes me feel a little guilty . It 's indescribable , especially if you like to think in terms of , let 's say , what 's Dylan 's best album . Then I think Blood On The Tracks and I have to shake myself to say that this is not the best Dylan album . It 's too mature , the sound is too individual , there 's just something about it ... Mainly a romantic work , Dylan has , by this stage , strayed from protest and ventured into acceptance . By the sound on Blood On The Tracks , Dylan seemed to be conscious of what he had become ( how strange was it when I saw him presenting something on the Grammies last year ? Answer : very strange ) .All ten songs are brilliant , but here are the ones I 've picked out . You 're A Big Girl Now has that deep nasal quality to it , seeming to be filled with regret , 'I know where I can find you , in somebody 's room , it 's a price I 'll have to pay you 're a big girl all the way ' . Idiot Wind starts with Dylan and the media , 'someone 's got it in for me , they 're planting stories in the press ' . Then it goes into an explanation of how this 'idiot wind ' had ruined the relationship with his wife , 'it was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart , you tamed the lion in my cage but it just was n't enough to change my heart ' and , finally 'idiot wind , blowing through the dust upon our shelves , we are idiots babe it 's a wonder we can even feed ourselves ' . Dylan 's passionate voice and heartbreaking lyrics make Idiot Wind one of the most individual of songs you 're likely to hear . Buckets Of Rain is so simple , leaving a haunting feeling about the whole album , 'I like the smile on your fingertips , I like the way that you move your hips , I like the cool way you look at me , everything about you is bringing me misery'.Blood On The Tracks is so close to reality yet so far away . It 's so much more polished in sound , and yet so much more personal . Works in opposites .	-1
I was really disappointed when I got this CD and it did n't work . Can I get a refund ? It acts as if there is no information on it .	-1
All of Fogelberg 's Albums are very inconsistent and uneven but most contain at least a couple of good songs . This one is probably his worst and does not even have one memorable song or melody ( OK - I guess Comes and Goes is the best song here and is pretty good ) . Amazing really how bad this is overall -- Avoid ! !	-1
Boz Scaggs , who had been in the music business for a long time and even made a record with Duane Allman in the 1960s , had recorded some fairly unsuccessful solo albums during the early part of the 1970s before `` Silk Degrees '' make him into a pop superstar.Today , there is relatively little criticism of middle-of-the-road music from the 1970s vis- & agrave ; -vis what came out of the 1980s , presumably because the production is not generally so dated or because it is seen as having fewer associations with `` rock '' . Boz Scaggs , however , must be said to be as bad as any of the modern MOR stars who became critical targets when commercial radio tightened its playlists during and after the `` punk revolution '' . In fact , it can be as difficult to listen to most of the material from `` Silk Degrees '' as it is to any material on the blandest 1980s pop albums which I grew up with in the ultraconservative suburbs of Melbourne . This is seen at its worst on `` Lowdown '' , where the chorus is as flyweight asMichael Bolton 's `` Said I Loved You But I Lied '' even if a little faster . More than that , the ultra-catchy choruses of all the slower songs on `` Silk Degrees '' stick with a listener in the worst kind of way - especially I will say for a person like myself who tends to have very unhealthy obsessions . `` We 're All Alone '' reminds me , as my review title suggests , of songs by Mariah Carey that I used to listen to as a child.The faster songs on `` Silk Degrees '' , like `` Jump Street '' , hold up a little bit less badly because there is genuine drive in them , but still one sees all the worst traits of commercial music of the 1980s . `` It 's Over '' , the other fast piece , is much less memorable and shows the effects of the soft production much worse.All in all , this is an unmemorable pop album that at times sounds like it was made in a time-warp , clearly predating the worst aspects of commercial music of the 1980s . Indeed , `` Silk Degrees '' could be seen as a perfect model for commercial radio stations forced to tighten their playlists during this period .	-1
I do n't know what the guy in the product description is talking about but clearly he know 's little about music ! This album albeit borrows heavily from the ideas of Led Zeppelin ( hey , so did myriads of other musicians ) is a brave second effort from Heart and I think is their best album . `` Barracuda '' is a classic rock standard while the other tracks are also very good and it 's hard to find a weak track here . The album flows like a good album should and the end product is clearly greater than the sum of the individual tracks which is rare indeed . It also sticks to a theme and pulls it off very well ( Gypsy-style , exotic music ) . The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the sound quality is not good and this clearly needs a major remastering job . I recommend not getting this version but by all means get the remastered one which would get 5 stars from me .	-1
This is the perfect example of a mediocre album . I bought this record ( not cd ) many years ago used when I was in high school . I liked the album oriented tracks , Love Alive , Barracuda , Little Queen , and Kick It Out as the guitar licks and arrangements are quite ear catching to this day . Other than these & quot ; lead tracks & quot ; , there is n't much else . Say Hello and Treat Me Well have interesting riffs but are not as complete as the aforementioned & quot ; lead tracks & quot ; . And the rest of the music sounds like they were trying to record enough music to fill the length of the record . Go On Cry merely consists of Anne Wilson yelling these words throughout a meandering riff . A bargain bid purchase is all this disc is really worth .	-1
the Jacksons did n't keep the flame going from their first album.this one has a couple of Good Songs Like Man Of War , Find Me a Girl & amp ; Different Kind Of Lady.but the Song-writting is hurting here.The Vocals are tight and the Philly Groove is there but this Album is Lacking a strong Overall concept .	-1
I must go against the grain of the other reviews posted here and say for the record that & quot ; All'n'All & quot ; is far from EW & amp ; F 's best work . Although it boasts some amazing cover art and the group 's musicianship is as proficient as ever , the overall sound is overrefined , slick , and heavily disco-oriented . The album starts out OK with & quot ; Serpentine Fire & quot ; and then quickly hits rock bottom with & quot ; Fantasy & quot ; , a perfect example of the kind of super-cheeze ballad that permeated the late 70s . The rest of the album follows the same pattern , with overworn grooves , cliched lyrics and excruciatingly overblown string arrangements designed for all the hip disco clubs of the time . Only the instrumental & quot ; Magic Mind & quot ; reminds one of the group 's previous experimentalism , and is the one highlight of the record besides & quot ; Serpentine Fire & quot ; . Do n't get me wrong -- I have nothing against commercialism per se , as I love both & quot ; Open Our Eyes & quot ; and & quot ; That 's The Way Of The World & quot ; . But the songs here follow a very rigid , overly produced formula that bleeds all of the heart and soul out of them , so that all that is left is the cheeze .	-1
Jeff Wayne 's War Of The Worlds is one of those albums whose legend far surpasses it 's content . This album is well known and well recieved within prog rock circles , but not well known outside of them . I remember being very taken by it upon first listen as a young man ( the artwork accompanying the album is priceless ) . It was quite the novelty hearing a rock opera with Sir Richard Burton narrating . But beyond the novelty , there is n't much substance.In 1978 this album had what seemed to be a stellar cast . But in hind-sight , most of these performers had passed through the apex of their popularity and rellevance . Most all the muscial performers had spoken dialog as well as singing parts , except Heyward , who does most of the vocals . And of course there is Richard Burton , whose classically trained , stacatto voice is perfect for this style of recording . His performance carries the show , which does n't say much for a rock album . Most of the dialog using Lynott , Essex and Covington ranges from banal to over-rought ( Lynott 's 'parson ' is played way over the top and is somewhat embarrising given how big a Thin Lizzy fan I am ) .That is not to say that there is n't some fine moments here and there . Heyward 's Forever Autumn and Thunder Child are the only two songs that really stand out musically speaking . Forever Autumn is a wistful lament expressing seperation and loss , and while not directly related to the story , it does serve the plot well . Thunder Child is a minor masterpiece , melding story line lyrics and Burton 's impecible narration with pop/rock hooks . If most of the album resembled this work , it might actually be the classic everyone thinks it is . But the people behind the console have to take a hit here as well . A superb , etherial instrumental like The Red Weed is marred by narration instead of being a stand alone song , save for the lead-in by Burton . The mixing job as a whole is somewhat clumsy . The goofy dialog ( along with the disco trappings ) should have been scrapped and more attention paid to the quality of the music.Jeff Wayne may have had the vision and the ambition , but lacked the chops and flair of a Rick Wakeman , nor did he have the composition skills of an Alan Parsons . And I 'm afraid that time has n't been kind to this release . Instead of being a period piece as it was intended to , it 's sound is inexorably linked to the year in which it was recorded . Maybe an updated version of this story is in order- ( ( hello Rick Wakeman ... ) ) It was a good idea that never was realized to it 's best potential .	-1
I kind of liked some of the songs these guys had on the radio . The one about Africa and Roseanna were cool songs , so I gave this a listen . I did n't realize that these guys were quite so disco/tech oriented . I felt like I was listening to some kind of goofy version of a black jazz disco group or something . The song Georgy Porgy was so grating that I wished I could take a ballbat to the broad singing backup . Man , this is a painful listen unless you are a fan and have some connection to this stuff from the past . I did n't have the cushion of old memories with this outdated music so I had to take it full bore in the year 2008 . I apologize to the people that love these guys , but I did n't know what I was getting into . Warning - Syn-tech-disco to the max with irritating vocals strained through a funnel .	-1
Some of the instrumental pieces on this album would sound natural floating through the speakers of a hotel lift . They are rather pretentiously titled , and not much more than pleasant tunes . Tim Weisberg 's flute only adds to that impression . But if you 're a fan of the flute , you may disagree . To me , it gives this a very ` seventies ' feel . Quite fun though , if you 're in the mood . Dan does put vocals on a few tracks , most notably the rather overdone and fairly unoriginal ` Power of Gold ' . Best stuff on the album is when Dan covers songs from the sixties and does a nice job . This album is the more appealing twin of the more recent ` No Resemblance Whatsoever ' .	-1
Were David Gilmour not a member of Pink Floyd , there 's no way this album would still be in print after 22 years . Gilmour 's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer , but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate , Roger Waters . It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge . Gilmour 's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd 's sound , but on his own he has nothing much to say . The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable . They are also pleasent enough , but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe . That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament . But its no reason to indulge him these many years later .	-1
The song No Way is extremely well done . Other than that it 's off to the used CD store with this one .	-1
This is a huge disappointment . Every song goes absolutley nowhere . David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs ( where is the melody ? ? ) and what is here is very empty and meandering . Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here . Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent !	-1
Billy Joel sounds great to middle aged women and lovelorn agnsty preteens , but his shtick gets old pretty fast . Critics have suggested that Joel is not rock , and while this is not true , his debt to the Brill building is obvious . It 's easy to imagine his songs being the basis for a snappy Broadway musical . I admit that I was a fan back in my own misspent youth , given as I was to soggy sentimentality , but unlike Billy , I grew up . You will too . Till then , you will probably love this album .	-1
I followed Fogelberg 's career from the debut in '72 though this title in '80 before finally giving up on him . Every album has a few great cuts but for someone more drawn to his rock 'n ' roll side , the drippy ballads and folkish muzak just got to be too much to bear . On this , his sixth album , Fogelberg 's stylistic swings reach the breaking point - he rocks harder on the songs & quot ; Face the Fire & quot ; and & quot ; Phoenix & quot ; than he ever has before , but with & quot ; Longer & quot ; and & quot ; Heart Hotels & quot ; he lets his sappy romantic side go way overboard as well . Hard to believe a fan of one side of Fogelberg can stomach the other . I recently burned my own & quot ; Best of & quot ; CD for Fogelberg - 2 or 3 songs from each of the first 6 albums . Now I 'll sell the albums and never miss them a bit .	-1
This album is worthless . What 's up with the hype . I could not find one song that I liked ... Horrible album bes avoided . Rock With you is a decent song but the rest is terrible .	-1
Why am I giving this Michael Jackson masterpiece only two stars ? I have a serious issue with the remastering -- it 's way too bright on my high-end ( and otherwise very flat with no tone controls ) stereo system . Who the heck maintained the boosted treble ? I 'm sure this would sound great equalized on an AM radio station , but it 's hurting my ears . The sound quality of the original album is remarkably crisp ... stinging , in fact.So , this is just a warning for those expecting the remastering to have corrected the riding-the-treble-gain problem . I recommend those without the usual treble/bass tone controls who still have their hearing avoid this particular release .	-1

This is certainly not a bad album but I think only the Toto faithful ( myself included ) would care anything about it . Another reviewer comments on the & quot ; dark and edgy & quot ; nature of & quot ; Hydra & quot ; and it could definitely fall into that category . The only problem is that I do n't really like my Toto & quot ; dark and edgy & quot ; unless you consider their 1992 release & quot ; Kingdom of Desire & quot ; ( arguably their best ) a little dark . The best tracks here are & quot ; Hydra & quot ; , & quot ; Lorraine & quot ; , and & quot ; White Sister & quot ; . Enjoy whats here but do n't fail to check out other superior Toto albums including the afformentioned & quot ; Kingdom of Desire & quot ; , & quot ; Turn Back & quot ; , and the outstanding & quot ; Mindfields & quot ; .	-1
My sister used to love Bobby Sherman , but she hated the Beatles , Led Zeppelin , and Steely Dan . I love those groups -- well , Zeppelin marginally -- so she decided that when I was a 7th grader she would force me to listen to Styx , John Cougar Mallencamp , Tom Petty , Journey , and Foreigner . I still like SOME Styx , ca n't understand Mallencamp because he mumbles but he 's kind of cool , Tom Petty is a Dylan/McGuinn wannabe which makes him semi-cool , Foreigner was good for a few decent songs , and Journey ? Do n't worry , this is about REO right now , but they rank very low on my list as well.Okay , so she throws REO in my face . I heard `` Time for Me to Fly , '' and was only marginally moved . She made me listen to their Tuna Fish album , basically an embarrassing midwest take on `` They 're OUR bands , and they ROCK ! '' Yeah , well , could n't I just have listened to Kansas ' earlier albums , a much wiser choice by far for audibly superior reasons ? Oh , no . I had to listen to an album with a bad name about fish and pretend I liked the next best thing to Boston 's percy pop defecation . The only songs I like by REO are `` Keep Pushin ' , '' `` Roll with the Changes , '' and a few cuts from 9 Lives . High Infidelity is another matter altogether , and it signalled the end of any half-hearted promise the group showed to begin with.Chock full of sickeningly hookey power pop aimed at mostly young popular girls I attended school with so they could dance and do `` other things '' with their whipped boyfriends who pretended that was actual rock , the album received so much undeserved airplay during my freshman and sophomore years that I simply wanted to puke . On the bright side , it beat having to hear The Knack , a group that was touted by some joker as the next Beatles and definitely worse . Still , you can only hear songs like `` Keep On Lovin ' You , '' `` Take it On the Run , '' and every other song that this album inspired on subsequently sappy excuses for rock albums before you feel like the guy with the gun in the bell tower . Also , what a nice image , pushing the idea of being unfaithful to your partner by the biggest bunch of pansy rockers to come out of my home area.Before you go and look up my reviews , I am the first to say I love all kinds of music , but certain genres should not be oozing so far off the mark as CBS pushed REO . Because of this album , the band never regained what credibility they might have gained as a respectable rock band . I may like some questionable stuff , but I know the difference between rock , jazz , pop , and a band that sells out to a point where they 've damaged their clout with even the most open-minded of music lovers . Certain genres can be quite wide and open , but others have certain boundaries that one should not step over lest they place their feet in some nasty refuse . With High Infidelity and its lethal formula of `` naughty , '' sugary pop with a few great hooks and chords passing as rock , boasting one of the most irritating lead vocalists of all time in Kevin Cronin , they most assuredly deserve a place right alongside Triumph as potentially great bands who decided to wander into the minefield of corporate cowpies .	-1
This album was the denouement of my high school existence . I give this competent , pleasant , easy listening soft rock formula pablum two stars , however , because , like the urge I get to put on an aural-opium laced Celine Dion album occasionally , it 's addictively listenable as background muzak . It 's like listening to the closest thing to rock 'n ' roll that Elvis recorded between 1960 and 1964.Stylistically , what I wanted when my gonads woke up and took over my mind at puberty was hard drug rock , pounding Chicago blues rock 'n ' roll chords , Chuck Berry riffs , Elvis before he was fixed at the Vet 's , Jerry Lee Lewis pounding out boogie woogie , the Who , and the Rolling Stones telling off my parents . All of that stuff came of age with my older brother , while my generation got Boone-vanilla 'd by James Taylor imitating a folky Der Bingle , Helen Reddy vamping around in a boy-cut hairstyle trying to Aussie Barb Streisand 's act but clipping off her vocals in the most annoying manner , and Carole King whining that men wanted only one thing ... . My parents had all those Ray Conniff , Andre ' Kostelanetz & His Orchestra , and Percy Faith albums -- that style of music tried to accomodate rock , both Percy Faith and Perry Como recorded a Patridge Family # 1 hit ! My generation endured the lectures about what was `` good music '' ( We wanted the other stuff ! ) . Led Zeppelin , Alice Cooper , Boston ( we could get Boston ; it was the one bright point in an otherwise dreary selection at the hardware store 's record room ) , AC/DC , and Kiss came in big just as I was hitting high school , but my crowd got John Denver , Anne Murray , Mike Curb Congregation , and Bread -- getting the hard stuff , the good stuff , took getting on the good side of some cool friends who could get past the lady at the record counter censoring our purchases -- AND threatening to call our parents . Pass me that 8-track Olivia Newton-John 's MAKING A GOOD THING BETTER , please ... . The best we could hope for was America , the Eagles , Captain & Tennille.Well , if ya ca n't beat 'em , join 'em . REO Speedwagon and a little later Styx schamltzed their sound , made easy listening soft pop records , accomodated the same market share as THE EAGLES GREATEST HITS , AMERICA-HISTORY , NEIL DIAMOND SEPTEMBER MORN ( how far he 'd fallen since HOT AUGUST NIGHT ! ) , and CAPTAIN & TENNILLE COME IN FROM THE RAIN . This album : mix up and process Cronin 's voice to sound like the Ray Conniff Singers , soften the sound with keyboards , record the guitar work to suggest Percy Faith 's string section , and mix down the bass , the beat , the rock rebellion . This album was the gateway drug to Air Supply and Pablo Cruise ... and Neil Diamond 's YOU DO N'T BRING ME FLOWERS .	-1
Epic records can not plead ignorance here as they surely know what good quality mini-lp replica sleeve ( mlps ) design means . The mlps designs they executed for the recent Michael Jackson albumsOff the Wall , Bad , etc and Men At Work'sCargowere fantastic and good examples of what great mlps designs are supposed to be . Instead , we get a very shabby mlps treatment for one of the greatest albums from the brilliant New Wave era of the late 70s to the early 80s . The design is pathetic coming in thin cardboard haphazardly assembled looking like something a kid in kindergarten would do on a typical school day . Once the glue gets old this baby will come apart and in fact gaps are already beginning to show on my copy . Included is a colour foldout insert that contains all the lyrics in both English and Japanese . The sound quality is good but not great though and so any alleged remastering done has not improved the original sound quality a great deal . What 's so frustrating though is that the mlps design they did for the follow up albumPrince Charmingis so , so much better ! Who makes the decision to do justice to one album while shafting the other ? The great irony is that while `` Prince Charming '' is charming in its own way `` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' is the far superior one quality-wise being the less commercial/sell-out one with more interesting musical ideas explored as well.When `` Kings ... '' first came out it took the music world by surprise and even defied classification . Was it punk ? Not quite . Rock'n ' roll ? Not quite . Old English folk ? Native American Indian chants ? This album was inspired and fittingly came out of what I feel to be the most creative and exciting time to be a fan of music . Growing up during the New Wave Movement was like dying and going to aural heaven given the vast diversity of music ideas and experimentation that was oozing out of the pores of the gifted musicians at the time : U2 , Peter Gabriel , Human League , Soft Cell , Eurythmics , Depeche Mode , Thompson Twins , A Flock of Seagulls , Boomtown Rats , Level 42 , Spandau Ballet , Duran Duran , Kajagoogoo , Howard Jones , Nik Kershaw , Blancmange , Ultravox , Visage , Heaven 17 and on and on and on and of course Adam and the Ants.I was first introduced to the band by my quirky younger brother who seemed to rebel at my tastes at the time as barely in my tweens I started my lifelong hobby of music listening to the Beatles ' early works i.e . pre `` Rubber Soul '' and so you can see why I hated the album at first which sounded like the antithesis of `` Hard Day 's Night '' and `` Please , Please Me '' . Still , listening to the album my brother played over and over , I began to appreciate tracks like `` Antmusic '' and especially `` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' . The other quirky tracks like `` Feed Me to the Lions '' and `` Jolly Roger '' actually made me laugh and the fact that no one was playing and making tracks like this band made me respect their uniqueness and hence made me more predisposed to listen to other `` strange '' music emanating from the New Wave Movement . Now years later I can hear traces of Velvet Underground , The Clash , The Sex Pistols , Blondie , The Cars etc here and so I hard pressed I 'd say that this is a unique twig off the branch of the punk rock genre being both entertaining and humourously amusing at the same time.The tracks here have aged well and the relative lack of recognition for what Adam and the Ants contributed to the second British Invasion of the early 80s is simply criminal . If you are an mlps collector you will be very disappointed at Epic 's disrespectful treatment of a great album but they could n't take away from the great track content that still sounds wonderful today.Give this expensive , pathetic mlps version a miss but do get the remastered jewel case version for better value .	-1
Hard to believe this cd is sandwiched in between British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance . In the liner notes it reveals this album was written mostly in the studio ... and it shows . Many of the songs , at least half , seem half-hearted and shallow . It 's pretty clear that the band did n't live with these songs enough to make them `` special '' . Tracks , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 are ALL totally forgettable.Still , like many things Priest it 's pretty much a necessity at any rate . Solar Angels being my fave with Desert Plains being right behind.The `` bonus track '' is poorly produced and has low sound quality , add to that a forgettable rendition of Desert Plains and you have two extras right out the window . If your looking for the best of what IS JP , try British Steel , or my favorite Sin After Sin . Buy Point of Entry ONLY after all other cd 's have been exhausted and even then ... tread lightly .	-1
Tried really really hard to like this but there are just way too many really bad songs here - it is really hard to listen to these 2 discs all the way through . Over blown , pompous , self righteous tone of the songs is very tiresome and gets old quickly . Most do not even have a decent melody and are full of cliched , sentimental lyrics and maudlin boring vanilla arrangements ! I can not believe the positive reviews here -- masterpiece ? ? ? Magnum Opus ? ? ? How about Over Rated ! ! ! The singles are great , but the rest is pretty worthless really - get Very Best of instead . Barely enough quality material for a single disc but probably not quite .	-1
I picked this up on the advice of a friend who told me that my distaste for Billy Joel was unjustified . I just had n't heard his early songs , which were full of raw talent , unspoiled by the demands of keeping on top of the charts.I picked it up , and it is now official : Billy Joel has always been a weak , uninspiring songwriter and performerThere is simply nothing interesting about this cd : it contains not a passionate , unique , or inspired note . Of course , it is , for the most part , not outright offensive . While certainly no great singer , Billy Joel does not send me running from the room or make me want to immediately shut him off . His piano playing is certainly no worse than my uncle Joe 's , and maybe a little better . The songs all rhyme , and Billy Joel seems to be very careful to make sure most of them make sense.Billy Joel 's problem is that he always plays it safe , and he is bland , bland , bland . There is no passion in any of it . There is no intensity in `` She 's Got a Way '' ( or `` Just the Way You Are '' for that matter ) , just comfortable , predictable , schoolboy rhymes . `` Captain Jack '' is the more boring drug song ever written . `` Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway '' is inane . Is there an emotional moment in the entire cd ? I could n't find one . You ca n't dance to most of it either.The success of Billy Joel appears to be that he is inoffensive and absolutely deathly dull . It 's comfort music for people who really do n't like music .	-1
`` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' was one of the greatest albums from the brilliant New Wave era of the late 70s to the early 80s . Too bad the sell-out/commercial follow up is such a disappointing let down . This mini-lp replica sleeve ( mlps ) version is very well designed and assembled from good quality cardboard and looks likely to hold up well over the years . Included is a fairly large colour foldout poster of the cover art as well as another fold out insert that contains all the lyrics in both English and Japanese . The sound quality is patchy and not very good with some tracks like regrettably `` Stand and Deliver '' sound very poor compared to that of some of the other album tracks . While `` Prince Charming '' is charming in its own way `` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' is the far superior album quality-wise being the less commercial/sell-out one with more interesting musical ideas explored as well.The tracks here have not aged very well and and some like `` Ant Rap '' sound so bad today that you actually feel embarassed for Adam and wonder if this is the same bloke that was responsible forKings of the Wild Frontier . If you are an mlps collector though you will be happy with the design and assembly although it is regrettable that Epic could come up with the same for `` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' as well . The bonus tracks are quite pathetic and do n't enhance the overall enjoyment of the album.The bonus tracks are:1 . `` Five Guns West '' melody on nylon-string guitar-type instrument ( could be ukulele ) with `` The Lion Sleeps Tonight '' background vocals2 . Stripped down perhaps demo version of `` Prince Charming '' 3 . `` Stand and Deliver '' demo version with comical-sounding drum machine backing4 . Unknown track5 . Demo version with funny drum machine of `` Picasso Visita El Planeta De Los Simios '' 6 . Unknown track7 . `` Scorpios '' very raw demo versionOverall , a very poor follow up to a very good `` Kings of the Wild Frontier '' album and it sounds like Adam was n't even trying which is insulting to his fans and an embarassment to himself.Get the `` Stand and Deliver '' single and forget the rest .	-1
As much as I absolutely loved Adam and the Ants ' first two albums - DIRK WEARS WHITE SOCKS and especially its crossover follow-up KINGS OF THE WILD FRONTIER - I just ca n't heartily recommend PRINCE CHARMING . Save for the three singles ( the peerles , still heart-stopping STAND & DELIVER , possibly the ANTS best single , the campy title track , and the so-bad-its-good proto-rap ANT RAP ) , the rest sounds like flippant , indulgent dreck & does n't stand up today . If you remember that KINGS came out in 1980 , and this came out less than one year later in 1981 , the album sounds like a rush job to capitalize on ADAM 's run of radio hits - clever early MTV videos and swashbuckling image aside , PRINCE CHARMING proves that third time is n't the charm !	-1
Hmmmm -- I seem to remember this song about & quot ; Working for the weekend & quot ; and then I just seen these guys on a certain TV program and I guess they play birthday partys and barmitzvahs etc . But what I wan na know is what exactly is a Loverboy ?	-1
I thought back in '82 when this came out that Men at Work were pretty cool but I was 14 . What did I know ? Now I have to say this album is kind of funny in a ridiculous way . & # 34 ; i come from a land Down Under & # 34 ; and on and on with the lyrics . Corny -- - & # 34 ; Who can it be now ? & # 34 ; The paranoid track . And I still remember the stupid video that came with it . OMG give me a frigging break . So you can listen to me or listen to a kid because its a kiddy album . ENJOY !	-1
When an album sells somewhere around 30 million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business , it does garner my attention . Therefore , separating out Michael Jackson 's personal life from his music - I decided to review his 1982 release `` Thriller '' . Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint , I do think this album is overrated . For this album , Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians . These musicians - while very talented probably were n't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became . Simply put , this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times.The musicians that contribute to this album are big names . There probably are n't many names bigger than Paul McCartney . McCartney is well known for his entertaining duet with Jackson on `` The Girl is Mine '' . However , there are many other big names that contributed collection as well : James Ingram ( background vocals on `` Wan na Be Starting Somethin ' '' , songwriter of `` P.Y.T . ( Pretty Young Thing ) '' ) , Toto 's David Paich ( an arranger on `` The Girl is Mine '' , Synthesizers on `` Human Nature '' and `` The Lady in My Life '' ) , Mega-producer David Foster ( Synthesizer arrangments on `` The Girl is Mine '' ) , Vincent Price ( provides the famous sinister 'rap ' on `` Thriller '' ) , Eddie Van Halen ( a guitar solo on `` Beat It '' ) , Toto 's Steve Porcaro ( Songwriter of `` Human Nature '' , Synthesizer on `` Beat It '' , `` Human Nature '' , and `` The Lady in My Life '' ) , Toto 's Steve Lutkather ( Guitars and Bass on `` Beat It '' , Guitars on `` Human Nature '' ) , Toto 's Jeff Porcaro ( Drums on `` Beat It '' , `` Human Nature '' , and `` The Lady in My Life '' ) , and LaToya and Janet Jackson ( background vocals on `` P.Y.T ( Pretty Young Thing ) '' Finally , acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes ( who worked on Lionel Richie 's `` Cant ' Slow Down '' and Donald Fagen 's `` The Nightfly '' - two outstanding albums in this era ) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection . As for the Toto band members , I do feel their contributions are overlooked . They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - `` Toto IV '' and now they were working on `` Thriller '' and Lionel Richie 's `` Ca n't Slow Down '' - two of the largest selling albums of this time period.I do n't feel it was Michael Jackson 's vocals or any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became . This album was released in December , 1982 . This was a time the music industry was undergoing change . This was the beginning of the age of music video . I give Michael Jackson and his management team credit . They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs , but they marketed it with some very clever music videos . Say what you want about Michael Jackson 's music - but he did make the most of this medium . The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top 10 hits of the 9 songs on `` Thriller '' in the United States . ( The title track `` Thriller '' is probably the best example of this ) .There are several reasons why this album is `` average '' at best : - The Percussions are awful . Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto 's Jeff Porcaro , this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them . There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album . Yes it did have a mixture of styles ( the Rock-edge on `` Beat It '' to the R & B ; Style of `` Baby Be Mine '' and `` The Lady in My Life '' to the campy `` The Girl is Mine '' ) . A lot of times this happens when there are `` too many cooks in the kitchen '' - while there was a vast array of talent , I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product ( even Quincy Jones could n't fix that ) .- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album . Yes , the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael 's songwriting did n't really shine . I thought it was the songs written by `` outsiders '' that were better . The Steve Porcaro `` Human Nature '' penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection . Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album . Many people do n't realize that he wrote the `` Thriller '' track ( while it is n't my favorite , it is probably the only innovative track of the collection ) . Temperton also wrote the two underrated R & B ; tunes - `` Baby Be Mine '' and `` The Lady in My Life '' .As for the positives : - The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members . As mentioned , `` Human Nature '' is probably the strongest track . While I 've never been a fan of `` Beat It '' , there is some good instrumentation in there . I actually feel if `` Beat It '' was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on `` Beat It '' .- If you are a Synth-Pop fan , this album ( with the exception of `` Beat It '' ) is going to provide plenty of it.The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits . Overall , when I look at this collection - I just do n't think it is the greatest album of all time . I would even say that for the year it was `` Album of the Year '' that The Police 's `` Synchronicity '' and Lionel Richie 's `` Ca n't Slow Down '' were miles ahead of `` Thriller '' . The bottom line is that if there were no music videos , this would have been just another 80s Synth-Pop album . If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I do n't recommend it .	-1
I think even Michael Jackson does n't understand how this average recording turned out to be the best seeling record ever . It 's an average albun , not bad at all , but nothing special . There are three or four great songs , the rest is plain boring .	-1
I ca n't understand why this album get such high ratings . To me , the only really good song is the opening `` I got your number '' , but that one is very good . The rest is a strange blend of pop and rock that does n't work at all . The material is also very time typical . I would not advise you to buy this album if you 're looking for steamy rock tunes in the Deep Purple manner .	-1
The title track is slammin ' , but the rest of the CD disappoints . Juicy Fruit is a classic of the '80 's . Unfortunately , the other songs are mundane and repetitious .	-1
Am I mistaken ? Did I miss something ? Or the Fast Eddie Clarke who wrote songs with titles like & quot ; FEEL ME TOUCH ME & quot ; and & quot ; ALL I NEED IS YOUR LOVE & quot ; is the same Eddie Clarke who was part of the glorious MOTORHEAD ? ? Unbeliavable ...	-1
GOooooshh , ... . and to think that Fast Eddie Clarke once was the guitarrist of mighty MOTORHEAD ... . And one still wonders why they & quot ; did not became huge & quot ; ... Almost all metal artists that sold out to make commercial pop metal failed in obtaining any amjor gains . FASTWAY , led by Fast Eddie Clarke , is another of these cases .	-1
FASTWAY is nothing more than ex-Motorhead 's British axeman Fast Eddie Clarke trying to make huge money . The sound in this CD is horrible , I do n't know how people gave it such reviews ! ! ! IT 's pure cliched American pop-metal , produced by & quot ; give me a hit single soon & quot ; Eddie Kramer . All the songs are discardables , the vocals are incredible mean , there 's no energy at all , ony bubble gam music ! ! !	-1
Putting the material aside , this disc is a dissapointment . If it had that `` analogue '' sound that just blows me away on many other SACD releases which were done better and in 5.1 , ( i.e . `` Brothers in Arms '' by Dire Straits ) , I 'd find myself reaching for it 'time after time ' for many hours of musical bliss . The singer does not come into my listening room but remains shrouded behind a digital realm . Alas , it is just ok and with not enough discernable improvement over a regular cd , especially considering the price , so it will likely spend it 's life on a shelf undisturbed but for the occasional dusting . Recommended only if the artist is special to you .	-1
I quite like the first side of this album . David Paich has a soothing voice and his lead vocal on 'stranger in town ' is effective . 'Carmen ' is also a memorable number . Lukather 's ballad 'how does it feel ' , is the only sort of ballad song here , but I am not too fond , though it is ok.The second side is just hard rocking bland song after hard rocking bland song . Tracks 6-9 just blur in my mind as the same sounding . 'Holyana ' is better by Paich again , but not enough to rescue a boring album that has none of the trademark melodies and ballads that Toto are best known for .	-1
Like several of the more positive reviewers , I 'm a lifelong Toto fan . And I did all I could to try to get into this album , but I just never could . Yes , there are a couple of good songs - `` Angel Do n't Cry '' is a pretty good rocker , I love `` How Does It Feel '' and `` Holyanna '' is a good closing song . But for the most part , the band just did n't deliver an album that could stand up to the body of his previous albums . It 's not the style that was weak - the songwriting just seemed to be lacking on this one . I would likely give this album 3 stars for almost any other artist ... but Toto was capable of a lot more than this .	-1
In the early 1980s , Adam Ant dominated the pop charts for all of eighteen months with some really irresistible hits : `` Stand and Deliver , '' `` Prince Charming , '' and `` Kings of the Wild Fronteir '' before he cracked the American market as a solo artist . Anyone looking for the tribal beats and twangy guitars that made his `` antmusic '' so distinctive will be big-time disappointed in `` Strip . '' Granted , there are two polished-up but enjoyable singles on this album : `` Puss and Boots '' and the title track ; both were produced by Phil Collins . Everything else is flat-out bad . `` Strip '' is really two singles weighed down by a whole lotta filler . If you wan na hear classic Adam Ant , get his earlier discs and avoid this . It flopped upon release in 1983 , and for a good reason .	-1
There 's no shame in PRIEST releasing this album . If their only option was to sell out , use puffy hair and thing like that , they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album . I must remember you that this was not a & quot ; phenomenom & quot ; that occured only with the mighty Priest , during the middle eighties : it also happened with SAXON , SCORPIONS , MICHAEL SCHENKER , RAVEN , ACCEPT , and other greta European bands , who tried hard to & quot ; make America & quot ; . In Judas case , they had already & quot ; made America & quot ; with their previous albuns , but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money . So , in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the & quot ; great & quot ; TURBO..	-1
I 'll stick to my old CD from this album than to the remastered version . What a dissapointment.. After so much publicity before releasing them , we 've got almost the same thing , with bad extra tracks and no great insight in the booklet .	-1
This album rocks . It has Halford singing in real fine form , the songs are tight and strong . So why I rated it two stars ? Simple : I just would like to know why ( ... ) producer Tom Allom ( or the band ) decided to kill Dave Holland 's drumming in this album ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! Why his precise and simple sound ( which flourished in BRITISH STELL and POINT OF ENTRY ) was replaced by the horrible kind of electronic / reverb sound disgracefully associated forever with hair metal ? ? ? ! ! ! IF you can sort of `` not listen '' the drums in this album , you will find DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH is very good .	-1
This may be the second worst Priest album after Ram it Down . Rocka Rolla can be excused because the band had n't found its sound yet , Turbo and Point of Entry are excuseable because the band ( and the fans ) looked at both albums as experients . There 's no such redemption here , this album is every bit as bad as Ram it Down . Granted , then first two tracks ( Freewheel Burning and Jawbreaker ) are awesome songs , the rest are all completely forgettable . Even look at the stupid song titles ( Love Bites , Heavy Duty , Turn On Your Light ) . Love Bites is a mind-numbingly awful track with stupid lyrics about Vampires ( Vampires are awesome but not here ) . Heavy Duty and the title track both stink , in fact both are the two worst priest songs ever . Some Heads are Gon na Roll has a good solo but that 's it . Eat Me Alive has a good intro , and then goes downhill from there.And another thing , the lyrics are TERRIBLE . Yeah Painkiller had stupid lyrics too but it could get away with it because the music was so damned awesome . There 's no such redemption for that too , the lyrucs are stupid . With dumb lyrics like `` We 're gon na rock you till your metal hunger 's fed '' , `` Let 's all join forces- rule with an iron hand- and prove to all the world- Metal rules the land '' as well as `` With animal lust they 'll devour your life- and slice your word to bits like a knife '' . This is especially shocking since Halford wrote the lyrics . Was n't Halford supposed to be the `` Metal God '' or something ? As for the production is terrible too- the guitars sound like keyboards , the drums sound like Holland is banging on a plastic cup , and the bass is too loud . THere are noticeable volume drops on the album too.How this trash got the reputation of `` Best Priest Album '' is beyond me . Cut your teeth on `` Killing Machine '' or `` Sad Wings of Destiny '' or even `` Painkiller '' instead , if you must .	-1
I was surprised that `` Turbo '' took such a beating with Priest Fans , because `` Defenders Of Faith '' has got to be , by far , the weakest Priest album with RH . The album really fools you by kicking some ass with the first three songs , and then starts to slowly fall apart . The Sentinel and Heads are gon na roll are Mediocre , but passable , but the last four songs on the album are the worst S**t songs that I have heard on a Priest album , and those ballads Judas Priest has no buiness singing . Sure , Ram it Down and Turbo have been bashed , and those albums are n't Great , but slightly above average around the 3 1/2 Stars rating . This One Sucks . Save your money , Get the first three songs ( hint-hint ) and avoid the rest	-1
Nostalgia made me buy this , next time I will ignore nostalgia	-1
The first thing you 'll notice when you stumble into the coke-infested realm that is `` Mirror Moves '' is the influence of Phil Collins on the Furs new `` mature '' sound . You 'll remember that 1984 was the year Collins came out of the closet in a People magazine interview , in a big way . Everybody but drummer Paul Wilson ( he was known as `` The Thimble , '' if you get what I mean ) had been in on what Collins himself referred to as `` ram sessions . '' In the process , apparently Dickie B. fell in love with the Genesis frontman . I hope you realize this means that the Butler brothers were gaining carnal knowledge about one another in these hour-long daily sessions.It 's as if The Psychedelic Furs had undergone a mutation involving the shedding of an outer layer , and it is this shell that 's left behind , meandering through imitations of tunes . It 's an overprocessed mess , as well , a painted lady on fire in an El D & iacute ; a de los Muertos procession . It 's like the fat Tom Hanks as Dorf on Golf . Oops , I crapped a baby . Paranoid delusions of self-importance are the mad whisperings within the cells of dis-ease . You should n't listen . You should n't turn their volume up with every gulp of wine and pills . My neck grows legs ; a matter-of-fact funhouse wherein your belly grows fatter with the brutality of time and temperance . Eyes grown blind , but still seeing.You might like this if you 're a Loverboy or Men at Work fan .	-1
Pop Kulcher Review : According to Amazon.Com , people who bought this cd also bought greatest hits collections from Boston , Journey , Foreigner , and Styx . What I 'd like to know is , where ARE these people ? Is there any way we can round them up ? Our safety is in jeopardy as long as they live among us.Now , personally , I know some people who own one of these albums , maybe even two . They 're good people -- culturally famished , obviously ; lacking in taste , unquestionably -- but not necessarily people you 'd cross the street to avoid . But people who own ALL FIVE of these albums ? I must admit , it 's difficult to visualize the sort of person whose record collection includes Styx , Foreigner , Boston , Kansas , and Journey . I suppose they would have a bit of Bad Company , Survivor , REO Speedwagon , and Meatloaf thrown in for the sake of variety . The walls would no doubt be adorned by posters of Molly Hatchet and black velvet unicorns . X-Men comics would litter the closet floor ; a few faded photos of Heather Locklear would be tucked beneath the mattress.While it is tempting to gather these sad misfits and lock them away from civilized society , we must -- MUST -- hold out some hope for their redemption . Find these people , my friends , find them SOON . Buy them a Clash album , some early R.E.M. , some Replacements . Offer them moderate doses of the Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth and Pavement . With care and nurturing , we CAN redeem them . Onward !	-1
LET 'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY was an album rushed out to the marketplace to capitalize on the # 1 pop and r & b ; title tune . That smash hit and the beautiful `` Black Butterfly '' are the only memorable songs on this album . The rest of the material features weak writing ( `` Next Love '' ) , cliche 80s synth/thudding drum machine fare ( `` Wrapped Up '' , `` Haunting Me '' ) , up-with-people anthems ( `` Picking Up The Pieces '' ) , and an organ-driven gospel piece that falls flat despite Niecy 's angelic vocals ( `` Whiter Than Snow '' ) .The material on BOY pales in comparison to the excellent songs on NIECY , MY MELODY , SONGBIRD , THIS IS NIECY and I 'M SO PROUD . On these albums , Niecy took her time and came up with material that stayed with you long after the album ended . Even her weakest album until this one , 1979 's WHEN LOVE COMES CALLING , had some great moments .	-1
they were catchy for the 80 's but mainly cool for the time . `` Love in a Vaccum '' Sounds alot like a Fleetwood Mac song.the title track is still the Jam . `` Voices Carry '' was the song.overall the Production & Music is dated but when they hit they did it right .	-1
The music Giorgio Moroder came up with for his soundtrack to the classic `` Metropolis '' was unbelievable and actually enhanced portions of Fritz Lang 's masterpiece . But this `` offical '' soundtrack contains ALL butchered versions of the great music found in the movie . Why could n't they have just inserted what we heard in the film onto the soundtrack instead of revising ( for the MUCH MUCH worse ) all the songs ? The most disappointing track is when Pat Benatar 's incredibly moving vocals in the film are destroyed and replaced with a lame effort here . Moroder 's film versions of these songs introduced me to deep feelings of romantic love I 'd never experienced , and this `` official '' soundtrack does n't even match the emotional level of a cheesy chick flick . If you like Giorgio Moroder , do what I did and record the audio off the DVD or video of this film onto a tape or CD ... do NOT listen to this soundtrack .	-1
To anyone who actually liked this album : I have a pristine vinyl copy played only once that I 'd gladly part with ( you pay shipping and handling ) .REO Speedwagon , once a top rock band of the 70 's with hits like & quot ; Ridin ' the Storm Out & quot ; and & quot ; Roll With the Changes & quot ; , show that they lack staying power . This collection is replete with syrupy pop drivel like & quot ; Ca n't Fight This Feelin & quot ; and & quot ; One Lonely Night & quot ; . REO peaked with & quot ; Hi Infidelity & quot ; and took a nosedive with this loser of an album .	-1
this is an awful album which should be best left behind in the eighties.dated boring dance pop music which you should avoid at all costs.no stars .	-1
The disturbing thing is that they did .	-1
Listening to this album is a sad experience , and not the good kind of sad . Basically , this joint release from Columbia and Motown finds both studios attempting to clear out their vaults of some of the previously unreleased material from Marvin . The graphic cuts `` Savage In the Sack '' and `` Masochistic Beauty '' are almost uncomfortably lewd , and some claim that Marvin never even intended them for release ( they say he just liked to shock visitor to the studio by playing them ) . The semi-hit `` Sanctified Lady '' ( which strongly peaked at # 2 on the R & B chart , but failed to scrape the Hot 100 ) is less pornographic ( even though it 's obvious that `` lady '' was dubbed over `` p***y '' at the last minute ) , however , it 's also melodically less engaging . There are couple more tracks that are just average ( `` Symphony , '' the title track ) , and one where Marvin rambles on and on but never really says much ( `` Life 's Opera '' ) . The best track is easily the perceptive `` It 's Madness '' ( # 55 R & B ) , although `` Ai n't It Funny '' is also a nice groove . However , these tracks could have easily been issued on a better compilation ( of which there have been plenty ) . But the worst thing about DREAM OF A LIFETIME is not the relative poor quality of tracks , but the fact that Columbia and Motown went ahead and released tracks that Marvin had not approved for release - all so they could make a profit off of his death .	-1
This is a Marvin Gaye album ? ! Taken from unreleased demos made shortly before his death and released posthumously a year after it , this album is surely one of the worst albums ever made by a truly legendary artist . His ballads are the weakest of any album in his career , others like `` Sanctified Lady '' are too robotic to be good for somebody like him , and `` Masochistic Beauty '' is such an unforgivable atrocity that sometimes I ca n't help but wonder if it was what Marvin and his father were arguing about when he was killed .	-1
..CHEESE . These songs from the vaults should have stayed there . With corny lyrics and cheesy dated backing music ... you should n't even waste your time with this . Skip this and buy ANY of Marvin 's wonderful albums .	-1
1985 's & quot ; Dream of a Lifetime & quot ; was Columbia 's attempt to get some revenue from the then-recently-departed Gaye . It is obvious to the discerning ear that the & quot ; singer & quot ; heard is not the great Marvin Gaye.The songs themselves are dull and lifeless . They may have been written by the genius but the form that appears here seems amateurish , at best.I 'd give it & quot ; no stars & quot ; if not for the fact that it does have a decent pic of the singer on the cover .	-1
Loverboy was trying way too hard to fit in with 80 's hair-metal bands with this album . The title song is the only one worth a spit . The rest , other than the power ballads , which are lame , sound like crap that would n't even make it as filler on the worst Dokken record . Mike Reno is not a hard-rock singer but he screams and roughs up his voice and just sounds terrible here . Poor guys really went astray and were desperate to keep up with the times and stay popular . This album is pure crappity crap-crap .	-1
& quot ; Balance of Power & quot ; was the last real ELO album ( not counting drummer Bev Bevan 's subsequent & quot ; ELO II & quot ; farce ) . As such , it was apparent that the time had come for leader Jeff Lynne to fold up the band which he thoroughly dominated by that point anyway . & quot ; Calling America & quot ; is a good single , but it is the only cut on the album worth hearing . In any event , the song is also available on the superior anthology album , & quot ; Strange Magic : The Best of ELO , & quot ; which would be a far better use for your money .	-1
elo being mostly 70s dynamic people time secret messages & armchair theatre solo are the only worthwhile stuff power turns empty once you pass the so serious track	-1
Everybody remembers `` The Final Countdown '' by Europe and that 's about it . There is good reason for that . Europe stumbled upon a great keyboard riff , and used it to maximum effect on `` The Final Countdown '' , the keyboard riff sold the song.Unfortunately on `` Wings of Tomorrow '' you do n't get a cool keyboard riff , and while the music is n't bad , anytime lead singer Joey Tempest opens his mouth the songs are ruined . Tempest 's vocals have all of the edge and rock quality of Michael Bolton . So while the guitar work is pretty decent , Tempest begins his `` ooohhhs '' and `` ahhhhhs '' and immediately makes the songs annoying , you will get douche chills for certain . I ca n't imagine paying more than $ 2 for this disk , and that would be for the instrumental `` Aphasia '' ... but even that is n't all that great , but to pay over $ 20 for this disk is a complete waste of money .	-1
Cyndi 's voice sounds terrific on this album but it 's surrounded by really cheesy keyboards and a programmed drum machine . It sounds very ` 80 's and very dated . Her voice deserves to be heard with real instruments that sound much warmer such as on the one song on here that stands the test of time ... '' True Colors '' . The only other song that 's worth owning here is her cover of `` What 's Going On ? '' Even Iko Iko is pretty weak . Cyndi does have a pretty impressive array of guest musicians helping out here ... The Bangles , Nile Rodgers , Billy Joel , Ellie Greenwich , Rick Derringer , Aimee Mann and guitar god Adrian Belew plays the lead guitar on `` What 's Going On ? '' She even has the immortal Pee Wee Herman playing the Operator on the song `` 911 '' ! I would love to hear her remake many of these songs minus the electronics	-1
The 1988 album Back To Avalon by Kenny Loggins contains 2 movie theme songs that reached the top 20 ; one is Nobody 's Fool , from Caddyshack II , while the other one is Meet Me Halfway , from Over The Top . It also includes a duet with Michael McDonald ( She 's Dangerous ) and a swooping title track , arguably the album 's strongest piece . Unfortunately , the album missed certification just as his previous Vox Humana ; a distraught Kenny Loggins due to a crumbling marriage , a slick , synth-heavy , and unequivocally dated late 80s ' production that suffocate the compositions , and the overall change in public perceptions at the time are all factors that contributed to its lack of success .	-1
What an enormous turkey this is ! Why this was n't a career ending album is beyond me . Uninspired writing , singing and playing highlight every track . The whole thing sounds like it came straight out of the can . Good news , no live musicians were used in the making of this disaster .	-1
Peter Pan returned to Earth when this follow-up to THRILLER moved only about half as many copies . Jackson 's audience would continue to dwindle with each subsequent release , perhaps owing as much to the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop 's well-documented tangles with law enforcement as the quality of the albums themselves , yet Weird Al Yankovic nonetheless enjoyed tremendous success with his BAD-inspired music video , a rare example of a `` cover '' improving upon an original recording .	-1
THIS IS BAD ( except a couple of songs where the real Anderson comes through ) .This is not soulful . This is disco pop of the late 1980s ( when disco had evolved away from the Bee Gees and Donna Summer ) .Released in 1988 , this was recorded when Anderson left Yes for the second time . It is 47 minutes long . The original CD sound quality was OK ( better than most of the Yes CDs released in the 1980s ) , but still not great . There is some harshness on the high end , which is a bad thing for someone who sings like Anderson . I have not heard the remastered version , but the original sure could use some fixing.This is more of a producer 's album than an artist 's album . It was produced by Stewart Levine , who produced the jazz/soul/disco band Simply Red . Some are going to argue that Simply Red is not Disco , but that is what Disco had evolved into in the late 1980s until Grunge wiped it off the map . So , many of the songs have that kind of Simply Red feeling to them.The lyrics on many of the songs were written by others , including Lamont Dozier of Holland-Dozier-Holland fame . He has written a number of classic songs , but his writing here is just horrible . Although we all complain about it , Anderson is better off just singing his spacy nonsensical lyrics than this pap.There are a couple of good songs on this CD ( Sundancing and Top of the World ) where Anderson breaks away from the pop and sounds more like he does on his other solo albums.To sum up : -I like Jon Anderson-I like Simply Red-I do n't like Jon Anderson doing Simply Red ( it was like when Eric Clapton tried to do Phil Collins on August ... another project involving Dozier )	-1
The pompous , ponderous emotionless lead singer of Yes here tries to recreate himself as a sensitive singer songwriter . No failure was ever so complete . The sound he creates is somehow both despicably cloying and utterly unconvincing . I fond myself trying to find excuses to leave the room while it was playing , the words that kept coming to mind were ` Please , make it stop . ' Truth be told , he seems to have created a soundtrack to a horrible kids cartoon , it 's that bad . Just thank gOd they never made the cartoon . They say there are no atheists in foxholes , this album seems designed to test that theory . F-	-1
Ouch . It 's painful to think that some people consider this album a `` classic '' BACK IN BLACK was a classic . MACHINE HEAD was a classic . APPEITITE FOR DESCRUCTION was a classic . This is , um , well , not ! Cheesy riffs and guilty pleasures are one thing , like 80s L.A . Guns and Cinderella , but when a band is this cliche and this uninspired , you can see how Nirvana kicked-ass when there was a time when there were just too many of these types of bands cloging the blood-lines of radio/Muchmusic/MTV.As usual there a couple good tracks on here , but the rest just sounds like it was made by robots peeling potatoes in the army backrooms , in other words , boring . Sorry.Please do n't call this a classic or them a hungry band , unless you afix the term `` money '' before it . This did not a pay-off by any means . As far as the scarce good songs , they turn in a great feel-good ballad in `` Do n't Walk Away '' and great hooks in `` Naughty Naughty '' , and `` Under The Gun '' is a rocker-ballad type , and whenever bands do these , and do them right , they sound great.There 's cheese , then there 's grease . Guess what I found ! ? 3/11	-1
Yep this is pretty much pop metal for twelve year old girls par excellence . This stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art'.But honest injun , I only review albums that I actually own and since I 've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - I paid for it and still own it.The airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating . My list of major problems with this release is ; 1 - A band called Danger Danger puts out an album with the lead track of Naughty Naughty . The saving grace is that Naughty Naughty is a darn fine song . Really , the genre does n't get much better than this . Pity about the rest of this album.2 - This is the kind of band that Metal Edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'The Way the Were ' which actually had photos of the band members as kids . Really , pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward . Then again , at the time D/D made a bit of cash so perhaps they 're the ones laughing now.3 - `` Bang Bang - what 's that sound / I gave you my heart then you shot me down '' If Naughty Naughty was the genre at it 's best then tunes like Bang Bang were the genre at it 's most dire.I have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time . Despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star , I ca n't possibly do it . These guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you would n't want to hurt their feelings . Not to mention the fact that Saturday Nite also rocks well . Two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just do n't rate so it ca n't get more than two stars .	-1
This is the worst metal record I have ever heard . Danger Danger were a decent live band , but their studio debut is 100 % grade A cheese . The keyboards are what destroys this record 's chances . Keyboards add to a band if you know how to use them to the benefit of the album . This was forgotten for years in my record collection . It was overshadowed by the superb debut of Skid Row . If you want a record you ca n't hardly sit through , by all means bye this . It 's only real value is as a collection piece for hair metal historians .	-1
Say what you will about Alice Cooper , but his music is a reflection of the times . You have the straight ahead 70 's rockers of & quot ; Love it to Death & quot ; through & quot ; Muscle of Love & quot ; and his solo projects covered disco with & quot ; Goes to Hell & quot ; , 80 's synth/new wave with & quot ; Flush the Fashion & quot ; and & quot ; Special Forces & quot ; , to the Nu-Metal sounds of & quot ; Brutal Planet & quot ; & & quot ; Dragontown & quot ; . In the 80 's Alice tackled the Hair Metal scene with & quot ; Constrictor & quot ; , & quot ; Raise Your Fist and Yell & quot ; and his most popular album of the decade & quot ; Trash & quot ; . Now as an Alice fan , I do n't really care for & quot ; Trash & quot ; , mainly because it does n't sound like Alice Cooper . The songwriting , the guest stars like Joan Jett , Bon Jovi , the & quot ; pop & quot ; production by Desmond Child . & quot ; Poison & quot ; is a great song , no doubt about it , and really the only Cooperesque track on & quot ; Trash & quot ; . & quot ; House of Fire & quot ; sounds like a Joan Jett song , and would have worked on a Joan Jett album , but not for Cooper . & quot ; Spark in the Dark & quot ; , & quot ; This Maniac 's in Love with You & quot ; , & quot ; Hell is Living Without You & quot ; , & quot ; Trash & quot ; & & quot ; Bed of Nails & quot ; are all okay songs , which would have fit perfectly on a Bon Jovi record , but Alice singing about lost love/being in love/finding love just do n't seem to fit with Cooper 's image . Now I can appreciate what Alice was trying to do here , but & quot ; Trash & quot ; does not hold up compared to his other music . You can put in & quot ; Killers & quot ; or & quot ; From the Inside & quot ; and the music still sounds fresh and original . & quot ; Trash & quot ; just sounds like so many other hair bands from the late 80 's , and I think that 's because too many of the then-popular stars of the era had too big a hand in creating the album . Still , I see some of the used copies here under $ 5 , and & quot ; Poison & quot ; alone is worth that .	-1
I like the 70 's Alice Cooper a lot . Theatrical rock'n'roll with creepy/weird conceptual lyrics . But TRASH is really just Cooper running with the then massively popular hair-metal guys .	-1
`` TRASH '' REVIEW : Mired with special guest appearances and an attempt to fit into the mold of Bon Jovi-like rockers , this is Alice at his worst . The top-ten hit single , `` Poison '' is the only track worth mentioning while the remaining tracks are so poorly written that you can understand why the album is called `` Trash '' . Ok , perhaps that 's a bit harsh BUT this is certainly Alice at his worst.MUSICIANS : Far too many to list . Steven Tyler , Joe Perry , Tom Hamilton , Joey Kramer , Richie Sambora , Kip Winger - to name a few.INTERESTING FACTS:1 . The working title for `` Trash '' was `` Low Class Reunion '' .2 . `` Trash '' was released in July of 1989 and peaked at # 20 . It would eventually be certified Platinum in May of 1990.3 . The single `` Poison '' charted at # 7 and would be certified Gold . The single would mark his first US chart single in nine years ! PACKAGING : It may be simple but `` Trash '' does boast a cool `` iconic '' photo of Alice on the cover . Lyrics are included.APPROX . RUNNING TIME:40 min . and 23 sec.FINAL ANALYSIS : '' Trash , '' while commercially successful , is Alice 's worst album that was produced under the watchful eye of pop songwriter-for-hire Desmond Child . Avoid `` Trash '' at all costs ! *1/2 out of 5 .	-1
This was Alice 's big comeback album . The single `` Poison '' got him back on top 40 radio for the first time in years , and the album was a huge success . Cooper was back to playing big arenas in front of sold out crowds . But ... ... I think the album stinks . The music is cliche ridden hair metal and most of the lyrics are just plain stupid . Compared to most of the Coop 's other work this dreck just does not hold up .	-1
At the time this was hailed as Alice Cooper 's `` Comeback `` album . Trash features an Alice Cooper made for 1989 , the catchy commercial songs , the ballads , songs co-written with Desmond Child , and the collaborations with Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi ( also Joe Perry , Richie Sambora , Kip Winger and so on ) were all attempts to make Alice seem more relevant at the time . The thing is Alice should never have cared about being current or follow trends which is pretty much what he did for `` Trash '' . I can disagree all I want about Trash being a solid return to form but the results are there it did fairly well on the charts and this album gave Alice one of this biggest hits with `` Poison '' .I feel the opening track and lead single of the album `` Poison '' is by far the best song here although it 's also the most popular . It 's just a great big catchy ballad , it helped introduce Alice to a new generation and to this day it 's always a live staple in concerts . `` Bed of Nails '' is in the vein of `` Poison '' in that it 's a slower songs , almost a ballad that rocks a little more than Poison . A highlight of the album . `` Spark In The Dark '' is catchy and features a riff straight out of Bon Jovi , it 's a darker song overall and while it 's not the best song here and its subjected to criticism I quite like it . `` House of Fire '' is a bit more Alice-like and what you would expect from him but is still aimed at being a radio song as most songs from Trash are . `` It 's Only My Heart Talking '' is another ballad , Steven Tyler participates on this one and his presence helps the song and for the time this was a good ballad . I feel those are the best moments here . There are some good moments on Trash but also filler or lesser material like the title track which does n't cut it in my opinion or even the album closer `` I 'm Your Gun '' which is too pop and does n't hold up very well over time . Other songs can vary between mediocre to average.This is the deal with Trash , it 's far from Alice 's finest moment and it suffers from perhaps too much production and it ends up being more of a pop album . I feel like there 's less Alice , it 's as if he went into the studio did what he was asked to by the producer or record company.It 's truly a product of its time ( 1989 ) , in fact there are songs that could have been played by just about any other Glam/Hair bands of the era ( that said it could be considered a good Glam metal album but its just not really `` Alice '' which is why some fans were/are disappointed ) . Alice experimented earlier in the 80 's with albums like Zipper Catches Skin , Flush The Fashion and Dada and this one almost does exactly the opposite . While those albums are usually not considered among Cooper 's best they were fun experiments and unique to say the least , Trash is very calculated and goes for what 's modern and popular and is n't very Alice-like . The album does n't have an interesting concept unlike most of Alice 's albums ; the only theme I can find on Trash is love because after all , most of the songs here are love/sexual songs pure and simple . Besides I thought that Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell were comeback records . Yet there are still a few great songs on Trash that makes it worth owning even though it 's obviously not Alice 's finest record or his best moment.Needless to say Trash is not Alice 's greatest moment . There are few songs on the album that are really good but to be honest there 's also filler material and this really is n't one of the best Alice Cooper albums , in fact it 's a little far from it . I would n't say its `` Trash '' but it 's not a great album either as there is a lot of filler material . This one is for completists and hardcore fans mostly ; otherwise I do n't think it has much appeal besides `` Poison '' to the casual listener . Please do n't take it as a stab to Alice , I love the man and what he 's done , I 'd still say it 's worth the $ 6 . Trash is I feel , as you may know by now an overrated album.2 /5 stars .	-1
i like baby hold on , two tickets to paradise , and the duet with Ronnie Spector take me home tonight ( be my baby ) but his voice is a poor man 's Steve Perry.the material is kindy catchy but nothing worth bragging about .	-1
Oh , no ... What a terrible album from Jackson ! He put 11 fillers beside Black or White , Give In 2 Me and Heal the World , the only 3 real songs on this album . Remember the Time was a bit worse but listenable , but all the other songs R on this album R even worse than the opening track , Jam ... . Get a Jackson Best Of instead , containing those three hits , that R really good . Give in 2 Me is the song that just does n't fit into this album 's weakness , it should be appeared on a better one in the future .	-1
Aic 's best and it sounds exactally like every other AIC album ... .problem is AIC are not a good band and have yet to release a decent album ...	-1
The reality is that Fishbone is n't much good . Part Metal , part ska and part funk , the resulting potpourri is more grating than joyful . It 's a pity , because I met him once , if I liked the guys music I might enjoy the memory more .	-1
This stuff is horrible ! ! ! The mix is all wrong and the recording sucks ! ! ! I cant even hear the gitar ! ! ! Get Bodge 's version instead ! ! Get ANY-THING by Bodge instead ! ! !	-1
I seem to be in the minority here , but this album did very little for me . There are a few good songs , but overall I think it is weaker than both `` Constrictor '' and `` Raise Your Fist And Yell '' .	-1
I have a feeling these live shows are a lot more fun live than this recording would suggest . Here , the 1993 big band sounds a little like overkill and James kind of overdoes many of his best songs , adding all kinds of new notes and swoops and hollers that are fine as part of a live show , but which you do n't want to hear again and again , as here . The essence of JT is simplicity , but his treatment of his catalogue here is a little too ornate . I would stick with original albums or greatest hits if you only need a JT sampler . This souvenir is for rabid fans who already have those and who want a live recording sample .	-1
Amazon reviewer Beth Bessmer needs a memory refresher . `` Here We Go ( Let 's Rock and Roll ) '' was also a single off the disc and also a big chart hit . Perhaps she meant to say she felt the other 2 are the only `` necessary '' ones here ? HIGHLIGHTS : Sure , some of the lines in Freedom Williams ' rap are corny ( `` It 's your world and I 'm just a squirrel/tryin ' ta get a nut to move your butt '' ) but that 's part of the charm of the title track . It still holds up well as a floor-filling dance tune that 's a pop song first . Martha Wash 's scatted vocal at the coda just seals the deal . `` Things that make you go Hmmm '' was more or less an attempt to piggyback on the popularity of Arsenio Hall at the time . The lyrics about infidelity recall the style of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince . It 's worth listening to the bonus track ( seemingly just a string of TV/movie clips strung over a house-ish track ) to try and figure out the sources.LOWS : The interminable `` Groove of Love ( What 's This Word Called Love ? ) '' ... wake me when it 's over . Hedonism anthem `` Live Happy '' shares this 'wisdom ' ( `` Some people say how can you live this way ? /Living only for today/Tomorrow may never come our way/So I 'm gon na try to live happy ! `` ) .BOTTOM LINE : The only absolutely critical song here is `` Gon na Make You Sweat '' . It 's available on several compilations : Try ASIN B0000C0XP3 if you want a good R & B ; based comp of that era , ASIN B00004Y6WD for a decent 90s dance disc , or ASIN B00005B53Y if you want a mix of 90s hits cross genre ... everything from Amy Grant to Mr. Big . These are just some of a HUGE number of hits for the song so if you do n't like any of those 3 discs , odds are you can find one you love ( or at least like enough to get it used ) . Get it on a compilation .	-1
In the 1990s , the Country Music began to go through some transitions . Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music . As a result , the sound started to change . By the end of the 90s , Country Music had full blown established music superstars in Shania Twain and Faith Hill . But back in 1992 , this metamorphosis was still in the early stages . I personally , have been intrigued by country music - but I would admit I am not a purist . I enjoy the fusion of different genres of music with country that would eventually lead to these new superstars.. Thus we come to Mary-Chapin Carpenter 's ( MCC ) 1992 smash & quot ; Come On Come On & quot ; . This album does n't quite mesh with the mainstream - it is more pure country and has much more of a folk-ish twist to it . The bottom line is I do n't think this is a very good album.Perhaps I bought this album for the wrong reasons . I had been pleasantly surprised when I heard the remake of Lucinda Williams ' Passionate Kisses on Don Imus ' radio program . Yes it was different than the original , but MCC 's version did something to interest me . She has a very good voice . As a result , I felt it was an investment in the collection that contained this song would be worthwhile . I had also heard that this album had some of the & quot ; fusion & quot ; elements - particularly with the folk sound . I immediately discovered two problems with this album : 1 ) The & quot ; fusion & quot ; element I felt was very lacking . Many of the songs of this album still have a traditional country sound . I did mention , I am not a country purist and I would n't rip an album for that reason alone- so the next reason ; 2 ) The Songs are just not that good . There is little on this album that helps lift it to the next level . Despite MCC 's great voice I heard on & quot ; Passionate Kisses & quot ; , the remainder of the songs do n't do as much to put MCC in the category of a great female vocalist.There are a couple of interesting things that I discovered as this album has sat in my CD rack for the better part of a decade . Country Star - Roseanne Cash ( Johnny 's daughter ) does background vocals on opening tack & quot ; The Hard Way & quot ; . On this very country-ish track , you really do n't get a good much of Roseanne 's voice and it almost is a complete waste of a good talent . Another background vocalist is Shawn Colvin ( who would eventually become a mainstream star in the late 90s ) . Colvin uses a folk-sy style in her works , so looking back in hindsight she might have been influenced on this album . Colvin actually does the background vocals on & quot ; Passionate Kisses & quot ; - which is n't a very folksy song . Again , you are n't going to get a lot of Shawn Colvin - this was very early in her career so you wo n't hear her distinctive sound on this track . Country artist Joe Diffie does a decent duet on & quot ; Not Too Much to Ask & quot ; , but the song is pretty dry and does n't do much for me . Finally , Amy Ray and Emily Sallers - pop artists from the Indigo Girls appear on the track & quot ; Walking Through Fire & quot ; - this is a pretty decent track and actually one of the better cuts , but this is n't a song that is going to make me do handstands.Another song which is worth mentioning is & quot ; The Bug & quot ; . This is a country version of a Dire Straits song . It was written by Mark Knopfler who has always had somewhat of a country/folk element in parts of his music . Dire Straits actually released this song around the same time as MCC 's version . MCC does a very nice job with her rendition of this . I still think the Dire Straits version is superior - but this version definitely holds its own and is one of the better cuts.For fans of MCC and this style , there are some nice liner notes included with the collection . All of the lyrics - with all of the appropriate credits are included with the collection . The version I have of this CD does have this in a fold-out format as opposed to a booklet ( which is annoying , but not terrible ) . The back of the foldout includes a big picture of MCC.I think if you are a MCC fan , my review probably is n't going to influence you . But if you are more of a genre-neutral music fan and are going to invest in this album - think twice . This album is n't going to do much to capture your imagination and will most likely sit in your CD rack like it sits in mine . You probably will find more luck elsewhere .	-1
The music on this CD is average , later to be completely eclipsed by their future albums . Someone please [ remove ] Zack de la Rocha . Better yet , go back in time and stop him from joining this band . He really is that awful . Any possibility of this being a good recording is totally ruined by his slobbering Sylvester the cat vocals repeating the same communist buzzwords over and over and over and over and over ... yes , they really do repeat forever . It 's like hearing a bunch of fools at a protest rally shout irritating catchphrases again and again instead of actual conversation . System of a Down has similar incorrect political opinions , but at least they think out their lyrics and form them together like an essay . You 'll hear nothing of the sort here . Just tired socialist propaganda that leaves you feeling dirty after being subjected to it . Check out their later albums , but stay far , far away from this one unless you can remove the vocals somehow . And the Led Zeppelin [ copy ] was lame .	-1
first off this album lacks imagintation its unbelivable admittedly they have a good guitarist in the form of tom mellero but otherwise they are a load of crap this is the worst cd in my collection and i have never brought another ratm record since if you want to hear political rock i sugest system of a down this the worst cd in my collection now there are some who may like this if you like rap you may do but the rap element isnt perticullary good quality even by the standard it has been set so unless your a fan of rap-rock ( crap rock ) then buy thisnow i only borrowed this album from someone who said it was brilliant it is probably worth borrowing if you like catchy guitar riffs ruined by some crap rapper	-1
Hypocritcal money hungry untalented garbageoh yes , the people who claim to hate the system air on MTV and are signed by sony . this kinda of music only appeals to little 11 year olds who know nothing about the economy and government.not only are the lyrics stupid , but the idea of mixing rap and rock is just awful.the `` singer '' is one of the worsts of all time . there is no particular guitar talent as for the rest of the band , THEY SUCK .	-1
How can ANYONE say this is the best rap-metal CD ? This is the absolute worst ! I bought this CD after seeing the excellent reviews at Amazon.com . Boy , I never thought 450 music fans could be rock . This CD has boring riffs and terrible vocals . The only song that does n't really suck and just kinda sucks is & quot ; Killing In The Name & quot ; . Other than that , this CD is the most overrated CD ever ! NEVER buy this CD ! If you want good rap-rock , check out Taproot , Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit !	-1
this is awful material ! the songs tell about justice ! the riffs are quite Ok but i would like to have more intelligent lyrics like slayer 's ! ! !	-1
After listening to this album several times I have concluded that it is way overrated and does n't deliver the goods despite of all the 5 star reviews here . Sure its better than linkin park and the lot but that does n't say much at all . Musically this album can not compete with with other far more interesting acts of that era such as soundgarden and RHCP whom displayed far more class and intelligence in their sound.The lyrics and vocals sink things much further as they come across as very pretentious and quite obnoxious , with little variation.Halfway through the album I get really tired of it all . Certainly impressionable and anti-everything types will love this but to me what could have been more becomes rather annoying .	-1
Horrible communist rock album by political activists turned musicians . This self-titled debut is best seen and not heard . And if you plan on hearing them , I suggest you wear ear plugs . This is mearly a plea for a socially acceptible rebellion that ends up being trendy . If you think watching CHILDREN OF THE CORN is what turns your kids against you , think again .	-1
Although this is a highly touted album , it is fairly weak . Rage Against The Machine is one of the most admired bands of the rap-metal movement of the 90 's , and that 's fair enough , they are one of the best bands in the genre ; hey ! at least every song is n't some teen whining about all their angst and pain , and how they 're so tough . However , for a band with a message , lead singer Zack de la Rocha raps as fast as he can , and it is often difficult to understand what he is saying , without refering to the lyrics sheet . That said , he is also often a good rapper.And with regards to the music , their song-writing is formulaic , predictable and often lazy . There are so many filler moments where the music in the background just plays a bass line on repeat and Zack raps on and on . Almost all songs follow the same pattern ; intro ( the chorus backing music ) / quiet verse / heavy chorus /quiet verse / heavy chorus /instrumental / heavy chorus / some screaming ( e.g . on the song Wake Up ) . Their songwriting is not very deep , the riffs can cross the line between catchy and repetitive . Repeat plays wear this album thin fairly quickly.But their music is quite energetic , the guitarist Tom Morello has some very excellent work , he is very creative , especially with intriguing high-pitched effects . And these guys have some seriously rocking riffing . Like funk-rock that just explodes from your speakers or earphones , just like a bomb going off . And , take you hat off to Zack , he puts a lot of energy in his vocals.Unfortunately , this album is too laborious to deserve a good rating . But at least they have a lot of talent and promise . Rating **	-1
I only liked `` Closing Time '' and `` Anthem '' on this CD , and even those are a cut below Leonard 's best work . This release gave me the feeling it was made of tracks that were not good enough for earlier albums , and someone decided to put them all one disc and get rid of them . The biggest insult to his fans , however , is to try to cover Irving Berlin 's `` Always . '' Both Cohen and Berlin are great songwriters , separated by a generation and a World War and amazing changes in love and courtship and sex customs . Leonard is great at writing relationship lyrics , and so was Irving , but for different planets . Try `` Various Positions '' and his `` Greatest Hits '' albums instead of `` The Future . '' This one is just not in the top ranks of his concept releases .	-1
& quot ; As I lay me down & quot ; is the only good song off of this album . I 've listened to this album many times , but none of the other songs make me want to listen to them over and over for pleasure . The other songs do n't seem to fit with & quot ; as i lay me down. & quot ;	-1
Oh wow , I 'm sure this is GREAT music for teens to listen to ; and I 'm sure it will teach teens all how to spell.I do n't know why posers going around selling all this s*** . What 's the point ? Listening to people swear , and cuss over some lame beat ? I wo n't pay good money to hear some guy curse and rap ... and you wo n't either , if you 're smart.Will this nonsense ever end ?	-1
Jamiroquai ` s debut was a critically aclaimed record when it came out in the early nineties , yet I fail to understand why . This is hardly innovative and original stuff , just a rehash of some sounds from the seventies with a couple of more contemporany and recent production details . & quot ; Emergency on Planet Earth & quot ; mixes funk , lounge , soul , pop and even a bit of jazz , trying to sound fresh , hip and subtle yet it ends up being unmemorable , slow and tiresome for the most part . The first songs are somewhat promising , but as the record unfolds it only gets boring and drags for way too long , becoming useless elevator music . Ok , so the environmental message & quot ; love mother nature & quot ; is mildly interesting , still that doesn ` t make this effort any better.Overall weak .	-1
I Liked Cypress Hill more when they first came out.There First Album is still their Best as far as I 'm Concearned.the Problem with this Disc & amp ; much of their Music is that they only Mainly talk about Weed.They Have Talent but it gets to be a One Trick Pony after a while.Insane & amp ; I wan na get high are still the cuts .	-1
Best cuts are `` I 'm In A Philly Mood '' and `` Stop Loving Me , Stop Loving You '' . Good R & B ; album such as it is but unless you 're a collector , you 're not missing much . The production is much too heavy for my taste . I 've played this thing a grand total of twice all the way through since it came out and even tried to like it but it just does n't do it . `` Three Hearts In The Happy Ending Machine '' remains the cream of the crop for Daryl Hall solo albums.I recommend the CD remixes of `` Stop Loving Me '' , and `` Written In Stone '' . The best track is on the import version of the CD in `` I 've Finally Seen The Light '' .	-1
With the release of their second record , Get Your Wings , Aerosmith was first trying to find their voice in the world of rock n roll . At this stage , the band gives us some gritty guitar styles and a few good hooks . However , when compared with Toys In The Attic and other material , this collection is a little bit weak.Out of the eight songs , I find three ( Same Old Song And Dance , Lord Of The Thighs , and Train Kept A Rollin ' ) stand out the most . And even these songs are good and not quite great . Seasons Of Wither is a little noteworthy too as a result of an interesting acoustic guitar passage.Seek out Toys In The Attic , Nine Lives , and/or a good compilation . This one shows a little promise but does not fully deliver .	-1
Toys in the Attic is an overrated , overplayed disaster.The only decent songs are the title track and `` Uncle Salty '' . `` Walk This Way '' has a unique vocal melody for the time it was released in the mid 70 's , but that does n't mean I like it . `` Big Ten Inch '' sounds like some fake novelty song that wears thin after a couple listens . `` Sweet Emotion '' is a decent song , but the live versions are MUCH better because the song demands a lot of energy , which this studio version lacks . `` No More No More '' is Aerosmith 's version of a pop song , and an unmemorable one at that . `` Round and Round '' is a rip-off of Black Sabbath 's `` Sweet Leaf '' and for some reason , a hard rock band thought it was a good idea to end an album with a ballad called `` You See My Crying '' , complete with overdramatic emotions that sound forced and unreal.Aerosmith is a pretty fantastic band , but Get Your Wings is the place to start . Or buy that live album released in the late 70 's .	-1
Aerossszzzmmmiittthh r just as bizzad as Van Gayf*glen ( with DLG & SG ) . Luckily tey became better wit 9 Lives & the mizzasterpiece Just Push Plizzay . Avoid they 70s & 80s ( ... ) at all cizosts though ! ! ! ! ! I bet you 'll hate it as well , dude !	-1
No its not them its me from sampling this bull ! @ # $ ! ! ! I wouldnt buy this if it came with a Peurto Rican Chick that the only word she knew in English was Yes or if Bush helped the Gas Prices Go Down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Do Not Buy Dont Listen To YO	-1
What WAS I thinking claiming Rocks to be Aerosmith 's masterpiece ? The album has too many flaws for any kind of `` masterpiece '' talk to be thrown around . How can an album be popular without any good guitar riffs , unmemorable vocal melodies and uninspiring drum work ? Even Steven Tyler does n't seem to care whenever he opens his mouth . His vocal work on tracks like `` Combination '' and `` Nobody 's Fault '' absolutely stink . A very annoying high pitched sound that was never a problem on any Aerosmith album before this one . I do n't know if he was trying a new style or just did n't care . It was probably the drugs getting the best of him . Let 's not even mention the god awful ballad that closes the album.Not all the songs should be avoided though . Besides the two big memorable hits that open the album , you have `` Rats in the Cellar '' which is an AWESOME track . Maybe one of the fastest songs I 've ever heard the band do , and it positively rules . Side two has some good moments , but it 's not really an album worth owning .	-1
thank god for good songs like `` hole in my soul '' and `` jaded '' because these old cds are really boring . its not aerosmiths true rootsfor good aerosmith listen to hokin on the hobo	-1
Like many other reviewers , the band was in decline on this batch . The record starts off strong with the gritty Title Track and I Wan na Know Why ( probably the best track on the collection ) . However , afterwards its very much hit and miss with more of the miss quality . Kings And Queens is fairly creative at elast with some noteworthy piano , strings , and Tylers best vocal performance on the record . Get It Up is a cool track but the rest is mediocre or even abysmal . Choose Toys in The Attic or a compilation isntead .	-1
Cocaine , heroin and tuinals became a bigger part of Joe Perry 's and Steven Tyler 's lives by 1977 , and it shows on & quot ; Draw The Line & quot ; .The title track does provide traditional Aerosmith fare ; Perry , in between snorts , actually lays down some inspired slide guitar . This is one of only three Tyler-Perry compositions . The other two , & quot ; I Wan na Know Why & quot ; and & quot ; Get It Up & quot ; , are marginal . & quot ; Get It Up & quot ; is the far weaker of these two songs . At least one can make it through & quot ; I Wan na Know Why & quot ; and detect some of Aerosmith 's swagger and arrogance. & quot ; The Hand That Feeds & quot ; and & quot ; Sight For Sore Eyes & quot ; are amongst the worst tracks the band laid down in the '70s . & quot ; The Hand That Feeds & quot ; is especially offensive ; Tyler sounds completely wasted and Joe Perry did n't even play on this song. & quot ; Milk Cow Blues & quot ; does provide a bit of a lift with some inspired blues riffs from Brad Whitford , while the Tyler-Tom Hamilton penned & quot ; Critical Mass & quot ; sports an almost Beatles-like sound . This track has to catch you in a particular frame of mind in order for it to be effective . & quot ; Bright Light Fright & quot ; is Perry 's nod to punk and should have been left off the album . Perry in this point in his career could n't sing and the whole production is just too dense.Thank God for & quot ; Kings And Queens & quot ; . Easily the best track on the album and one of Aerosmith 's greatest moments , this song builds the drama quite effectively , using mandolin , banjo , synthesized strings and Steve Tyler 's piano to compliment the guitar fury of Whitford and Perry.After & quot ; Rocks & quot ; , this album is a huge letdown . & quot ; Kings And Queens & quot ; ca n't even save this album . But & quot ; Draw The Line & quot ; is oddly effective in two ways : as a historical artifact which cronicles the bands decline , and as a warning to musicians not to do drugs .	-1
This release drew the line for me with Aerosmith . There music on this and the following material up to date contain complete chaos . Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts . This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned . I have the first four releases ( Aeromsith , Get Your Wings , Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5***** ) , but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there . Or maybe I am just old !	-1
After Rocks , one would think they could only go down and that 's what happened . At the top of their game as America 's greatest rock band , they had nothing in their way ; except themselves . Draw the Line was where their excesses caught up with them . Many bands of their stature would have serious problems putting an album together in their state but it never stopped Aerosmith before . They simply pumped the energy from their live shows right onto to the record . This is where that all changed.The title track may be a little raunchy but it still makes a good noise . Afterwards however , things go down hill . & quot ; I Wan na Know Why & quot ; and & quot ; Critical Mass & quot ; are listenable but they just are mediocre songs . & quot ; Kings and Queens & quot ; has to be one of my favorite of the band 's songs but it even leaves something to be desired . It shows the band struggling to follow-up the experimentation they began on Rocks . Even the solid riffs of & quot ; Sight for Sore Eyes & quot ; ca n't help this album look good as a whole.If you want 70s Aerosmith , pick up Rocks , Get Your Wings , or Toys . Even Night in The Ruts , produced after this one , is a better album than this one and the band was literally breaking up while they were recording it . Goes to show that concentration can be the biggest roadblock in the creative process . All you get from this album is shoddy sound and a few decent songs .	-1
Like Aerosmith ? Me too . Like Aerosmith early days ? Me too . But this album is not for me . Poor cover versions of James Brown and The Beatles , awful `` Back in the saddle '' , terrible `` Train kept on rolling '' and sick `` Sick as a dog '' made me sick of it . Easier to mention the good titles : `` Lord of things '' is made here much better than in `` Get your wings '' ; `` Walk this way '' is also good and `` Dream on '' is great . Nothing more to write about , besides the bad sound recording . Poor album of a good band .	-1
THE BAND : Steven Tyler ( vocals , piano , harmonica ) , Joe Perry ( guitars ) , Brad Whitford ( guitars ) , Tom Hamilton ( bass ) , Joey Kramer ( drums & percussion ) .THE DISC : ( 1978 ) 16 tracks clocking in at approximately 76 minutes . Included with the discs is a 7-page booklet containing some great band photos , song titles/credits , where each song was recorded and when , and thank you 's . All songs from 1977-78 with the exception of `` I Ai n't Got You '' and `` Mother Popcorn '' from 1973 . Label - Columbia.ALBUM REPRESENTATION : Debut ( 2 ) , Get Your Wings ( 3 ) , Toys In The Attic ( 3 ) , Rocks ( 3 ) , Draw The Line ( 1+ ) , songs not on a studio album ( 4 ) .COMMENTS : Plain and simple - most of these live recordings should have remained in the vault . The good : Joey Kramer keeps a steady beat throughout ; overall decent track list - song highlights include `` Back In The Saddle '' , `` Chip Away The Stone '' and `` Mother Popcorn '' ( featuring some great saxophone from David Woodford and then leading into an uncredited smokin ' version of `` Draw The Line '' ) . The bad : A majority of the songs here are simply butchered ; Steven Tyler screeches and wails like a drunken sailor on leave ; dueling guitars from Perry and Whitford are sloppy and actually miss musical notes ; Tom Hamilton 's bass guitar is for the most part absent ; truly sad and careless versions of huge hits `` Dream On '' , `` Walk This Way '' and `` Sweet Emotion '' . So many great 'live ' albums were released in the 1970 's ... an era often remembered fondly for the double-live vinyl album ( Peter Frampton , Deep Purple , Kiss , UFO to name a few ) ... sadly Aerosmith 's `` Live-Bootleg '' is NOT one of them . Aerosmith has always been one of my favorite rocks bands , but the timing on this album was terrible - the band members were clearly down in the dumps and at one of several low points in their career ( drugs/alcohol ) and their performance absolutely suffers because of it . If you 're looking for some Aerosmith live , start with `` Rockin The Joint '' ( 2005 ) .	-1
After releasing of 6 Aerosmith longplays , the Greatest Hits compilation appeared . But WHAT ? Greatest hits ? These are not the greatest hits ! The one bad point is that some songs here are cut , and there are many songs missing ! There is only Dream On from their debut . I understand that many people underestimate Aero first LP and they do n't like it , so appearance of `` One Way Street '' Or `` Somebody '' here could seem strange , but how about one of Aero 's greatest rockers , `` Mama Kin '' ? And this is also on almost each later Greatest Hits compilation ! You get only Same Old Song And Dance from Get Your Wings . So how about Train Kept A Rollin ' and Seasons of Whither ? The track choosing from Toys In The Attic is almost right , but where is the classic rocker `` Toys In The Attic '' ? Two greatest hits from Rocks , Back In The Saddle and Last Child are here as well , but maybe I would appreciate at least `` Sick As A Dog '' here , too . It 's one of their best cd 's , at last.Draw The Line and Kings And Queens are the only two really listenable tracks on Draw The Line . I also like Sight For Sore Eyes , but I can spare them it 's not here.Remember may be a hit , I do n't care , this song is weird , and I think No Surprize would make much better choice than this.Another disappointment is appeareance of Beatles song , Come Together , while I think it 's Aerosmith worst cover ever ! It definetly should not appear here.This compilation is only for collectors and for VERY fastidious listeners . True Aerosmith fan will never like it . If You are new to Aerosmith , go for `` Rocks '' , `` Get Your Wings '' , `` Toys In The Attic '' or self-titled debut .	-1
This is n't there best of . It is n't anywhere near it . WHy did they even make a best of that early in their carrer . This has good songs but it is n't worth the money . Buy `` Oh Yea : Aerosmith 's Biggest Hits '' or something with more songs because this is n't veryfullfilling with only 10 songs and some suck . They do a cover for Come Together originally by the beatles and it 's terrible.2 best songs : Last Child & Sweet Emotion2 worst Songs : Come Together & Kings and Queens	-1
The original Aerosmith compilation has become nothing more than a relic for completists . Originally released as a single LP record in 1980 , there are only 9 songs from their first six records ( with two of them , & quot ; Sweet Emotion & quot ; and & quot ; Kings and Queens & quot ; , substantially edited ) and the Beatles cover , & quot ; Come Together & quot ; ( originally featured on the 'Sgt . Pepper 's ' movie soundtrack - you know , the one with the Bee Gees ) . For the casual fan , you can get just as many unedited songs from that era on the newest compilation , 'Oh Yeah ! & quot ;	-1
I have no problem with greatest hits packages , but when they butcher the songs with 45 editing , you get half-ass versions of songs that were meant to be heard in their entirety.Add to this poor decision that they included two songs that need not be here , Kings and Queens and the ridiculous Remember ( Walking In The Sand ) . There are at least a dozen others songs that deserve to be included here.All that aside , if you really want to introduce yourself to this band , buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks or one of the other scads of hits packages they 've greedily dumped on the consumer over the years.Save your money .	-1
What 's missing : 'Mama Kin ' , 'Train Kept A-Rollin ' , 'Seasons Of Wither ' , 'Toys In The Attic ' , 'Chip Away The Stone ' , 'No Suprise ' . What 's annoying : some songs , like 'Sweet Emotion ' , 'Same Old Song And Dance ' , and a few others , are edited for time . I hate that ! So in effect , these are n't even the songs we 've come to know and love . Get the recent double-disc Oh Yeah ! compilation instead .	-1
Ignore all of the positive reviews for this album they are not the truth . If you are a fan of Aerosmith like I am , odds are you will not like this album . Only one song is good and that is Lightning Strikes . Jailbait is ok and is the only song from this album that they tend to put on best of compilations . The rest is a boring snooze fest that you do n't want to hear . Even though Joe Perry & Brad Whitford are n't on this album , I do n't think that is the problem . The state of the band at the time just did n't allow them to write good rock music . Luckily Aerosmith reunited and made a commercial comeback . If you are new to Aerosmith get Pump , Rocks , & Toys in the Attic . Those are the 3 essential Aerosmith albums . This album is for hardcore fans who want to be completeists . Do n't expect to listen to it often and good luck enjoying it .	-1
Every few years I give this CD another chance but the end result is always the same . There are 4 decent songs and six bad tracks . Three of the bad tracks are awful . This is a CD that probably never should have been released . It has nothing to do with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford having left the band either . Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo were good guitar players doing the best they could in a bad situationThe good for me are Jailbait , Lightning Strikes , Bitches Brew and Rock in a Hard Place . Musically Jailbait is a fast paced , raw song even if the subject matter is juvenile . You 'd think a band recording their 7th record could have come up with something more original lyrically . I always liked the guitar riffs for Lightning and Brew . Rock in a Hard Place is a boogieing rock song that is underrated.The rest of the songs are n't good . Bolivian Ragamuffin and Jig is Up are boring . Prelude to Joanie is poetry from an addict 's drug-addled mind and its follow-up , Joanie 's Butterfly , is a mess . Push Comes to Shove is n't much better . Cry Me a River is a great old song , but this version is terrible . Steven Tyler has one of the best rock 'n roll voices ever , but he does n't have the voice to pull off a torch song.At some point during his tenure with the band , Rick Dufay said to the original members , `` What are we doing here ? '' You can hear that statement throughout Rock in a Hard Place .	-1
I have to agree this is one of the worstalbum 's ever recorded by Aerosmith.It 's not Aerosmith without Joe Perry orany original member for that matter.To me they suck without Steven and Joe.Do n't waste your money and do n't just buy itcos'you want it for your Aerosmith collection.The only good song on here is & quot ; Lightning strikes & quot ; .You 're better off buying the best classic album's.Aerosmith , Get your wing 's , Toy 's in the Attic , Rocks , Draw the line , Live bootleg , Greatest hits , and Classic'slive 1 and 2 , Done with mirror 's and Gem's.Those are the best album 's from Aerosmith inmy opinion from the 70's.Save your money and do n't waste it on crap like this .	-1
Not only is this Aerosmith 's worst release , it 's one of the worst cds of all time . The production , playing , songwritig , singing , and anything having to do with cd , is horrible . This was the first Aerosmith cd ( record ) I ever bpought . I would not touch Aerosmith with a 10 foot pole for years to come . Luckly PUMP caught my attention when it came out , and I started buying their stuff . I have even listened to the cd , thinking maybe it was the record that made it sound bad , NOPE .	-1
Well , believe it or not , Aerosmith used to be a descent band in the early 70 's . This album has still a little clue , of what 's been going on in the past . But still it fails , offering you the wost side of Aero-style . There are only brief cuts form the huge jam they had going in the 70 's . But still , it 's a true masterpiece compared to the latest production . Jeess-uss ...	-1
I think this is the worst Aerosmith album , but & quot ; worst & quot ; does n't mean bad . What i 'm trying to say is this : It 's not a bad album because there are good songs in it , but thinking about Aerosmith I feel that the tracks have less power that the others . Althoug Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo are good , the perfect ( and unique ) couple for & quot ; A & quot ; are Joe Perry and Brad Withford . I respect all the reviews by others fans because each one of us have our own mind .	-1
THIS WAS ULTIMATELY THE WORST AEROSMITH ALBUM EVER RELEASED ! ! AND IT 'S ONE OF THE WORST ROCK ALBUMS EVER RELEASED ! ! ! NONE OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD AND THIS WAS MADE AT THE WORST TIME OF AEROSMITH 'S CAREER . 2 OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS HAD LEFT THE BAND AND BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM CAME OUT , AEROSMITH HAD ALMOST BECOME FORGOTTEN . BUT , A FEW YEARS LATER THEY MADE A MIRACULOUS COMEBACK BY COLLABORATING WITH RUN-DMC FOR A REMAKE OF THEIR CLASSIC `` WALK THIS WAY '' . DO N'T BUY THIS ALBUM LIKE I DID . YOU 'LL REGRET WASTING THE MONEY TO GET IT AFTER YOU LISTEN TO IT .	-1
Times were hard for Aerosmith . But what matter when you buy an album is if you like the songs or not . I do n't care if the badn members wer overdosing , if the record company was putting pressure on them , if the members are gay ... I just do n't care.And , as for the music on the album , oh boy , Aerosmith had the talent to produce anything better than this [ stuff ] , even without Perry and Whitford on board . Just it .	-1
By the 80s Aerosmith had lost it . They had given up their trademark muscular hook driven hard rock in favor of screechen metal . Sad but true , hence , no hits , give this one a miss , even fans of the band will doubtless prefer TOYS IN THE ATTIC or GET YOUR WINGS .	-1
This may as well been a Steven Tyler solo album . Brad Whitford and Joe Perry were gone , and Tyler had to resort to a truly god-awful cover of `` Cry Me A River . `` The only good song here is `` Lightning . '' Get any other Cd than this ... with the exception of `` Done With Mirrors , '' this is Aerosmith at its worst .	-1
This album is not terrible . It is simply so-so . It captures the darkest time in the history of the band . The members ' drug problems were on their way to the pits . Joe Perry and Brad Whitford were doing their own things in solo projects . Aerosmith was left with not much of a songwriting team . they were forced to enlist Richie Supa as a regular songwriter and do whatever they could to get lyrics out of Steven . Thank god they got the real band back together and made solid records again . If this were their last , the band would n't have much of a history.Songs like & quot ; Jailbait & quot ; and & quot ; Joanie 's Butterfly & quot ; are interesting but not good enough to be great . They only stand out cause there is not much else on the album.Strictly for the Aerosmith completist .	-1
It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John , Gary Moore , Montserrat Caball & eacute ; and Muse , with a twist of progrock.He does not succeed in any of those attempts.His very little voice - whining and weeping , turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play , and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.Therefore , Jeff Buckley is at his best when he does n't sing.But he does . So ... The only OK song on 'Grace ' is the final 'Dream Brother ' . And still , it is only OK , not exactly brilliant .	-1
Only one word can describe this album -- Atrocious . Jeff Buckley ? ? Ha -- more like Jeff Suckley .	-1
I did not order thsi . I have it on CD . Take it off , take it off , take it off , etc , etc , etc I am on my way to the bank to refuse to pay for these orders .	-1
... .but that 's it . Do n't like any of the other songs on this CD . I think i 'll just buy the one song from itunes . i 've already given away the CD . Not happy with my purchase , sad to say . I was expecting so much more .	-1
I find this guy 's voice extremely unappealing . He sounds like he ca n't control it . Sometimes his voice sounds good , but then it goes weak . I 'm amazed that so many people love it . This album is borderline pretentious and I just do n't think the songs are very good . But some of the more atmospheric stuff sounds kinda cool , especially on the last song.P.S . - the guy 's review below me is laughable . Buckley does n't hit any `` magic frequencies '' - how pretentious ! He ca n't hold a candle to NFAK either .	-1
Wow..Jeff Buckleys & quot ; Grace & quot ; should be renamed & quot ; Disgrace & quot ; .What a stinker this album is.1 star is all this deserves , and that is being awfully generous .	-1
I remember reading about this album in Rolling Stone . It had 2 stickers on it . It had the usual `` parental advisory '' sticker ( is there a rap album that does n't ) and another one saying `` the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist '' ( or words to that effect ) . The article 's main point was asking `` are albums going to get two labels now ? What 's next ? '' . So , my `` I hate censorship '' side got all flustered , and I went out and bought it . It 's a piece of s -- t. The beats are boring , and all the lyrics seem to consist of is `` my name MC Eiht . No one better mess with me '' . He pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so , and it gets incredibly tedious . Needless to say , the sticker `` controversy '' never erupted into anything beyond this album . I just ended buying a really boring album , and I immediately got rid of it .	-1
I have listen to this cd today and really it was funny ! This cd is a real joke , this music did n't pass the test of time.Completely out dated , look somewhere else for good heavy in the 80 's , like Iron Maiden for instance !	-1
So he sang some simple blues songs and played his simple guitar licks and died young . And thus begins the pattern that if you die young your importance and talent become magnified far beyond what it would have been had he lived another 20 years and drank himself into obscurity . Forget the hype and get real .	-1
This CD is not as good as you may have heard . It 's not what I would call revolutionary -- terrible lyrics , inept playing , and an overall muddy sound make this nearly unlistenable . A few good moments but too much crap to slog through .	-1
I went shopping for some tapes at the local thrift store . Some dopey looking teenager was working there and asked if I was looking for anything . I said `` Yeah , do you have any cool punk tapes ? Like a Good Charlotte bootleg ? '' and he just laughed . He said `` Girl , this is real punk ! '' and handed me some tape with a tranny on the cover called `` Raw Power '' . It was only 25 cents so I bought it . And YUCK ! This album is pretty much as run-of-the mill as you can get . Nothing special about this album at all . Real punk is Green Day 's `` American Idiot '' , not this untalented crap made by ProTools . Do n't listen to it , EVER .	-1
I bought this when it first came out in 72 , and I pity 14 year old kids today who do n't have a record like this `` to do all the things that kids are n't supposed to do '' to ( if that makes any sense ) . If my old vinyl copy could talk , I 'd be in jail for the rest of my life . That is , if I could find the damn thing . And that 's a BIG deal , because the remastering of this album completely ruins one of the wildest listening experiences ever created . On the original album , every tune sounded like it was recorded in different venue with a different producer . Every mix was completely different , and by objective standards , unbelievably horrible . By subjective standards , however , the uniquely ridiculous sound of each track made for one of the ten best rock and roll albums ever . `` Search and Destroy '' was all trebled-out , overdriven Stratocasters and virtually no bass , with an up-front metallic clanking throughout that really hurt the ears , even at low volumes ( listen to any track on the Mary Chain 's Psychocandy to hear roughly what it used to sound like ) . Raw Power growled away muddily , with lots more low-end sludge than on this version . Death Trip sounded just like the name implies , with the lead guitar sounding like it was recorded with the mike about an inch away from the amp , and turned up to 11 with an outrageous treble boost . Shake Appeal ( which fares best on this CD ) sounded like it was recorded in muddy mono , until the up-riff ended , and then the power chords exploded in a huge wall of stereo sound , and then shrank back to mono ( the effect was mind-boggling at high volume ) . But the crown-jewel , the piece-de-resistance , was `` Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell . '' If ever a dirtier , sludgier fast rocker was ever recorded ( with Iggy 's absurd growling-screeching buried behind the wall of unbelievably distorted guitars and bass ) I 've never heard it . Just thinking about the way it used to sound after a micro-dot is putting a big smile on my face . But it does n't sound anything like that on this remaster , nor does any other track sound remotely as good as on the original ( with the possible exception of Shake Appeal , which I preferred in the old mix but which has a lot of power in the new version ) . And unless you 've ever heard the original release , you ca n't possibly imagine the roll that the right mix can play in turning an excellent album into something that changes your life ( not always for the `` better '' in this case ) . I 've been collecting records and CD 's compulsively for over 30 years , much to the detriment of floor-space in my domicile , and I 've never seen a re-mastering ruin an album the way Raw Power has been eviscerated . The re-mastering is really loud , but that 's not the point . I 've got a volume control to deal with the relatively low levels of the old masters . For the love of all that 's Holy , somebody get ahold of the original masters that were used on the old albums and re-release this thing . Then , kiddies , you 're in for some real fun .	-1
Iggy ( or whoever really remixed Raw Power ) apparently did n't realize that the filmmakers of Spinal Tap were joking about turning up the amps to 11 . All these vandals accomplished was to wipe out a good portion of the signal and make this cd unlistenable at normal volumes . As others have stated , Iggy and the Stooges were the proto-punk of their day . Way to trash a historical document , guys .	-1
This is garbage because of one thing ... the production and mix are truly awful . It sounds like you are listening to this through a transister radio , underwater and 100 yards away . It was purposely recorded that way.This is 3 chord rock and there is nothing special about them . With other punk/garage bands , you heard the same chord progressions and time signatures infinite times but with better recordings.I like some of Iggy Pop 's material but I do not get it with this one . I know that this is regarded as a classic by a lot of critics I just do n't get it.You should stay away because I can not imagine anybody having repeated listenings of this .	-1
This is the worst piece of ... I 've heard in a long time . Heavily arranged pop cheese gathered on one disc . The players are good , the singer is good , but the tunes are pure cheese , while the players are held back from playing anything that 's actually musical . If Sade wants to be a jazz singer , she should try singing something with some meat in it , and learn to improvise , as well as let her musicians improvise and swing . This is smooth R & B at it 's elevator music blandest .	-1
In the day when I collected commercial music from my 1980s childhood , Sade , though they had only one hit ( `` Smooth Operator '' - which sounded to me back then like `` New Corporation '' ) in my native Australia , were one of the most mentioned artists in music advertisements . `` Smooth Operator '' I had always found enjoyable with its melodic , even haunting saxophone lines and seemingly interesting lyrics about travel across the United States . `` Your Love Is King '' and `` Hang On To Your Love '' had some truly beautiful - at least I would have though on hearing them on radio - vocals that completely overshadowed the lack of depth or fire in the backing . `` Jezebel '' and `` The Sweetest Taboo '' from Sade 's second album `` Promises '' were even slower but had proportionately more beautiful , even absorbing vocals.However , that is where it really starts to go downhill , for on later songs there is no way in which Sade Adu 's deep vocals can make up in any way at all for the lameness of her backing players . Most of the later songs really seem to stop , stop and start only in the most momentary way one could ever imagine . These songs really proved impossible for me to sit through them back in the middle 1990s when I bought this album , and I never have thought I would want to try . At times , even Sade Adu 's voice can seem a little soppy rather than deep.Apart from the early singles , there is nothing even listenable here even if the album is far less dated than most music of its type from the 1980s .	-1
Cryptic song titles , sludgey riffs , pained singing from thinly stretched vocals ... it must be an Alice in Chains CD . Yep , that 's the one.AIC do n't bring their A-game to the table on this self-titled disaster , except for a few key tracks : & quot ; Heaven Beside You & quot ; and & quot ; Again & quot ; are true keepers , the rest of the record is deplorable . Sadly , the only good record these guys ever made was 1993 's stellar & quot ; Jar of Flies , & quot ; an acoustic gem that broke AIC through to the big leagues of the music industry , where they always longed to be.Rumor has it these guys used to be a hair-band from the '80s . That 's abundantly clear from this mess of a record album CD . For true rock , check out Creed 'n ' Bush.THANKS A LOT FOR LISTENIN ' ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Just another run of the mill teenager depressing whine feat from AIC . Sucked then sucks now nothing special move on ... , .	-1
This contains one of the most boring songs ever , that I 'll say right now . That song is called `` Sludge Factory '' . Dear god , that song is awful ! I shudder when I hear the high-pitched singing at the start , the lyrics are pure uninteresting crap , and musically it 's just generic AIC . It 's a bad song ! Oh , and seven minutes of it ? Um , no . Wikipedia called it `` One of the more popular songs on the album '' or something like that , but whoever wrote it must 've been the kind of hardcore AIC fan who 'd give this mess of an album a 10 . And that 's not its only problem : there are a bunch of `` generic AIC '' songs on here : `` Shame in You '' ; `` Brush Away '' ; `` Head Creeps '' ; `` Nothin ' Song '' ; `` So Close '' and `` Frogs '' are all uninteresting melodically , do n't have anything new to say , run out of steam way before they end , and in fact make up 7/10th of my `` bottom 10 AIC songs '' list . You can also find `` Hate to Feel '' , `` Whale & Wasp '' and `` Love , Hate , Love '' on that list , if you were wondering , which I 'm sure you were n't . A couple songs do have some cathartic force ( `` Over Now '' ; `` Again '' ; `` Grind '' ) , `` Heaven Beside You '' makes for a great `` light-and-shade '' song , similar to Led Zeppelin 's `` Over the Hills and Far Away '' , but in a minor key , and `` God Am '' makes excellent use of synthesizers . But as a whole , this is one sad album . Kind of like that dog on the cover .	-1
What ever happened to these guys ? They were getting better with every album , then they put out this self-titled piece of garbage . It 's their fifth album , and yet its self-titled . Tell me if that makes sense . And the tinted color jewel case it comes in is pretty [ bad ] too , probably just a strategy to sell records since I 'm sure they realized the album sure was n't going to sell based on its quality.Anyhow , I do n't know why they even bothered , all the songs on here are weak . The only song I ever care to listen to is Heaven Beside You , and even that one is slightly flawed . Sludge Factory is the most aptly named song on the album because the title describes what it sounds like perfectly . The rest of the songs all sound exactly the same , I can barely even tell the difference . Facelift was kind of like that too , but it was n't so sludgy , so harsh on the ears . Plus all the harmonies that sounded so nice on Jar of Flies are just grating here . I think Layne 's addiction got in the way , I ca n't think of any other explanation for this disaster of an album . When he sings `` you 'd be well advised not to plan my funeral before the body dies '' it sounds horrible , I do n't know what 's up with his voice but I do n't like it the least.Anyhow , everyone laments AIC 's breakup but I 'm glad they did if the songs on this album were the direction they were heading in . Its a listenable album , but it takes a lot of effort , and its like why even bother when there 's a million better CDs out there .	-1
A couple of months ago , a jury was right on the money with their finding that Bolton unconscionably copied the Isley Brothers in his & quot ; creation & quot ; & quot ; Love is a Beautiful Thing & quot ; . This CD ( like all of his others ) makes clear that Bolton has shamelessly tried to copy a style of music , standards , melodies , and claim it for his own . But it becomes painfully obvious after about ten seconds listening that he can not .Every dime he ever gets close to for this drivel should go to musicians from as far back as some forty years ago from whom he stole.Want to hear this music actually performed the way it is supposed to be played and sung ? Purchase some Ray Charles , some Otis Redding , Al Green , Soloman Burke or Percy Sledge.Shamelessly derivative	-1
Michael Bolton , ( I first knew him mistakenly as Michael Dutton from a radio announcement ) was the singer behind a vast number of major hits that dominated commercial radio during the 1980s and 1990s . He first came to prominence with the sudden high entry of his version of `` Dock Of The Bay '' ( I used to sing it as `` Top Of The Bay '' ) onto the charts in 1988.In 1990 , Bolton began to dominate the airwaves with a vast string of hits , of which the upbeat songs like `` How Can We Be Lovers '' and `` Time , Love And Tenderness '' were rather painless to listen to though they certainly were extremely pompous , Bolton 's voice certainly appeared to convey some real emotion . They were also undeniably catchy and could bear hearing on commcercial radio.However , as time went by , Bolton moved onto softer and softer , airier and airier ballads that really did make his voice sound painful , grating , even tuneless . The early `` When A Man Loves A Woman '' is barely distinguishable from a version by Australian Jimmy Barnes but really has little tune , whilst the flyweight `` Said I Loved You But I Lied '' is even harder to listen to as Bolton mumbled through both verses and chorus in a way that ought never to impress . `` How Am I Supposed To Live Without You '' was more of the same , but the then-new tracks are just awful even compared to Bolton 's earlier output . There is not a single memorable hook in the new tracks , and Bolton 's voice , really best designed for hard rock or heavy metal , falters trying to sing a tune with any gentleness in it at all , yet alone such flyweight songs as these.Pleasant , yes , memorable , anything but . Look elsewhere for something that will keep you listening .	-1
what greatest hits ? upset stomach variety ? he ca n't sing.i wish he would stop trying to tarnish R-N-B music.doing dock of the bay ? you have to be kidding ? Bolton is a okay writer.but that straining gives me a headache.that 's not Soul that 's toneless for a whole Decade .	-1
The title of this review is to the fact that he butucherd on the dock of the bay but you probably allready know that . Boloton sounds like he is constipated when he sings . Actually every dead singer/or songwriter should do the same and also the still alive ones .	-1
Overall a boring album . Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music . Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy , bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she does n't do it very well . Her voice is irritating and constant moaning does n't help either . Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music . Obviously talented but this album is n't very good in my opinion .	-1
`` Sleep To Dream '' and `` Criminal '' are musically superb . The remainder of the album is filler .	-1
I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the & quot ; Nebraska & quot ; mode . My excitement turned to disappointment , however , as I listened and realized that there are no songs here close to the power of that album 's & quot ; Atlantic City & quot ; or & quot ; Johnny 99. & quot ; What you get instead is a lot of standard folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any transcendence . Bruce 's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star . This is a well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable of much better . Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street Band more evident .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , I enjoy Bruce Springsteen 's music very much . Many of Bruce 's other CD 's are filled to the brim with passion and emotion . However , this Ghost of Tom Joad CD leaves me very cold.There are twelve songs on this CD 's and they all seem to move at the same lethargic pace . The bleak tone surely does not help . On many of them it is extremely difficult to make out what Bruce is singing or more appropriately , mumbling.Worse yet are the songs themselves . Most if not all of these songs lack a good melody . Youngstown and the title track are the only ones which seem memorable after three listens . A few others catch me for a moment but then fade away due to an overly repetitive pattern and a strong lack of instrumental definition . The guitar playing is way too quiet that it barely adds any impression to the disc . The ocassional harmonica blasts are the only thing that keeps from dosing off from boredom.It 's not that I dislike it that Bruce decided to make another all acoustic recording . Whereas Nebraska was bleak and limited to a guitar/harmonica instrumental accompanyment , at least Bruce actually put some creative stylings into those songs . And each of those tunes moved at distinctive paces and several of them had strong melodies . The Ghost of Tom Joad on the other hand is dull , dismal , and boring .	-1
I do n't mind when artists challenge their fans with something unexpected . In fact , in 1982 Bruce Springsteen threw his fans a curve for the first time with NEBRASKA . Rather than object to a demo tape as an album , I listened to and appreciated NEBRASKA . Today I still consider NEBRASKA worthy of inclusion in Bruce Springsteen 's golden period , 1975 through 1987 . In those twelve years , every Springsteen album was a gem : BORN TO RUN ; DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ; THE RIVER ; NEBRASKA ; BORN IN THE USA ; and TUNNEL OF LOVE.I wish I could say the same about THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD , but it turned out to be the weakest in a series of Bruce Springsteen releases where he showed only glimpses of his old self . THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD 's songs just are n't memorable , except for `` My Best Was Never Good Enough '' and the title track . After realizing I had not even thought about playing THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD in several years , I sold my copy of it . I still have HUMAN TOUCH and LUCKY TOWN , the other releases comprising Springsteen 's post-1987 career , as each has at least several good tunes .	-1
This album isnt all that it is cracked up to be . For me there is only a couple of good songs on the album ( pony and holler ) .The rest of the songs are not anything amazing and frankly made me fall asleep . Im not saying its the worst album ive ever heard im just saying its one of the worst.Ok pony is a great song and the beat to it is tight but what the hells going on with the rest of the album . was he drunk when he released it ? The ladies probably love him because of his looks and his nice body but men can see right through that . Men dont get impressed by him takin his shirt off . The men actually look at the lyrics of the song and how well the song is presented and from a mans point of view it really is dreadful.If you want pony go and download it and dont bother buying the album . I made that mistake .	-1
The good news is that Kenny sings his heart out , obviously committed to this personal catharsis and his book THE UNIMAGINABLE LIFE . And the talent of the musicians is impeccable and near flawless . The bad news is that this late 90s effort finds Kenny sounding like every pop boys band out there -- N'Sync , Boys II Men , etc . Little of Loggins ' fun-loving persona shines through . The songs are n't that remarkable and they all overstay their welcome , most of them clocking in around 6 minutes average . The best tracks are more straight-forward and capitalize on the song 's strengths : ONE CHANCE AT A TIME and THIS ISLAND EARTH . While I 'm a firm believer that artists should stretch and explore new territories in their careers , there 's only so much African rhythms and ecological messages I can validate . I really like Kenny Loggins and recordings after this brought him back down to earth . If an artist is allowed a misfire , this is Loggins ' biggest .	-1
Jamiroquai 's & quot ; Travelling Without Moving & quot ; gets off to a great start ... then fumbles somewhere along the third track. & quot ; Virtual Insanity & quot ; is a great song with a awesome beat , insightful lyrics , and , if you 've seen it , a provocative video . & quot ; Cosmic Girl & quot ; is a funky , disco beat with great lyrics ( & quot ; Sends me into hyperspace when I see that pretty face & quot ; ) . But , when & quot ; Use the Force & quot ; starts , the album loses steam and plunges into boring R & amp ; B cliches and monotonous melodies.Songs like & quot ; Hard Times & quot ; reduce lyrics until the chorus is being repeated over and over again ( and it was n't very good to begin with ) . The two instrumentals sound like tracks from nature CDs ( the second being the better track ) . But , the thing that I ca n't understand is that the title track is NOT GOOD . When bands name an entire album after one song , that song is supposed to sound interesting , fun , and ... well , GOOD . But it has annoying car sound effects and an utter lack of cohesion . I do n't even think there are any verses in that song ! It 's a shame that two great songs should have to follow eleven tracks of & quot ; blah & quot ; . But , I 'm not giving up on Jamiroquai yet . After I write this review , I 'll be looking into their newest release & quot ; A Funk Odyssey & quot ; . Hopefully , it 'll sound better than & quot ; Travelling Without Moving & quot ; .	-1
Virtual Insanity was the jam here.cosmic girl was cool but this disc is downhill after that.Jamiroquai has moments here & amp ; there with the Stevie Wonder Influences but it does n't hold up .	-1
As Michael Jackson ventured on the second leg of the HIStory World Tour in 1997 , the EP Blood On The Dancefloor was released perhaps in order to capitalize on Jackson 's success in Europe . His HIStory album had experienced enormous success in Europe , yet America did not embrace the album as warmly as Europe had . Jackson 's popularity in Europe was cemented as the first single Blood On The Dancefloor reached no . 1 on the English single chart , while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe.Blood On The Dancefloor is mainly to be regarded as an EP or a remix album , consisting of 5 ordinary songs and 8 remixes . The title track and the first single Blood On The Dancefloor is a funky up-tempo song with a fusion of keyboard and teasing synthesizers . Despite being released as the opening single , the song was hardly among Jackson 's finest material . In fact , Blood On The Dancefloor even sounded dated in 1997 and it has certainly not aged very well . I always found that the song bore a resemblance to the Dangerous album in terms of sound . Perhaps the material on the Blood on the Dancefloor album was written for that particular album or during the same time period . However , the gruelling theme continues as the song Morphine reveals a character completely obsessed with the drug . The soft and hunting verses are a contrast to the sturdier choruses , yet surprisingly it works quite well . Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson 's attempt to simulate Prince ; however the repetitive , dull baseline is an unwelcome addition . Similar to the lead single , Superfly Sister suffers from the syndrome of dated-ness . Ghosts and Is It Scary are enjoyable songs ; however they are not among Jackson 's greatest works . Notably , Is It Scary is a lovely track especially due to the shift between the soft verses and the tougher choruses . I considered it the best song among the 5 ordinary songs on the album . The remaining 8 songs/remixes are a Tour De Force of dance remixes . Generally , I do not like remixes , however the remix of 2 Bad , Scream-Louder and HIStory are not half-bad . Yet the remixes of the remaining songs leave a lot to be desired.Blood On The Dancefloor is primarily an indulgence for hardcore Michael Jackson fans . The few ordinary songs are pleasant , however they are not on par with Michael Jackson 's back-catalogue . If you like remixes in generally , I am positive the remixes on the album would surely appeal to you . If you have recently discovered Michael Jackson 's music , I would advise you to purchase Number Ones or The Essential Michael Jackson in order to fully grasp the back-catalogue of Jackson.Overall Grade : 4.0/10	-1
It takes a fair bit of critical contortionism to declare this any kind of masterwork , especially considering it comes from a man with a few genuine classics under his belt . Despite popular opinion , Dylan 's lyrics here are uniformly horrid , travelling the short distance between trite and awkward with less flourish than your garden-variety Hallmark card . Melodically the songs are indistinguishable from one another , with Dylan 's cracked honk blending into the thick soup of Daniel Lanois ' ponderous soundscape until it sounds like one of Brian Eno 's ambient albums as mewled by a goat . I 'd actually prefer the goat . Do Dylan a favor and pick up a copy of & quot ; Blonde on Blonde & quot ; or & quot ; The Basement Tapes & quot ; or even & quot ; Love and Theft & quot ; instead of this over-praised steamer .	-1
... HE HAS TO SHOW HIS `` THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE '' FACE ON THE COVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! bob is no musical genius ( no `` O '' in genius , people ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before , put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying .	-1
I bought this based on rave reviews not long after it was first released . I played it twice and gave it away . I just do n't get it . I like his first three records , ( the acoustic folk and protest ones ) and `` Highway 61 Revisited '' and `` New Morning '' and a few others in his extensive catalogue , but the people who rave about `` Time Out of Mind '' and `` Blood on the Tracks '' are dwellers on a different planet . I found this one boring and bleak , personal but pointless .	-1
heres an interesting phenomenon that seems to repeat itself quite often , ancient singer enjoys well deserved comeback with catchy single , follows it up with an album that contains the hit single and a disappointing clutter of filler tracks. & quot ; practice what you preach & quot ; , the song that put barry back in the picture is here , and it is incredible , possibly the best song he ever recorded . the remainder of this album is dull , repetitve and unimaginative , and not worth hearing . in short , its awful . that pretty much sums it up.i 'd recommend the new double album , the & quot ; essential barry white & quot ; , for everything you need .	-1
Let 's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is . I will start by saying I did n't play the 30 second snippet for `` All I Want To Do '' because I knew it was already a lost cause , the rest were all just as bad . There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k . and they are `` Ca n't Cry Anymore '' , and `` We Do What We Can '' . I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge do n't be decieved . I do n't know what she 's like , or anything like that , but I do know she 's beautiful , but while talented it 's not the music I seek to listen to .	-1
I never buy an album on the basis of one song . When I hear two I like , however , I consider it . I ended up with this album because I liked 'Leaving Las Vegas ' , and especially 'All I Wan na Do ' . To my dismay , I found these two to be the only good songs on the album . The rest was either boring background music or just plain irritating . My interest in Sheryl Crow 's music ended after listening to this album . On the basis of only two songs , I ca n't reccomend the album to anyone , but maybe the 'All I Wan na Do ' single would be worth it .	-1
Once upon a time , there was an actual Tuesday Night Music Club . It was a group of guys who jammed together for fun . Sheryl Crow came along and joined the group . They made more music together . Sheryl went on to fame and fortune . The others did n't . That 's all I can type on this matter . It 's up to you to fill in the blanks !	-1
Got ta be a tie between Cheryl Crow and Dave Matthews for most overrated modern artist but when your responsible for one of the most putrid songs of all time like Strong Enough the crowns got ta go to Crow and any cd including that piece of garbage does n't deserve more than 1 star	-1
I confess to buying this one for that very reason when it first came out . A friend of mine once dismissed Sting with the phrase ; `` He gets in my face '' . I could n't be sure what he meant by that exactly , but my friend has a knee-jerk hostility to `` rock '' that is n't `` real rock'n'roll '' and Sting has a pride in his creativity that runs counter to just about every `` supposed to '' that says the rock singer who does n't emphasize his charisma and avoid the `` artsy '' is being a bit of a heretic . Ironic , when the First Commandment of rock used to center on defiance . I guess the difference lies in just what it is you defy . But there are times when Sting gets a bit unsubtle in the way he `` pays dues '' to the people who came before . Like the title track `` Fields Of Gold '' , which is lifted from his `` Ten Summoners ' Tales '' . That track is so derivative of Dylan 's `` My Back Pages '' that I caught myself singing along and inserting the Dylan line ; `` Aw but I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now '' , in a Sting vocal imitation .	-1
An acceptable summary of his solo career is 'Fields of Gold ' . Although , like most compilations , they have annoyingly remixed certain tracks such as 'We 'll Be Together ' . Who knows why they do that , it 's almost as if to say that the original was n't very good , but all Sting fans know that it was.I have the Australian version of this album which contains 'Love is the 7th Wave ' instead of 'Fortress Around Your Heart ' , a Portugese version of 'Fragile ' instead of 'They Dance Alone ' , and 'It 's Probably Me ' instead of 'Why Should I Cry For You ' . Not sure why they did that , as our replacements were n't any bigger hits here than they were abroad but I am more or less happy with the Aussie version . Sting has successfully made the transition from lead singer of the Police to solo artist . His music is , as others have sad , depressing at times but it has a unique feel about it . It is one of those albums that just wo n't date , and I will be playing it in the next 20 years.If you really like the original version of WE 'LL BE TOGETHER from 1987 , avoid this album at all costs . The remix is so inferior that it is an insult to fans .	-1
This album is n't great , and she always sounds the same through different songs . I do like the song she made a tribute to Janis though .	-1
If you want just one CD that gives you an overview of Joan Baez 's career and contains her greatest hits , well ... you wo n't find one . Her career has been too long and varied for that . She was at Woodstock and at Live Aid . She covered traditional English , Spanish and French folk songs , protest and mainstream pop.She currently has 46 albums to her credit , including 15 compilation albums . Newcomers to her music will assume that an album entitled Greatest Hits , which is her current best seller , is the best place to start . Unfortunately , it 's the worst.The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down was one of her finest songs ; I remember the excitement her version generated in the 70s . This album has a live performance which is a pale imitation of the studio version . Her voice is tired and slightly off-key , the backing is scrappy , the acoustics are poor and the tempo is a little too fast . A mess.She does a Dylan impersonation on one verse of his A Simple Twist of Fate . This might have been amusing at the time , and may still be to those in the know , but to newcomers it will be irritating and confusing . A mistake.One of her signature tunes is Amazing Grace , which she has performed better than anyone . At the 1985 Live Aid concert , she made the terrible mistake of saying the words before each verse , to encourage audience participation . Mercifully , the DVD of the concert cuts this short . So why , in the name of all that 's musical , does this album include a 1976 performance of her doing the same thing ? An embarrassment.All the tracks were recorded in the 70s ( 1972 - 1976 ) , by no means her 'Greatest ' era , nor her most representative . Simply , they are her years with A & M ; Records . They had the nerve to cobble these tracks together and call it a 'Greatest Hits ' . A smart marketing move but a shameful musical one.To add a positive note , the final track , Less Than the Song , is very fine . I guess you ca n't keep a good singer down.Joan 's is the finest female voice of the 60s folk revival and protest movement -- pure and melodious and true . As a child of the 60s , the album of hers that I remember best and which now seems most representative is her eponymous 'Joan Baez ' . If you are new to her music , start either with that album or with The First 10 Years . Both are great .	-1
This is more a complaint about the press release than the CD itself ( although I do believe that Baez , at her best , is trite ) . & # 34 ; Before Joan Baez , the closest thing to a female folk singer was Jo Stafford & # 34 ; . Huh ? Leaving Ronnie Gilbert of the Weavers aside for the moment , Carolyn Hester recorded & # 34 ; Scarlet Ribbons ' in 1957 , BEFORE & # 34 ; The Kingston Trio & # 34 ; , the album that precipitated the 60 's folk boom . She followed it in 1960 with the & # 34 ; Tradition & # 34 ; album and , in 1961 , her Columbia debut featuring Bob Dylan on harmonica , Bill Lee on Bass and Bruce Langhorne on guitar . Carolyn 's perfect soprano bell-like tones and Spanish-language folk songs were the obvious prototype for Baez 's uneven career.So , if you 're going to write a press release promoting someone , do n't make it so obviously fatuous !	-1
( ... ) Clapton 's heroin days definately produced more intersting results.I always hear masterful , understated , laid back , and assured when describing this album and to me it 's just a polite way of saying boring as hell , which is basically what every Clapton album after 461 Ocean Blvd . is . Slowhand is a middle aged persons excuse to say they are still rocking out when they are certainly smack in the middle of the road . Cocaine is one of the most overrated songs in the history of rock & roll . Two chords and a lackluster guitar solo . I 've seen bar bands look bored playing it . Wonderful Tonight is a song I would n't be surprised to see some aging crooner like Pat Boone cover . The ultimate wedding song , and it was Clapton 's plea to his wife to get her butt in gear and get going ! ! That in itself is kinda funny , but still a bit pathetic . Lay Down Sally is country rock with a nice guitar riff , one of the few redeeming songs on the record , but it was overplayed when this album was released . We 're All the Way is a straight country song written by Don Williams and played straight by Clapton , a glimpse of the direction he was heading . Core is probably the most rocking song on the album and the female vocals are top notch , but it goes slightly into jam band territory in what should have been a 3 minute song . The rest of the album is fairly pointless , as Clapton mauls Arthur Big Boy Crudup 's difinitive Mean Ol Frisco and just rests on his laurels on the remaining songs . Clapton was capable of much better than this MOR schlock , but he has never really recovered from the blandness of this album except when playing blues with others who demand more out him , like B.B . King .	-1
However , there 's always a first time , and this is it . I remember on Friday September 17 , 1982 was the first time I heard `` Stepping Out '' , and I hated it right then and there . It 's extremely melancholy , and I had a bad day at school with the kids laughing at me because I could n't read the blackboard in music class because I needed new glasses . I was still stewing over that , and then this song came on . To be honest I felt that Joe Jackson was going down hill in the 80 's as I enjoyed his first album `` Look Sharp '' in 79 , but in 1980 I heard `` Pretty Girls '' from the soundtrack of `` Times Square '' , and I sensed that he was going downhill fast . I kind of liked `` Breaking Us In Two '' , but not for long as it reeks of divorce , and leaves the woman cynical , and more proving herself to be manly and tough , and the guy is taken for everything , and left in holey underwear . I found the rest of this to be really horrible as with the first song `` Another World '' It starts out as a possible dance tune , but falls flat , and then goes downhill from there . I can only say that there was only one other album that could come close to a disaster as this , and that was Frank Zappa 's : '' Meets The Mothers Of Prevention '' . Girls and women may like this , and sensitive men , but I feel I can be sensitive , but I thouroughly hate this .	-1
First off , let me make something clear : The original Night & Day album is a classic , worthy of 5 stars on its own . The review here -- more to the point the 2 star rating -- is for this particular `` deluxe '' reissue.For the `` deluxe '' series of reissues , started by Universal a few years ago , a formerly single CD album is expanded to two CDs , with the second CD typically filled out some combination of outtakes , b-sides , live tracks or other material that was recorded in the same time-frame as the album . So far , so good . Some of these deluxe reissues has been great , some less so.This one falls distinctly into the latter catagory . Why ? The second CD of bonus material is simply a mugging . The contents of the second CD are as follows : 1 ) The vocal tracks from the Joe Jackson soundtrack to Mike 's Murder ; 2 ) The second side of the 2 LP ( 2CD ) Live 1980/86 set ; and 3 ) demo versions of six of the songs from the album . The Mike 's Murder tracks are OK , and it 's nice that they are finally available somewhere on CD , but they really do n't belong here ... they belong on a reissue of the Mike 's Murder soundtrack . The second side of 1980/86 is just a waste of time . These tracks were easily available on CD for many years as part of 1980/86 . Any serious fan -- and anyone buying this expensive set is presumably a serious fan -- already has this material.OK , that brings us to what , for many people , is the real hook : The six demo tracks . I wish I could say that they 're great , or that they at least shed some light on the finished album , or that they really bare repeated listening in any way . But they do n't . They are too close to the final album versions to be particularly interesting , and all are inferior to the completed album versions . Listen once , then file away.So in the end , the second CD consists of inessential froth , material available elsewhere , and material that should have been made available elsewhere . It 's sucker bait for the hardcore fan . Many of whom will probably bite , but few of whom will be happy they did.Unless you 're a completist , save your money and buy the single CD version instead.dap	-1
OK the listing is Cat Stevens - Tea for the Tillerman ( DVD ) and you 've started salivating . Sorry to have to inform you but it 's LIVE . The title is - A Classic Concert - Cat Stevens - Tea For The Tillerman Live . The information on the box is non-English ( Spanish ? ) but regardless it 's him and two other gentlemen performing to a small studio crowd . Front speakers only , maybe stereo . Video and sound meddlin ( fair ) at best , sadly nothing to get excited about . So unless you have to see and hear everything by Cat Stevens I would recommend passing on this one . The animated short film of the same title is also included . I believe the LIVE part has been deliberately not disclosed to sell this it to the unsuspecting .	-1
When you put a CD-Album or CD-R into a Mac or PC linked to the Net , it automatically seeks out the Gracenote Media Database to get the track list and classification details . If you 've already altered it before and are looking at it again - your computer recognizes the disc and any alterations you made - it remembers it - and shows you those details next time you put it in . Common practice all over the world for millions of music lovers using iTunes as a database ... So imagine my astonishment when I put in the 2008 supposedly new remaster of Cat Stevens ' `` Tea For A Tillerman '' into my computer after I 've unwrapped the shrink-wrap and up comes my OLD DISC with its altered details ! Why ? Because this is NOT an improved version as indicated on its packaging and in adverts , but the 2000 version all of us already have . The tracks timings are exactly the same ( 36:46 minutes ) and there is NO NEW REMASTER.And if that 's not bad news enough - when I opened the other Cat Stevens DELUXE EDITION `` Teaser And The Firecat '' which I also bought this morning - it 's NOT CHANGED EITHER . They are exactly the same as the old versions - NEITHER is any improvement to discs you can purchase on line for peanuts.When I then turn to the packaging and booklet to find an explanation , there are three references to 'remaster ' - first is on the sticker , second is Page 7 of the booklet which tells you it was 'recently ' remastered by Ted Jensen ( no date ) and last on Page 27 which again mentions his name ( but again no date ) . It slyly and deliberately does n't mention `` when '' it was done ... in short , this is an old disc masquerading as a new one and is deliberately deceptive about it.But there 's worse - I bought this DELUXE EDITION of Tillerman on the strength of a track on the recent 3CD Island Folk-Rock Box set `` Meet On The Ledge '' . Track 2 on Disc 2 is Tillerman 's `` On The Road To Find Out '' which has been given a 2009 remaster by DENIS BLACKHAM - and the sound is ASTONISHING - a huge improvement over the 2000 version . When you hear how good this 'whole ' album could have sounded , it makes this deceptive lazy rip-off even more difficult to stomach.Disc 2 does n't make up for much either ( 36:49 minutes ) . While the bonus tracks on `` Teaser '' ( see separate review ) are excellent , these are n't . Admittedly there is two indispensable gems on here for fans - the demo versions of `` Wild World '' and `` Miles from Nowhere '' - they 're beautiful . But the rest of the live tracks are poor man 's filler . Any why were n't these demos put on the initial release in 2000 in the first place ... I do n't know to what level Yusef was involved in this , but it is surely not in keeping with his beliefs or commitment to his fans to have this rip-off in the marketplace . The DELUXE EDITIONS of `` Tillerman '' and its companion `` Teaser '' should be withdrawn by UNIVERSAL and replaced with proper 2009 remasters.What a disappointment and what a bad taste left in the mouth ... AVOID .	-1
Taking an artistic risk is typical for Joe Jackson , an artist who refuses to be placed in a category . But BLAZE OF GLORY does not work for me . Starting with the anthem `` Tomorrow 's World '' which sounds like something Starship would do , Jackson constantly reaches for a grand statement about life and the pain and joy that touches us all , but through a number of curious musical choices the theme falls flat . Bouncing around from pop to jazz to Greek influenced instrumental ( ? ) , the music lacks the focus to move the story forward . I ended up being more distracted by the music then being moved by it . The songs are also designed to lead from one to another which will also lead to a jarring dissonance . Lyrically the anger and pain is well expressed but there is a sense of `` heard this before '' that kept me from wholeheartedly following along . Even the title track is strangely reminiscent in theme to a number of other `` Burned out before they fade away '' songs . I can see by some of the other reviews that this CD has touched others deeply , but I found myself unmoved by the trials and tribulations within .	-1
In a nutshell , pleasant yet awful . The overuse of sythesizers really detracts from the music ; the production hides her voice , though that may well have been intentional . As her production and synthesizer went more pop from 1983+ , her vocal abilities seems to have declined in kind . Deliberately ? The irritating evolution of her voice since 1981 may have been a stylistic choice , a change of feel , to match the increasingly processed pop sound of her '80s releases.Two tracks on this project do stand out , though : The rocker feeling of `` You 're Not Alone , '' and a mild almost feminist theme , `` Hats , '' which is the most intriguing song on the album . `` Hats '' suggest a far more personal recording and bears repeated listening . It suggests spunk , grit , opinion , something generally missing/buried in the formulaic nature of Amy 's gradual distancing from her earlier music . Otherwise , though , I 'm reminded of that shock I had hearing David Lee Roth bellowing over the repetitive synth riff on `` Jump '' when Van Halen Welked .	-1
Go and buy soundgarden 's other album & quot ; superunknown. & quot ; This album has & quot ; outshined & quot ; on it and that is about it for songs that you can actually listen to on this album . The other cuts are n't even worth mentioning . Their second album & quot ; superunknown & quot ; is ten times better because you can at least listen to it from time to time .	-1
i like the music but the lyrics are not so good . i wonder why they make this kind of stuff !	-1
This disc , along with the rest of the domestic Pie CD releases , are still the same crappy , 35+ year old , vinyl-EQ 'd masters , which all sound like music emanating an AM radio : No bottom , no definition , no soundstage , nothing . *** HOWEVER ***On 2/14/07 , Universal Japan released the entire Humble Pie A & M ; catalog , plus the `` Marriott '' solo album , in remastered , mini-sleeve packaging.These remasters are GLORIOUS . It 's so great to FINALLY be able to hear all these great tracks the way the band recorded them.The initial production run of the five central Pie titles ( Humble Pie , Rock On , Performance , Smokin ' & Eat It ) have already sold out in Japan , so do n't delay in getting yours ! Four of the five Japanese remasters are now the audio benchmarks for these titles : The 2006 UK Repertoire version of the third album , `` Humble Pie '' , definitely has more clarity than the Japanese version , especially in the drums.Perhaps now , Universal U.S. will get up off its lazy collective a** and make these fabulous remasters available.Until that day , grab the Japanese CD 's before they 're gone , as all mini-sleeve CD 's are limited edition.Link to the2007 Japanese remaster.WHAT IS A JAPAN `` MINI-LP-SLEEVE '' CD ? Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century 's great art forms , the 12 '' vinyl LP jacket ? Then `` mini-LP-sleeve '' CD 's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license . The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album . Also , anything contained in the original LP , such as gatefolds , booklets , lyric sheets , posters , printed LP sleeves , stickers , embosses , special LP cover paper/inks/textures and/or die cuts , are precisely replicated and included . An English-language lyric sheet is always included , even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then , there 's the sonic quality : Often ( but not always ) , mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering ( 20-Bit , 24-Bit , DSD , K2/K2HD , and/or HDCD ) , and can often ( but not always ) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world . There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an `` obi '' ( `` oh-bee '' ) , a removable Japan-language promotional strip . The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release , the catalog number , the mastering info , and often the original album 's release date . Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi , maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork . The obi 's are collectable , and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition , but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common ( again , not always ) . The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered , however , with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world , primarily on eBay . They are inferior in quality , worthless in collectable value , a total waste of money , and should be avoided at all costs .	-1
Ca n't recall why the hype is there for this group as the live sound does not carry over into anything that I would want to hear on the radio or in concert .	-1
Live in Europe , Adams ' set includes all his hits up to 1988 ( & quot ; Cuts Like A Knife & quot ; & quot ; Summer of 69 & quot ; etc . ) Adams is an engaging live performer , but like most live sets this one is for fans only . It makes for a nice keepsake for the fan that wants to have an audio memory of an Adams ' concert , but it does n't quite capture the energy and charisma of Adams on tour .	-1
Although the band is very competent , there is something strange in this album . The performances lack energy ; maybe it 's the lack of overdubs , and this is how a live album should sound , I do n't know ... But it 's only for completists .	-1
With the exception of Yes , Steely Dan is generally the closest I come to prog-rock . So if you think I do n't really know the genre , you 're right . However , I feel this is overblown and pretentious . Granted , all that ca n't stop Nights In White Satin from being an incredibly powerful , lovely piece ( other than the crappy stoner poem at the end ) . But even then , it does n't strike me like the work of Yes ( specifically Close to the Edge and Starship Trooper ) . The rest is overblown and endless , especially all eight-and-a-half minutes of the aptly-titled Forever Afternoon . If you 're looking for grade `` A '' prog-rock , go with Yes .	-1
I could n't believe my ears . The harmony on the last part of `` Tuesday Afternoon '' is missing ! Whoever remastered this from the original tapes FORGOT to mix in all the tracks and it sounds hollow . How incredibly annoying . The only way you 're going to hear the real music is to turn on your record player and play the old vinyl . Maybe the SACD CD was remastered correctly , but the AAD CD was NOT .	-1
This album is one of the Moody Blue 's milestones , a symphonic progressive rock album.But BEWARE - Amazon sells two different MP3 versions of this particular DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED album . A cheaper $ 5 version , and a more expensive $ 9.49 album.The cheaper version only contains the first seven tracks of the original album ; it does not have the remaining tracks , numbered 8 through 7 . And missing is their classic TUESDAY AFTERNOON.So beware - if you 're looking for the complete album , do not buy the cheaper version ! NOTE : I gave this one star so people would know that they could be shortchanged if they buy the cheaper version .	-1
Well shame on the people involved in this `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' project . Oh , maybe that 's a little harsh.First off , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the sound has been aggressively compressed , which means , by the time you 've reached the later stages of the album , you may experience some ear fatigue . The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix . A sign of over compressing . Has the whole music industry gone compression nuts ? Or , were the Moody Blues simply worried that their back catalogue ( the big 7 ) was lacking in musical muscle , and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer ? Or both ? On the EQ front , there 's some added EQ to the bass and kick drum , giving me a whole new appreciation for the Moody Blues rhythm section . This `` intense '' re-mastering really benefited the `` Dear Diary '' thru `` To Share Our Love '' section of the album , which is usually , my least favorite part . So it 's not all bad . In fairness , their albums always did lack a bit , in the bottom end , but now they don't.One more thing about aggressive compression , this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 album `` Who Do We Think We Are . '' By the time I got towards the end , my ears were tired . So , recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression , and it not only sounded better , but my ears were n't tired by the end . But , since the Moodies do n't play as loud as Purple , it should n't be a problem . Now that I got that off my chest ... Secondly , the `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' bonus track enticement , just ticks me off to no end . Sure , there are some good rare tracks here . The BBC stuff is very nice to hear for the long time fan who only know these songs one way . But , the first five bonus cuts may take away some of the mystery of the album . It 's like when watching `` the making '' of a movie , and it just takes away the magic if you will , at least for me.Thirdly , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover ! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded ! But , the booklet is really nice , with many color photos , insightful stories and lots of studio information.In conclusion , after hearing a number of these `` SACD Deluxe Editions , '' I 'll be keeping my old ( 1997 ) re-masters , after all , they still look and sound great . But now I have two versions of each album , great , just what I needed ? !	-1
When compared to 'In search of the lost chord ' and 'To our children 's childrens children , this release falls way short on both performances and sound quality . A few good songs but not enough to recommend it . Despite being remastered , the sound is not that much improved : very little high end and an overall 'thin sound ' . 13 tracks/37.06 .	-1
Just so you know where I 'm coming from , I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era . Also , some of the material I 've heard from 1981-1999 is good ( if formulaic ) , but I am less familiar with it . With that said , the Moodies hit their lowest point with `` Every Good Boy Deserves Favour '' and `` Seventh Sojourn '' . The only song on `` Every Good Boy '' that I enjoy is Justin Hayward 's excellent rocker `` The Story in Your Eyes '' . I award two stars to this album just because it contains this song . The other songs are either plodding and dull or sticky sweet , comparable only to the very worst of their prior material . If you are exploring the early Moodies ' music , do yourself a `` favour '' and try any of their first five albums ( see my other reviews for details ) . You will find rock that really rocks , and beautiful music that is fresh and original .	-1
What ? They do n't have a Lite Rock or Classic Rock radio station where you live ? Why else would you need to buy this CD ? Every song on here is an easy listening hit . But just because you have heard them all before , does n't make the songs good.Sure , other reviewers will tell you that this is the top selling album ever , or some such line . But that is still no reason to buy it . That just means you probably know several people who already own it . Buy something else ! Greatest Hits are for housewives and little girls ! These songs are mostly just boring schmaltz that somehow manages appeal to the lowest common denominator of Yuppies and Rednecks alike . And what is the deal with all of the & quot ; ooh oooh & quot ; and & quot ; whoa oh & quot ; ? All 10 songs feature someone ( lead or background ) singing & quot ; ooh oooh & quot ; and/or & quot ; whoa oh & quot ; ... It is not quite as noticeable on & quot ; Desperado & quot ; , which by the way , is just about the wussiest outlaw song in the history of music . The best thing about it was a funny bit on Seinfeld about a guy who was way too into the song.You like country rock ? Try the Byrds , Steve Earle , Uncle Tupelo , Old 97 's , Wilco , Son Volt , the Flying Burrito Brothers , the Bottle Rockets , Neko Case , the Jayhawks , the Waco Brothers , Robbie Fulks , Lucinda Williams , the Band , anything else . There is no prize for being the one billionth person to buy the Eagles Greatest Hits .	-1
Turns out everyone who bought a copy of this album made a major mistake . Thankfully , that mistake can be fixed . All you got ta do is return your copy to whatever record story you bought it at and ask for your money back.Now what about the music ? Well , I gave it one star , so that should be a sign it sucks . Any album with Witchy Woman , Desperado , Peaceful Easy Feeling , Lyin ' Eyes , Take it To the Limit , Best of My Love and One of These Nights would be worth one star already , but they lose even more points by ruining a great Jackson Browne song ( Take It Easy ) . Skip this .	-1
Everything this band ever released was horrible . Fooled by the masterpiece tune & quot ; HOTEL CALIFORNIA & quot ; , I went out to buy a compilation from them . Uau ! ! awful . & quot ; HOTEL CALIFORNIA & quot ; is a thousand miles ahead of all other songs they ever wrote , in terms of sheer quality . THe rest is a bunch of cheesy and souless music . The only merit is the drummer who can sing , which is very rare . Blergh !	-1
I 'm sorry , but in my opinion , The Eagles were mediocre until Joe Walsh joined the band . & quot ; Hotel California & quot ; is and always will be their best work and easily deserves five stars , but this is a boring collection of dull songs . Why even buy it ? Gee whiz , just turn on your favorite classic rock radio station and within several hours , it 's likely that you will hear most of these songs . Classic rock radio is over rated , too , but that 's going off the subject . Unless you love early Eagles , save your money or spend it on & quot ; Hotel California & quot ; ( 5 stars ) & quot ; The Long Run & quot ; ( 4 stars ) or & quot ; Eagles live & quot ; ( 4 stars but a must own for & quot ; Seven Bridges Road. & quot ; )	-1
Let me start by saying that I have known this recording intimately since it was first released . I still have a mint LP copy and the first release of this on CD from 1984 ( solid puuple Elektra silkscreen CD label ) . So like any audio enthusiast I bought this `` remastered '' edition ( I also bought the Dec 2005 remastered Japan version in the mini-LP ... read that review as well ) . In a word : disappointment.Credit Bill Szmyczyk for creating a great ( if somewhat muffled ... and maybe that was the intent ) recording to begin with . The ONLY thing this new incarnation brings to the table is a much louder volume . There is NO sonic revelation , there is NOT a replication of the original complete artwork , there is NO indication on the actual inserts that this is a remastered edition . The only indication is a black sticker on the shrinkwrap . So if you have any of the CD versions out there , DO NOT PITCH THEM TO BUY THIS ONE ... you will be disappointed .	-1
After over three years of no new Eagles product , Don Henley , Joe Walsh and company finally released & # 65533 ; The Long Run & # 65533 ; to long awaiting fans . In that interim between Eagles albums Joe Walsh released a solo album & # 65533 ; But Seriously Folks & # 65533 ; ( which might as well have been an Eagles album ) and probably a lot more bickering between the Eagles.The music industry went through a couple of upheavals as well . Disco music had saturated the market and was about to be blown apart by the Punk Rock crowd ( who were aiming their guns at Heavy Metal and Progressive Rock as well ) to wipe the slate clean. & # 65533 ; The Long Run & # 65533 ; ( released late in 1979 ) hits at that awkward moment at the cusp change and includes both some disco and punk elements . I would like to say that this last Eagles studio album was a stellar collection of songs . It would be nice & # 65533 ; it would be right . It would be proper for a swan song.But such is not the case . While the title track has an attractive syncopated beat and guitar work with Don Henley putting the challenge and defiance to critics & # 65533 ; If we can go the distance we & # 65533 ; ll find out in the long run & # 65533 ; , there is too much sameness about the results here.Tracks like & # 65533 ; Disco Strangler & # 65533 ; and & # 65533 ; Sad Caf & eacute ; & # 65533 ; sound too much like each other . And there is dullness when there is supposed to be excitement . & # 65533 ; Heartache Tonight & # 65533 ; kicks off with a loudly played guitar riff and decent slide guitar work throughout . But there is nothing distinctive about it . In fact it sounds tired , worn out , pedestrian . & # 65533 ; Heartache Tonight & # 65533 ; best exemplifies what is wrong with the whole album . It & # 65533 ; s just plain old dull . Give the people what they expect with no surprises , no discoveries and no bonuses.Some Punk elements are thrown in to spice things up with the speedy Farfisa organ dirge & # 65533 ; The Greeks Don & # 65533 ; t Want No Freaks & # 65533 ; . It was enough to add interest to the album in a campy sort of way , but little else.By far the best track on the whole album is the hit & # 65533 ; I Can & # 65533 ; t Tell You Why. & # 65533 ; It & # 65533 ; s a gorgeous soul ballad with a good melody with neat guitar lines . The muted guitar lines during the long fadeout really make the case for this song.So was Don Henley right ? Did the Eagles make it in the long run ? What did they prove ? They started out trying to be the world & # 65533 ; s greatest rock n roll band . When things got rough , they enlisted an already established ace guitar player , Joe Walsh ( who actually was already putting out better material than the Eagles ) as a & # 65533 ; bona fide & # 65533 ; member . It worked for one album but ended up creatively bankrupting Joe Walsh , Don Henley and the rest of the Eagles.So , instead of it being called & # 65533 ; The Long Run & # 65533 ; , they should have taken a cue from Monty Python and called it & # 65533 ; Our Contractual Obligation Album & # 65533 ; because it really sounds like the Eagles going through the motions and really didn & # 65533 ; t want to be with each other .	-1
The late seventies Eagles were a been there , seen that , done that type of band . A southern California band that was disillusioned with the SoCal and Hollywood lifestyle . If the band were doing tons of coke all the time , it does n't show in this album ( or they were recording on mornings after ) because the playing on this album is lethargic . The songs could have been very strong , but the band sounds bored with them . Every song sounds like it should be speeded up a beat or two and everyone sounds like they are playing behind that beat . The songs drag on too long and the band takes itself too seriously to be enjoyed . Even their one attempt at humor ( Greeks Do n't Want No Freaks ) falls flat , but it is only song on the album where the band does n't sound like they were playing while laying on the couch . Even Joe Walsh could n't save this one and the band 's break-up was probably the best move to make . Still , the talent within the band is/was indisputable and there are several listenable tracks here , especially I Ca n't Tell You Why which showed the shape of things to come for Don Henley who seemed to care a lot more when it was his name alone on the album cover . In the City was a remake of a song Joe Walsh did for a movie ( the Warriors , I think , but I could be mistaken ) and it pales next to Joe 's solo version . Heartache Tonight , while a big hit , seemed like an attempt to return to the Eagles early sound , but ended up an overplayed AM radio anthem . Teenage Jail was the albums `` hard rock '' song and just sounds very slow and tired , a minute and a half into it , you just wish it would end . The Eagles put out some great music in their lifespan , but this , their last full studio album , was n't it . For some great Eagles music get the earlier albums like Across the Border , where they actually sound like they are interested in what they are doing .	-1
The Eagles were itching to move on with their solo careers , and that is quite visible from this album . It seems like a pile of songs just thrown together without too much thought . There are some real disappointments on this album such as 'These Shoes ' ( incredibly boring ) , and 'Greeks dont want no freaks ' . 'In the City ' is okay but perhaps misplaced . The album 's highlights include 'I Ca n't Tell you Why ' and 'King of Hollywood ' . Naturally it is hard to follow up a masterpiece such as 'Hotel California ' . The fact that I hardly play this album anymore proves that .	-1
The first two Cars cds , were well produced , tight on the playing , and the songs were well written . This cd is just the opposite . The songs , are not great , most are average , and their are no stand outs . The production is muddled , and the playing this time out is not as tight as before . The songs are n't all bad . & quot ; Panorama & quot ; , Touch and Go & quot ; , both rock , and have a great bass line running thru them . & quot ; Down Boys & quot ; , and Do n't tell Me No & quot ; , have potenial , and & quot ; you Wear Thoses Eyes & quot ; , could really have been a hit , but the production almost kills them . Rest of the songs are not much , just filling space . The singing this time out is more raw , like the playing , it 's not the polished sound , that they had before . Buy one the greatest hits , and skip this one .	-1
Panorama is the Cars third album , in three years . While it looks like many fans do enjoy Panorama , the album does n't really do anything for me . `` Touch and Go '' was a minor hit , and I did n't even really care for that song , most of Panorama sounds bland to me . For the hardcore fans only !	-1
Apparently , she went into the studio with an acoustic guitar & Jaco Pastorius & not much else . There 's one great track called OFF NIGHT BACKSTREET , which includes a fun recurring appearance of Jaco 's high-register bass-pings . The title track is a mediocrity that uses a glissando bass-pulse . At the end of the title track , Joni threw in some background singing . Too little too late . The title track would 've been a lot more interesting if it had contained her background singing all the way thru it . TALK TO ME is a pretty good song lyric . Unfortunately there 's no tune attached to it . Which raises the obvious question : is TALK TO ME deliberately tuneless for the purpose of expressing the desperation of the narrator ?	-1
It 's been a while since I bashed the Eagles , so I thought I 'd get back in action . Anyway ... Three of the most annoying Top 5 ihts of the '70 's can be found on this disc : the title track , a crappy uptempo/pseudo-dance song that 's even more annoying than Hotel California ; the brainless Lyin ' Eyes ; and especially the sophoric , overly-orchestrated Take it To the Limit . I do n't know how ANYBODY can put up with this group , but if I hear one more Eagles hit on the radio ...	-1
So Jackson , who was clearly listening to a lot of Bob Dylan records at the time , decided he wanted to be like a certain critically acclaimed , commercially successful living legend/cynical street poet with a really bad voice - only with a considerably better voice ( technically speaking , anyway ) and soft-rock instrumentation . Really , he only blew it on one count . Too bad that count was he did n't have the talent of Dylan 's elbow . He tackles weighty topics - depression , suicide , drug addiction , apocalypse - but he does n't say anything too revealing about any of them , and we wind up with several spare piano and acoustic guitar ballads that are lifeless and unoriginal , if earnest ( `` For Adam '' , `` My Opening Farewell '' , `` A Child in These Hills '' , et al ) . But he doe nail a couple of these : `` Jamaica Say You Will '' is a lovely ballad that 's been covered by just about everybody ; the piano-driven , pessimistic `` Doctor My Eyes '' is probably my favorite of Jackson 's songs , and actually is pretty good as far as Dylan knock-offs go ; and `` Rock Me on the Water '' is enjoyably apocalyptic . Now if the rest were n't so turgid , we 'd have a classic on our hands .	-1
I ca n't for the life of me , understand that there 's only one sub four star review on this crappy album . `` Desperado '' is one of my favorite EAGLES songs , but one great song does n't an album make . I sold this to a used cd store a couple of years ago , and I ca n't say I miss it that much . I have the song `` Desperado '' recorded on cassette , and I have the `` Eagles Live '' on cd , so no problem . This is definitely the handsdown worst studio release in the EAGLES discography . `` On the border '' is only slightly better than this one . `` One of these nights '' is their final one with Bernie Leadon and is their best effort , so stick with that one instead of `` Desperado '' .	-1
Yes , this is the great PBBB 1st album ( actually , the 2nd , see below ) , but it 's not the CD you should be buying.This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.The import 2CD version of this title ( backed with the PBBB 's 2nd album `` East West '' ) is the one to get . It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.Ditto for `` Pigboy Crabshaw '' & `` In My Own Dream '' ; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered ( and sounds incredible ) and the domestic CD 's are not.Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.Do n't waste your money on these inferior versions : Get the imports ! Also : Do n't miss the `` Original Lost Elektra Sessions '' CD , which was the real first PBBB album , recorded before this one . There is some fabulous music on that CD , and the liner notes by Paul Rothchild are worth the price alone .	-1
Some songs are good , but most of them are not . I just do n't like it .	-1
Previously the Eagles ' success baffled me , but I think I 've got it figured out now : they brought the right stuff ( dull pointless pedestrian soft-rock ) to the right place ( California ) at the right time ( the '70s ) . Their continued popularity today is probably more out of nostalgia and/or peer pressure ( `` How can you NOT like them ? '' say the fans . `` Greatest Hits 1 is the biggest-selling album ever ! If you do n't like the biggest selling album ever , you do n't have good taste ! '' ) than anything else.But what 's the music like ? Well , I 've heard the band themselves hated this album . I hate it too . For one , there 's the ' '' legendary '' `` Hotel California '' . A # 1 hit like anything else they put out at a certain point . But it 's embarrassing . Every element that gets praised even today is an element of it I dislike - I see the syncopated reggae rhythms as this forced , `` Look at us , we can do REGGAE ! We 're DIVERSE ! '' thing ; the lyrics as either pretentious ( `` We stabbed the beast with steely knives '' ) or unintentionally hilarious ( `` You can check out anytime you want , but you can never leave '' - what is this , the roach motel ? ) , and the famed guitar duel near the end puts me out like no anesthetic ever could . And if Don Henley is ever picked as the voice of rock 'n ' roll over Mick Jagger , Roger Daltry or John Fogerty , that will be the day I stop listening to rock 'n ' roll . At least it is n't bad as their other attempt at reggae , `` New Kid on the Block '' , another # 1 hit ( god , did these guys have a payola deal going ? And while I 'm conspiracy theorizing , they probably locked up all the executives of the Billboard charts in their basement and played them their music until they agreed to move their records up to # 1 ) .But wait - there 's more ! The addition of Joe Walsh somehow convinced the Eagles that they were a sleazy boogie-rock band , like ZZ Top ! Only they saw themselves as too smart to right about tube snakes and pearl necklaces and girls with legs who knew how to use them . No , instead they gave us their takes on either the frailty ( `` Heartache Tonight '' ; `` Victim of Love '' ) or longevity ( `` The Long Run '' ) of love ; cliched damming of rock-star life ( `` Life in the Fast Lane '' ) . Problem is , they ca n't play boogie-rock ; the vocals are painfully oversung , and the band sounds stiff and awkward . `` Heartache Tonight '' ( or `` Headache Tonight '' , take your pick ) is especially painful , though all four of 'em are disgraces.And can they write a memorable lyric that has not , in fact , been beaten into the ground ? Glad you asked . No is the answer to that question . Let 's count the songs that pretty much do the same thing as `` The Sad Cafe '' ; `` I Ca n't Tell You Why '' and `` After the Thrill is Gone '' . Let 's see ... . one , two , three , four ... 9.5x10^28 , 9.6x10^28 , 9.7x10^28 ... This right here is a fine example of why sometimes you ca n't trust the masses . The fact that George W. Bush was elected for two terms in office was another example . This might 've sounded great in the '70s - I was n't around back then , I would n't have a clue - but the music of the Eagles has aged like cream cheese . Oh yeah , they 've got a new album out . You know what that means , right ? That means I will never turn on the radio again as long as Don Henley , Glen Frey , Timothy B. Schmidt , Don Felder , Joe Walsh , Randy Meisner , and Bernie Leadon live . At least Felder , Meisner and Leadon had the good sense to jump ship . Wait , wait , their music was n't any better with them on board . Never mind .	-1
I am not a fan of the band , I have listen to this cd a couple of time and I am not very pleased with it . There is just a couple of good tracks , not enough for me to keep this cd . I will use it as a gift for somebody who will listen to it , because I wo n't if I keep it .	-1
THis band has a lot of greta songs , but none of them is even closer to the sheer quality of & quot ; HOTEL CALIFORNIA & quot ; . That 's why they keep on releasing compilation after compilation featuring the EAGLES . Blergh ! !	-1
This `` audiophile '' gold CD is ruined by the `` mastering engineer '' Steve Hoffman 's decision to ignore the original pacing , presention and intent by the band and producer Mutt Lange by adding unnecessary gaps between the songs.On the original LP , tape and CD , the songs flowed without interruption.Secondly , the HDCD ( means `` high-definition CD '' ) encoding causes audible popping and clicking sounds at the end of each song.And lastly , the sound is n't even that much improved over the old 1980 's CD which you can buy for only $ 6.99-7.99 at most retail outlets.Do n't waste your money on this bastardaztion of an 1980 's rock classic , which get 5 stars in its original CD form .	-1
Ignore the people who call this commercial ? Why ? It is commercial dreck and shame on the Cars for making it . By this point the Cars were poising themselves to be multi-platinum superstars and they suceeded big time with thier music suffering . The first three releases ( & quot ; The Cars & quot ; , & quot ; Candy-O & quot ; and & quot ; Panorma & quot ; ) I would highly recommend to see what the Cars were all about . But hey , if you like over processed , slicker than oil , calculated , derivative , drab pop music , this release is for you .	-1
I remember when You Might Think , the first song off the Cars ' new album made itself known - it was upbeat , but completely overshadowed by its groundbreaking video that set new standards . The problem with that was , it was easy for the video to distract from the fact that the song was a bit fluffy , for a group that made its name by vowing `` there 's no mistaking rock and roll '' . By now the Cars sound has lost just about everything that made it unique , and gone from having lots of odd sounding synths to having too many ordinary sounding ones . It was the starkness of their songs that made a single lead stand out , as compared to layers upon layers of generic sweeping pads and little bell sounds . It still has Rik Ocasek 's odd voice , but instead of amusing , wry humor , the emphasis is slickness and a certain smugness . This album has a terrifically produced sound , it set new standards for musical precision , and there are some well written songs , like 'Hello Again ' ( which contains a lot of the old Cars humor and energy ) and the title track . Songs like 'Magic ' and 'You Might Think ' are instantly catchy , but do n't really merit repeated listenings . 'Drive ' is a nice ballad , it 's nothing TOO amazing but it avoids a lot of the traps that made other ballads of the time ( like Chicago/Peter Cetera 's ) so bad . This is n't bad music by any means , like the Moody Blues ' Other Side of Life , it is elegantly put together , but the soul 's gone . I guess the guys just got older and were n't as peppy and intense into the music anymore . And one last thing , the album cover is pretty terrible . What a confusing jumble of car parts and body parts ( and interestingly , a two-star rating ) . Their other covers you could UNDERSTAND what you were looking at .	-1
Sorry , but the only thing this album does well is get on my nerves . The only saving grace is Rock and a Hard Place , which gives us a glimpse of things to come on Floodland . Very simply , the whole album runs together in a liquid slur of wheezing noises . Hard to dance to and harder to listen to . Pass on this one and go straight to Floodland , the real masterpiece .	-1
Slamming America , this is a give-a-way cd now .	-1
With the exception of a few tracks , this CD mostly consists of noise , dissonance , and screaming . Definitely better than nu-metal , but still not something I listen to on a regular basis . It 's not bad if I 'm in a really grouchy mood and need to let off a little steam .	-1
First my biases so you know where I 'm coming from : I 'm not really into the `` club music '' scene though I do enjoy some dance pop . While I can appreciate that the groove is `` # 1 '' in dance music , I still want lyrics with some amount of depth to them and an actual melody ( which is why I avoid techno ) .ITEM # 1 : The groove . Deee-Lite manages this in spades thanks to the use of samples , horns and other items outside of strict electronics to beef up the sound . Lady Miss Kier is n't the fiery vocalist someone like Black Box 's Martha Wash is , but she 's competent if not exciting.ITEM # 2 : Lyrical depth . This is where most dance pop fails and in this Deee-Lite is not immune . The words to some of these are appalling and in some cases skeletal to the extreme ( `` What is Love ? '' is probably the prime example . ) ITEM # 3 : Melody . The tunes here for the most part tend to have a reasonable amount of melody . In fact , I 'd say the music often is the best part of the package.HIGHLIGHTS : Far and way , the best track here is the sole chart hit `` Groove is in the Heart '' which pulsates with energy from front to back and brings an instant smile to my face whenever I hear the `` we 're going to dance..and have some FUN '' sample and the memorable bass and bongo lick that introduces it . No other tune here manages as much outright soulful danceability along with nifty cameos from Bootsy Collins and rapper Q-Tip . Outside of that sparkling hit , the 2 that best stay with you are `` E.S.P . `` , an ode to the power of the disc jockey ( `` Wo n't you listen to what the DJ 's spinning ? /He 's tapping into just what you 're feeling '' ) and `` Who Was That ? `` , as Miss Kier ponders the identity of the trespasser who noshed some peanut butter and indulged in a bubble bath before skipping out . It 's playful and would have been the logical followup single to `` Groove.. '' .LOWS : '' What is Love ? '' is not so much a song as a midtempo music bed with Lady Miss Kier 's wide eyed musings that love is `` de-vine , de-lightful , de-gorgeous ! '' . `` World Clique '' is much the same with the theme being global unity this time.BOTTOM LINE : This is far from indispensable to the average music listener . I 'd stick with getting `` Groove is in the Heart '' on a good compilation personally .	-1
this disc was catchy 10 years back but nothing worth keeping.Groove is in the Heart was about it.much like the B-52 's pretty campy .	-1
I bought this CD the day it came out , and let me tell you , the 1990s had their share of hits and misses , more misses than hits , and this open especially bothered me a lot . Granted , nearly every artist and group loathes to release a second album that is a Xerox of the first one , but when bands define what they want to be : metal , pop , dance , etc.. they truly do a disservice to themselves and their fans when they release an album that lacks all the things that made the first one such an catch in the first place . Yes , they have the & # 34 ; Deee-Lite & # 34 ; eclectic team of producers and collaborators to make the & # 34 ; sound & # 34 ; come out , however , the songs here are AWFUL ! They appear to be either the rejected tracks from the first one , stuff that was in somebody 's forgotten trunk that should have never seen the light of day ( see XTC Apple Venus Vol1 , and Oranges & Lemons ) , or songs that were rushed and half-baked on the subway ride to the recording studio . Since the label or the band already paid for the production team , the studio time , and the rest of the team , this sloppy homework done at the last minute is what they had to work with . No time for rewriting or to properly compose good songs as they did with the first one . The label wants another 5 top 10s by the end of the week ! ! Sadly maybe 2 songs were good enough for me to keep this album in my collection for so many years , but now I will trade it in among with my other undesirables for enough $ to buy something else . The last time a famous artist went from his trade ( rock ) to a political album , it flopped miserably . Anyone remember John Lennon & Yoko Ono & # 34 ; Some Time In New York City & # 34 ; ( 1972 ) ? Yes , that one sucked as well . Right after this flop DJ Towa Tei called it quits . He saw the writing on the wall . A sad and bitter decline for a band that had so much promise . I still mourn them .	-1
Deee Lite is a fun group and they make good party music . This album , though , is quite inferior to `` World Clique '' in my opinion . I was disappointed by it when I ought it nearly 15 years ago and I listened to it again after many years recently and still found it lacking , though ca n't say exactly why . If you like this group 's sound ( and I do ) `` World Clique '' is simply a much better album .	-1
i did n't get Ephraim Lewis then or now.he was to me a 3rd tier Terence trent D'arby clone or a 2nd tier Seal.the words & amp ; Music have been done all before by better talent .	-1
Back in the day , this was very popular . Not many people are driving around with this in their cd player today . It sounds dated.However , `` Cannonball '' is a classic . This band just happened to stumble on a genuine , `` Louie , Louie '' type of song . `` No Aloha '' is interesting ( sounds very Pixie ish ) , `` Divine Hammer '' is decent and `` Driving on 9 '' is a cool , trucker vibe of a song.The rest of this is pretty unlistenable .	-1
i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world ... MY MISTAKE . do not call this album techno . call it top 40 , or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented . there is little rock on this album . this album is the predeccesor to play . if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wan na be music.i also bought animal rights by moby . THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles ... yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn , the funky beat of lets go free ( song is 37 seconds long ) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess . although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby 's cd 's but otherwise this is not worth your time .	-1
This CD is TRASH , okay ? It 's all about freakin ' , humpin ' , ridin ' , and eatin . ' Most guys would probably like hearing a woman singing dirty like that . I have a guy friend who has her CD and does n't like it but only got it because of her big rear end on the CD cover . You know , a lot of people act like it 's a good thing for a woman to express her sexuality , but some women actually cross the line . Instead of coming across as feminine and mysterious , chicks like Adina just come across as plain ol ' nasty , vulgar , and offensive . She 's the type who just lays all her stuff on the table and you 're like , `` What ? That 's it ? '' Anyone who does that does n't have much to offer anybody . Women can freely express their sexuality without being raunchy and exploiting themselvse . Listen to Minnie Riperton 's `` Inside My Love '' and Adina 's `` Do You Wan na Ride '' and you perverts will understand what I 'm talking about . Anyway , this CD did nothing for me but give me a headache . It 's boring and has no substance . Adina has/is wasting her talent and that 's a shame . You definetly want to skip this floozy .	-1
The near-pornographic lyrics which pervade most of this CD 's tracks and the equally revealing artwork were what sold it . Like most R & B `` singers '' of the time , Adina Howard could n't hold a candle to such great Soul Divas of yesteryear and ( not surprisingly ) her producers had to overproduce these tracks in a bombastic way so as to distract the listener from the fact that Adina was a no-talent . This CD is a classic example of why most post-1988 so-called `` R & B '' ( or Hip-Hop Soul ) should be DISMISSED by anyone who loves and appreciates 1960s and '70s Soul .	-1
If you enjoy this CD , great : more power to ya . I found it to be the most annoying music to ever be praised by the alternative music press . Tried to like it , could n't . Take my name off your [ stuff ] !	-1
The title song says , `` The whole world 's broke and it ai n't worth fixing ... '' . But fixing it is all we can do because we ca n't `` start all over and make a new beginning ... '' . `` Create a new world ... '' ? Get real . We 're not God . We broke it and we have to fix it , not hide behind noble but hollow sentiments.And as for track 9 , `` Give me one reason to stay here ... '' , how infantile is that ? She demands a reason she has no right to ask for . She should be making up her own mind whether to stay or leave . She sounds like a self-absorbed , spoilt child .	-1
Just when I thought Jackson had hit on a hot streak with I 'm Alive , he goes and proves me wrong : he really is mediocre , or worse . There are so many clumsy rockers on this album , it makes it a tough listen ( `` Information Wars '' ; `` Culver Moon '' ; `` I 'm the Cat '' ) . Jackson can not rock out , as it turns out , but you probably knew that a long time ago and do n't need Moron Rock Critic here telling you that . Even worse is when he experiments : the Latin flavored `` Nino '' and the World Music feel-good chant `` It Is One '' show just why Jackson rarely broke formula on his `` classic '' ( ha ! I 'm Alive is better than any of them ! ) records . Needless to say , the songs that stick out the `` same old , same old '' work best : the soft-rock ballads of the title track and `` The Barricades of Heaven '' ; and `` Some Bridges '' , one of the catchiest songs Mr. Browne has ever penned . But on a whole , this is a dismal , half-a**ed record . Even for Jackson Browne . `` Half-a**ed '' is that guy 's calling card . It 's true . If you call `` 1-800-half-a** '' , his secretary will answer the phone and say , `` Mr. Browne is n't available right now . He 's too busy making half-a**ed soft-rock . Can I interest you in a free copy of his latest release , The Naked Ride Home ? '' And that , sports fans , is when you should hang up .	-1
Long ago Nada Surf insisted on releasing tiresome post grunge rubbish until they realised that they could write decent songs.This album is a good example of what Nada Surf were like before they metamorphosised into a brilliant power-pop band with the stunning album 'Let Go'.Although the musicianship on High/Low is of a high standard , the songs are all fairly bad especially the dreadful 'Popular ' which was Nada Surf 's attempt to get noticed by MTV.I am so happy that the first that I heard of Nada Surf was the album 'Let Go ' because if I had heard this album first , I would have very quickly decided that Nada Surf were not my cup of tea and I would n't have listened to them any further.Do yourself a favour and buy the masterpiece 'Let Go ' instead and consign this piece of embarrasing history to the bargain bin where it deserves to be .	-1
With few exceptions , this album sloshes through with pretty mechanical inclanations..Nada Surf were obviously just starting out , and by no means is it a bad debut rock alternative album , but it is definitly the wrong place to start , hardly hinting at their greatness to come..	-1
I 'm inserting this review for a little balance . I give it one star because this stuff is unlistenable to me and very uncreative in my opinion . But before you hit that & quot ; Not Helpful & quot ; ticker , I just would like to re-emphasize what has been mentioned in other reviews : this group has a total retro 60 's sound . One reviewer said they 're like Dimitri , but not as cheesy - well , they are like Dimitri from Paris , but this music is still cheesy as hell to me . The singer has mediocre ability . Even when I get past the retro timbre , the composition itself is hardly experimental ( for the time ) to me . This left a bad taste in my mouth . If the lyrics are worthwhile , I ca n't get through the other yuckies to begin to appreciate them . All I 'm saying is : Not for everyone ! ! Incidentally , I also tried the TomatoKetchup one too with the same conclusions . Others may think I 'm trying to slam their preferences but I 'm not - just trying to help others with tastes similar to mine save a little money and direct their purchases wisely . ; ) If you like this retrogroovybabyloungeorganFUNKcheese sort of thing - grab your bell bottoms and click & quot ; Buy & quot ; because this is right up your alley .	-1
Nothing here can stand the test of time . IT 's all about a bunch of hippie musicians doing crazy rock songs . At least Neil Young already shows his talents here . The rest is [ ... junk ]	-1
Whew this was a difficult cd to listen to . He has about 2 great songs on it and the rest is like tourture to get through . This is one of those cd 's where it 's best to buy them seperatly , do n't waste your moola cause you 'll be screw-la .	-1
How can this be called the Best of Jackson Browne ? It does n't include many of his great songs . Every time I think about buying this CD I stop . There 's way too much missing . My advice to anyone wanting to get some Jackson Browne into their collection is to look elsewhere . Start with one of the stand alone albums . `` Saturate Before Using , '' `` The Pretender , '' and `` Running on Empty '' are my favorites . I have different advice for the record company : Get your act together and release a true `` Best of '' for Browne . Sure , it will probably need to be a double-disc set . Also , it would be nice to see some remastered versions of the individual albums . As far as I know , we 're still forced to put up with [ poor ] sounding analog transfers of all the early albums , which are easily his best .	-1
you would think with Johnny GIll , Keith Sweat & amp ; Gerald Levert that this would be enough to have pretty good Material.you would be wrong.nothing on here is worth having.and what 's up with all the Rappers ? a Good Idea gone down the Drain .	-1
ude think with sweat/levert producin most of the album and gill adding his voice ude get a great album but not a single memorable song ..really sad when u think keiths last album had twisted nobody ... and why with all this talent ude get puff to produce is beyond me	-1
An album of undeniable historical importance , Free Jazz is also not likely to be one you 'll listen to often . It inspired , and continues to inspire , countless great recordings of collective improvisations , including a number of far greater albums that followed immediately in its wake in the 1960s . Sun Ra 's Magic City ( and his other experiments in conduction ) , John Coltrane 's Ascension ( and Live in Seattle ) , Albert Ayler 's New York Eye and Ear Control , and Peter Brotzmann 's Machine Gun are all more spiritually searching , musically soaring and just plain searing experiences , and , while Ornette deserves all the props for doing it first , you can hear all the musicians on Free Jazz concentrating too hard as they try to make their solo statements or comment on what the other players are doing . It 's all a bit tentative compared to what would come later , and , as a maelstrom , it 's all rather polite . Interestingly , Eric Dolphy 's bass clarinet comes off as the dominant and most confident voice . He 's seems to have been born to channel some sort of ineffable cry from the soul , and it 's no wonder that Coltrane wanted to be near him .	-1
Hi when Flack made love with me long ago in 1988 , she stole my pants . She dessapeared form the room and she had stolen my wallet , trousers , and slip . Now I have to write that she had to steal me and made this record that year , she 's such a bad princess and made me think i was gon na die because I had offered her some sex to go on the bed and keep on lovin ich other.No , it 's a lie , I was only joking . I respect her as a singer and just waned to make another type of review . Any antihelpul votes are welcomed . Nanay .	-1
Phils reliance on the drum mashine after the Genesis album And Then There Were Three weakened his ability as a drummer thereafter . Here he plays very simplistically . Phil found himself in his career linked with Peter Gabriel successfully but Gabriel wins hands down as a good artist with his expressive voice and as a top notch multitalented musician and diverse songwriter . Phil struggles with his words when he sings , plays little besides drums and not particularly well and writes simple compositions making his music passable .	-1
& quot ; Face Value & quot ; is n't bad , I guess , but it most certainly is n't my taste . I absolutely love & quot ; No Jacket ... & quot ; and a lot of Phil 's later hits , but when I heard this , I was really disappointed . I wont say it 's bad , I just want to warn everyone who likes Phil 's later ( more mainstream pop ) songs , that they should listen to this before they buy it .	-1
Peter Gabriel 's first two solo albums are both a bit off , this one more so than the first one.The first thing that came to my mind when hearing this album was & # 34 ; writer 's block & # 34 ; - most of these songs have very uninspired writing and Gabriel completely lacks direction . He tries his hand at country , progressive , punk rock , gospel but it never sounds convincing , rather stabbing at ideas.There are a few songs in the middle of the album that are rather good , such as the enjoyable & # 34 ; Animal Magic & # 34 ; and the heartfelt & # 34 ; Indigo & # 34 ; but even these are a shadow of what he was capable of .	-1
Very few artists have made abums this bad . The thing about Phil is he included covers on many of his albums as if he could not be inspired enough to write all his own songs and even did the covers poorly and focused on quantity or more then quality . If you want to hear a good artist focussing on the opposite get Security by Peter Gabriel released the same year as this absolute rubbish .	-1
Advice to the ladies out there : If you are dating a musician be prepared that if you break up with that person , he or she is likely going to write an album on how much they now hate you . Many noticeable artists have done this before . Justin Timberlake , Eminem , Michael Jackson , Carly Simon , but one of the most noticeable releases was that of Phil Collins when his wife Joely divorced him . With the divorce getting ugly and bitter for both parties involved , Collins locked himself up in his studio and began recording to release some of his bitter emotions . The result is `` Hello , I Must Be Going , '' one of his weakest albums to date . Granted , for people who might not like Phil 's other albums this may be for you.Unlike some of his mainstream albums and hit singles , this Phil Collins is angry , bitter , and sarcastic , with nary a trace of humor to be found . The opening track `` I Do n't Care Anymore '' shows Collins ready to let loose some anger , and he does n't care whether you like it or not . And that 's exactly what he does for the firs four tracks : Vents . He vents , vents , and vents . Sadly , for all the anger directed in these songs , they do n't provide much of an enjoyable listening experience . The second half of the album is slightly better , starting with a remake of `` You Ca n't Hurry Love . '' At this point Collins contemplates the purpose and place for love in the first place . It 's a much calmer , more thoughtful , more mature second half , where the thoughtfulness can be felt in the music itself.Still , despite the second half being more interesting then the first , Collins would have done well to save a few of the highlights and shelve the rest of the album . This is an album that is probably too personal to please many people . I 'm glad he managed to get all this pent up frustration off his chest though , as what followed were much better , much more enjoyable works to be sure.Grade : ** starsDownload This : You Ca n't Hurry Love , Do n't Let Him Steal You 're Heart Away	-1
Phil Collins might have made some infectious music on this album but it lacks real magic . This is pure pop and thats rarely a good thing . It certainly is not here .	-1
There are only three good songs on this album . If you like Phil Collins alot , then pick up this album . Otherwise just pick up his greatest hits cd because his hits cd has all of his good material on it . The other 8 songs on this album really do n't gel that well when compared with the other 3 good songs .	-1
Shrill Collins is phony , talentless , boring , vapid , chiched , weak , tuneless , unoriginal , atrocious , fake , irritating and just plain BAD . Review over . Thank you .	-1
Not worth the 5 bucks ! ! ! ! !	-1
I used to dig this Album More Back when it was out.But He Bites Too Much Here.Sussudio is a Rip Off Of Prince 's 1999.Take Me Home is So-So.I Respect His Ability at Drum Beats & amp ; Production.One More Night is the Best cut here.but this Album Has n't Aged well at all .	-1
This was a monster album in 1985 . Many of the songs from this album were all over the radio . Phil Collins was also all over MTV , thanks to what were ( at the time ) his catchy tunes and `` witty '' ( well , `` English witty '' ) videos . It was a # 1 album and sold a ton of copies . The fact that a very balding , rather short and not very attractive man could have been such a superstar says quite a bit about how things have changed . Hell , look at the cover of this one -- and then remind yourself that this thing sold millions of copies in LP FORMAT -- meaning that his big old ugly man was blown up to an incredible size for the cover of this one.In any event , this album has not aged well . Listening to it now I just do n't think it 's very good . A lot of the songs seem to sound very similar to each other , with no real variety . Sure there are a couple slow songs , but the more uptempo songs really all seem to have the same beat . The drum/percussion sound on this album is also really gimicky and has not aged well either . This was an album made for the 1985 market , without much thought or concern for making something that could stand the test of time.This was also the Grammy winner for Best Album . This thing had NO business being named Best Album . It certainly beat out two far more qualified and much better nominees in `` Brothers In Arms '' ( Dire Straits ) and `` The Dream of the Blue Turtles '' ( Sting ) ( New Order 's `` Low Life '' and Tears For Fear 's `` Songs From the Big Chair '' were not even nominated , which proves how much the Grammy 's suck ) . Whatever else , do not be fooled , this was not the best album that came out in 1985.All in all , the hits on here can be found on other compilations , including various Phil Collins `` Best Of '' / `` Greatest Hits '' albums . There is no real reason to buy this album if you are only looking for the hits . You can get those elsewhere , and in conjunction with better songs ( such as `` In the Air Tonight '' ) . This album really does n't even make for good 1980 's nostalgia music . It 's simply a relic of a bygone time in radio formating , MTV and music marketing.All told , I own this on LP and CD , and I actually like several of the songs on here , having listened to them quite a bit on radio and MTV when I was a kid growing up in the 1980 's . I am not even a Phil Collins hater , as I have no opinion either way as to the guy , other than I certainly do not hate him the way some people seem to really hate this guy and his music.However , I can not find a compelling reason to recommend buying this CD . Get a Phil Collins `` hits '' compilation instead .	-1
This was originally released as a CD and LP in 1985 . It is 40 minutes long . There is a new remastered version , with extra tracks and bonus CD that is a Bruford infomercial.On the original LP , the two sides were completely different . Side A was a waste , and Side B was OK . It is all piano and drum music.The music on side A is peppy little ditties . Some of it sounds like circus music , other parts like what would be in a rodeo or for a Western movie . It 's all just a bunch of silly inconsequential bits . Maybe something you would hear at a childrens concert.Things are better on the second side . There are some nice little drum solos from Bruford and piano solos from Moraz . Then there some very good discordant piano/drum duets.I bought the new remastered version of this CD based on the rave reviews given on Amazon . I am not too happy about it.Be warned , that most of the CD is not what you would expect from Moraz , and mostly not like what Bruford has done before .	-1
By the end of the 1980s , after four releases in a synth rock vein with instrumentals and vocals alike far removed from rock-out savagery , Rush 's popularity was beginning to fade . The tour for 1988 's album HOLD YOUR FIRE saw half-empty venues and cancelled dates , while guitarist Alex Lifeson was feeling increasingly pushed to the side by all the keyboards . The trio knew they needed to make a change and PRESTO , released in 1989 , shows them embarking in a slightly different tradition . It 's not a complete departure , as songs like `` Red Tide '' and `` War Paint '' and could easily have fit in on the previous two albums . But in the main we find a much dimished use of synthesizers , and in tracks like `` Show Do n't Tell '' and `` Available Light '' , Lifeson returns to the spotlight.But the album is ultimately overall disappointing . The most readily noticeable flaw is Rupert Hine 's production . The drums have no punch , the sound is flat with little variation in dynamic , and there 's an incongruous edit in the second track . The other problem is that , as one listens through the whole album , Neil Peart 's lyrics are perhaps his weakest in the band 's entire career . At best , they are forgettable , with myself and many fellow Rush fans unable to recall half of what Geddy sang . At at worst , they are risible . The `` boys and girls together '' bit on `` War Paint '' makes me cringe almost as much as the infamous `` Net boy , net girl , / send your signal 'round the world . / Put your message in a modem / and through it in the cyber sea . '' lines of `` Virtuality '' on TEST FOR ECHO a few years later.I consider PRESTO the weakest Rush album released in the three decades since they moved to radio-friendly lengths . From talking to other Rush fans , I always thought this was the common opinion , and I 'm baffled as to the high average review here . It 's not a complete failure , as I occasionally listen to `` Chain Lightning '' and `` Available Light '' , but this is one of the few Rush albums I 'm reluctant to play through . Ironically , opinions aboutHold Your Fire , the album that drove so many people away in the late 1980s , seem to have improved over the last 20 years . On the other side of PRESTO , the following albumRoll the Bonesis also often seen as a solid effort .	-1
Mediocre at best , I liked & quot ; Hold Your Fire & quot ; better than this CD. & quot ; Show and Tell & quot ; is boring and I really didnt care for this CD , nothing stuck out and grabbed me like there other CDs have ... .. There next effort & quot ; Counterparts & quot ; was much better . wouldnt recommend ... .	-1
Anyone who puts Presto among Rush 's greatest albums is obviously not a Rush fan . This CD just plain stinks . Show do n't tell is the only good song on the album . I ca n't believe that this is the same band that made Hemispheres , A Farewell to Kings , Signals , Permanent Waves , and 2112 . Avoid this and Roll the Bones like the plague , they are pure garbage .	-1
& quot ; Hold Your Fire & quot ; culminated the 80 's Rush , building on the innovations brought forth on & quot ; Power Windows & quot ; . I anxiously awaited this ; the start of a new decade , with a new label and a different producer from the last two records . What a dissappointment .	-1
Rush 's inevitable slide into mediocrity was evident from 1982 on . Unlike Hold Your Fire , ad Power Windows this album is not drawn out in synthesizers . Alex Lifeson 's guitar is not buried deep in the mix like it had been for a while , but this album is not an improvement . Neil Peart 's lyrics are repetitive , as well as Geddy Lee 's vocals . Gone is the shrieking , and instead his voice is low ( at least for his range ) and it sounds generic . The songs on this album are n't that memorable , for pretty much , if you have heard one song you 've heard the whole album . The musicianship of the band is still tight , and their skills are still virtuosic , especially on the complex time signature changes on & quot ; Chain Lightning & quot ; and & quot ; Superconductor , & quot ; but even that can not save this album from blandness . Do n't be fooled by the title ; Presto is not a magical experience .	-1
As a long time Rush fan I hate to say negative about the band . However to give this a five star rating and talk about how wonderful it is would be a major fib . Except for The Pass , which is a wonderful song , Presto is a collection of forgettable tunes by a talented band . Like all albums before and since , Presto does display impressive musicianship on behalf of Geddy Lee , Alex Lifeson , and Neil Peart . The problem here is the songwriting and compostions . The album starts off interesting enough with Neil tapping and then a bombastic intro to Show Do n't Tell . Then Geddy starts singing . The problem is what he is singing about . A song about cynicsm . If you want cynism check out any of the works by Pink Floyd or Roger Waters . Superconductor is a nice rocker but it 's chorus is hideous . The major problem is the sound . This album sounds to polished . It 's at the opposite end of the spectrum from Vapor Trails , which sounds too raw . The band sounds best when it finds a nice balance with producers such as Terry Brown or Peter Collins . Rush is capable of much more than this .	-1
This review is of the esoteric sound recording quality of this release . No one doubts the quality of the songs themselves.I just wasted $ 9 on the so-called remastered version download of Presto . Initially , Amazon had confusing labeling showing the MP3 download to be remastered . It was not . The labeling was changed after I made the purchase . I am hoping the 2013 Japanese remaster I just ordered will be the one ! The remasters of the oldest of the catalog are definitely worth it . For example , I purchased 2112 , Exit Stage Left , Hemispheres , Hold Your Fire , Signals and Power Windows . ( Vapor Trails is a compressed mess ) . All were worthy of repurchase . The two `` Presto '' cuts that are on the 2009 Retrospective CD sound great . Hopefully the 2013 Wea/Japanese will sound just as good..UPDATE COMING SOON.UPDATE : The Japanese Import remaster sounds no better than the original 1984 recording . I wish they had made the whole album sound like the two cuts on the 2009 Retrospective .	-1
With colours Collins turns out a quality piece of music making this album better then what came before and theres some big talents on the songs but thats still not saying much as theres a weak cover of The Temptations I Wish It Would Rain Down as well as weak matearial elsewhere .	-1
SAD THAT PHIL WENT THE WAY OF POP DIVA ... HORRIBLE ... MAKES ALL PROGRESSIVE FANS CRINGE ... SHOULD MAKE ALL MUSIC FANS CRINGE .	-1
After the absolutely top-notch `` No Jacket Required '' , it was inevitable that Phil Collins ' follow-up would be a letdown . And it 's not that `` ... But Seriously '' is a bad album , just BORING . The word of the day here is `` ballads '' . Songs vary from moody ballads ( `` That 's Just The Way It Is '' , `` Another Day In Paradise '' ) , standard fare heartfelt ballads ( `` Do You Remember ? `` , `` I Wish It Would Rain Down '' , `` Father To Son '' ) , slow groove ballads that transition to slightly-heavy ballads ( `` All Of My Life '' ) and ambitious epic ballads ( `` Colours '' ) . Elsewhere you find more upbeat , jazz-or-latin influenced numbers ( `` Heat On The Street '' , `` Saturday Night And Sunday Morning '' , `` Find A Way To My Heart '' ) . All are BORING.A couple of the more rocking tunes , `` Hang In Long Enough '' and `` Something Happened On The Way To Heaven '' save this album from being a complete yawner , but both are cut from the same cloth as the far superior `` Sussudio '' from `` No Jacket Required '' . All of tunes here are admirable compositions and performances , and if you 're a diehard PC fan , this 'll scratch your itch . If your tastes lean more toward his work with Genesis or rock music with a bit more of an edge , this album is just plain flat out BORING .	-1
much was the case with much of their Albums the Material did n't always highlight the strong Vocals they have.Hold On was a tight jam.if given the right Material they could have been the next Emotions.now they were the Best Female Group of the 90 's but it could have been more than that.McElroy & amp ; Foster are Talented Brothers but they were Hit & amp ; miss with En Vogue .	-1
This album starts out fantastically -- `` Dreamline '' is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done , while `` Bravado '' and the title track maintain a high standard . But other than `` Heresy '' and the instrumental `` Where 's My Thing '' , the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock . Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the ( near ) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring . The completist will want to pick this up , but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages . [ This review is based on the original 1991 release , not the 2004 remaster ; the sound quality on the original is just fine . ]	-1
My this is a toothless old affair . Easily their worst album . The real Rush was over after & quot ; Hold Your Fire & quot ; . If this was anyone 's first experience with the band I do n't see how they would find them interesting . By this time they had moved so far away from what put them on the map anyway . If a group debuted with a record like this I doubt any self respecting label would give them a shot to do it again . For fans of tired millionare rock only	-1
Bad effort by RUSH . A IRon Maiden , Van Halen , Def Leppard , Ozzy and others artists , they just ca n't be so great anymore .	-1
I love Rush , I really do , but even now , when I tried to give it a listen , it still sounds like the worst thing that Rush has done ( beside Test for Echo ) I am really surprised that Rush fans love this album . I just do n't get any kinda of vibe from this album . Even though Dreamline and Ghost of a Chance are good songs , the rest seems like filler material . I give it two stars for those two good songs , but otherwise I really ca n't recommend this . If you want Rush from the 1990 's , go with Counterparts . Its easily a 5 star effort and the best from that decade	-1
Tori Amos is , to say it politely , a hack . Yes , comrades , a hack . She is simply a talentless Britney Spears knockoff . All of her songs have computerized vocals and lame dance beats , making it blatantly obvious that she is desperate to be on MTV . Sorry hun but you 'll NEVER be good enough to make it on MTV . Skip this junk and listen to a Britney Spears or Lady GaGa album . PS- `` Me and a Gun '' is hilarious ! !	-1
I remember this album being the first Rush album I did n't like . There were others I was n't too fond of , but I could listen to them . I ca n't sit through more than a couple songs on this album before I 'm like `` This is diminishing my opinion of Rush '' .It seems the Nirvanasplosion took its toll on Rush too , as they toned down the over-zealous production of Roll The Bones and made their guitars sound raw , unsustained , and with little warmth . Even the vocals sound like Geddy Lee was thrown in a room with a mic and zero post-production was done . Rush actually benefits from production , and they 've made far better-sounding albums even with over-production.I could look all past this however if the songs sounded anything like Rush or even really inspired . Listening to the whole album , nothing sticks with me ; nothing makes me feel `` I did n't know I needed to hear that ! '' . I do n't feel like I 'm taken on other-worldly journey or opened up to new musical venues that I never could have imagined . This album feels like Rush 's answer to grunge and dirty bars , and it just does n't fit them . Rush has always hitched a ride with the latest trend , but they always came out reinventing the wheel and expanding beyond their modern counterparts . This just feels like they hitched a ride , bummed a smoke , and got out at the next bus stop . If this were Rush 's only album , I would n't remember them for much and I barely recognize them here . I guess every band has to go there .	-1
Well , they asked for it . Peter Collins and his glossy production trying to make Rush into something they are not . Fear is not a good enough reason for prog-rockers to turn `` Alternative . '' I swear some of the songs here sound like hyped versions of Pearl Jam . I do n't mind a change in direction , but an about-face is something else . For such heralded musicians and writers of some of the more intricate songs I have ever heard , it was truly a shame to hear the fairly conventional song-structures , cliched lyrical content , and jagged production . I remember actually liking this album for the first few spins , but after a few more I was beginning to be annoyed . I never listen to this album anymore , while I still return to their earlier albums with confidence . The only really good track here is the instrumental `` Leave That Thing Alone . '' That 's good advice . They have much better albums than this disappointment . Later .	-1
I 've bought this CD a long time ago and until now I ca n't feel it right . & quot ; Nobody 's Hero & quot ; is a beautiful song , but the others seem all alike to me , over-produced , as if to hide the lack of inspiration of the band for this CD .	-1
What ? GEDDY , ALEX , AND NEIL are wearing flannel shirts ? The 90 's was a dark time for Rush fans . Rush fans do not wear flannel . What were they thinking ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I 'm an old RUSH fan . I survived and enjoyed fully when they changed their sound , adding a lot of keyboards , synthesizers , etc , forever . It was a new way , but the point was : the energy of true rock and music was always there , always at their side in all kind of songs . But in this COUNTERPARTS it seems everything went wrong ! ! ! ! ! It 's & quot ; cold & quot ; , heartless , overproduced , flat . Of course there are few tunes , but production ( by Peter Collins ) ruined the good part of them . If you wan na know , I gave ( for free ) my copy of COunterparts to a friend of mine . I really tried to enjoy it , but that was not possible , so bad that album is .	-1
Unbeliavable that a reviewer below could think that the song & quot ; NOBODY 'S HERO & quot ; may have been written for the heroes of September 11th,2001 , when this album was released in 1993 ... Incredible ... As for COUNTERPARTS , it 's plain dumb , as most of Rush 's work of the nineties . The production is utterly commecial , no wonder they brought in producer Peter Collins to do it ... A shame.I really do not like this album , and put it in the same league of the dreadful HOLD YOUR FIRE , in the & quot ; fireless & quot ; category .	-1
In my 15+ years of listening and buying this bands albums I can not for the life of me understand peoples ethusiasm for this record.Counterparts seemed to be a welcome change as the band dropped more of its keyboarding sound , and Alex started to do more riff rocking guitar action . Do n't get me wrong , Alex and Geddy do some decent grooving on this album , but there was a big problem . And it is the biggest problem on the album.That problem was Niel . Niel Peart who is considered probably one of the best drummers who ever lived , fails to live up to his impressive playing on this album . Basicaly Niel 's drumming on this album is predictable and borish . There are no fancy rolls , or intricate beats or anything to get you moving . In fact everything I think is 4/4 . But the worse was yet to come.Niel who is the principal lyricist for the band , has penned his WORST lyrics ever ( yes worse than Caress of Steel ) . Songs are peppered with incredibly CHEESEY lyrics , and many of the songs just reak ( Nobody 's Hero , Everyday Glory ) , sound stupid ( Between Sun & Moon ) , have stupid song breaks that kill the momentum ( Cut To the Chase , Double Agent ) , or are just titled idioticly ( Speed of Love ) . He really dropped the ball on this one , and Geddy 's vocals come in at the most weird tonnes , and awkward places making everything 10 times worse . No do n't get me wrong , a song about AIDS is great as long as it 's done well . However Nobody 's Hero is just the most corniest , cheesiest , weepeist , sachrinst thing I have ever heard . Never mind the exhausting outro string section that 's beaten over your head to death ... Let 's look at some more lyrical cheese shall we : '' For You and Me ; sex is not a competitionFor You and Me ; sex is not a job description '' -Alien Shore '' AHhha ha to yes why the sun ? `` -Between Sun and MoonIt was just before sunriseWhen we started on traditional rolesShe said sure , I 'll be your partnerBut do n't make too many demands-Cold FireWhat kind of lyric are these ? I even heard them play Sun And Moon live and it was horrid ! It 's amazing the lyrics Niel has penned and the worlds and moods he 's created and this was what he came up with . It boggles my mind ... They do n't even sound jocular or humourous even ... This is without a doubt the bands WORST album they ever made ( at least so far ) . I even say it 's worse than Caress of Steel because at least with that recording they 1 ) tried something creative and imaginative 2 ) were pressured to get the record out before they were even ready.Only buy this album if you are a huge fan of the band and need to complete your library . THat being said make sure it is the LAST Rush album you buy . If anything go out and get the next album they released after this album 'Test For Echo ' . That album is basicaly what Counterparts would sound like if they did it right , it blows this album out of the water !	-1
All they can do with Rush 's recordings is play with the dynamics , there is nothing that they can do to change the low-resolution of the original 80s through mid-90s Rush recordings.To make a true SACD you need to use an analog source . If you use any digital source all you get on an SACD is a clear copy of that low-resolution recording.All of Rush 's LPs from 1981/82 were low resolution digital . They would record everything at 16 bit/44.1kHz except the bass and drums which they would record on analog tape at a different studio . Although those analog recordings were later converted to digital ( which is counter productive ) . May as was have skipped the analog recording.Around 1991/92 when DAT mastering was more widely utilized , they were recording in low-res still but mastering at 20 bit / 48kHz.24 bit recording was not widely used until the late 90s , the first commercial rock 24 bit recording was in 1996 . So there ARE no recordings of Rush from the 80s through the 90s that are truly high quality ( analog or high-definition ) .So , making am SACD from a low-resolution source is ridiculous because all you get in the end is a VERY clear copy of a CD ! ! The original recordings resolution can never be changed . Ever.You could do the EXACT same thing by using the CD and play with the dynamics yourself and copy it to 24/96kHz or higher if you have the software.Update : I JUST contacted Kevin Shirley , the recording engineer for Counterparts . He confirmed what I had discovered earlier , that it was recorded on a Studer 48 track digital at 16 bit / 48kHz . They had just recently changed over from the Sony digital recorder they previously used.Rush 's earlier recordings at Le Studio were recorded on a Sony Digital 24 track PC-3324 at 16 bit/44.1kHz .	-1
Can someone please tell me why people compare this to my favorite band Nivarna ? Sometime 's it 's really fast like hardcore death metal like Slipknot and sometimes it 's really slow like they got tired . what ! ! ! make up your mind please . I guess it 's funny when he 's singing about goats but this is n't nearly as good as Nivarna .	-1
I think the Melvins ' career can be broken into a few clearly separate `` acts '' : Prelude- 1983 to 1985Hardcore . Loud , fast , snotty . ( see : Deep Six compilation album , EDIT- and the soon-to-be-released Mangled Demos ) Act 1- 1986 to 1989Buzz ( founder , guitarist , songwriter ) was heavily inspired ( no pun intended ) by Black Flag 's 'My War ' album , particularly side 2 , which was composed of three very long droning dirges . The Melvins ' songs became a bit heavier and often slower . Some of their earlier songs might have been considered speed metal , but at this point you could hear a definite '70s `` regular '' heavy metal element in some songs . A very original sound at the time , many other local bands followed suit ; it 's been said that the Melvins ' change in direction is arguably the direct impetus of the `` grunge '' thing that started around Seattle , for better or worse . ( see : Six Songs debut EP , Gluey Porch Treatments , Ozma ) Act 2- 1990 to 1992Their sound became , for lack of a less lame cliche , extreme . They were no longer `` kinda heavy , '' they were extremely heavy . The song writing and live performances became confrontational . Riffs and rhythms were often so drawn out and plodding that they were scarcely recognizable . In other instances there were no riffs at all , a storm of white noise taking their place . Listening to the Melvins sometimes made you feel like you were a mastodon slowly sinking into a tar pit . I personally consider this to be the Melvins ' at their peak . One of my personal highlights was seeing them play in Costa Mesa CA in 1991 ; in the middle of their set , Buzz began spewing atonal noise from his amp while Dale pretended to hit his drums . This went on for several minutes . Some fratboy types , at the behest of their girlfriends , approached the stage to make them stop . Their demands and pleas fell on deaf ears . Glorious . ( see : Bullhead , Eggnog , Lysol [ a.k.a . `` Melvins '' /self titled ] ) Act 3- 1993 to presentHoudini marks the beginning of this era . The Melvins suddenly abandoned the heavy approach . They completely lost focus and embarked on journey of discovery that usually involved ho-hum `` hard rock '' song writing and dabbling in experimental weirdness . Unfortunately , the experiments almost always fail . Or at least fail to be enjoyable listening . ( see : Houdini , Stoner Witch , Stag , and whatever else they 've put out in the last 10 years ) As far as I 'm concerned , they do still squirt out the occasional great song , but by and large they probably could have called it quits in 1994 and left the music world a beautiful corpse to admire forever and ever . It happens all the time . A band spends all of their creative juices until nothing 's left , but they keep going . Not that I blame them . What else are they supposed to do ? Sell insurance ? EDIT- `` to dismiss 'what ever they have done in the last ten years ' withouteven bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant . `` I agree , that IS ignorant . You 'll be happy to know that I own and have listened to every single record the Melvins have ever released , including Never Breathe , with the one exception of Roman Empire . ( EDIT- I now own Roman Empire ) I would have listed them all by name , but there are a lot of them , and their titles were n't readily jumping into my mind anyway . And I 'll continue to buy their records , always in the hope that they somehow get the fire back and do something worthwhile again . I 'll let you know as soon as that happens.EDIT- `` The truth is , the Melvins , while most worthy of the played out `` grunge '' title , are not responsible for it at all . They are in fact `` dirge metal '' . They are not Northwest , rather Bay Area . `` Incorrect , sir . The Melvins formed in WA circa 1983 . According to Kim Thayil , the `` Seattle scene '' was your average hardcore punk scene at the time , but after the Melvins slowed down and took on a more metallic sound , a lot of the bands in the area followed suit . That was how the `` grunge '' thing began . They did n't move down to San Francisco CA until 1988 or '89 .	-1
1 1/2A bloated lightweight , pseudo-heavy , post-punk over-citation disguises its compositional inadequacies inside undercooked experimentation and wins due to such low relative expectation .	-1
Phil Collins may play every instrument on this album but do not be fooled , he will never play as many instruments or play them as well as his serious competators in the music world ( notably Peter Gabriel ) and hes still a weak vocalist and songwriter . Both Sides is an album with simple non real talent musical accompaniment and bland songs .	-1
This was recorded in Collins home studio and it has a desolate , lonely and claustrophobic feeling to it . Some people call this powerful and art . I call it 67 minutes of drum machine and droning.Released in 1993 , this is his fifth studio solo album . The sound quality is typical of an early 1990s CD , which is not that great and adds to over all desolate feel of the album.I am not a Collins hater , like some ... .Deke Leonard of the Welsh group Man once said about Quicksilver 's John Chipolina & # 34 ; why is it the good ones have to die . Why could n't it have been Phil Collins & # 34 ; .I think Collins is a great drummer ( listen to early Brand X ) . So , I never understood how he got into this drum machine phase . He did it somewhat with Genesis but really relied heavily on it for his solo albums . I think it really distracting and takes away from the power of his songs . Surely a drum set could fit in his home studio somewhere.I also think that the Collins lead Genesis was a better live band than the Gabriel led one . With Gabriel , you had to be there to veiw the atmospheric stage show and costumes , but the songs were played too closely to the studio albums with no excitement . A Collins led Genesis concert was fun , energetic and a different experience from listening to the album . However ... . the post Gabriel Genesis albums were not nearly as good as the earlier ones .	-1
Ok , I fall in love with Phil 's music 10-12 years ago and he is the pop-disco star from 80'es , but not the music star from 90'es . This album is n't terrible at all , but like someone said it 's too private . It deserves max 2 and 1/2 stars . & quot ; Everyday & quot ; is great song , & quot ; Both sides of story & quot ; is ok , but after third song , album goes to nowhere . It is like you open big book and inside there is n't any word . Every song is too long ( more than 6 minutes ) and I really ca n't listen this album 'cause it become really painful after some time . The songs has some mood , that is true , but there is n't any catchy melody , only easy going to nowhere . This album is n't disaster but after his previous classic & quot ; ... but seriously & quot ; this is big step down and this sounds like he is tired from life and everything . Too easy ... only for big fans .	-1
This was one of the most boring albums that I got to listen to ! I ca n't believe that Phil Collins made this album in 1993 ! After all those classic '80s albums , he comes up with this album that put me to sleep during much of it . & quot ; Both Sides of the Story & quot ; is very hip-hoppish in terms of the beats , but that 's the only good song on here . The rest of the album is a bunch of bland ballads , badly performed songs that do n't rock and just uninteresting songs to me . Just drags for much of its 68 minutes ! ! ! ! ! Phil can defend this album , but I just do n't like this one . His later albums were far better than this dull effort !	-1
Tori 's & quot ; Under The Pink & quot ; is marginal and strange . The concept of her songs are just not understandable , and I guess you 're not supposed to understand it at all . Tori wails on & quot ; God & quot ; , the blasphemous single that turn some listeners away , and tragically ruins the record and ones to come . & quot ; Pretty Good Year & quot ; stands out as a great song and so does & quot ; Bells For Her. & quot ; Other than that , I am disappointed .	-1
I really loved Little Earthquakes , I was weirded out ( and a little scared ) by Boys for Pele , and I respected and enjoyed Choirgirl Hotel . But I just did n't get this album . Most of it , anyway . Cornflake is incredible and Baker is beautiful and there are a few other good tracks , but mostly this album is beyond me .	-1
This group is derivative and dull . The songs on this album get annoying very quick ( not to mention played out ) .	-1
like so-many boy bands of today they all seem to sing without any kind of feeling and any texture.nothing stands out.it is all formula without substance.all-4-one are a 2nd tier Boyz 11 Men.overplayed songs with little lasting impressions.also none of these bands except Hanson play or write anything.they are a push button for a Producer .	-1
These guys totaly sold out when they singed to atlantic for this peace of junk . this album just screams sell out . Look we 're played in the mall now . If you want good bad religion then get anything from how could hell be any worse up recipe for hate . I can make a better album then these sell outs can ! ! !	-1
I would n't be surprised if this was the worst CD in my collection . For some odd reason I thought it would be a good idea to get my first Jewel CD and this one should be it . I do n't understand how anyone could sit through this whole CD because it 's boring , pointless and a big waste of time . Not to mention 13 or so bucks down the drain.Who Will Save Your Soul and You Were Meant For Me are this CDs best tracks . Foolish Games is n't bad either . But sadly , it was n't enough to save us from the other tracks ' suckage.The worst part is that almost all of the songs sound the same.1 star .	-1
Jewel 's supposed poverty won millions of hearts back in 1996 when her debut album came . But her record mainly recorded live is a piece of College Poetry in Acoustic Guitar that will get you a surely nice nap . Even Jewel and her record label knew her songs where boring , by re-recording YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME and FOOLISH GAMES , so that the DJ of the radio did n't fall sleep when he played the songs . NO wonder Jewel recorded her New Wave-Britney type of albu 0304 , she was bored too .	-1
I heard mixed review about this album . Being european I had n't exactly being thinking about Jewel or her music for that matterbecause the main buyers for this album were Americans . She though re-released this album back in 1997 when of course all the world bought it . I listened to the song Foolish Games and I thought Why not give it a try . This was it about 3 or 4 songs on here were actually good the rest is bla bla . I do n't know but seeing this woman in interviews and live . It seems that she needs something really important to talk about . Well some of the lyrics are bit nice listening to . But this whole talk about her being this alternative sensation makes me wa n't to scream . I mean this album hit top 5 and sold 11 milion copies in the USA alone and contained I believe 2 # 1 's . Although Alanis Morsette 's Jagged Little Pill did that well too even better she was n't just called a great alternative musician but a great mainstream too . I give it two stars for the singels and two other songs on the album .	-1
I bought this album based on the first single & quot ; Who Will Save Your Soul & quot ; , which was a good song . I think the 2nd single had also come out but I had n't heard it yet . I figured it to be an enjoyable listen based on that first single as well as my enjoyment at the time of other varied female artists like Alanis Morissette , Natalie Merchant , and No Doubt 's Gwen Stefani . Well , after one tedious listen I was disgusted that I had actually spent money on such drivel . I sold it back within a week of purchase . The songs are whiney and pretentious , and it amazes me how many people think that based on these songs this woman is an & quot ; angel & quot ; of sorts . Here 's what an angel she is : my wife ( fiancee at the time ) was working at a record store in New York where Jewel was promoting a book of poetry . A fan said & quot ; I love you , Jewel & quot ; , and she responded , & quot ; Shut up , you punk ! & quot ; As a result , several people returned their signed copies of her poetry book for a refund . When Gwen Stefani sings , you can tell she feels what she sings . Jewel is just a phony , and her & quot ; sweet voice & quot ; is overrated as well .	-1
jewel , you have a magnificent voice . so lets get some lyrics in there that actually mean something ? 'i break the yolks to make a smiley face ' ? jesus , if i wanted to hear that , i would turn on some weird al . there is little diversity in songs , and her voice ( actually very good ) is often reduced to a soft moaning . that was my exact reaction i had by the second time i had heard this cd !	-1
Today there are lot of untalented artist that claim they arereally talented such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton and those kind og garbage . The one who started that was Jewel . This girl from Texas or whatever made this album which has probably one of the most non-exicting collection of songs ever put on an album before . Her voice is not very good and when she sings it 's like she has a fever or something and has just thrown up . It 's that bad . The music is n't very interesting . She is clearly copying Joni Mitchell ( who is another overrated singer , but has created some amazing songs ) . The lyrics are not good either and knowing that over 11 million people bought this album just shows how the music industry is becoming more like a circus .	-1
I just ca n't . Jewel really tries with this album . Her potential is clearly there . The problem is that these are n't songs - they 're poems . As such , they just do n't work set to music . The themes themselves are , at least in a few cases , interesting and important . I 'm just not sure that Jewel has anything new to say about them . And while the guitar playing is n't bad , it does seem repetitive after a while . All the songs sound the same ( save for Meant for Me and Foolish Games ) .Little Sister , Daddy and Pieces of You are really underappreciated songs , probably because the themes are controversial . That said , they are n't so well done to warrant buying the album . Of course , Meant for Me and Foolish Games are wonderful . The rest is iminently forgetable . The good stuff from here will be on a greatest hits CD , or can be acquired through a CD single , or a compilation CD . Get Spirit instead , or listen to other folkie types like Tracy Chapman , Tori Amos , or Ani DiFranco .	-1
First of all , I 'm a really big fan of Jewel , I think she 's one of the best singer/songwriters of all time.On `` Pieces Of You '' I think the title track , `` Near You Always , '' `` Adrian , '' `` I 'm Sensitive , '' `` You Were Meant For Me '' and `` Emily '' are all great songs , both vocally and lyrically . I find that with the rest of the songs , the songwriting is still great but the vocals are what really lets the songs down . Jewel has always managed to write good lyrics that are interesting , she 's written great stories like `` Adrian , '' `` Fat Boy , '' `` Till We Run Out Of Road , '' `` Stand , '' `` Goodbye Alice in Wonderland , '' `` Good Day , '' `` Stephenville , TX '' or `` Rosey And Mick '' - the love songs she writes are never cheesey , she just always keeps the writing really good.Her vocals on this album ( other than the six songs I mentioned , which I do n't just think are alright songs , they 're great songs ) are very awkward , they 're not easy on the ears at all , and Jewel has clearly learnt from this as she has n't sang in this style since , she has said she does n't know why this album sold over 11 million copies worldwide and I agree , when I think that her other albums combined have n't sold as many as this album , I find it sad , I just ca n't understand how `` Goodbye Alice in Wonderland '' is her only album not to sell over a million copies , the vocals on all her albums other than this one are on a high level , I guess the positive thing though is that Jewel is sticking to singing in the best way she can and is n't going back to singing in the way she does here .	-1
This album reeks of pretentiousness . Most of the songs are overwritten and just too damn serious . Jewel has a gorgeous voice but this does n't do it for me . Come back brighter ... and lighten up .	-1
Horrid . Jewel you get one star for this one . ( Only Celine Dion could get no stars , if that were an option we were given ) . The girlish voice is annoying , the lyrics ripped straight from an angst-ridden teenager 's diary . No this is definitely not for everyone . Jewel will do well in Nashville with her hurtin ' songs and high-pitched wail . There is a definite lack of maturity , depth and insight here and it has taken a few good years before a lot of people have woken up and rightfully pitched this CD onto the no-talent scrapheap overflowing with bubble-gum chewing teens , Dion and Madonna et.al	-1
Donna Lewis sounds Like a Bad Karoke Cyndi Lauper.I will Love you always forever is so corny as is the rest of this Sorry Disc.No TOne or Soul in Her voice .	-1
With Donna it 's all about the atmospherics . Her voice is OK but it tends towards shrillness and she frequently tries to sing notes she can barely reach . I hear promise here , but not enough discipline . She sings like she does n't really care what she sounds like as long as she 's feeling it . That is a good place to start singing from , but a bad place to be when recording . It 's a producer 's job to reign this in , but it was never going to happen with her co-producing . `` Agenais '' is a very nice tune ( all songs written and arranged by Donna Lewis ) , but her singing is not up to the task . This song demands a new recording by someone who can make it what it should be.The hit , `` I Love You Always Forever '' is not one I need to hear again , but if you like atmospheric writing , I highly recommend H.E . Bates ' novel `` Love For Lydia '' which inspired it .	-1
I love Tori Amos work , but of all her albums , the only one I simply dislike is Boys for Pele . It is way too long and only a few songs are worth the price . These are : Horses , Blood Roses , Caught a Lite Sneeze , Talula , Doughtnot Hole , and Putting the Damage On . The rest seem to go anywhere . Good thing she improved in her subsequent albums .	-1
A complete disappointment ! As much as I love Tori Amos ` music I can ` t give a better review . Half of the 18 tracks on this album are absolute nonsense . Tori here moves away from her stark piano pieces , takes up the harpsichord and over produces most of the songs . CAUGHT A LITE SNEEZE is the only ingenious song incorporating her new fangled harpsichord . Songs like PROFESSIONAL WIDOW ( profanity amungst mumbo jumbo ) , LITTLE AMSTERDAM , TALULA , NOT THE RED BARON and AGENT ORANGE are horrible . IN THE SPRINGTIME OF HIS VOODOO tops them all at being ridiculas and at times childish . BUT WAIT ! ! ! ... There are , I must say , some simple , quiet gems , if you are patient enough to listen to all 70 minutes . HORSES opens the album slowly with the most rememberable lines ( So I got me some horses to ride on ... They say your demons can ` t go there ) , MARRIANE , a sad and at times weird ode , HEY JUPITER , another sad but sensible ode , DOUGHNUT SONG , which is not about a doughnut , really , and the heartbreaking PUTTING THE DAMAGE ON ( Now I ` m wishing for my best impression of my best Angie Dickinson/Now I ` ve got to worry/ ` Cause you sure look pretty /When you ` re putting the damage on . Don ` t buy this album unless you are a complete & quot ; Tori Nut & quot ; ( like me ) . You will write off the talented artist . Instead try her famed LITTLE EARTHQUAKES or FROM THE CHIORGIRL HOTEL .	-1
During the last decade Tori Amos has builded an interesting if not fascinating music career . Being an artist who prefers to fully reveal her emotions through her songs , one can be sure she is capable for the best ... and the worst depending on her mood . & quot ; Boys For Pele & quot ; , her much anticipated following to 1994 's & quot ; Under The Pink & quot ; has been deeply loved by thousands of fans since the day it was released . Even they though , ca n't help but admitting this is not everybody 's thing .The album contains eighteen songs most of them thinly structured . It is not the liquid form of the melodies which is the problem as much as the frustrating character most of them have . & quot ; Professional Widow & quot ; becomes immediately intense and almost suffocating the minute the vocals walk in . & quot ; Blood Roses & quot ; is this middle-age ... something with no aims or charm what so ever . Things are not getting much better on the more lo-fi tracks . The soft , tender story of suicide victim & quot ; Marianne & quot ; goes nowhere while & quot ; The Doughnut Song & quot ; feels long and tirering .Lyrics were always an element which made Amos stand out from other artists of her generation . On her debut & quot ; Little Eartquackes & quot ; on tracks like & quot ; Leather & quot ; , & quot ; Silent All These Years & quot ; and & quot ; Precious Things & quot ; she wrote some of her best ever , full of metaphors and witty hints . Then on & quot ; From The Choirgirl Hotel & quot ; , an album shortly released after a failed pregnacy she sounded so touching and vulnerable ( & quot ; She 's conviced she could hold back a glacier / but she could n't keep baby alive ... & quot ; she sang on & quot ; Spark & quot ; ) . On this album now , things just do n't work that way . & quot ; Muhammed My Friend & quot ; could be taken as a base for a number of empty philosophical discussions among fans but if there 's a piece of music messing with religion out there , this is surely not it . On & quot ; Talula & quot ; she sings & quot ; Talula , Talula / you do n't wan na lose her / wrapped in your papoose / your little Fig Newton & quot ; . We are supposed to search for something meaningful behind her genious lyrical madness but it 's all too confusing . The thing is that Amos does n't need to get all extreme in order to write good lyrics . She has a rich , sensitive soul and some touching love poetic lines like the ones she wrote on the ultimately beautiful & quot ; Your Cloud & quot ; from her latest offering & quot ; Scarlet 's Walk & quot ; ( & quot ; Do you think just like that you can divide this ? / you as yours / me as mine / to before we were us & quot ; ) will simply do .Amos was trying to overcome a rough break up at the time , something the press pointed out in every opportunity yet background information about a singer 's life-phase should help complete the potrait of a music album and not trying to support it alone . Music should n't be like this , it should be able to stand autonomus .It 's hard to actually reach a single concusion about albums like & quot ; Boys For Pele & quot ; . This is a record which demands respect not so much for being deeply profound but for being as emotionally charged as it is . Amos has taken gentle music instruments like the pianno and the harpsichord and managed to create stiff , harsh melodies . Only on & quot ; Caight A light Sneeze & quot ; she delivers the masterpiece we all know she 's so capable of : her perfomance is fierce , the bells and backing vocals are totally haunting . Elsewhere though , there 's no balance in her songwriting and & quot ; Boys For Pele & quot ; ends up being more of a challenge for the listener than an actually enjoyable music offering .	-1
I know the maximum words I can have for this space is 1,000 words but I could go further on bashing this album . What is sad about it and what makes me even more disappointed is that I am a very big fan of Tori . & quot ; Under The Pink & quot ; was strange , & quot ; Little Earthquakes & quot ; was the best , and & quot ; Boys For Pele & quot ; is terrible ! The songs go nowhere except to Whineville . The one star was for the so-so song & quot ; Caught In A Light Sneeze & quot ; and the passable & quot ; Hey Jupiter. & quot ; The rest is junk . I could use this CD as a coaster .	-1
Not so sure not so sure , is this the software that tests and records the echoes that emit inside a structure ? I know you can yodel all day long in a canyon like they show on tv but I thought this was the software that allowed you to test and record the echo itself . I did get some interesting feedback when I first used it but I was not sure because it is an English voice actually saying echo . I think this may be a Microsoft tool licensed to a third world company and resold here . Just not sure what to make of it but I will keep trying to use it and hope I can further my echo research ! ! ! !	-1
After their `` synth era '' of the mid-to-late 1980s , Rush turned back to their hard rock roots . COUNTERPARTS ( 1993 ) was their new triumph , but on 1996 's TEST FOR ECHO the band went even further in reducing the role of keyboards and preferring cutting riffs to melody.Looking at the individual performances , TEST FOR ECHO shows three performers maintaining their immense talent . Drummer Neil Peart adopted two bass drums and an arsenal of new techniques for the album ( which he explains on the VHS/DVD releaseA Work in Progress ) , with the title track and parts of `` Carve Away the Stone '' featuring especially strong work . Guitarist Alex Lifeson sounds thrilled to reclaim the territory once occupied by synths , flaunting this return to the spotlight in `` Driven '' and `` Dog Years '' . Geddy Lee thankfully favours his bass more than his keyboards . In the instrumental `` Limbo '' , we hear three musicians still on top of their game in their mid-40s.Unfortunately , the album is fatally disappointing from other angles . Neil Peart 's songwriting here is grating instead of thought-provoking . In `` Half the World '' , nearly every line begins with precisely those three words , and the effect swiftly becomes annoying . The Internet-themed song `` Virtuality '' is dated now , but was widely panned even when it appeared due to the risible chorus `` Net boy , net girl , send your signal around the world . / Put your message in a modem , and throw it in the cyber sea . '' `` Dog Years '' similarly has a lame chorus . The other weak aspect of TEST FOR ECHO is the production , a `` loudness war '' casualty that packs everything into a miniscule dynamic range and does n't allow the music to breathe . Strangely , however , `` Limbo '' sounds to me like it came from a completely different producer.All in all , I 'd rate even Rush 's controversial following album VAPOR TRAILS higher than this , since the strong songwriting there makes up for the digital distortion . Looking at the band 's whole career , TEST FOR ECHO seems one of their very minor releases .	-1
This is the sequel to Counterparts , with an even heavier sound . There are n't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous . There 's still good stuff on here -- The frantic `` Dog Years '' may be the first ( intentionally ) funny Rush lyric , while other highlights are `` Driven '' , `` Carve Away the Stone '' , and `` Resist '' . This is not one of the band 's better albums , though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it . [ This review is based on the 1996 original release , not the 2004 remaster . I have no problems with sound quality on the original . ]	-1
2 1/2Not a huge Rush fan by any stretch , so I ca n't recall why this album was one of my choices to explore their more modern sound . The single title track was decent enough , but the album fails to create much traction with mediocre riffs and preachy lyrics making a persistent average quality even more self-consciously , over-the-hill-rock annoying . Good thing there are enough chops interspersed from preventing complete erosion of the senses .	-1
I just did n't like this album ... .and I had been a fan for about 5 years when I bought it . To this day , I still just ca n't get into it ... and I have been a fan for 12 years now . It just seemed sooo ... .soft . PRESTO , ROLL THE BONES , SIGNALS , or MOVING PICTURES are so much better . Like another reviewer said , do n't start with RUSH through this album . Their older stuff is much better ... and the newer things since 1996 are too . Put this one in your collection ... but be guaranteed that it will collect dust much faster than the other RUSH albums will .	-1
Test For Echo sounds just plain and tired . It has moments that recall past glories , a cool riff or two , and possibly has some of Peart 's best lyrics , despite what anyone says . Yet the tunes are not memorable at all . I rate it a hair above Roll The Bones and Presto ( Counterparts was a brief comeback ) .The title cut is my favorite , which is typical of the formula of later Rush albums , best goes first then downhill from there.Also , Geddy 's vocals , which showed some signs of life on Counterparts , have returned to the robotic , monotone delivery we older fans loathe . A friend of mine who 's lost more than a few brain cells due to substance abuse actually thinks these songs are 'classics'in the same league as 'Fly By Night ' and 'Lakeside Park ' . I think he 's well , lost some brain cells .	-1
A fan of Rush since 1989 and an owner of all their albums , it was quite disheartening hearing _Test For Echo_ upon its release in the fall of 1996 . The basic Rush elements were there -- power riffs from Alex Lifeson , intricate basslines from Geddy Lee , melodic , powerful drumming from Peart , but , something was lacking . What was ultimately lacking was the songs themselves . Even one of the better songs on the album , the title track , contains awkward lyrics and phrases ( & quot ; tough talking hood boys & quot ; ... er ... ok ... . ) .There are plenty of powerful riffs on songs like & quot ; Driven , & quot ; & quot ; Dog Years , & quot ; and & quot ; Virtuality , & quot ; but the songs themselves come off pretty corny . Written during the wake of the internet , & quot ; Virtuality & quot ; is already painfully dated with a chorus that calls out to & quot ; net boys & quot ; and & quot ; net girls. & quot ; One can imagine what Neil Peart was thinking when he decided to tackle media overkill and the internet boom in the mid 90s , but perhaps more thought should 've gone into whether or not these lyrics would hold up . They really don't.Elsewhere , some songs sound like Rush on autopilot , most notably on & quot ; Half the World & quot ; and & quot ; The Color of Right , & quot ; which features for the first time , in my opinion , an extremely bland guitar tone from Lifeson . If you 're as big a Rush fan as me , you know how immediately recognizable Rush music is . When you 're hearing a new Rush song and thinking , & quot ; This sounds like it could be any band ... , & quot ; you know there 's a problem . Also disappointing on this album is Geddy Lee 's tame vocal deliveries . Considering he was coming off of some of his finest vocal performances ( 1993 's _Counterparts_ ) , it 's surprising that he sounds pretty much restrained and unenthusiastic on many of the songs on _Test for Echo_ . His layered vocals are also overdone and become more distracting than engagin.Are there good points to the album ? Of course . & quot ; Totem & quot ; is irresitably catchy and should be brought to life on tours in the future . & quot ; Resist & quot ; is also evocative with typically beautiful optimism from Peart 's lyrics . However , the bad unfortunately far outweighs the good . Luckily Rush would resurface with an incredibly powerful album , _Vapor Trails_ , six years later . If you 're looking for a taste of recent Rush , pick up that one instead of this . If you love all things Rush , then pick up _Test for Echo_ , but just keep in mind -- I love all things Rush too , excpet this album .	-1
The followup to `` Counterparts '' , released after Alex Lifeson 's guitar workout , `` Victor '' , `` Test For Echo '' is a continuation of the recession of synthesizers in Rush 's sound and a contineud growth from the band . This album , however , seems to miss the mark in many ways.It starts off great , two rocking songs , `` Test For Echo '' and `` Driven '' . `` Test For Echo '' has a great mysterious feel , a rocking chorus , and is just a blast , `` Driven '' is a workout , one of the best hard rock songs the band 's done , a driving bass/guitar doubling and a brilliant chorus with subtle drumming.But unfortunately , thats about it for the record , it really kind of falls apart after this -- ther 's some great moments , the bizarre rhythms and lyrics of `` Time And Motion '' and the mighty `` Resist '' , another superb Rush song come to mind , but some of the material falls flat -- `` Half the world '' feels like `` Nobody 's Hero '' , but without the bite , and some of the lyrics ( `` Dog Years '' , `` Virtuality '' ) just do n't make it . Much of the other material seems fairly uninspired -- `` The Color of Right '' , `` Totem '' , `` Limbo '' , etc. , they'r all ok songs , but the performances seem to fall flat . Actually , `` The Color of Right '' has great verses , but the chorus are just bizarrely awful , which is too bad , because the lyrics are really quite good.In the end , the album is vindicated by a few good tracks , but is overall a bit too uneven to be a fully enjoyable listen .	-1
Test For Echo has a few decent songs but as a whole this album is pretty much forgettable . The title track and virtuality rockharder than Rush as since it 's 2112 days . Unfortunately both songs are plagued by really bad lyrics . The two songs on this albums that are worth having are Driven and Resist . The version of Driven on Different Stages is more exciting as it has a wonderful live feel and sports a rare bass solo by Geddy Lee . I am not a fan of ballads but Resist has an emotional edge typical of the band . The rest of the songs you can listen to once or twice and never have a desire to hear ever again . Test For Echo like all Rush albums sports incredible muscianship . However the songwriting here is lacking . For diehard Rush fans only .	-1
I have been a Rush fan since the mid 1980 's , and was actually turned onto them by a OOP record called album called `` Archvies '' which was a 3record set of the first 3 Rush albums . From there I was hooked . Since I decided to take this CD for a Spin again for the first time in many years , it still does the same thing for me when I first purchased it . NOTHING ! I understand that true Rush fans will look into the work of the musicanship , and some fans based positive reviews for that aspect alone . Hey , do n't get me wrong , there are some cool things here ( some nice drum work , some good solos..but that is about it . The song writing is really lame . Dogyears is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard from Rush ( except maybe roll the bones ) and the rest of the album does nothing . I understand that Rush has turned away from its epic storytelling over the years and we will never again here anything like 2112 again . But thats no excuse to write such a poor album , espically to follow up Counterparts ( which is in my opinion the best Rush record since Grace under Pressure , and definalty the heaviest . Stay away from this..Rush can do better then this..and since I had such a bad taste in my mouth from this album , I ignored Vapor Trails , but I have heard some cuts off of it , and it sounds a whole lot better . Why any true Rush fan would love this album is beyond me . Maybe the fans who grew up with their mid 80 's work and really dont listen to the older stuff might like it . But I really doubt any person who thinks Farewell to Kings , Hemisphers , and 2112 were the best albums they did , would find this remotly interesting . DO yourself a favor..Avoid this and just pretend it didnt happen	-1
With more of an expiramental ege and less of a bad pop sheen then Phil Collins general fare Dance Into The Light is a 2 1/2 star album . Theres still a cover here and weak ballads and Phil did not even cowrite the lyrics of Lorenzo but theres some largly african world music here paralleling this album with ( the much better music artist ) Peter Gabriels Security and actually a few good songs .	-1
This album just plain SUCKED . I encourage change and experimenting but this album just showed that even phil collins can run out of material . For the first time it appeared as though phil was trying and even struggling to create . I have mixed emotions of anything he has done since but seriously . In that album the musicianship is phenomenal and there are so many people playing on it . Also , his drum patterns and acoustics were extraordinary . Dance into the light was dufficult to listen to . When I bought it in 1996 I had goosebumps the entire drive home waiting to listen to it . I remembering not even making it to the 4th song . It was hard to listen to . The drum patterns were weak . There was no real strong moments except for otta know by now which felt pretty rocky and convincing like most phil collins related material does . I was just disppointed . Daryl Steurmer 's presence was different as well . Look , I guess I am so used to phil doing such high quality stuff that when this came out I was just let down . Oh well , noone can stay on top forever .	-1
Since his solo career started in the 80 's Phil Collins has been a mastermind of pop music from the second British Invasion . As his time came into the mid 90 's , he had no place to go on the radio , and in the mainstream.His 1996 album , Dance Into The Light , is a bit more upbeat than Collins previous albums . Although the album is a complete turn from his 1993 album , Both Sides , the music proved to be a sorrowful project . The songs here are very much in-between , and only two songs stand out very well on the album , Dance Into The Light , and It 's In Your Eyes . The music borrows the feel of African rhythms and effects , but is nowhere near Peter Gabriel 's triumphs in African Beats . Surprisingly , the album was Phil 's last studio albbum , before announcing his departure from Genesis that same year.Although Phil Collins created many hit songs , this album is n't as big of a keeper as his 80 's albums , or his days with Genesis . Dance this one out of the light .	-1
Phil Collins at his worst & quot ; Dance Into The Light & quot ; is awful . The title song is a joke and sounded very forced , like he rushed to make and bring out a song from the subpar album . The single & quot ; Dance Into The Light & quot ; has no rhythm much less a hook . If people thought his album & quot ; Both Sides & quot ; was bad and I am not one of them , then this album will make the think again , when was the last time a Phil Collins album only produced one song . The thing that is a shame about this album is & quot ; It 's In Your Eyes & quot ; a song that could have done well if it was a follow up to a bad song , and was n't released right away . This album is a far cry from the & quot ; ... But Seriously & quot ; , & quot ; No Jacket Required & quot ; days . & quot ; Dance Into The Light & quot ; is one of the worst albums I own , and I own some bad ones , thank goodness Phil redeemed himself with & quot ; You 'll Be In My Heart & quot ; from & quot ; Tarzan & quot ; . Phil will release better material than & quot ; Dance Into The Light & quot ; let 's hope , from one of the best male voices in music .	-1
Buffalo Springfield has got to be the granddaddy of dysfunctional rock groups . On all 4 albums there was at least on member not around , and on this one it was Bruce Palmer the bassist . He was deported back to Canada for drug possession , and also for walking off the stage during a concert in which he , Neil Young , and Stephen Stills all got into a tizzie . The result would be that Palmer 's gone , and now you bring your sound engineer in the name of 19 year old Jim Messina , and you move on . The result is & quot ; Last Time Around & quot ; . By this time it was obvious no one was interested in going on . The material is at best experimental and creative in some spots , but other than that it was to fufill a contract , and let 's go our own ways . Of course set on a course of which music was going through a muck of mire where you had bands like The Yardbirds , Cream , The Troggs , and The Byrds breaking up , and others experiencing revival like Johnny Cash , Elvis Presley , and Dion , and others going through a transformation like Bob Dylan , The Moody Blues , and The Byrds , and then you mix into all this the ones going backwards like The Rolling Stones , and The Beatles , plus adding new blood to the mix like Blue Cheer , The Chambers Brothers , and Vanilla Fudge not to mention the artists who were still popular , and or up and coming , so it 's a interesting time to be a rock and roll star . However , with & quot ; Last Time Around & quot ; this was the end for Buffalo Springfield . Stills would join up with David Crosby , Neil Young would have a taste of freedom before joining Crosby and Stills at Woodstock , and Richie Furay , and Jim Messina would form Poco , and Messina leaves after 3 albums to join Kenny Loggins . The material here is very diverse , and rooted around soul , country , and blues . & quot ; On The Way Home & quot ; has a pop flavor which is very unusual for Neil Young , but to me is a very depressing Sunday record as it gives me melancholy of Sundays ending , and rest is almost over , and then back to the grind . & quot ; Pretty Girl Why ? & quot ; is also like & quot ; Incense and Peppermints & quot ; a rock and roll suicide . Also depressing , and then there 's & quot ; I Am A Child & quot ; the other contribution of Neil which shows what he would do a few years down the road with the album & quot ; Harvest & quot ; . & quot ; Uno Mundo & quot ; has a carribean flavor to the song , and it makes me wonder if they may have spent some time listening to Chris Montez , or Trini Lopez when doing this song . Probably my favorite tune here is Richie Furay 's song & quot ; Kind Woman & quot ; . It 's a nice slice of country music . However , with all the diversity , and talent the group would disband on May 5th , 1968 .	-1
I do n't know what these two 'musicians ' were thinking when they put out this album . It 's horrible . I am still wondering why I bought this in the first place . If you want real rap , then check out N.W.A . I ca n't stand to listen to a single song of theirs .	-1
I have this album somewhere lost in my house . Anyway this album only has about 3 good tracks . I really like the song with Aliyah though . RIP . This album has way too many interludes ! Corny . Cease is corny and so are the other guy rappers on this album . No wonder why Junior Mafia ai n't around no more .	-1
This album sucks . It has two songs on the entire album and they are get money and players anthem . They are only hot because big is on them . Even big admitted when he was alive that junior mafia was n't hungry . When you are n't hungry , you do n't make good music . The lyrics are weak and they have subpar beats . I hope they never make another album .	-1
I have this collection on vinyl and I 'd like to tell you not to buy this collection all of the hits that they originally recorded on Cadence are remakes and not the original Cadence recordings . For the original versions , they are on CD 's issued by Rhino , Ace , Bear Family and other labels ( one of the notable CD 's is Rhino 's & quot ; Cadence Classics : 20 Greatest Hits & quot ; ) . The tracks that were not on Cadence are available on other collections that Warner Bros. has issued such as the & quot ; Walk Right Back & quot ; 2 CD set and the & quot ; Golden Hits of The Everly Brothers & quot ; so buy those collections instead of this collection .	-1
The first time I listened to this thang ( when I was a tender teen rocker ) I though it was a joke.But then , many of my hard rock loving friends were so gung ho about it , I thought & quot ; I must be wrong & quot ; .Now that I 'm an old fart ( and proud of it ! ) , I listened to the thang again and boy , was I right ! Ian Gillan 's performance in Speed King really deserves a place in Rock History . Specifically under the chapter & quot ; Laughable Yelling Clowns & quot ; .	-1
Okay , I do n't think My Chemical Romance could churn out a song as banal or inane as `` Speed King '' if they tried , and that 's the second-best song on the album . Anybody else seeing a problem ? This erases all the effort by superior acts like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix to establish rock as a legitimate art form . Take `` Bloodsucker '' . It 's even duller than `` Speed King '' , believe it or not . Three of these songs run at epic lengths , including one ( `` Child in Time '' ) being stretched longer than ten - `` Child '' has got to be the most painful song Purple ever recorded , a blundered attempt to combine opera ( listen to Gillan 's shrieking vocal histrionics and Jon Lord 's painful haunted-house organ ) and hard rock ( listen to Blackmore 's unspectacular , clumsy , loud pentatonic twiddling ) . Sounds interesting in theory , but it 's a good thing virtually nobody else tried this . I ca n't call it the worst song on the album because it gave me a good chuckle ( which I 'm sure was n't intended ) , but it sure comes pretty close . The other two ( `` Flight of the Rat '' , `` Hard Lovin ' Man '' ) are basically just your average Deep Purple songs ( or , should I say , sub-average Deep Purple songs ) dragged out as long as possible . Ouch . `` Into the Fire '' is everything I hate about Deep Purple : soulless and derivative , with Gillan wailing away as usual . I 'm sorry , but I do n't like his voice . At all . Now I do like `` Livin ' Wreck '' - cool riff , interesting drumming - but it 's almost ruined by Ian 's shrieked backup vocals . This is insipid , soulless , and overrated . So 's Deep Purple . Go figure .	-1
I do n't agree with all these people who claim that `` In rock '' is a masterpiece . Of course it 's an album that helped developing rock music , but that is more because of the sound , or approach itself , than the actual quality in the songs . `` Speed king '' and `` Bloodsucker '' are good songs and so is parts of ( the much too long ) `` Child in time '' , where Ian Gillan show us all what a beautiful and powerful voice he have . I 'd spend my money on `` Machine head '' and `` Fireball '' before even considering buying this one.Maybe 2 stars is a bit too little , and 2.5 stars would be more correct .	-1
In the first place , I am FROM Atlanta , Georgia , and I AM PROUD TO BE FROM THE SOUTH ! And if liberal-guilt Randy do n't like it , he can ... ( I ca n't say it , Ammy wo n't publish it ) And I have played @ the bar where the cover pic was taken ... it 's an Ethiopian restaurant now . When are you liberals just going to let it go ? And ref the `` song '' `` Rednecks '' from this POS , we DO know our +++ from a hole in the ground !	-1
These guys were good ( to a certain point ) for three-minute songs . Five minutes it becomes hard to bear . But when they went into epic-prog-rock mode , boy , did they suck ! Why did they have a producer at all ? Should n't he have tied one of Jon Lord 's hands so he could only play two-finger riffs in his B3 ? As I said in other comment , DP will go into history thanks to Machine Head only ... and mostly thanks to the casino fire which FORCED them into basic-rock mode !	-1
In 2008 , WEA Japan released the entire WB Tower Of Power catalog in remastered form . All of the albums benefit from new mastering , and are worthwhile acquisitions for fans.I found all of the remastered material to be superior to the Rhino 2CD `` What Is Hip ? '' 1999 compilation set , except , surprisingly , for the material from the 3rd album , which sounds better on the Rhino.Amazon does a haphazard job of stocking these remasters , so you may have to seek them from Japan-based retailers . Also , Amazon 's prices are at least a third higher than buying direct from Japan , although shipping costs will cut into that percentage.Here are the links for the ` 08 remasters : East Bay GreaseBump CityTower Of PowerBack To OaklandUrban RenewalIn The SlotLive And In Living ColorAgain , it 's sad that American consumers have to obtain better sounding CD 's from another country . WEA , and now WMG , have long maintained a corporate policy of not upgrading their catalog under the `` they're- gon na -buy-it-anyway-so-why-waste-profits '' philosophy , no matter that rival Sony has made a lucative business model out of remastering nearly the entire Columbia records catalog . Although this internal policy was mandated by the WEA regimes of the past , Edgar Bronfman , the current WMG chief , has maintained the status quo.So , Tower Of Power now joins fellow WEA artists Jackson Browne , Ry Cooder , The Doobie Brothers , Tower Of Power , Neil Young , Van Dyke Parks , Little Feat , Van Morrison , America , Annie Haslam , Everything But The Girl , Roberta Flack , Todd Rundgren , Cold Blood and Paul Butterfield , just to name a few , whose catalogs either partially or wholly exist in better audio in Japan than here in the U.S.It 's a pathetic and frustrating situation .	-1
Has the Huffman lost his touch , or is being a celebrity wanabee going to his head ? It is very doubtful that this is from the original analog master tapes , and even the liners are very vague on the source used . Sonics tell the tale . There is lots of definition and detail , excellent separation , and as good a soundstage as this can have . But it still sounds digital , unlike the earlier Huffman remasterings for the defunct DCC . Clarity is favored over warmth , and the high end - cymbals in particular - sound bright and exhibit digititis.Not a bad remaster at all , and betters the stock Warners CD . But not up to the standards of DCC , or for that matter , anywhere close to what the Mobile Fidelity true analog , and true original master standard is.Not worth the money . Message to Huffman - upgrade your digital front end , and stick to original analog master tapes .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , this classic Alice Cooper album is worth 5 stars in my book , but this gold CD offers no improvement in sound quality over the unremastered one ( which you can buy dirt-cheap ANYWHERE ! ) .It 's still sounds thin and muddy , nowhere near as good as theBillion Dollar Babiesand theWelcome to My Nightmareremastered reissues Rhino put out a few years back.Save your money and buy/keep the old one !	-1
This is the first time I have not been satisfied with an Alice Cooper album ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I love all era 's from Alice , but this album I was expecting to all be as great as the title track , but sadly it almost felt like a couple of songs , and a few fillers ! I do n't see why all the fans are so into this album ? I do n't recommend this album for people wanting to start to get into the great Cooper legend.This has been the first album I have bought by Alice that I do not like ! ! ! ! This album does n't rock like a few have said . The only song that seems to be worth a listen to apart from the title track is `` Pubic Animal # 9 '' If your looking for the track of `` Schools Out '' and have n't heard of any of these songs , I suggest you skip this album and go for one of the 10,000 greatest hits Alice has out ; preferably `` Definitive '' or `` Monsters and mascara '' . But as a big fan of Alice , I dont see the hype in this album ? Apart from 2 tracks , its has bored me to sleep . Its no surprise to me now why I have n't seen any of the other tracks appear on greatest hits albums ! Only the die hard Alice fans , or the fans of the original band will praise this album . But this is by far no where even close to anything spectacular from Alice ! For a fan looking into new material , then it might be worth getting ? or for the collection ? but this is rare for me to say there 's an Alice album I do not like ! ! ! ! I only give it 2 stars for 2 great songs . The others just seem like tired filler material to me . Tho , be the judge for yourself , different tastes apply to different people ... .you might like it ? and it might just be me who does n't ?	-1
this is a very enjoyable cd but Year Of Sunday has always been my favorite seals & amp ; crofts album and i would love to see it released on cd . is anyone listening ?	-1
`` Who do we think we are '' is in fact a rather uninspired album . Maybe the guys blow it all on the previous and excellent `` Machine head '' and simply ran out of ideas . The best songs on the album are `` Mary Long '' and `` Woman from Tokyo '' , and they are indeed good . The rest is nothing to be excited about .	-1
For all the hoopla I expected better.This record sux.Save your money .	-1
I 'm assuming as it 's not stated by Amazon anywhere on this page to date that this is the Japanese mlps version and if so , this review refers to that version.This album is one of the greatest debuts ever by a rock band and is essential listening for fans and aspirants of good rock guitaring . Although all the tracks have been tuned down to E flat tuning for the guitar ( so if you 've been trying to play along with the cd and have been finding it hard to do so this is the reason ) some of rock guitar 's standards are on this album and especially so for `` Eruption '' which is a tour de force of guitar flash playing . The extremely tasty guitar licks on all the other tracks are also worth the purchase price of this baby.The remastering though is the 2001 version and so if you already have the old cd of this version , I 'm struggling to find any extra value that will justify the hefty price tag on this baby when you are essentially paying for cardboard that is n't one of the better mlps designs that I 've seen out there anyway . The cardboard is thin and flimsy and looks as if it will come apart once the glue gets old . For examples of good mlps designs , check out The Band and Hall & Oates releases which are simply works of art on good quality thicker and stronger cardboard.This is essential listening although this mlps version does not represent good value for money and if you already have a 2001 remastered version in the jewel case , you are better off sticking to it as this is no real upgrade to me .	-1
led zeppelin was much much better ! i do n't like this album at all ! this was a commecial album ! no good songs !	-1
I give credit to Deep Purple for being heavy metal and hard rock pioneers , but musically , I 've never found this band nearly as interesting , memorable or creative as their contemporaries . Ritchie Blackmore 's guitarwork is somewhat average . I mean , the main riff of Smoke on the Water , despite being a ballpark classic , just kind of sits there . It reminds me of a dumbed down heavy Cream riff . And vocally and lyrically , the band does n't have a whole lot to offer.I 've heard previous reviewers claim Deep Purple as being superior to Led Zeppelin , all I can say is `` to each his own '' . Led Zeppelin drew influences from a wide variety of music styles and where blessed with having a brilliant guitarist in Jimmy Page and strong rhythym section in Bonzo and JPJ who where intent on making a sound all their own . Some of Deep Purple 's stuff could have easily been passed off as any other early 70 's rock band . They neither have the creative song writing brilliance of Led Zep nor the elegantly sludgy heavy grooves of Black Sabbath . Even Jethro Tull has better moments.So , not a horrible band by any means , just not a very interesting one in my opinion .	-1
These Audio Fidelity gold CD 's become immediate collector items the second they stop releasing them . In my experience they 're largely hit and miss . The quality of the original recording ca n't be improved upon and that appears to be the case here . I do n't know if the original was loaded with hiss or some other noise but the upper frequencies are very attenuated on this recording . Very dry without much ambiance . I 've heard better .	-1
When I bought this Seals & Crofts ' `` Greatest Hits '' few years ago , I expected to get the whole package of hits , including `` My Fair Share '' and `` Get Closer '' , among other great S & C ; songs that are not included in this compilation.Now these 'funny ' guys at Rhino , just reissue the same album with a slightly 'masked ' edition ... The same songs , nothing extra ... What 's wrong with you , Rhino guys ? ? ? ...	-1
I liked this when it first came out b/c I was only 16 . I was a rebel , wanted to be part of something different . This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.My favorite song here is `` Mongoloid '' ... totally strange but rocking song . `` Uncontrollable Urge '' rocks ( in a weird way ) and Come Back Jonee is almost a conventional song . `` Satisfaction '' is a rather completely version but I can not call it a good song.The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS like , multi-media , making money kind of thing.I saw them live ( they were horrible ) during their heyday . The most interesting thing about them is that while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream , DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever . Mark Motherbaugh does a lot of soundtrack work ( Rugrats ) and you can hear the aspects of DEVO in all of his work.Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is . DEVO came out as a goof , not as serious musicians . They got big in the 70 's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids ( like me ) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own .	-1
First off , I 'd recommend you listen to Dirty Mind right after listening to this one . Does the word `` Quantum leap '' come to mind ? No ? Because it SHOULD . At this point , Prince was on the verge of a dynasty of sorts - Dirty Mind , Controversy , 1999 , Purple Rain , Arond the World in a Day , about half of Sign o ' the Times . I say `` On the verge of '' because , frankly , Prince was pretty far from his peak here , no matter what the two amazing singles may suggest . First off is `` I Wan na Be Your Lover '' , one of Prince 's earliest classics . The keyboards ! Listen to the keyboards ! It 's pretty much all Prince , and it 's one of his best one-man jams . The song 's pretty catchy , too , and tough not to dance to . `` I Feel For You '' is another good one - again , really catchy ! - but I feel Rufus did a better version of it myself . Hey , whatever , I know a great song when I hear one and that 's one . The third song I like is `` Why You Wan na Treat Me So Bad ? `` , a scorching funk-rocker . The guitar parts on `` Bambi '' are cool too , but its lyrics are homophobic and I 'm not down with that , as kids say today . Especially not coming from Prince , who at this point was pretty flamboyant about his sexuality ( Princesexual - that is , anyone and anything 's fair game ) even though he regularly denied it . Sweet guitars , though.Now , let 's talk downsides . I know `` Sexy Dancer '' is supposed to be a dance track , and I 'm not supposed to care about the lyrics , but they 're just dumb . They do n't offend me - I 've heard far worse , especially coming from Prince , who was always subtle as a jackhammer when it came to lyrics ( `` Soft and Wet '' , anybody ? ) And I 'm sorry , but I do n't think orgasms translate well into songs , though Prince obviously did because he simulated one on this track . Sorry , orgasm fans . It 's not very danceable either , so it can go into the trash bin . Furthermore , the ballads are dull , faceless , and interchangeable - `` When We 're Dancing Close and Slow '' ; `` With You '' ; `` Still Waiting '' ; `` It 's Gon na Be Lovely '' . Okay , so `` When We 're Dancing '' is more obscene than `` Darling Nikki '' and probably would 've made Tipper Gore 's head explode . That 's all that sets it apart . Obscene lyrics . And they are n't even funny , unlike the `` Orgasmatron '' lyric on `` Private Joy '' , a track from the great , underrated Controversy.This is a pretty bad album with two pretty good singles that you can get on any Prince greatest hits , even though this is the only place you can find the full-length `` I Wan na Be Your Lover '' - far superior to the radio version . Oh well . Just get it from iTunes or Yahoo ! Music or somewhere like that . Not from LimeWire though . I 've got huge anti-LimeWire biases after my experiences with it . I tried to download ONE song , and my entire iTunes library got deleted . I did n't even get my download , either . I 've hated LimeWire ever since . That and you 're pretty much stealing from the artists with LimeWire . If you 're gon na download , do it legally , unless you want to see musicians you like starve to death before they can make their next album . Honestly , they need all the money they can get . There . *Steps off soapbox* .	-1
The Rhino remaster is much better , and-Here you get a lot of bonus tracks ! Rhino=USD 10 . Mofi=USA 30 ! Muddy sound , muddy high 's . What a letdown-Save your money . Another reviewer is absolutely correct-The latest Mofi releases do not sound good .	-1
I have a few of the older gold cd 's from mfsl that are really a notch above anything else that was available . Great care was taken on each recording to get them to sound as best as possible before they were sold . Pretenders II and a few of the other mfsl discs I have bought lately actually sound worse than the regular cd releases . I dont get it . I say this in hopes that mfsl gets it together again so I can get some great sounding cd 's from them again .	-1
Wow I remeber what a huge disappointment this was after their sparkling debut . Sure there are 2 good songs ( Message of Love and Talk of the Town ) but I already had those on the EP . The rest is FILLER -- mediocre and dull . Skip this and get The Pretenders , Learning to Crawl and a Greatest Hits CD and that 's all the Pretenders you will ever need .	-1
Do n't let Genius Of Love fool you . Although & quot ; Genius & quot ; is one of my favorite songs of all time , this is without question the worst album I have ever bought . Not one of the worst - the single worst album I have ever bought . Stay away ! ! ! I beg of you .	-1
THE MAIN WORTHWHILE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE OF COURSE , & quot ; GENIOUS OF LOVE & quot ; N ' & quot ; UNDER THE BOARDWALK & quot ; NUFF SAID !	-1
As an album , I give it a star ; the hit singles are fantastic , but the album as a whole is worthless.At the time , Talking Heads had just done 'Remain in Light ' , a collection of droning , hypnotic funk grooves which remains their masterpiece . The writing and production credits were shared by David Byrne and Brian Eno , and the rest of the band were somewhat miffed at being turned into session musicians . To compensate , bass guitarist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz formed the Tom Tom Club , who were very briefly almost as popular as Talking Heads , although they blew it with this , their debut album.Rather like Frankie Goes to Hollywood a few years later , the Tom Tom Club had three big hit singles which everybody remembers and/or likes . 'Wordy Rappinghood ' and 'Genius of Love ' are excellent , highly influential dance/pop/rap numbers which sound like nothing else ; a combination of girlie vocals , simple tunes and charming early-80s rap production , child-like and hip at the same time . Their version of 'On the Broadwalk ' took the child-like into the realms of the childish , and was subsequently overshadowed by Bruce Willis ' masterful rendition on his classic album 'The Return of Bruno ' , which I play every single day ; not just because it 's a wonderful piece of music , but because it 's a highly erotic emotional statement , too . Europe was the birthplace of Nazism , Fascism , Communism and more murderous ideologies than any other continent on Earth ; it 's a decadent wasteland that would benefit the world greatly by dying . 'L'Elephant ' is sung in French and tells the tale of an elephant and a hippo who don human clothes for the purpose of terrorising the local population but - but ! - they find that the people are scared of a war which was started by human beings , and thus the elephant and the hippo do n't need to terrorise etc . It 's fun . 'Tom Tom Theme ' is just an extra bit on the end of 'Genius of Love ' , and that 's how you make the first side of an album ! Easy ! The second side of the album awakens sadness within me . 'As Above , So Below ' and 'Lorelei ' are both dull , repetitive dirges which probably sounded great in the studio , and I can picture the band high-fiving each other and nodding their heads smugly , but they 're torture to listen to - just like listening to someone being tortured , in fact . 'On , On , On , On ' is shorter and has a chorus , but it 's excruciatingly bad , and I have no idea what 'Booming and Zooming ' sounds like because it was n't released on the UK version of the album . Unless it 's the equal of 'A Day in the Life ' or 'Ice Ice Baby ' I ca n't see it influencing my negative opinion of this album . Good day to you , miss .	-1
In 1982 , Laurie Anderson , already in her thirties , astonishingly was kept off the top of the British singles charts only byDavid A. Stewartand Barbara Gaskin 's remake ofLesley Gore 's `` It 's My Party '' . `` O Superman '' also was a top thirty hit in Australia , and as a result Laurie Anderson was able to establish herself in the musical field despite the fact that many critics recognised that she was never truly `` musical '' in character and remained chiefly a performance artist all along.It is true that being a performance artist is not necessarily opposed to the making of music at its best . Kate Bush and George Clinton , for instance , have shown the ability to produce theatrical works that had some amazing musical talent onHounds of LoveandMothership Connection . However , even with Bush , there existed a tendency for mer music to improve when she focused more deeply on it rather than on the visual aspects as she did in her earliest days as a performer . The tendency is further supported by Laurie Anderson 's musical career , and plagues `` Big Science '' throughout . There are many problems with the record , not least of which being that , apart from `` O Superman '' itself , there is hardly a single memorable hook line at any point on the record . Even the whispered hook of `` O Superman '' does not have the impact one would expect from an arty female singer/songwriter , whilst `` Walking and Falling '' really shows the lack of musicality on the album , being in fact not so different from the dated spoken passages that one hears on popular songs from the era . `` Born Never Asked '' , though longer , has also aged very badly with the electronic drums being so much a staple of 1980s pop music , even if the production is so sparse it is easy to think otherwise without the clue provided by the strings.The music on tracks like `` Walking and Falling '' and `` Let X=X '' suffers equally badly from the dated and even syrupy synthesised strings , percussion and vocoders . More than that , when it does get moving , only `` From The Air '' manages to sustain any sort of momentum . That song definitely does predate the horrible techno music , which came to be a prominent part of the charts in the middle 1990s , but features an impressive , single-note trumpet line that ties the piece together in a way Anderson never manages at any other point on `` Big Science '' , creating a sound that is close to funk but avoids the potential stereotypes of that genre.There are a number of great female artists who managed to take the pioneering work of the first generation of female singer/songwriters into the 1980s and beyond , such as Kate Bush , the Cocteau Twins , Dead Can Dance and Kristin Hersh . In comparison to any of those , `` Big Science '' is amazingly slight and lacking energy .	-1
I bought this record as a curiosity . I like electronic music of the early 1980s and am always looking for different , more obscure artists to check out . I also like to try out experimental records . I have a few Kraftwerk and John Foxx LPs and a few odds and ends . I 've seen this 1982 release many times and was attracted to the retro cover . I have one of David Van Tieghem 's ( who plays percussion here ) albums which I thought was OK but nothing spectacular . I finally decided to give Big Science a try . Lyrically , it is interesting with intriguing themes and images but , musically , it is not something I want to listen to over and over . Other experimental albums I have offer enough accessible , melodic and catchy riffs that bring me back to further listens . This album does n't offer much in the way of memorable melodies . The only track I enjoyed on a musical level was `` Born , Never Asked '' which offers a nice violin part the effect of which reminds me of some of Gary Numan 's Telekon tracks . The rest of the album is made up of spoken word and repetitive riffs that at best are unmemorable and at worst grating . `` From the Air '' ( 4:29 ) -- Mysterious opening jazzed up by the addition of a saxophone . Spoken word lyrics are of the captain of a plane giving crash instructions to the passengers . `` Big Science '' ( 6:14 ) -- Slow , dark , and quiet track about the building plans of a future big city . I like the lyrics , especially the line `` You know , I think we should put some mountains here . Otherwise , what are the characters going to fall off of ? `` `` Sweaters '' ( 2:18 ) -- Annoying number , luckily a short one . Bagpipe background , with Anderson singing in a kind of Middle Eastern wail and saying `` I no longer love the color of your sweaters '' and other things . `` Walking & Falling '' ( 2:10 ) -- The words are the best part of this track : `` You 're walking . And you do n't always realize it , but you 're always falling . With each step , you fall forward slightly and then catch yourself from falling . '' Just quiet electronics in the background . Not much to this track musically . `` Born , Never Asked '' ( 4:56 ) -- Spoken words with not much if any musical accompaniment begin this track which is hard to distinguish from the last track until the violin kicks in . I really like the violin in this one . Musically , it is my favorite on this album . It reminds me of something Gary Numan would put out during his Telekon sessions . `` O Superman ( For Massenet ) '' ( 8:21 ) -- This track has an annoying `` hu hu hu hu hu '' background which runs through the entire track -- only being spared by it getting quieter and a little less obtrusive as the song progresses . The words seem to have an anti-industrial/military complex message : `` So hold me , Mom , in your long arms , your petrochemical arms , your military arms , in your electronic arms . `` `` Example # 22 '' ( 2:59 ) -- Annoying track . Kooky saxophone , some wailing , German words in parts , whining `` No no-no-no-no no no no '' at the end . Not a pleasant listen . `` Let X=X '' ( 3:51 ) -- Very electronic with some robotic sounds covering the spoken words . Then a trombone comes in ( odd ) . `` It Tango '' ( 3:01 ) -- These last two tracks run together so it is very hard to distinguish one from the other . Both are so unmemorable that I guess it does n't matter that they are two songs . This track has quiet electronics , claps , and spoken words which are often `` Is n't it just like a woman ? '' The last line is `` Your eyes . It 's a day 's work just looking into them . '' Sometimes this album felt like work listening to it .	-1
For anyone wondering why David Lee Roth was finally fired , this extremely weak 1982 release is all that needs to heard.Clocking in at a scant 31 minutes and featuring five covers , this is Van Halen as cash cow with minimal effort that Roth envisioned . And in this incredible era of mega-selling albums , mega-tours and mega-parties that seemingly would last forever , the record company would not balk as long as units could be shipped and sold.The band had been in the fast lane , touring virtually non-stop since 1977 and quickly progressing from clubs/small halls to become an arena/stadium monster that was propelling the music industry , while recording a wealth of new material . Roth wanted a party-hearty band while Eddie Van Halen had his focus on the craft of making music.This ship was starting to sink , but Eddie Van Halen was able to patch up the holes in the hull before the band became a parody of itself , with Roth as the drum major .	-1
There r 2 good songs on here . If you wan na find a good album by Vizzan Halen , get the third ! ! ! ! It has the singer from one of the GRIZZEATEST BANDS EVER : EXTREME ! David & Sammy are DONE ! You 're 15 mins of fizzame are OVER , dudes ! Just download the 2 good songs !	-1
THis is the wortst Van Halen album . 29 minutes long , filled with covers and second-rate compositions by the band . But fans are fans and forget to see how this is a product clearly released in a hurry , just to satisfy record deals with the record company . Except LITTLE GUITARS , ... . For your information , I sold my copy of this `` thing '' a few days ago .	-1
Frankly , I do n't know what Van Halen was thinking when they recorded this album . We do know that & quot ; Fair Warning & quot ; did not do well , so perhaps the band felt that in order to reobtain commerical success , they should play cover songs . Well , it worked in that regard , but this is an absolute creative nadir for the band.Of course , there are two originals on this album which do stand out : & quot ; Secrets & quot ; and & quot ; Little Guitars & quot ; . These two pieces have instrumental preludes in common , & quot ; Cathedral & quot ; and & quot ; Little Guitars ( Intro ) & quot ; , and they again serve notice that Edward was indeed king of rock guitar mountain . & quot ; Secrets & quot ; is beautiful , complete with electric 12 string guitar and beautiful vocal harmonies , while & quot ; Little Guitars & quot ; is unique because Ed is , in fact , playing a little guitar . It 's also a darn good song.Then we have two other originals : & quot ; Hang Em High & quot ; and & quot ; The Full Bug & quot ; . Uninspired , at best . Sure , they sound good , but this sounds like Van Halen is going through the motions and not being truly creative.The rest of the songs are covers : & quot ; Where Have All The Good Times Gone ? & quot ; , & quot ; Pretty Woman & quot ; ( with another prelude , & quot ; Intruder & quot ; , to open it ) , & quot ; Dancing In The Streets & quot ; , & quot ; Big Bad Bill ( Is Sweet William Now ) & quot ; , and & quot ; Happy Trails & quot ; . At least & quot ; Big Bad Bill & quot ; has the late Jan Van Halen playing clarinet to give the song some credibility , and we can gather from & quot ; Happy Trials & quot ; that Ed and Michael Anthony are truly talented when it comes to background vocals . But five albums into their career , the question to ask is whether or not Van Halen should have taken this career path . In interviews since the release of & quot ; Diver Down & quot ; , Ed has slammed the album , while David Lee Roth defends it as a good party record . Yeah , it 's good as a coaster.Be your own judge , but if you buy this , do n't expect the Van Halen of & quot ; Fair Warning & quot ; .	-1
Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe only 15 minutes of original material , this album seems more like a contractual obligation than a proper album that Van Halen would make , especially in their 80s heyday with Diamond Dave . Their covers of & quot ; Pretty Woman & quot ; and & quot ; Dancing in the Streets & quot ; are inspired , but hardly make the entire album worthy of purchase . & quot ; Little Guitars & quot ; is a great Van Halen song , but not considered a classic . If you are a true Van Halen nut , or a completist , by all means buy this one , but if you 're casual , stick with its predecessor & quot ; Fair Warning & quot ; or its follow-up , the monumental & quot ; 1984 & quot ; .	-1
This is only for die hard fans ! With hindsight you might wonder if the band already had decided to break up . The songs are far from the high standard we got used to from albums like `` Van Halen I '' and Van Halen II '' , but they do a great version of The Kinks `` Where have all the good times gone ? '' . I guess Van Halen asked themselves that question , or at least should have .	-1
This is the typical product Van Halen 's critics feed upon . It is confusing , a few covers acting as fillers , it has only 30 minutes of music . Very , very weak . Only & quot ; LITTLE GUITARS & quot ; is a great tune . For a real and lucid VH fan , this is on the theirs leatest fine moments .	-1
DIVER DOWN is Van Halen 's most artistically bankrupt album . Cited by both Van Halen brothers as their least favorite album , DIVER DOWN marks a vast departure from its predecessor , FAIR WARNING , returning the band to their party hearty image . Roth was behind the drastic changes behind the record . This album is not only Van Halen 's weakest album , but overall one of the most puzzling records in all of rock . DIVER DOWN is very reactionary . The album points to Roth trying to reclaim the audience they lost with FAIR WARNING , as DIVER DOWN is the polar opposite of that album . Like all Roth Van Halen albums , the album is very brief , being only 31 minutes long , which has always irritated me.The album sounds like it has a personality crisis . David wanted to do a covers record to move product , while Eddie wanted to maintain some shreds of artistic credibility , and the quality album is a causality of this tension between the two dominant personalities of the band . The sound and atmosphere is a total retreat from the darkness of FAIR WARNING , and the only reason for the retreat is Van Halen selling out . This selling out indicates lack of integrity and total artistic bankruptcy.For fans of bands , I always recommend listening to the albums in chronological order . It gives a sense of history . When you get to DIVER DOWN , you realize that the band is simply running on empty , they 're looking to reinvent themselves after the hideous darkness of FAIR WARNING , and they 're simply running out of ideas.Let 's look at a little history . In 1982 , when Van Halen released DIVER DOWN , they had just come off a major tour in support of FAIR WARNING . FAIR WARNING met with a rather chilly reception . That record was a very dark , mean spirited album , brimming with anger , immorality , and rough lifestyles . By the time FAIR WARNING had come out , the band was known for their party , over the top lifestyle , and Eddie 's guitar heroics . While the guitar work certainly stayed amazing , FAIR WARNING simply did not sell well , and is still even to this day Van Halen 's least commercially successful album due to its dark intensity.When the time came to record FAIR WARNING 's followup , Roth wanted to change directions . He and the record company began operating on the philosophy that if you start out with a hit song , you 're half-way to a commercially successful recording . While the rest of the band disagreed with this ideology , they acquiesced to Roth.Another issue contributing to DIVER DOWN 's overall weakness is the band had been touring nonstop since 1977 , and they were exhausted . The band were going on vacation , but recorded a single which went became successful enough that Warner Brothers wanted an album to go with the single.Originally , the album 's initial sessions began when the band tried recording their next single . They started out with Martha Reeves and The Vandellas hit song , `` Dancing in the Streets . '' Eddie expressed difficulty recording the song , as he simply could not get a real handle . They then proceeded to record `` Pretty Woman '' at Eddie 's suggestion . The intro , `` Intruder '' , which Dave claims to have written , was composed specifically to take up time on the controversial video that MTV banned , as the song was about two minutes too short for the film they shot on the video . Rather than edit down the film further , they just wrote an extended intro.Taking the hit song philosophy to its utmost , Van Halen recorded no less than five cover songs , almost half the album . Of these five songs , one is a Kinks song ( the band was hoping to replicate the success of the `` You Really Got Me '' cover on their first album ) , the second is `` Pretty Woman , '' the third is the totally incompatible `` Dancing in the Streets '' , the absolutely bizaare `` Big Bad Bill ( Is Sweet William Now ) '' , and the fifth is the joke recording `` Happy Trails . '' While the Kinks cover does n't sound that out of place on a Van Halen album , both `` Pretty Woman '' and `` Dancing in the Street '' are obviously signs of a band selling out and just looking for a hit . Eddie has cited the `` Dancing '' cover as the worst Van Halen commercial recording , and for good reason . It 's a good song , but totally out of sync with Van Halen 's overall image and sound . `` Happy Trails '' sounds little more than a drunken joke recorded to allievate otherwise boring and monotonous sessions . `` Big Bad Bill '' has a nice vaudeville feeling to it , but again , this is Van Halen . You do n't listen to Van Halen for vaudeville , and is probably the most ridiculous thing they ever recorded . The song is notable for featuring Jan Van Halen ( the brothers ' father ) playing clarinet.With the five covers discussed , that leaves only seven original tracks . Three of those are short instrumental tracks . `` Cathedral '' is one of Eddie 's most enthralling guitar instrumentals , primarily because when you listen to it you think it 's an organ and you wonder how did he get that music on a guitar . `` Intruder '' is filler written because the video ran longer than the song , although by segue-waying right into `` Pretty Woman '' it does give `` Pretty Woman '' a rather ominous tone not present in the original song . `` Little Guitar '' is a totally unnecessary intro . If they wanted to make it include it as part of the main body of the `` Little Guitar '' song , there was no reason to make it a separate track.With the covers and the instrumentals dispensed with , that leaves a paltry four major Van Halen originals . `` Hang ` Em High '' is a decent enough track . `` Secrets '' never did anything for me . `` Little Guitars '' has a strange Mexican flavour too it , and while nothing particularly wrong with it , there 's nothing real memorable about it either . The song was improvised and recorded live.That leaves only one song left . `` The Full Bug . '' This track has sizzling guitar work , great vocals , and just a fantastic song to rock out too . This is the only time on the entire album where the entire band just clicks . This is vintage Van Halen right here , and easily on level with anything on the first four albums and 1984 . Unfortunately , one song can not carry an album . ( Take note , American Idol winners ) .Eddie Van Halen despises this album . As Eddie says , he 'd rather have a flop with his own songs ( which he did flop , and flop hard , with VAN HALEN III ) than have hits with other peoples ' songs . And he 's right.DIVER DOWN has too much filler , has too many covers , does n't have enough originals , and of the originals , only one really rises to former Van Halen standards . It has a very cold , calculating feel to it , like the record execs and the band were more interested in restoring the band to their commercial zenith and forget anything about making good music.Overall , DIVER DOWN solidified Eddie 's opposition to recording music solely to sell . After DIVER DOWN , Eddie formed his own studio where he would have complete artistic control over Van Halen 's music . Likewise , Van Halen never recorded covers again ( the sole exception being OU812 's closing song `` Apolitical Blues . `` ) Ultimately , DIVER DOWN is Van Halen 's most dispensable album . While I 've been pretty damning about the whole album , I will say it 's a very , easy listen , and is very uncharactestic of the band . But while it 's light and fun , it 's also fluff . Nothing really to return to once the album finishes , and it 's only a mere 31 minutes long . It 's like cotton candy . No real substance .	-1
This is the worst VH album of all time ( including the ones with Sammy Hagar ) . Do n't even argue with me , you know I 'm right . `` Fair Warning '' was their last amazing set of hard-rocking original tunes and VH obviously tried to keep that gravy train rolling by quickly releasing a follow-up . Their poor unsuspecting fans ( me included ) bought it immediately in the hope that it was 1/10th what `` Fair Warning '' was . Boy , were we all wrong ! Eddie 's guitar work is wimpy throughout , Dave sounds completely unfocused ( can you say `` sex , drugs , rock-n-roll '' MINUS the `` sex '' and `` rock-n-roll ? `` ) , and the only hit-worthy tunes were covers . They did n't even pick cool songs to cover ( except for `` Where Have All The Good Times Gone '' by the Kinks , which , by the way , was a lame and obvious attempt at recapturing the magic of `` You Really Got Me , '' from the first album . So sad ) . `` Dancing In The Street '' ( ? ! ? ! ? ) Are you kidding me ? ! CRAP ! ! ! Yeah , that really rocks , guys ! Good job ! ! This is the only VH album I did not buy on CD and I have no plans of ever doing so . If you gave it to me plus $ 5 , I might put it in my collection , but I doubt it . I 'd probably just stomp on it ... in the street , of course !	-1
If you have tha bad luck of owning this CD by VAN HALEN , there 's still time to sell it ... THis is the worst VAN HALEN album in the DAvid Lee Roth era , simple as that . Only two good songs here : LITTLE GUITARS and SECRETS . The rest is discardable .	-1
I 've got a warning for you , a naive beginner in terms of Van Halen . Probably you are aware of the & quot ; conrtoversy & quot ; surrounding whos is ( or was ) the best singer in Van Halen . To avoid that kind of controversy , I will give you a list containg an album by each of its singers for you to avoid at all costs : * Gary Cherone - VAN HALEN III * Sammy Hagar - OU812 * Dave Lee Roth- DIVER DOWN.DIVER DOWN is a heartless product , only 29 minutes long , filled with covers , no & quot ; chemistry & quot ; or idendtity connecting the songs . A real waste of time and money .	-1
I wonder how much pressure the badn was suffering to fulffil his contracts with the record companies . Only this justifies the absurd low quality of this DIVER DOWN . Only thirty minutes of music , mostly covers , some tasteless instrumentals . It seem another band altogether . THis was their first clear failure after four great albuns .	-1
This is the one Van Halen album that never should have been made . The fact that half of its songs are covers is bad enough , but most of the covers are poorly chosen , and of the originals , all but one or two are total crap . Avoid this album ; in fact do n't even ask for it for Christmas or Chanukah . I 'm not .	-1
This is the quintessential filler album and the worst VH release of all time . There 's only a handful of decent tracks on this album ; these being : Hang 'Em High , The Full Bug , Little Guitars , and Cathedral . Dancing in the Street is simply atrocious . The less said about ( Oh ) Pretty Woman the better . I do n't even know what to say about Big Bad Bill ( Is Sweet William Now ) - is n't this supposed to be a hard rock album ? Happy Trails is just a waste of time . What were they thinking when they recorded this drivel ?	-1
If you 're thinking of buying the Audio Fidelity version because you believe it wo n't have any compression , do n't because it does . Despite the marketing claims on the cover there is compression . The cover states `` The original dynamic range of this recording was not maximized , brickwalled , limited , or compressed in anyway during remastering . '' Just put up Space Invader ( as and example ) from this release in any garden variety audio editing program and compare it to the 1980 's cd version and you 'll see that some substantial limiting and compression has be done.Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman have really tarnished their image with this one , and the fact that emails to AF have not been answered makes me think they do n't care what they 're selling . So if the 'no compression ' thing is deceptive , what else about this reissue also is ? Is it from the master tapes ? Personally , I 'm not going to buy anymore AF or Hoffman releases because I do n't like being lied to and I no longer trust them.BTW , the one star is for the AF release , not the music which is 5 stars all the way .	-1
Echo & The Bunnymen , are one of those bands ( like My Bloody Valentine or Depeche Mode ) that everyone tells me I am going to like , but do n't . I am a huge fan of a lot of 80 's brit-pop ( The Smiths , The Cure , Aztec Camera , etc . ) but these songs just do n't compel me . I will say the guitar playing is excellent and these guys really gel together as a band , but the melodies are not exceptional and the songwriting lackluster . Maybe this is not a good place to start or maybe I am too young ( or old ) to `` get '' this band , but I have to be honest : Not impressed . '	-1
not very good . but i heard that title track for the FIRST time the other day -- apparently , everyone else on the planet has heard it hundreds of times -- and i was won over momentarily . i soon found the CD used for $ 4.99 and decided to pick it up . there are unfortunately two skips in & quot ; alice 's restaurant & quot ; and the rest of the stuff is forgettable . ah well .	-1
What happened to the band ! In the three year span between & quot ; Wild Planet & quot ; and this album , they seem to have completely abandoned the cool guitar-rock they were purveying on the first couple of collections , and replaced it with a bunch of dorky synthy crap with no hooks or interesting melodies . The songs sound like they 're being played on a MIDI file , for Christ 's sake ! & quot ; Legal Tender & quot ; is the only song which approaches decency on the album , and even that one has an annoyingly wishy-washy synth section throughout the entire song . The rest of the album -- & quot ; Work That Skirt , & quot ; & quot ; Big Bird , & quot ; & quot ; Songs For A Future Generation & quot ; -- UGH . Horrible . The biggest one-album downturn that I 've ever heard . Straight from their zenith to their nadir . Recommended only to & quot ; Best Of The '80s ! & quot ; compilation lovers who actually think & quot ; Come On Eileen & quot ; is a decent song .	-1
Yeah the hits were hot and heavy when this album was released but guess what ? Van Halen does not stand the test of time.Their appeal starts to wear thin.How much of Roth 's stupidity and Eddie 's same old guitar riff can you take ? ?	-1
2 stars for the solo in Jump , the riff in Panama and the tapping at the start of Hot for Teacher . The rest of the album sucks .	-1
Doing far more damage than their mega-selling debut , `` 1984 '' helped launch the mainstream explosion of the West Coast hair metal assault by proving that smooth pop hooks and synthesizers could be applied for plenty of crossover appeal without losing the so-called `` edge '' ( though most of these bands were about as sharp as a dulled butter knife ) . By giving license to this sort of exercise in neon-washed mummer acting , this album can take a greater share of the blame than nearly any other.There 's no denying the guilty pleasure appeal of a hit like `` Panama , '' but `` Hot For Teacher '' is medicore even for a dunderheaded slab of energetic sleaze rock and `` Jump '' is sabotaged by their new found adoration for the synthesizer ( the energetic performance is in stark contrast to the mechanical musical makeup ) . `` I 'll Wait '' falls somewhere in between , sounding like a cross between `` Jump '' and their 1991 megahit , `` Right Now . '' The filler between the radio wonders , though , are pretty tame . `` Top Jimmy '' has a pretty bad vocal performance ( and a rather dull punk-ish melody ) , `` Drop Dead Legs '' drags where it tries to strut , and the mediocre leftover from their early days , `` House of Pain , '' simply stumbles . Only `` Girl Gone Bad '' is worth hearing , but by then , you 'll probably be too sick of this album to care anymore.Best cuts : `` Panama , '' `` Girl Gone Bad , '' `` I 'll Wait ''	-1
Alright man ! This is the coolest Van Halen album , David Lee Roth has sex with more women on this album than any other album , from his teacher at school to some girl in the street with 'Drop Dead Legs ' , so many groupies and he had sex in Panama City as well ! Way to go David , it 's his biggest score card yet ! And yet ... .And anyway , this album sold lots of units , so if there was any fault in this album , well , who cares , right ? I mean every critic from here to Saudi Arabia gives it 5 stars and says it 's a masterpiece ( well , not in Saudi Arabia , where it 's banned ... oh wait , it 's not banned , they do n't understand the sexed lyrics ) and if you gave it a two-star review on Amazon.com ... .. well , I 'm sure there would be some interesting comments to read about your review , but ... Formulas are formulas , and this album is like a couple of masterpieces followed by a few formulas , and the formulas defintiely ouweigh the masterpieces ... .That formula , by the way , is sex sex and more sex . David Lee Roth had became a parody of himself . When on 'Women and Children First ' he dubbed the teachers at school 'Fools ' and was able to pull out sarcasm like 'the circus is back in town ' , well now he 's 'hot ' for the same teachers . He was no longer a rebel having fun , he was a man living up to an image , an expectation . Well , hey , 'Jump ' was a fine pop song , an excellent one at that . It was synthesisers and David showing his soft side ... but it was an excellent song , and then 'Panama ' was a powerful rocker , with anthemic chorus and when he talks about 'can you feel the heat ' , well , you really could . Then comes the humourous 'Top Jimmy ' , which has charm . And then ... Well there 's a song called 'Drop Dead Legs ' , which is kind of predictable , a fairly joyless hard-rock number . And then there are cliche 'd songs like 'Hot for Teacher ' and then songs like the keyboard heavy 'I 'll wait ' and the dispirited 'House of pain ' lacks the exuberance of earlier Van Halen material.Ultimate you are left with an album that begins terribly well , but ultimately goes stale with the same formula , and lacks a lot of the fun of their earlier albums . It 's not quite a pass ; Rating **	-1
This album is by Boingo as Oingo was dropped from the title . It is not the only thing missing in this album . Oingo Boingo 's music was always dark with a somewhat danceable beat to it . This album is just dark and really has no sing along songs on it . Not the kind of cd you want to play at a party . It is so different from other cds put out by Oingo Boingo that you scratch your head and ask yourself why would they release as this their last cd ? Huge Oingo Boingo fan ... .so - so fan of Boingo .	-1
Just a little to modern for my taste , he is a real artist somewhat under appreciated unlike the gold rush currently waz zup in the industry .	-1
This CD is boring- somewhat original but boring . The only good song on it is `` Glamorous Life '' and I downloaded that . Skip this unless you 're over the age of 40 . Definetly skip Trina 's `` The Glamorest Life '' which is 100 % trash .	-1
after coming off there Best Album with `` What time is it '' they release this very Average set . `` Jungle Love '' was catchy & got alot of Love for a good minute as did `` The Bird '' .I Liked `` My Drawers '' but overall this Album felt Campy & kinda Cold without any kind of knockout Punch.while there Performances in `` Purple Rain '' were tight it did n't translate to the Album though for me.while they got More Cross-over with this Album it also became there Watered Down Period.I always say that if Prince did n't have His Purple Claws all over this Band who knows How far & big they might have gotten ?	-1
During my spring housekeeping ( I know - it 's a little late ) , I discovered this CD gathering dust . I bought How Will The Lone Wolf Survive ? on the strength of the cover song ` Will The Lone Wolf Survive ? ' The song is a bouncing jangle-guitar light rocker reminding me of Bruce Springsteen . The other tracks are mediocre Tex-Mex boogey-woogey and honky-tonk which I wound expect to hear from a local bar band . ` Do n't Worry Baby , ' ` I Got Loaded , ' and ` Evangeline ' are simplistic boogey-woogey tunes with different lyrics . ` Corrido # 1 ' and ` Serenata Nortena ' are about as exciting as mariachi music played by a three-piece combo in a franchised Mexican restaurant . Terribly annoying is the ever present accordion ( a musical instrument which does absolutely nothing for me ) . The never ending four-note country bass lines ( Our Last Night , The Breakdown ) bore me to tears . It 's tough to pick the least credible track , but the title goes to ` I Got To Let You Know . ' The song has a brief saxophone line repeated 100 times . Is this supposed to be a polka ? Now I 'm wandering why this CD has been taking valuable space in my music collection since 1984 . Time for the trash .	-1
Nearly every cut of this album is a digrace to everythingGeorge Benson represents.From his obvious face job on the cover and the souless elevator muzak inside his 'Breezin'-era material sounds like HARDCORE funk-jazz by comparasin ! But at the end he sticks on a swingin ' rendition of Bobby Darin'sstandard reinvented but another talented singer.It 's one ofGeorge Benson 's best numbers and the ONLY thing making thisdull album worth anything.But borrow this from a friend ; it isn'tworth your time to buy it .	-1
Everything on George Benson 's & quot ; 20/20 , & quot ; from the artist 's uneasy smile and mismatched clothes on the back cover , to the studio guest Hessians ( Richard Marx , Patti Austin , & quot ; JT & quot ; Taylor , Michael Sembello , members of Toto ) who intersected with Benson at the 17 studios this was recorded at , spells PRODUCTION . It 's the opposite of jazz , what Benson does best , and is among the weakest albums of his long career.Producer Russ Titleman and the studio crew pour so much dance technopoop ( strings/horns/drum programming ) over the songs that Benson 's voice , ( not the strongest part of his talents ) let alone his still-great jazz guitar , is lost in the mix . Occassionally , Benson breaks free on the Neil Larsen 's instrumental & quot ; Stand Up , & quot ; on a swinging & quot ; Beyond The Sea & quot ; ( w/real horns ! ) and with a touching Sam Cooke-style vocal on the Womacks ' & quot ; New Day. & quot ; But the rest of the set is filled with sappy ballads ( one a duet with Roberta Flack featuring some of Linda Creed 's weakest and , unfortunately , last lyrics ) and uptempo songs that either take off on other hit songs ( the title track recalls the Pointer Sisters ' hits of the time ) or Benson 's own ( & quot ; Please Do n't Walk Away & quot ; rips off & quot ; Turn Your Love Around. & quot ; ) No wonder Benson returned to traditional jazz shortly after this release with the sweet & quot ; Tenderly & quot ; and a series of fine releases for GRP . That later success renders & quot ; 20/20 & quot ; an easily overlooked mistake in Benson 's catalogue .	-1
I really hate giving bad reviews , especially to George Benson , who I like very much . Some have a dislike of his late ` 70s jazz/soul music ( `` This Masquerade , '' `` Love Ballad , '' etc . ) , but I 'll happily listen to it any time . And I even got into his first two ` 80s releases ( `` Give Me the Night , '' `` In Your Eyes , '' ) , which pretty much eschewed jazz for a more pop/R & B ; fan base.But with all the Benson albums out there for both camps ( and I 've got nine of them total ) , this would n't be my first , second , or tenth choice . With dozens of credited producers and musicians ( the former include Michael Masser , who wrote and produced a string of MOR ballads for Diana Ross in the 1970s , and Michael Sembello , coming off his hit `` Maniac '' ) , the album never gets any kind of cohesive flow.Benson 's voice , smooth but not powerful , is best placed either with stripped-down backing instrumentals ( such as on `` This Masquerade '' ) or mixed with a more sympathetic producer in the box ( Quincy Jones and Arif Mardin qualified here ) . On `` 20/20 , '' Benson is forced near the edge of his range ( `` I Just Wan na Hang Around You '' ) , or buried in a wash of synthesizers ( `` No One Emotion , '' `` Please Do n't Walk Away , '' title track ) . Weak material ( `` You Are the Love of My Life , '' `` Hold Me '' ) does n't help . Even the one instrumental showcase , `` Stand Up , '' barely features Benson 's guitar.The exceptions to this are a horn-driven remake of Bobby Darin 's `` Beyond the Sea '' and a melancholy `` New Day . '' He sounds fine on `` Nothing 's Gon na Change My Love for You , '' but the song ( written by Masser and ex-Carole King partner Gerry Goffin ) has a weak arrangement and lyrics.This charted lower than any of Benson 's previous forays into pop/soul , and he soon moved back to jazz guitar , a smart move . Given his web site ca n't even dig up a proper album cover image , I suspect it was n't one of his favorites , either . For his sake , please start elsewhere .	-1
I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses , Black Celebration , and Violator . I also enjoyed People are People , some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell . But , most of this record never did anything for me . It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I did n't really try to like from bands I liked . But , a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall , but People are People is a stronger `` early Mode '' post Speak and Spell choice . Stick with Music for the Masses , Violator , Black Celebration , People are People , and Speak and Spell .	-1
The 1980 's were a bad decade for music , and this album is a good example of why . I hope you like overly long , overly synth driven tunes that run out of inspiration shortly after they begin , because that 's pretty much all you get . In fact , I can only think of two tunes worth salvaging here ; Money for Nothing and the Man 's Too Strong , which even then do n't touch average works by great bands ( the Beatles , the Stones , Cream , Led Zeppelin , etc ) .A fine example of everything bad about this release is Why Worry , eight-plus minutes of boring ... for one , you can barely hear it , but when you can it 's fairly uninspired . The same can be said for the title track and especially the opener , So Far Away , which repeats the same line ( not to mention measure ) for about two minutes in the end , and the title track . I 'd avoid it , but that 's just me .	-1
I like Dire Straits with their more laid back approach due to the singing and playing by Mark Knopfler , but listening to `` Brothers in arms '' is in the long run a rather boring experience . This album was in a way Dire Straits big breakthrough and includes the excellent `` Money for nothing '' , and the catchy and happy `` Walk of life '' . But the rest has n't the quality I 'm used to when it comes to Dire Straits.Skip this one , and go for their debut `` Dire Straits '' ( 1978 ) and the even better `` Making movies '' ( 1980 ) instead .	-1
I sensed trouble as I listened to all the noisy , obnoxious synths on `` Alchemy '' . I knew no good would come from the Miami Vice fashions sported by the band in the `` Alchemy '' concert film . But I dumped the Straits after one spin of `` Brothers '' . Tracks 1-5 ( Side One , vinyl ) just flat out suck . Where is the tight , groove-oriented playing ? The Knopfler knack for good storytelling ? Noticeable improvement on tracks 6-9 ( Side Two , vinyl ) , but the Straits tank on the first half . Compared to the first four albums ( self titled , Communique , Making Movies , Love Over Gold ) , `` Brothers '' is a lightweight , Mr. Mister-sounding stinkeroo . Some record label hack must have sent Mark and the boys into a panic on this one . They seemed to have lost faith in their instincts , and subverted their talent to achieve mass market stardom . Pity .	-1
A-HA was a one-hit wonder , at least in the USA , where only & quot ; TAKE ON ME & quot ; received an absurd amount of MTV and radio display , to the point of becoming unbearable to ever listen again ! ! In Europe , mainly int he U.K , thing were a little different , A-Ha being able to resist for more than five studio albums . BUt that was never a band to be taken seriusly . Other than the very good vocals , the ultra-pop-synth music is lifeless , industrial and toally electronic . That 's why they succumbed .	-1
A-HA is much better than some people think . This debut is very good , but suffered from two major flaws : the indecent , excessive exposing of TAKE ON ME , an amazing tune totally burned out by massive MTV and radio playing , and the slicky and acheesy production.Even being totally synth-orientated , the album could have possessed more edge to its approach , because the songs are essentially very good and melodic . There was no need to such a openly commercial production .	-1
Yeah , I , like the others , remember this disc fondly for the time that it was hot . Upon a & quot ; revisit & quot ; , I ca n't see why it was a seller.And why , for the life of me , I bought it !	-1
You know , out of the 3 solo albums MORRIS DAY has , this was the most interesting . Although JIMMY JAM & TERRY LEWIS penned `` Fishnet '' and `` Love Is A Game '' from the sophmore `` DAYDREAMING '' , Morris did this album alone without production or music or backing voices by the legendary TIME members ! That is about all the props I can give Mr. DAY . His album is nowhere better than any of THE TIME 's four albums . Even JESSE JOHNSON 's solos tell MORRIS DAY to `` Walk '' . What gets me the most is `` The Oak Tree '' . `` The Bird '' ( Part 2 ) as RUN formerly of RUN-DMC would say . Good song to a point but if you 're 'ready to debut ' you do n't go back in TIME to get ahead . High points : `` The Color Of Success '' , a diss to PRINCE . Shocking ! Of course PRINCE disses him back on SHEILA E. 's `` ROMANCE 1600 LIVE '' video with the 'wooded leg ' chop ! `` The Character '' is my favorite here . The music is a cross between R & B ; and new wave , sounds like ANDRE CYMONE . That 's the first 3 songs . The other 3 ... Well , that 's my review . MR . COOL , made his best effort on this album and not the ones after this ( `` GUARANTEED '' is frisbee bait ) . `` THE COLOR OF SUCCESS '' shows a man finally breaking out of the kingdom of PRINCE , but to go where ? Also , where is the originally here ? 6 songs makes an album ? THE TIME 's first 3 albums have only 6 songs each album . MORRIS ca n't escape THE TIME . He keeps on doin ' what he and they have done , again .	-1
This is a marginal effort . Many of the songs just sound too similar to each other , and Morris shows very little of the creativity that drew us to the Time . His vocals are as solid as he can get ( considering he ca n't really sing ) , but the music is terrible.If you get this , it 'll surely disappoint .	-1
Now , when Prince is on top of his game , he 's one of the most talented musicians in the history of Earth , putting out classic albums and songs effortlessly . Seriously , when this guy was at his prime , his album tracks were BETTER than most the hit singles of the era , which admittedly is n't very impressive . I mean , when you 've got something as good as `` The Beautiful Ones '' in your backlog , you 're probably really , really talented . And Prince , as a singer , songwriter , musician , and innovator , is really talented.With all that said , Diamonds and Pearls generally reeks of insipidness . I do n't know why - I 'm not here to say Prince lost it after Sign o ' the Times , because my favorite Prince album is Emancipation . But it 's not really worth listening to , outside of three of the four hit singles : ballads like the lovely title track ( `` I 'll give you DIAMONDS AND PEARLS ! `` ) , the slightly hokey but melodic as all get-out `` Money Do n't Matter 2Nite '' , and the dirty as dirty can be funk-rap crossover `` Gett Off '' ( I 'm sure he wrote several of those lyrics from personal experience ) - it 's really the catchiest I 've ever heard the lyric `` Twenty-three positions in a one-night stand ! '' The fourth , `` Cream '' , is one of Prince 's least creative moments , just dull funk . And most the rest fits in with that mold , other than on the decent ballad `` Insatiatable '' , which even then is n't one of his best moments as a lyricist - not everyone 's interested in your budding career directing `` home videos '' ! As for the rest - either trite steamy bedroom lyrics about doin ' the big nasty or points about spirituality ( `` Thunder '' , which has none of the resonance of early spiritual gems like `` Purple Rain '' ) or individuality ( `` Walk Do n't Walk '' , ironically not very original ) ; and one random folk-pop song that has no reason for even existing ( `` Strollin ' '' ) . And a LOT of jarring , abraisive raps that might as well be Prince shooting his fanbase collectively in the head ( `` Jughead '' ; `` Daddy Pop '' ) . And one big long waste of seven minutes that would 've been better off silent ( `` Live 4 Love '' ) . And one big , long , rambling , convoluted review of the whole mess , for those inclined to care . I 'll end the madness right now and tell you this is n't one of Prince 's better albums .	-1
2 1/2If not for the title track plus a few embellishments , this would easily be dismissed as one of the artist 's outdated nineties productions slathered in a corny hip hop influence .	-1
Best track : & quot ; Gett Off & quot ; There are two or three other okay songs here ( like & quot ; Cream & quot ; , & quot ; Daddy Pop & quot ; , & quot ; Money dont matter tonight & quot ; ) . I used to really hate this album back when it came out , but have grown to tolerate it in the wake of Prince 's artistic demise . It 's far better than much of the antiseptic , boring material he churns out these days .	-1
There are few songs as wonderful as & quot ; Kiss & quot ; ... certainly none appear on the rest of Parade . AnotherLoverHoleInYoHead comes close with a light Steely Dan approach , and New Position is rubber-band-snappingly good . The rest just seems too nostalgic ( Do U Lie ? ) or mellodramatic ( Sometimes It Snows in April ) . Ai n't much foreshadowing of the next album ( Sign O the Times ) , the best of his career !	-1
Almost any CD from this gifted singer , is a delight for your ears ! `` L Is For Lover '' , not being one of his best , is certainly an excellent addition to your Male Jazz/Pop singers collection . I do n't know exactly why there is now a `` shortage '' of Al Jarreau 's CDs in the market ( perhaps it is due to that usually stupid fight between record companies for copyrights & /or royalties ) , but if you have the chance to get it , do it right now ! ( I had to buy mine as a used one -a German issue , the sound quality is outstanding ! ) .	-1
B-52 's albums released in the mid-80s do n't exactly tickle my fancy at all , since they 'd pretty much abandoned their original sound and had n't yet come upon that overproduced late-decade Nile Rodgers dance sound which became so infectious ( and so chartworthy ) . This is n't really an exception , though it shows the band moving away from the dull cheese-fest & quot ; Whammy ! & quot ; into a collection of actual songs . I give the band credit for the gorgeous pop of & quot ; Summer Of Love & quot ; and & quot ; Ai n't It A Shame , & quot ; and the bizarre synth excursions of & quot ; Detour Thru Your Mind & quot ; and & quot ; Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland , & quot ; but the rest of the album is basically a studio mess ( & quot ; Housework & quot ; ? Give me a break ) , not helped at all by the death of Ricky Wilson . Most of the bandmembers worked solo for this release , therefore drawing possible comparisons to the White Album , were the White Album about 50 million times less good than it actually is .	-1
PEople give five stars to this album . I 'll tell you about the CUlt . This is a band without any substance , a boring pseudo-pop-rock-metal-new wave band , that only tries to copy AC/DC and ZZ Top in this ELECTRIC ( which is considered their best album ! ! Imagine the others ! ! ) Everything here sounds a copy . The singer Astbury is horrible .	-1
Apart from Love Removal Machine and Lil Devil , the album is a collection of the most throw away riffs and rejected type songs . There is nothing above average about Peace Dog and Wild Flower either . Even Born into this sounds more interesting than this ( I 'm working backwards through some of Cult 's stuff ) , so maybe that 's why the fans who like that album say it 's `` as good as '' Electric ? I 'm a fan of albums from before and after Electric , meaning the different sounding styles of the band but I 'm put off by this . Really mediocre .	-1
Prince seems to have decided to move up the ladder of Maslow 's hierachy of needs pyramid to tackle issues other than just the primal baser instincts and as a result shows himself an artist to be taken seriously . Although some siliness is still evident on tracks like `` Housequake '' and `` If I Was Your Girlfriend '' other tracks like the title track , `` U Got the Look '' and `` The Cross '' show an artist with depth to go along with his undoubted musical and compositional talent . The tracks do not flow as well as say on `` Purple Rain '' but like another very good double album the Beatles ' `` White Album '' the disjointedness seems to work in an ironic and unexpected way and similar to other classic albums , you feel you can only truly appreciate the album if you sit through and listen to all the tracks at one go . I get the feeling that I 'm listening to one entire track and not the 16 individual tracks that make up this album.Too bad this mini-lp replica sleeve ( mlps ) version could n't equal the content in terms of quality though as the SHM-CD treatment of using a allegedly better reflective plastic material does little to improve the sound quality over previous releases . The mlps design too is a disappointment coming in thin , poor quality cardboard that is flimsily assembled looking like it will come apart easily once the glue gets old . There is a small heart-shaped sticker included though which is nice , 2 inner sleeves that replicate the original vinyl release and a 28-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.No noticeable improvement in sound quality and a mediocre mlps design and assembly makes this certainly not good value for money and hence not recommended .	-1
my least favorite simon album . the writing is forced and inconsistent . not very good .	-1
Though there are some great songs here , this album finds Paul Simon beginning to run out of creative energy . It 's all getting to sound by-the-book and it does n't always sound like he 's happy to be making music . There are two great songs - 50 Ways and My Little Town ; and the title track , while subdued and downcast feeling , has a spooky , dreamy atmosphere and heartfelt vocal . Have A Good Time *might* sound better if he had someone else sing it , i.e . a female . To hear him wail away in a whiny falsetto for the WHOLE SONG is only slightly less grating than Prince 's 'Kiss ' . No wonder Art Garfunkel did all the falsetto stuff on the S & G albums . The rest of it is not bad , but suffers from blandness . No real catchy hooks or anything to make you remember the music . As far as the musicianship goes , it 's top-notch throughout the album .	-1
Disregard this album ; do not even THINK of picking it up . It 's only notable for Ice 's precursor to 'Colors ' , entitled 'Squeeze the Trigger . ' Tape the one tune from a friend then forget about the rest .	-1
The Jesus and Mary Chain - Darklands ( 1987 ) This music is n't very exciting and it 's not nearly as dark as some would have you believe or what the title implies . The song `` Darklands '' sounds too much like Bowie 's `` Heroes '' ( if you know what I mean ) and I get the feeling that 's not the only thing ripped-off on this album . Not that it really matters much anyway because there 's plenty of music I do like that rips off other tunes.I 'm sure many would slag my opinion , but it just comes down to a question of taste and this album tastes pretty bland to me . However , it 's certainly NOT true that all of J & MC ; 's albums sound the same and there 's 2 very different sounding ones that I would recommend far more than DARKLANDS : the dancable shredfest HONEY 'S DEAD and the laid-back , supercool STONED AND DETHRONED .	-1
If this album sold any copies , it must be because of the cover ( nude ) . The follow-up to the best album Prince has ever recorded , SIGN `` O '' THE TIMES , is the worst album Prince has ever recorded . Well , one of the worst , if not thee worst.Prince was set to release another double-disc epic but I guess Warner Bros. would n't allow it so LOVESEXY was released on Warners and THE BLACK ALBUM was released as a bootleg . The better of the two : THE BLACK ALBUM . Reasoning : Funky tracks . Although `` When 2 R In Love '' appears on both albums , ( LOVESEXY 9 selections to THE BLACK ALBUM 's 8 ) LOVESEXY just does not shine in a partly cloudy sky . `` Alphabet Street '' , `` Anna Stesia '' and `` I Wish U Heaven '' are the only worthwhile selections here and speaking of selections , it was a really stupid move between Prince and Warners to release 9 selections as just 1 selction for the entire album , how annoying is that ? What else can I say here ? Nothing good . I am a die-hard Prince fans so to all you Prince fans out there who enjoyed LOVESEXY , I do n't know . Maybe there 's too much wax in my ears to hear what you all have heard .	-1
I am a prince fan but this album is not worth your money since who ever up loaded this album put as one long songs and not album . You ca n't skip to next song , you have to wait until plays the entire album . that why give this one star	-1
Prince had recorded two albums at the time of the release of Love Sexy . One was by the good Prince ( Love Sexy ) and the other by the bad Prince ( The Black Album ) . The story goes that the good Prince won out and Prince released Love Sexy . The album is full of positive notions about love and God . The problem is that the unreleased Black Album ( it was released in a limited edition several years later ) was far superior to Love Sexy . & quot ; Alphabet St. & quot ; has a nice funky groove with a guitar riff reminiscent of & quot ; Kiss & quot ; and is a good song , but the album does n't offer much else . One would be better served to find a copy of the Black Album as that contains some of the darkest , deepest , funkiest grooves Prince has ever committed to tape . Love Sexy just does n't match up the high standards that he had set with his previous 80 's releases .	-1
Through out the 80 's , Princes ' standard in artistry and production was nothing short of amazing . `` alphabet st. '' , `` dance on '' , `` love-sexy '' and `` I wish u heaven '' , were all strong tracks with much potential . The finishing result was a 45 minute mish-mash of noise that has destroyed the joy of listening to these four particular songs . The mastering process of the album , resulted in one single track ( very unusual ) ( that 's prince ) , but overall , the album sounds awful . Many of the tracks are mixed together , with no definitive track boundaries , with `` over the top '' production work , which becomes somewhat annoying . Prince would have been much better off to release these four tracks on an EP , with distinctive silent gaps between the tracks . This would have given all four tracks their distinct individuality , deepening the experience that each track is conveying . On a finishing note , this was one messy album to listen to , with no depth . This was the beginning of Princes ' decline	-1
This is the only effort by the Scandinavian crew that I came away from with a bad taste in my mouth . The album has the feel of a collection of earlier songs that were passed up for publication . This is the type of half hearted effort that comes about when a group or artist feels pressured to release a new album . The only bright spots are & quot ; Hurry Home & quot ; and & quot ; Stay On These Roads & quot ; . Not enough . Bring on the raspberry jam guys .	-1
This is one of the very few times I rip into my favorite songwriter , and I 'll tell you why : Outside of the opening song IF IT SHOULD PLEASE YOU , this album is nothing but Gordon Lightfoot lifelessly singing in a studio as someone pounds out simple 1-2-3-4 chords on a keyboard.I ca n't tell you how disappointed I was when I got past the opening track ( which is what saved me from knocking this album to a one-star clunker ) . Now I can not stress to you , the reader how much I deeply enjoy EVERY ONE of Gordon Lightfoot 's albums , but this really was an embarrassment to his career . I 'm not kidding when I say that voice aside , Tommy Smothers could have pulled this album off with the same emotional intensity and talent put in.DO N'T BUY THIS ! Download the first song IF IT SHOULD PLEASE YOU , then do n't let this album taint the beautiful visual lyrics , instrumentation , voice , and feeling that the original versions possess .	-1
Although many highlights of his 80 's albums are in their original versions and has a great song called & quot ; If It Should Please You & quot ; available nowhere else , everything else , including & quot ; Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald & quot ; is all re-recorded and the remakes are not good at that . You are better off getting the & quot ; Songbook & quot ; boxed set or the original albums for what you would be buying this for . If It were n't for the highlights of the 80 's albums and the new track , this would rate 1 star , but since the 1980 's original recordings are well chosen and & quot ; If It Should Please You & quot ; is a decent song , I give it 2 stars .	-1
Well , I bought the tape & quot ; Gord 's Gold II & quot ; for the song & quot ; wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald & quot ; and discovered as someone else did who reviewed the album found it to be an alternate version of the song which left me disappointed and glad I didnt soak more money into the cd . Now I like Gordon Lightfoot , but there is alot of music on this effort of his that I just dont recognize . Give me a Greatest hits comp with & quot ; sundown & quot ; , & quot ; carefree highway & quot ; , & quot ; wreck & quot ; and the like and we could talk . Like most here hough , I have to give a thumbs down . I give this cd 1 star and it hurts to do that .	-1
Yes , there are some great songs from this album , but `` Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald '' is a remake , and so are most of the other tracks on the 18 song set . `` Baby Step Back '' and `` Ghosts Of Cape Horn '' are original versions , but little else is . It does n't make any sense to take an artist 's best loved songs , re-record them , then think they are better than the original versions . Sadly , they are not , and that is what prompts me to issue a 2-star rating for this album .	-1
This album has terrible sound . Its very tinny and distant . Nothing like Gord 's Gold vol 1 or If You Could Read My Mind . I was very disappointed with it . Lightfoot should re release this after firing his producer as there are several great songs on it .	-1
I 've been a Lightfoot fan since 1970 , and owned his United Artists LP 's and almost all of his Reprise output up to about 1990 . I began to be disappointed in him when , in a concert in Albuquerque in 1971 , he seemed drunk or stoned on stage , and this was no `` bar '' venue . However , when CD 's came along , I bought his two-disc United Artists compilation , and `` Gord 's Gold Volume One '' and were quite happy with both . This one , however , as another reviewer noted , has `` re-recordings '' of these tracks . I think in almost every case , the older versions on the original albums came off better . Gordon has a very distinctive voice , and when he enunciates properly , he sounds lovely . I found this in a thrift store last week , and since I 'd never owned this CD , I took a chance for two bucks . Alas , I think I 'll pass it on to a non-profit agency garage sale in the fall . Listening to the United Artists showcase recently , I decided I had `` outgrown '' all but ten or so of the 40 songs . On this item , I only `` loved '' about six of the 18 tracks anyway . In these versions , I do n't respond to any of them positively enough to hang on to the disc . Lightfoot had a long career , penned a dozen or so great songs that other artists can do well , ( like `` Ribbon of Darkness '' ) and had a handful of great early performances . Yet somehow , I have little interest in hearing him again . I feel similarly about Dylan , Baez , James Taylor and others from the '60 's and 70 's who once were important to me . I have n't become a Republican , but I have n't heard anything ear-catching from those singers in decades .	-1
If all you want is a collection of Fleetwood Mac 's hits this one 's fine . All the hits are here ( from 1975-1988 ) and if that 's all you expect from a greatest hits collection , you wo n't be disappointed . But even a casual fan of the band ( like me ) found this to be a little less than I expected . The liner notes are the pits ; a behind the scenes look at a 1988 concert ( w/o Buckingham ) with no insight into the songs in the collection . There are n't even songwriter credits ( although there are production credits ) ! I 'm not reviewing the songs here , but the packaging . I feel a band that is this talented and popular deserves a better package for their best material .	-1
Ian Curtis plunges into the depths of post-existential , post-structural connotative ruminations on the implications of our `` thrown-ness '' ( as Heidegger put it ) into this world , into its light , its darkness , and the transluscent twilight of the ambiguity we confront as we try to choose between good and evil with nothing to guide us beyond the pull of our compulsive pusilanimity . Curtis 's inept baritone proves the perfect counterpoise for Joy Division 's disinterested , motoric rhythms and the barely competent guitar of whatsisname . All in all , an album for the ages . The early middle ages , to be precise , during the last few years of Pepin the Short 's reign.More than any band I can think of , Joy Division makes it plain that it 's virtually impossible to underestimate the intelligence , or overestimate the gullibility , of Western Man . There 's no arguing about individual taste , or one 's ability to perceive the paradox of beauty in ugliness , or any subjective point of view when it comes to this band . Joy Division is objectively crap . Musically , lyrically , conceptually , aesthetically , even the production blows . In 35 years of obsessive record collecting , I 've never seen any band even come close to Joy Division when it comes to pulling the wool over peoples ' eyes . Come to think of it , why do you think you never see Ian Curtis and Karl Rove photographed together ?	-1
The Title Cut is one of her Best Songs ever.Like in Her top 3 songs Shes ever done.but the Album is Hit & amp ; Miss.Express Yourself i sone of The Most Over-Rated songs Ever.Love Song With Prince does Nothing for Neither of them.Keep it together is alright.The Title Cut though alone is a 4 1/2 alone.the rest of the Album is a One.She maintains her Trademark Sound but The Album Never Rises Again to the CHallenge of The Title Cut .	-1
I 'm not a really a big fan of this album . Well , it just plain sucks . It 's really bad 80 's pop and it sounds outdated . And I love 80 's music ! I mean her other 80 's stuff is a lot better then this crap . I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain ( boy was i wrong ) . It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together . Other then that Express yourself ( well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid ) . Like a Prayer is ok , the video and concept are great . But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much , even today . ( its like mj with thriller , it gets old quick ! ) It 's really not that great of a song . The only one that I really like is act of contrition . It 's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it . It 's very good and creative . Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD .	-1
Some fans like 'Spike ' . I 'm not one of them . 'Veronica ' is a classic and 'Deep Dark Truthful Mirror ' is solid , but the rest of the songs here are hit and miss ... mostly miss .	-1
Now despite what anyone says this is unlistenable . I loved Costello but here really ... avoid at all costs .	-1
but not very exciting . After the first song it pretty much goes downhill . I guess you need to like this kind of music to appreciate it . I bought this album being a fan of MK , but its not my cup of tea .	-1
& quot ; Get the Message & quot ; is one of the all time great new wave hit singles . Too bad the rest of the album fails to follow suit . Like many supergroups , Electronic gets bogged down with mediocre songwriting and a failure of inspiration .	-1
`` When Heart is Open '' may be the most excruciatingly boring fifteen minutes of music I have ever listened to : a slow , liveless reading of poor poetry . Most of the other songs are n't much better . At first listen , I thought I had a problem with a defective CD -- surely nobody intended music to sound like this.I 'll give this CD two stars only because `` Summertime in England '' has a few good moments when the brass section kicks in and it swings .	-1
Ironically , the songs are easier to appreciate when you can listen to one song occasionally rather than many collectively . I did enjoy hearing these songs again , but I could n't do it in one sitting . The one joke theme of Devo is their dehumanized song styling , very stilted and deficient . Unfortunately , the punch line becomes very tedious quickly .	-1
Not too much to get excited about here although I am a fan of Elvis 's paean to the Beach Boys , 'The Other Side of Summer ' . 'Hurry Down Doomsday ... ' is also a hoot , especially the live version on the Rhino issue bonus disc .	-1
Blood Sugar Sex Magik was the album with which Red Hot Chili Peppers broke through to a less limited music scene . By many , it is still considered the band 's best album , so I looked forward to enjoying as many as 17 great RHCP songs.But no ! Apart from the hits Under The Bridge ( still a superb song ! ) , Give It Away , I Could Have Lied and Breaking The Girl , plus the last minutes of Sir Psycho Sex , this album has not much to offer . The other 13 songs all sound like ( unworthwile ) imitations of Give It Away.This funk-rap-rock dominates the album - so if you are not into that style , buying Blood Sugar Sex Magik will be a waste of money . I recommend Californication , even though it is more commercial , instead .	-1
Released in 1991 and sandwiched somwhere between the demise of alterna-metal ( think Jane 's Addiction ) and the birth of the grunge movement pioneered by Nirvana , this CD belongs in neither camp , trying instead to find some kind of footing in the world of funk , punk , rap and post Led Zeppelin guitar pyrotechnics.The band itself ( actually everyone except child TV actor Anthony Kiedis ) can play their instruments . Frusciante is a reasonably accomplished guitarits , Flea is a slap bass fiend and , if that 's Chad Smith playing drums , then the drumming is perfectly competent.Sadly , the sum of the parts , do not add up to anything interesting as the band proves to be only as strong as its weakest links and these weaknesses run the gamut from a mediocre singer to the blandest of ideas.Being only as strong as your weakest link is no good , especially when the weakest link is your singer . When Kiedis ' finds the key the song is written in ( and 90 % of the time he does n't find it ) , he is cocksure and delivers the lyrics with some panache ( a requisite of all the great rock singers ) but the lack of talent and ideas reveal to the world that it 's all flash in the pan . He 's all show and no substance . His whiny , white boy voice does n't help with the rap parts , he 's way too `` California cool '' to be a punk and he 'll never pose any dangers to funk masters like James Brown or Maceo Parker.The lack of essence is also obvious in the lyrical content of the songs and in the arrangement of the tunes , which are seldom more than a cut and paste up job of pieces and parts.If you think `` Funky Monks '' , `` Mellowship Slinky In B Major '' , `` Apache Rose Peacock '' , `` Suck My Kiss '' and the rest of the tunes on this CD add anyting interesting to the western rock ` n roll cannon you are sadly mistaken.I can understand some people 's love for the CD - a lot of them grew up with it and find it hard to leave their childhood pleasures behind but your job as an adult is to learn , move on and betray your childhood .	-1
One thing I did n't like about this album that I tried in vain to savor is the rhythms . Another thing is how prestigious it is ; I do n't like the idea of these things being well-known , but in an effort to enjoy an album , I overlook that and listen to it anyway , sometimes.I 'd say that most of this album is pretty relaxed.Lyrical-infused Moods : -Imaginary-Profane-Fascinated-Reminiscent-Inevitably Pressuring-Self-centeredI just did n't like the style of this album generally . Few songs that were creative . Most of the songs do n't sound that distinguishing . This is a rotten masterpiece .	-1
I remember this album well ; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer ' , as it was released well before `` Under The Bridge '' made them the bandwagon band of the year , but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right -- they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to ( `` Suck My Kiss '' , `` Give It Away '' ) , there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded . This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands should n't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that , the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief . Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album , and Kiedis was so off-key , it was n't funny . They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals , but the damage was done . People were walking out in droves .	-1
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were another main factor in the commercialization of alternative rock along with Nirvana and Jane 's Addiction . Their lyrical content was n't much different than the sex obsessed lyrics in the glam metal of the late '80 's , which helped the public make a smooth transition from one fad to the next.The RCHP album before `` Blood sugar sex magic '' was n't bad , but this album was such a blatant attempt to market their sound to the brain dead masses . ... Like all other pop music , it 's fun the first few times and then it gets annoying . Anthony Kiedis ' rap style vocals are very cheesy . He sounds way too white to be rapping which makes it really awkward and unnatural.Kiedis ' soft voice is very annoying as heard on `` Under the Bridge '' ... The lyrics are pretty bad also . It 's the typical left wing agenda won them critical praise . The party and have sex themes are for very shallow people . The sensitive '90 's man lyrics are just disgusting.Musically , the album is so polished it takes away from the emotional impact . When a band uses high dollar production , it usually means the music can not stand on it 's own.The funky bass and beat makes it sound more like soul music than rock . The bass pretty much dominates the overall sound . The guitar sound is mostly in the vein of classic rock and clashes with the funk in a bad way.The worst thing about this album is the inside of the CD where the band members are posing to show off their tattoos . Their imagery was just like glam metal , only showing off tattoos instead of hairstyles .	-1
not my favourite bands ... under the bridge has great lyrics ! the vocals are terrible ! the melodies are too much rap !	-1
Why are we still reviewing this ? For that matter , why are you even selling this , Amazon ? `` Angel Dust '' was years ago exposed as a mere corporate stunt and , even if you 've been stuck under a rock , comes off as an awkward exercise nearly 20 years later . An exercise that , frankly , Suzanne Somers would n't even try with a Thighmaster.So , if somehow you did n't already know , I 'll give you the Cliff Notes of the `` Angel Dust '' debacle : The year was 1992 and Geffen Records pimp David Geffen had just broken up with Warner Bros. Records chief Mo Ostin , after catching him fooling around with Lorne Michaels and the Artist Who I Think Is Currently Known As Prince in the `` crystal baths '' at the Burbank YMCA . After Ostin learned that Geffen was `` on the rebound '' with then-Disney boss Michael Ovitz , he set out to deflect the `` grunge '' movement by signing Body Count and ( you guessed it ) Faith No More , pumped methamphetamine vapor into the studio and dressed them in Run-D.M.C . outfits for photo shoots . However , Geffen countered with Guns N ' Roses ' `` The Spaghetti Incident ? '' and won the round through the sheer WTF factor alone.And I got ta hand it to Mike Patton , boy does he try on this Jason Voorhees version of suburban soul -- what with his ever-earnest aural gymnastics ( see the militant , Tone Loc-flecked `` A Small Victory '' ) -- but it 's like Bill Bixby channeling Constantin Stanislavski in `` The Incredible Hulk , '' the rest of the cast molesting the proceedings like a nun wearing a confederate smock to an Al Sharpton barbecue.If I may , I 'd like to sum up some of the `` stoner critiques '' that have come before mine so you do n't have to go through the torture of reading them yourself . You 're welcome.A closet opera freak by the name of S. Janowski ambled out of hibernation a mere 15 days ago to chisel out an ode to this inspiration for screamo , in which he basically states `` Angel Dust '' is one of the best albums since music began because the songs are great . A genuine genius analysis , sir ! Ranger92175 admits he is such a pothead that he can never make it past the first three songs before losing consciousness , although he still gives it the requisite 5 stars . N. Hall shares a term paper he wrote in community college with us which made my head hurt . Christopher Roche `` real gone '' shares how listening to the album made him so psychotic that he thought Mike Patton should have been the one with an amusement park in his backyard and a detachable nose , always hanging out with homeless kids in Bangladesh . Et cetera .	-1
I 've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars . I have to tell you , however , that Angel Dust is the worst album ever created . My first college roommate played it every day ( along with Empire from Queensryche ) and it never grew on me . This is an educated review . Why ? - I 've heard this stinking album over and over and I hate it . I 'm glad FNM is dead and buried .	-1
this is n't so good i recommedn you to get real thing ! there 's great lyrics but the melodies are boring !	-1
Midlife Crisis and a Small Victory are two great songs , but the rest of the album just is n't very listenable . Try The Real Thing or a `` Best of '' compilation instead .	-1
I saw the video for `` Kiko and The Lavender Moon '' on TV at around the time this album came out and was very much impressed with the weird but unforgettable video but even more with the song . Some time later I got a hold of a copy of `` Kiko '' and I remember not liking the album at all save for `` KATLM '' and `` Wicked Rain '' . One of the first impressions of this album before I played it , judging by the cover and the title song , was that there would be more `` spooky '' / `` Mexican Day of the dead '' type of music in it . However , while I loved the two aforementioned tracks , it was a great disappointment . This album is listed or mentioned in the Lobos catalogue as an `` experimental '' album . Sort of like Fleetwood Mac 's `` Tusk '' . But while Tusk contains I would say 75 % good or great songs and 25 % filler , to me `` Kiko '' contains only two excellent tracks as teasers , but the rest of the album sounds like very well skilled musicians playing a bunch of boring songs with some interesting beats and sounds , but overall songs that just do n't quite cut it for me . And before you Lobos fans send me hate email , please understand that while I did not expect an album full of `` La Bamba '' hits , I expected better songs . No complaint about the ability of these men to play greatly or the album 's production , just the songs are really not that good . IN a few days MFSL will release a 180gram vinyl pressing of this album , and because of it , I went to a popular video site to play the tracks from this album - 20 years later - to see if I changed my mind . Sad to say , that my original feelings about this piece in 1993 remain the same . I was hoping something in the album would grab my attention besides the 2 tracks I like and plunk down the expensive price to own it . It wass not to be . Your best bet would be to get a copy of `` just another band from LA ' or the greatest hits single CD album that came out last year , but does not contain `` Wicked rain '' , and that is a pity .	-1
Have you ever met someone and thought they had lots of good qualities but somehow the spark was n't there and you never really connected ? There was nothing you could really put your finger on -- he/she was a good person , attractive , smart , etc . but it just did n't click . This album is like that for me . I ca n't say anything is particularly wrong with it , other than that it seems overly sentimental . She has a good voice and it 's well produced , but I just do n't want to listen to it.Can we still be friends ?	-1
ZZ Top you hate em or you love em . I dont hate these guys but i just honestly dont like really any of the songs on this album except three , Sharp Dressed Man , LA Garange , and Tush . Every other song on here i really hate ecsepcially , `` Planet Of Woman '' , or `` Legs '' . ZZ Top all they do is sing about hot women and getting some . Thats there whole basis for there band thats it every song thats what they sing about . Arrggg whats next Journey , `` Be Good To Yourself '' , come on people pick up Dark Side Of The Moon instead of this shameless music	-1
Album - Generic Flipper Well , what 's to say , it 's Flipper . You 're either going to hate them or hate them . Yeah , that 's clean .	-1

I do n't exactly bear any animosity towards this album , seeing as I bought it for $ 4.99 , but compared to the previous album , it 's phenomenally weak . The key here is the temporary departure of Cindy Wilson . To some , that may seem trivial , as & quot ; both of those singers sound the same ! & quot ; but , to tell you the blatant truth , they DO N'T . Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson made up what was probably the best girl duo in music , with Cindy 's raspier vocals mixing perfectly with Kate 's pure , sugary-sweet vocals , and with Kate on her own , the sound of the album is kind of flat . In addition , the problem that the album has is that too many of the songs sound like Kate and Fred singing random stuff over rather contrived backing music ( & quot ; Hot Pants Explosion , & quot ; and the title track in spite of a wonderful chorus ) just to fill up space . Finally , the entire album and liner notes and cover art seem to show some sort of spiritual rebirth , with disgustingly trendy let's-save-the-earth pictures of manatees and dolphins and astrological symbols , and songs like & quot ; Dreamland & quot ; and & quot ; Vision Of A Kiss. & quot ; That said , I really enjoy the piano boogie number & quot ; Tell It Like It T-I-Is , & quot ; the gorgeous & quot ; Revolution Earth , & quot ; and the spacey & quot ; Is That You Mo-Dean & quot ; ? & quot ; Bad Influence & quot ; is a catchy rocker , but it really could 've used Cindy , and the political lyrics are too contrived and direct for it to rank up there with , say , & quot ; Channel Z. & quot ; I guess I could still recommend it for those four songs , seeing that it 's in cutout bins around the nation anyway .	-1
For the most part , Prince would have one of the most successful decades of any artists . Despite a couple of low points ( the commercial failure of the movie `` Under the Cherry Moon '' and poor sales of the `` Lovesexy '' album ) , Prince would achieve a great amount of commercial success and even more critical acclaim . At the center of this success was `` Purple Rain '' . Prince 's `` Purple Rain '' was a surprise success at the box office and prove to also garner critical acclaim . At the same time , the soundtrack of the `` Purple Rain '' album would prove to be one of the true landmark albums of all time . With a successful decade under his belt and plans for the sequel to `` Purple Rain '' , there was much anticipation for both the movie and the associated soundtrack . These hopes would be completely dashed when 1990 's `` Graffiti Bridge '' was released . `` Graffiti Bridge '' would serve as the sequel to the movie and become a complete disaster from both a commercial and critical standpoint . While something similar happened with `` Under the Cherry Moon '' , the `` Parade '' soundtrack to that album would still prove to be successful . Such was not the case with the `` Graffiti Bridge '' soundtrack . In a nutshell , except for a few good points , this album was also a complete train-wreck.Much of Prince 's 1980s 's success proved around the `` The Minneapolis Sound '' . `` The Minneapolis Sound '' contained a mixture of Funk , Pop , R & B ; , and Rock . Prince was largely responsible for being a contributing architect to this sound movement . Following the success of `` Purple Rain '' , the follow-up albums would go in different directions . Subsequent albums would introduce psychedelic elements ( `` Around the World in a Day '' ) , a European influence ( `` Parade '' ) , and even some Hip-Hop ( `` Sign O ' The Times '' ) . For the most part , `` Graffiti Bridge '' returns to the classic `` Minneapolis Sound '' . There is a `` gospel '' element toward the end of `` Graffiti Bridge '' and I also think Prince pushes the Hip Hop element some more . However , just because he maintains and expands the `` Minneapolis Sound '' does n't mean it 's very good . For the most part , the album disappoints overall.One big difference from this album compared to `` Purple Rain '' is that `` Graffiti Bridge '' is a true soundtrack . `` Purple Rain '' only contained Prince 's contributions to the film ( and did n't contain music from The Time or Apollonia ) . On `` Graffiti Bridge '' , there are non-Prince songs included - such as the music of the Time , Mavis Staples , Tevin Campbell ( his first break through album ) , and George Clinton.There are four tracks that I would term `` stand out '' tracks '' :1 . `` Ca n't Stop This Feeling That I Got '' : On `` Purple Rain '' , it was `` Let 's Go Crazy '' that set the intensity and tempo of the album as the first track . I thought this song would do the same thing and I would prove to be wrong . I thought some of the Hip-Hop elements at the beginning worked , but overall this song was classic `` Minneapolis Sound '' . I was surprised this was never even released as a single.2 . `` We Can Funk '' : Historically when Prince sings in a duet , he proves to be at his best . This particular song with Funk legend George Clinton is no exception . This might be the album 's strongest contribution . Obviously from the title , this song is - Funk ( well `` Minneapolis Sound '' style of course ) . The last minute of the song is unbelievable and great work by Prince and Clinton.3 . `` Thieves in the Temple '' : This song was the first single released . This song has some of the Rock elements that remind you of the `` Purple Rain '' days . Since this was released before the film , many thought this would be indicative of a true sequel to `` Purple Rain '' - but not the case . Still a very good song.4 . `` Graffiti Bridge '' : Much like the title-track of `` Purple Rain '' provided the emotional climax for the film and soundtrack , so does this particular title track . It is truly worthy of being the title track . This song brings a gospel element to the music , as well as an orchestral sound Mavis Staples and Tevin Campbell share lead vocals with Prince as he proves he is at his best when sharing vocals with others . Again great stuff.Honorable mentions go to the tracks `` Joy in Repetition '' , `` Shake ! '' ( one of the Time 's four tracks ) , and `` Still Would Stand All Time '' . These songs are good , but do n't hold up against the four tracks above . As for the rest of the tracks , there really is n't much to say . In other words , I mention seven tracks above , yet there are still 10 other tracks that I really do n't have much to say about.With the exception of `` Shake ! '' ( good bass line ) , there is not much else to say about the Time 's contributions . There is a long awaited duet with Prince on `` The Latest Fashion '' and while some `` Minneapolis Sound '' fans embraced this particular track , I found it to be very extremely disappointing . Tevin Campbell got some praise for his track `` Round and Round '' , but again it did n't have me doing handstands . I would also say the same for Mavis Staples ' other track , `` Melody Cool '' . Overall , I think the theme as `` not much to the other songs '' is prevalent throughout the remainder of this album.Once last point worth mentioning is the `` New Power Generation '' and `` New Power Generation ( Pt II ) '' songs would eventually become the name for Prince 's new backing band with that name - soon to be seen on subsequent albums.The liner notes did not contain the lyrics to these songs . Overall , with the exception of the four very good tracks and honorable mention tracks , this album has to represent Prince 's low point of the career . Perhaps it is that this album has less of the Rock elements of `` Purple Rain '' on why this album disappoints . This would probably be the impetus for why Prince would assemble the New Power Generation band and go back to the drawing board in the 1990s . Overall , I 'd recommend the tracks I mention , but not the album as a whole .	-1
Disappointing soundtrack to an ill-conceived Prince movie - as though the world needed a sequel to `` Purple Rain . '' Even guest artists such as George Clinton , Mavis Staples and The Time can not save `` Graffiti Bridge '' ( 1990 ) from utter derivativeness . Only `` Thieves in the Temple , '' `` The Question of U '' and Tevin Campbell 's `` Round and Round '' are worthy of your time . A definite low point in the Prince discography .	-1
Wow . This album displeased me . Usually , I would have an album 's taste last for a week , but I could n't give this one a try . This album was ridiculous , mostly . There are a couple of songs that have decent beats , but I 'm a lyricist , and lyric-wise , I need to rebuke this Erotica album . I expected it to be pretty good . One song had good lyrics : `` Why 's It So Hard . '' That 's worth listening to because of its strong reasonableness and persuasive questioning about this phenomena we live in . `` Bye Bye Baby '' is for people who are breaking up , and who wants to go out with that heartache , especially if you 're not under that condition of considering related departure from somebody ? `` Deeper and Deeper '' had a good beat , but I need an album to stand out , and this one fleeted my attention despite what the majority rates it on Amazon . Do n't buy Madonna 's `` Erotica . ''	-1
One of the most polemic Madonna ` s albums , & quot ; Erotica & quot ; is also one of the weakest , providing some controversy due to its taboo subjects ( at least at the time it came out ) but failing to engage and surprise on a musical level . Madonna ` s image and attitude usually come before her music , and in & quot ; Erotica & quot ; this is more than evident . Although somewhat stylish and with a cool atmosphere , this record is too flat , linear , unsurprising and forgettable . It seems like a collection of fillers and b-sides with two or three decent songs that appear randomly ( the title track and & quot ; Rain & quot ; , the latter being completely out of place here ) . Most of the moments here are weak and dated , consisting of quasi trip-hop rythms , club-oriented tracks and pop/jazz/spoken word whispers that recall the early nineties dance scene but aren ` t very engaging or captivating songs . Most of them are too cold , distant and create little or no effect . The record is also too long and by the middle of it all the songs seem to sound the same , generating a bland and generic pop album . Despite the shock factor and ( anti ) hype , & quot ; Erotica & quot ; is a weak and uninspired effort , a product of its time that doesn ` t make much sense today , both musically and thematically.For fans only , but overall devoid of interest .	-1
For all The Fuss About this Disc it did n't Match the Hype at all.Deeper & amp ; Deeper is the Only song worth Remembering here.very bad Club Music.This Album is Very Lame .	-1
I think I 'm listening to a different album than the rest of the reviewers . `` Erotica '' is Madonna 's first , flat-out failure as a musical artist.Something was changing when she added `` Justify My Love '' to her greatest hits album . OK ... it had a killer , sinuous beat , and she moaned over it , more speaking than singing , and it had that video.She dips into that well too many times here , without any of the sexy kick . She 's visibly trying to be provocative and it does n't come off that way . ' '' Erotica '' ( the song ) is a boring club jam with no melody : it 's not a song , it 's a groove . It 's background . It 's wallpaper . `` Fever '' is another of Madonna 's homages to old songs , and it 's simply an average cover version . Better than karaoke , would n't fly on American Idol . `` Bye Bye Baby '' starts off awesome ... great , high-register , whispery vocals with an irresistible melody ... but comes crashing down with an awful chorus and a production that just buries her voice ( a common problem on this album ) . `` Deeper and Deeper '' is the one song for the compilation CD . Madonna pops out another one of her classic club anthems that would also sound fine on a car radio . Her voice is in fine form ; she 's much better at singing those lower notes than she was back on `` Like A Prayer . '' This one 's a keeper . `` Where Life Begins '' , like so much of the rest of the album , is boring to the point of being unable to recall a note by the time the next song is through , like `` Waiting '' , `` Secret Garden '' , `` Words '' or `` Why 's It So Hard '' . `` Bad Girl '' is a standard ballad , and done well , but the lyrics fail her . `` Bad girl/drunk by six . Kissing some kind stranger 's lips '' ... hello ? That 's an average college co-ed at a Friday night frat party . What 's the big deal ? `` Thief of Hearts '' makes you think Stacey Q did this stuff better.And that 's a big problem , this set of overlong songs , for the most part , have been done better by lots of other people , including Madonna herself . `` Rain '' is a much better ballad , and probably the other selection for your iPod . `` In This Life '' , a catastrophically boring song , is significant ( for me ) only because the melody is borrowed from a Gershwin piano piece , `` Prelude # 2 . `` I 'm not a classical music lover by ANY stretch of imagination ; the song was one of my recital pieces when I took piano lessons back in junior high . `` Did You Do It ? '' is just awful , a pointless rap with minimal Madonna in it . Why is it even here ? Up to this point in her career , this is her worst album . By far .	-1
Erotica should be an album thriving with songs in the order of 'Vogue ' 'Deeper & deeper ' and 'Express yourself ' , in short ; The Vogue ( house ) album . Instead we 're thrown , the unexciting and unimaginative Erotica . Not only is the album of demo-like quality but , most of it 's craft ( or lack there of ) has little substance to it . For instance , the 'did I do it ? ' track , a complete rap song by some unknown male rapper and Madonna utters not one single word , this song also shares the exact same music as 'the waiting ' , another bland track . the subpar mastering and stripped sound comes off more underdeveloped and low budget than an actual audio effect ; a result , much of the songs become disposable and/or unlistenable . Although this album is her most controversial record content wise , it 's also the least remembered of the bunch . Most people do n't recall an album from her at this point in time . There 's no memorable hits that anyone can reference other than diehard fans . The album got most of it 's promo through tours and not radio . It feels as if Madonna needed more time to get inspired before this production took place .	-1
I have always appreciated Gordon Lightfoot 's music , but of all of his albums I have , this one is by far his weakest effort . The opening cut `` Restless '' is half-decent and autumnal , but the rest of the album is forgetable . Lightfoot 's vocals are lackadaisical and uninspiring , the lyrics are often very difficult to understand , and often drowned out by the instrumentation . Sadly , it often sounds like he 's just mumbling to himself . This is a dull and unimaginative album , and would only appeal to only his most avid fans . His best days of making really good music have long since passed , and maybe it 's time for Lightfoot to sit back , relax , and take the rest of life off by going fishing or hunting in his native Canada ( See my album review for his double CD set `` The United Artists Collection '' for reviewing Lightfoot 's BEST music ) .	-1
Prince has always been able to write catchy hooks , and put a good beat down to his music . But it 's his words that have always done him in . With songs like Gett Off , Cream , and Sexy mf , its hard to enjoy the music , with out having to listen to his sometimes vulgar lyrics ... Disk one - 4 stars , disk two - 2 stars , disk three- 0 stars . This shows how the power of music can do good and bad , but the for the most part , it show the power of music when it sucks .	-1
Not one of my favorite Costello recordings ; nothing here makes my EC Top 50 list . 'London 's Brilliant Parade ' and 'Favourite Hour ' come closest.Other OK cuts include 'Pony St. ' , 'Sulky Girl ' , 'Still Too Soon To Know ' , 'My SciFi Twin ' , 'Just About Glad ' and 'All the Rage ' . If you must procure 'Brutal Youth ' to complete your Elvis collection , try to pick it up used for $ 5 or so .	-1
Chalk me as one of those people who just did n't `` get '' the genius of this band or at least this particular album . I plucked this CD out of the bargain bin of a local shop recently , figuring it was worth a try . I played it a full 10 times before realizing it was never going to click for me . Sorry , just not my thing , I suppose . To me these `` songs '' sound like rough demos , or pieces of compositions in their uncompleted state . I hear snippets of tunes , but nothing that ever sounds fully formulated . The phrase `` slacker jazz '' was used by one reviewer to describe them . Hmm ... I guess that sort of captures the sound , along with bits of hip-hop . If that 's your thing , you might like this album . As for me , I prefer things much more tuneful .	-1
Despite some interesting songs like & quot ; Sanctuary & quot ; , & quot ; Bedtime Stories & quot ; or & quot ; Secret & quot ; , this Madonna album is nothing to write home about . Presenting a mix of R & amp ; B/pop/soul , this effort fails to seduce and intrigue , being a listenable enough yet ultimately blah record at best . It ` s more tolerable than & quot ; Erotica & quot ; , though , but far worse than the subsequent and more innovative & quot ; Ray of Light & quot ; , & quot ; Music & quot ; and & quot ; American Life & quot ; . An average record from an uneven artist.Mostly filler material .	-1
I & quot ; LOVE & quot ; all of Ms. Madonnas albums to the extreme with the exception of this one and Erotica . Although she sings great as she has always , the songs here leave something to be desired . With the exception of & quot ; Take A Bow & quot ; , I do n't listen to any of the other songs on this album . I 'm glad she 's back with & quot ; Ray Of Light & quot ; , Her best studio album since & quot ; Like A Prayer & quot ; . Go get one of those if you want some good Madonna music . Skip this one and Erotica .	-1
Highlights here include the seductive `` Forbidden Love , '' which puts the listener in a hypnotic trance . An uncensored `` Human Nature '' tells the listener to follow their own rules , and not those of a control freak . `` Survival '' gives the same message in a more upbeat way . Unfortunately , these 3 tracks sound similar , and it causes them to stand out less on the album . They also fall flat in comparison to Madonna 's spunky 80 's pop , or outstanding 90 's ballads . `` Take A Bow , '' the sugar sweet duet with Babyface , is Madonna 's biggest hit to date , and not without reason . `` Secret '' is a good track , but comes across as an Erotica throwaway that pales in comparison with that album 's other tracks . `` Bedtime Stories '' marks the album 's last good track . It 's a shame that it sounds rather lifeless & mechanical . It was also a sign of the type of music that would take over the rest of her career , and cause her albums to be exempt from the charts & thrown in discount bins everywhere.The GHV2 & Something To Remember albums would be more practical to buy than this or the other 3 albums that came after it .	-1
As an album , Bedtime Stories is insipid , uninspired , boring and a tedious aural exercise . I know the intention is to do some ballads , but Madge seems to drag her feet vocally and comes across as lackadaisical.Some tracks are pretty tuneless , think Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary . The album could do with some rigorous editing to whittle down the set to the really catchy ones . And release this as an EP.Two stars for the hits - Secret and Take A Bow . The latter produced by Whats-His-Face.If you do not own this , you may just want to get Celebration which contains these songs.Looking at the brighter side , Bedtime Stories is a great cure for insomnia !	-1
A very mellow and laidback Madonna album . With mainly midtempo and fluffy love songs that have the ability put one right to sleep , hence the title ; Bedtime Stories . None of the singles from this album represent it 's true sound . The songs do n't match , flow or align with one another ; the entire production is inconsistent , not to mention the poor sequencing.An rnb song with mild hiphop flavor and unapologetic lyrics open 's the album 'i 'll never be an Angel , I 'll never be a Saint , Im too busy surviving ' . A song anyone expects to hear after a smash like 'Human Nature ' . Then sadly we run into endless , lengthy , basic and/or dull winded-down songs about love . This is where I become agitated and resentful by what 's clouding my speakers . The ultimate fail of the album would be 'Do n't Stop ' ; a cutesy and basic pop tune that does nothing for anything else present on the album . It 's basic , simple , amateur and bubblegum considering where her career was at this time ; karaoke at it 's best.Then there are songs like 'Inside of Me ' 'I 'd Rather be your Lover ' and several others that overlap in sound ; fragile and mushy songs about love , and suddenly you 're smacked in the face with the cutting-edge kickdrum of 'Human Nature ' , an inyourface track that glamorizes the `` b '' word , it does n't add up . The bigger question is : How does such a song come about in a recording session drenched in love ballads ? Why would you even want these songs to co-exist together on one album ? It 's not making sense ; which could be why this record highlighted no tours . 'Inside of Me ' and 'Take a Bow ' would hit the mark as first singles . 'Secret ' is another out of place track omn the album . 'Survival ' and singles like 'Secret ' and 'Human Nature ' are misleading and strange compared to the dominating sound of all the others . I expected Erotica with a groovier , modern hiphop/rnb twist and her usual pop elements , certainly not this ...	-1
When I bought this album I was hoping for some Johnny Marr guitar , yes , maybe with some electronic stuff , but still JM is JM ! Only , this has nothing to do with his guitar , you ca n't even hear the sound of his guitar . I mean , I was not expecting The Smiths , but at least some of Marr 's musical invention . Sorry , but this is not my cup of tea ! ! Buy it only if you like New Order or other electronic bands , do n't buy it if you like the Smiths .	-1
The suprise success of Electronic 's debut eventually meant that there had to be a follow-up somewhere . Unfortunately , the charm of the debut does not carry to `` Raise The Pressure , '' and disc that is more Sumner than Marr and sounds like a weaker New Order album , without the hooks . `` Raise The Pressure '' misses the added pleasure of Neil Tennent 's guest vocals . If that is what you 're looking for , fine , but be warned . Just about any New Order album ( or for that matter , Pet Shop Boys or OMD ) is a better buy.Some side projects best remain one-shots .	-1
2 1/2This drafty-not-breezy adult contemporary does retain a slight credibility mainly because of its bossa nova borrowings , but plays out as Brazilian jazz for the Borders set , with a pretentiously breathy approach .	-1
I bought this CD not long after it came out . It did n't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it ! ! ! I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden . Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael . He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already . Stick with your roots Michael ... you are from California ... not South America . Try buying Blue Pacific instead ! ! ! I abandoned this one a long time ago .	-1
I could hardly believe my ears when In first listened to this album . I know I may have had too high expectations to this follow-up album to their masterpiece `` Kiko '' . I gave it many chances , hoping to discover great moments that I might have overheard the first times ; but somehow they never seemed to appear.As usual the playing is impeccable , but the great problem with this album in general is the lack of good songs . The first track `` Revolution '' is not a bad track , but not up to Los Lobos ` normal high standards ; but still one of the best efforts on this album.Next track to really capture my attension is `` Manny ` s Bones '' ; among the previous 6 tracks there have been some solid blues-based efforts ; but none of them particularly memorable . The same can be said about tha last three tracks . If I were to compile a Los Lobos compilation , I think I would only consider the 2 before mentioned tracks.On second thoughts , Im pretty sure I would include `` Revolution '' .	-1
I love Los Lobos ! I have six of their albums and have had the good fortune to have seen them several times . However , this album is uninspired and horrid compared to other great Los Lobos albums like `` Kiko '' or `` How Will Wolf Survive . '' Perhaps it is the greater expectations that I have for this band that cause me to take a less than flattering view of this album , perhaps . But I do n't think so . I am shocked by all of the five star ratings in here . This is a very short album with hastily put together blues jams that lack much innovation or creativity . Did these people actually listen to this CD or are they just so loyal to the band that they will not speak the truth ? I love them and can say without a doubt that this is their worst album .	-1
As one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time , anthologizing Van Halen is a tough task . This is proven by 1996 's `` The Best Of Van Halen , Volume 1 '' , a measly 17 track , single disc collection that leaves much more than it includes.It 's not that the music is bad . Almost all of the first 14 tracks are essential for any Van Halen fans . As a matter of fact , no hard rock fan can be without `` Eruption '' , `` Runnin ' With The Devil '' , `` Ai n't Talkin ' Bout Love '' , `` Dance The Night Away '' , `` Jump '' , `` Panama '' , `` Why Ca n't This Be Love '' , `` When It 's Love '' or `` Right Now '' . I also liked that the producers chose to include underrated tracks like `` Dreams '' and `` And The Cradle Will Rock '' . The fact is , there is n't enough . There are so many classic songs left out , both from the David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar era . Here is a partial list.Hits/Chart Singles : - '' You Really Got Me '' ( number 36 ) - '' Beautiful Girls '' ( number 84 ) - '' ( Oh ) Pretty Woman '' ( number 12 ) - '' Dancing In The Street '' ( number 38 ) - '' I 'll Wait '' ( number 13 ) - '' Hot For Teacher '' ( number 56 ) - '' Love Walks In '' ( number 22 ) - '' Black And Blue '' ( number 34 ) - '' Finish What Ya Started '' ( number 13 ) - '' Feels So Good '' ( number 35 ) - '' Top Of The World '' ( number 27 ) - '' Not Enough '' ( number 97 ) Notable Album Tracks : - '' Everybody Wants Some '' - '' Best Of Both Worlds '' - '' Runaround'- '' Jamie 's Cryin ' '' - '' Little Guitars '' - '' Summer Nights '' - '' Mean Streets '' - '' Do n't Tell Me ( What Love Can Do ) '' - '' Ice Cream Man '' - '' So This Is Love '' The new songs do absolutely nothing to help . In fact , they are terrible . `` Human Beings '' , the last thing they recorded with Sammy Hagar until their 2004 reunion ( more on that later ) is loud and messy . Sammy obviously left the group on a low note . 1996 was when the group did a one time reunion with David Lee Roth . But what could 've been a special moment in rock history turns out to be forgettable , as neither `` Ca n't Get This Stuff No More '' or `` Me Wise Magic '' are any good . If I had my way , I would have dumped these three tracks as well as `` Unchained '' and `` Poundcake '' to make room for some of the better tracks left off.For a far better representation of Van Halen 's , pick up the two disc `` Best Of Both Worlds '' , which has 36 of their best songs ( not all the best , but close . Its new recording are much better , three new tracks by Hagar , who is now backin the group . The one advantage that this cd holds over `` BOBW '' is that it 's done chronologically . Other than that , this is a forgettable affair .	-1
This is obviously a Sammy Hagar influeced GHs , I ` m flabbergasted that more DLR wasnt included , just because the guy has an ego as big as the Grand Canyon is no reason to keep his material off the CD . VH should be ashamed of themselves for even putting this garbage out . All there best music was with DLR , Hagar blows compared to Roth , besides the fact no material from Diver Down is even on this CD . what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? I see others have put setlists that should have been on this effort ( small effort ) if that , and they are right , this CD should be ALL David Lee Roths songs , not Hagar . I never bought this CD but have seen the setlist and laughed when I saw it . I did see VH in 95 with Hagar and he wouldnt even sing the songs that Roth wrote , wussy ... . I have never gone back to see them since , when Roth comes back I will see them ... . Not Recommended unless your a Hagar fan ... .	-1
Van Halen is a legendary hard rock group . Having just seen them less than a month ago , I can tell you , this band still has it , even as they push 60 . These guys just plain ROCK . 'The Best of Van Halen , Volume 1 ' made an effort to compile the best of both eras : the David Lee Roth era ( 1978-1984 ; 1996 ) and the Sammy Hagar era ( 1985-1995 ) onto one single disc . Honestly , as you can tell by the star rating , it comes up short.The title suggests it is a 'Volume 1 , ' meaning that a volume 2 would have to follow . 16 years after this compilation 's release , we still do n't have a volume 2 , and so it is probably safe to assume that we are n't going to get one . Which is a shame , because as a standalone , this album is severely lacking.Sure , 'Running with the Devil ' is here . 'Eruption , ' 'Ai n't Talkin ' 'Bout Love , ' 'Unchained ' ( a non-hit but rather a really great album track that does garner a good bit of airplay on classic rock radio nowadays ) , 'Jump , ' 'Panama , ' and a handful of Hagar-era tunes ( 'Why Ca n't This Be Love , ' 'Dreams , ' 'Right Now , ' 'Poundcake , ' the new-for-1996 tune 'Humans Being , ' a soundtrack song which is surprisingly good ) , but what 's not here is also a major issue . 'Beautiful Girls , ' 'I 'll Wait , ' 'Love Walks In , ' 'Finish What Ya Started , ' 'Dancing in the Streets , ' 'Pretty Woman , ' 'Cabo Wabo , ' '5150 , ' 'Hot for Teacher , ' 'Light Up the Sky , ' 'Everybody Wants Some ! ! , ' and many more ( too many to list ) are all missing on this Van Halen compilation . It 's not essential for those reasons . Warner Bros. needs to wake up and release a volume 2 to go along with this , because this just is n't beneficial on its own.It is worth the money if you are a devoted fan for one reason : the two new-for-1996 DLR tracks , which , up until 'A Different Kind of Truth ' this year , was the best you were gon na get for a Van Halen reunion . These two tracks , 'Ca n't Get This Stuff No More ' and 'Me Wise Magic ' sound fresh and exciting and give this compilation oomph ( something it really does need ) . Roth is in fine voice here ( and he still is in 2012 , TRUST ME ) , and Michael Anthony 's harmonies just sound flawless . This is in all likelihood the last time the original lineup of Van Halen will perform together in a studio environment ( as Wolfgang Van Halen is now VH 's bassist and Anthony now spends his time with Sammy Hagar in the supergroup Chickenfoot ) , thus these recordings are vital to your Van Halen collection.The sound on this disc is also excellent . It 's not overcompressed and distorted -- it is just right . Crisp , clean , and airy , just the way CDs ( and vinyls , for that matter ) are supposed to sound.Overall , 'The Best of Van Halen , Vol . 1 ' by itself is a severely lacking compilation worthy of two stars , simply because Warner Bros. can not get their acts together and release a proper companion piece to this set . However , the two Roth recordings make this disc a worthy purchase for any true blue Van Halen fan , and for that reason ( not to mention it is dirt cheap and VERY easy to locate ) , you 'll probably buy it anyway . 'Humans Being , ' 'Ca n't Get This Stuff No More , ' and 'Me Wise Magic ' all are worthwhile songs that automatically save this disc from a 1-star rating . Unfortunately , 3 songs just is n't enough to save this disc from a more than 2-star rating . The rest of the material is repetitive for die-hards , and while the material here is great , THERE JUST IS N'T ENOUGH OF IT .	-1
Like the last person said , there where better hits then alot of what is on the collection of crap ! I bought this expecting that the songs i already knew & quot ; eruption & quot ; & quot ; pannama & quot ; & quot ; jump & quot ; ect would have songs just as good ? but i was wrong , maybe if it had a second disc , or a greatest hits 2 with it it would have been more worth the while ? one that was not mentioned tho that i beleive shouldve been there was & quot ; good enough & quot ; ... .. so basicly , where the hell is & quot ; you really got me ? & quot ; & quot ; Pretty woman & quot ; & quot ; good enough & quot ; & quot ; hot for teacher & quot ; ? this choice of songs was not thought out very well !	-1
So many key tracks were left off , From Dave 's era Janie 's crying , You really got me , Atomic punk , Beautiful girls , Mean streets , Hear about it later , Dancin in the streets , Where have all the good times gone , Pretty women , I 'll wait ; Hell , where 's Hot for teacher ? Sammy 's half lacks 5150 , Summer nights , Best of both worlds , Finish what ya started , Judgement day , The Dream is over , Runaround , and Top of the world.This compilation re-inforces my belief that greatest hits are just the record companies out grubbing for cash.The new tunes Ca n't get this stuff no more and me wise magic are alright , it 's great to here David Lee Roth behind the mic again . Download 'em if you can . VH fans starting from scratch might be better served with the individual albums . Check used record stores .	-1
I do n't know if I could ever fully express my gratitude to Rod.. A couple of years back , I had a blind date.. Well , she was more attractive than I ever could have expected ; I was at a loss for words and I simply just froze up . I had gone into this date with no expectations ; I did n't bring flowers ; I simply just honked when I arrived at her place of residence.. When we started to leave for our destination ( on the phone , I had originally flat out lied and told her I was broke and could only afford Subway ; and to go dutch at the dollar cinema ) she was cold . When I was able to compose myself and actually attempt to make conversation , I got nothing . She clearly was n't impressed with me . I attempted to smooth things over by telling her that she did n't look anything like I had expected ; she expressed the same sentiment to me , but unfortunately , before we met , she told me that I had a gorgeous voice.. Anyway , there we were driving ; her head turned towards the window ; I 'm quickly grasping for any possible solution to pull me out of this hole.. Then , I remember , I had taken my Grandmother out to lunch earlier in the week , and she had left a Rod Stewart album in my stereo . Normally , I would n't think twice about it , but this was no ordinary Stewart disc . No , this was n't his humdrum work from the early '70s , or that lame duet with Jeff Beck.. this was the sensual guarantee of being asked in at the end of the night.I started with the first track , `` If We Fall In Love Tonight '' ; I needed to get the message to this girl that it was okay , She could let go , and who better to help me express this sentiment than Rod ? As the vocal started , she actually turned her attention away from the passing traffic and commented that she thought she had heard this one before , but could n't put her finger on the time or place.It did n't get me very far , but at least she was talking..Then , I skipped ahead to `` For The First Time '' ; at that point , she spoke again , and said that this one always reminded her of a root canal . I did n't understand , but then she explained that there was a version of this that the guy who did the song `` Footloose '' did , and when she had some dental issues a few years back , she heard the song , over and over again while sitting in the chair.This was n't going at all as I had planned , so I moved ahead to `` When I Need You '' ; all of the sudden , I felt an arm come around my shoulder- she giggled and whispered in my ear , `` you know what this one is really about , do n't you ? '' Well , I had no clue what she was talking about , but what difference did it make ? I was finally getting somewhere , so I smiled and nodded , and let the track play in it 's entirety.When , `` Have I Told You Lately '' began , I felt her hand on my knee . She told me that for some reason , this remix took her back to high school , when a video by the group `` Color Me Bad '' was popular , in which a man and woman were trapped together in an elevator.. I could n't believe how much this girl could blab , but I did n't care , the CD was working , she was getting increasingly heated up.By track eight , we were kissing rather intensely , and no , it 's no coincidence that the song playing was a slow jam like `` The First Cut Is The Deepest '' .The deal was pretty much set with `` Tonight 's The Night '' , but when my date did n't hear the French whispers at the end , she cooled off a little bit . I almost panicked , but then `` Sometimes When We Touch '' closed the deal . It went back to the whole elevator scenario again ( shrug ) ; only this time it was a connection to an Aerosmith song.. Whatever the case , it did n't matter , she asked if I wanted to pass on our plans for the evening and just go back to her place for a drink.. Thank you , Rod..Oh and no , you do n't have to ask , we finished the CD once we arrived at her place- it all went well until the last two tracks : `` Forever Young '96 '' started her talking about her need to start a family before she was too old ; and I 'm sure `` All For Love '' , featuring Bryan Adams and Sting is self explanatory..Anyway , after this release , I thought we almost lost Rod ; he actually put out an album in '98 ( When We Were The New Boys ) that featured rockers , where he was attempting to go back to his roots ( yawn ) .. but it 's always darkest before the dawn ; he then did a motivational song for the `` Patch Adam 's '' soundtrack- and then the flood.. `` The Great American Songbook '' . With this exceptional , four volume set , we realized Rod had n't lost anything ; and I 'm sure I do n't have to explain my good fortunes on subsequent dates .	-1
The biggest problem with Vanishing Point is that it does n't really maintain a consistent tone . It starts off with an excursion into electronic dub , slowly developing a somewhat dark and moody feel . But then , on track four , it throws you a really earnest , folksy acoustic ballad that expresses reverence for civil rights icons , sounding like theManic Street Preachersat their least vital . I can applaud the sentiment , but this sounds really out of place after you 've been working hard to create a sense of menace.On the second side , it gets even worse . Primal Scream have always been goofyStonesrevivalists at heart ( they just have exceptional taste in dance music ) , but the band 's landmark albumsScreamadelicaandXTRMNTRboth find ways to incorporate that tendency into electronic music so it does n't stand out too much . But `` Medication '' is a completely unadorned straight-ahead attempt at blues-rock , and it sounds very repetitive and boring . What 's worse , it is immediately followed by aMotorheadcover . I have nothing against Motorhead , but Bobby Gillespie has the wrong voice for any kind of swaggering hard rock . It makes him sound weak and straining.This is all a bit easier to take if you remember that the band 's goal is to create an alternate soundtrack to the movieVanishing Point . In that context , the sudden use of sixties-style folk is more understandable . If you view the protracted , long jams in the dub songs as a stoned road movie soundtrack , it makes more sense . The electronic songs `` Out Of The Void '' and `` Stuka '' are unremarkable musically , but they do have a sort of trippy vibe . Still , it 's not really first-rate material.Perhaps it would be easier to just enumerate the good parts . The first three songs are pretty good . `` Burning Wheel '' has Gillespie singing about something or other in a detached manner , accompanied by a reverberating guitar line . The song takes a really long time to get off the ground , but it sets the tone for a freaky dub album . `` Get Duffy '' is a fine instrumental . It has a jam-like quality , but the rhythm is funky and enjoyable . This leads into the excellent `` Kowalski , '' which rips off the bass line fromMassive Attack 's `` Safe From Harm '' ( hey , steal from the best ) and lays some sampled dialogue and droning guitar over it . The hoarse , rhythmic whisper repeating `` Kowalski , vanishing point '' is oddly effective.The dub-jam sound comes back a couple more times . `` If They Move Kill 'Em '' uses a really neat dub echo as the lead . The guitar line that counters the lead seems a bit incongruous , but does the stoned seventies thing well enough . Personally , I preferKevin Shields'incredible deconstruction of this track on XTRMNTR , which is much harsher , trippier , and simultaneously more danceable . However , the original does occasionally emphasize a funk-keyboard backdrop that is quite appealing . Toward the end , `` Trainspotting '' is basically another long jam with electronic effects , and it 's all right , though not particularly memorable.Whether you like this album or not will heavily depend on how much the idea of a bunch of meandering dub jams for a road movie suits your mood . I have a lot of trouble listening to the whole album most of the time ( and I gave it many chances ) , but once in a while I hit a mood where this sort of half-focused , lazy , vaguely weird music sounds pretty good , when neither of the focused , well-defined tones of Screamadelica and XTRMNTR seems to be quite what I 'm looking for . In that setting , Vanishing Point might be just the thing ( `` Kowalski '' definitely gets some momentum going ) , but even then , I sort of have to force myself to ignore the blues-rock detours . I 'd suggest leaving this one for after you become acquainted with the band 's two most famous albums .	-1
This CD was a bit of a disappointment for me . Dischordant bits often drag on and on . For those looking for a Screamadelica-style experience , this is not it . & quot ; Medication & quot ; ( depite other reviews ) is a good tune . But 1 out of however-many , is not a good ratio . I might not buy more Primal Scream CDs after this , which bums me out .	-1
When this record came out in 1997 , it was considered one of the year ` s best releases and a groundbreaking album . The hit `` Brimful of Asha '' played everywhere and Cornershop became the new flavor-of-the-month . A curious flavor that mixed pop and indian vibes , generating a mildly eccentric and somewhat refreshing sound . Well , despite a good beginning with `` Sleep on the Left Side '' , an alright song , the rest of the record isn ` t all that great and shows few points of interest . Most of the songs here are just repetitive , monotonous interludes that keep going on with no sense of cohesion . At times there ` s a good beat or an original moment , but overall it just disappoints and doesn ` t really glue . Just another example of style over substance , a hip record that hasn ` t much to deliver and ends up being listenable but average background music . Asian Dub Foundation , Nitin Sawney or Talvin Singh do this type of asian underground sound better .	-1
A list of things wrong with this : 1 . Only the first 2 tracks have any real style or class- everything else is a tiresome mess of overused scratches , disjointed production and lifeless musicianship2 . Brimful Of Asha blatantly rips off When I Come Aorund by Green Day3 Brimful Of Asha needed Norman Cook , at that moment the epitome of trendiness , to make it a hit4 People got into it because of the novelty aspect of an Asian version of Beck , eclectic and awkward . But Beck had some tunes.5 The cover of the US version dispenses with the Asian cultural influences of the UK one and replaces them with an attractive Asian lady . Not a cynical attempt to shift units and put across an Asian image the mainstream would want , by any chance ? 6 It has now become fashionable , at least in the UK , for any record made by British Asians ( I know 3 of this group are n't but the have a predomenantly Asian sound ) and mixing in Bhangra alongside hip-hop , electronic and lo-fi . This I would attribute to people 's lack of wilingness to slate anything ethnic . No disrepect to Asian people , this is what their tradional music comes from . But I doubt many Asian youths own any classical music . Asian Dub Foundation and Talvin Singh make much more exciting sounds.7 The version of Norwegian Wood resembles desecration . What would people say if a white guitar group tried to cover a bhangra song like this ? Anyone who , after seeing this , still rates this record , well I ca n't understand you .	-1
Despite some apealling moments that show this bands ` uniqueness and stenght ( `` Stripsearch '' , `` Mouth to Mouth '' , `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' , `` Ashes to Ashes '' ) , `` Album of the Year '' is nothing special for the most part . The majority of the songs aren ` t bad , yet they never seem to rise above average , merely listenable material either . Overall , this record lacks personality and staying power , presenting bland and not very intense rock tracks . Faith No More can do better and quirkier music than this middle-of-the-road effort without distinction or impact.Not memorable enough .	-1
When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called , `` Album of the Year '' , I got pumped . I knew `` King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime '' was a flop , so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track . I was sadly mistaken . This album , to my amazement , got very good reviews at the time it was released . I just did n't see it . `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' was a decent song , as was `` Ashes to Ashes '' , but other than that , I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs , most of them being more on the weak side.This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang , with `` The Real Thing '' , and `` Angel Dust '' . Two remarkable albums . I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things , but if you call Mike Patton 's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music , all power to you .	-1
Please stop calling this the best CD ever . You have got to be kidding yourself . I admit a few songs had potential , like Around the Fur and Be Quiet And Drive , but they just wasted them . My Own Summer steals the riff from Metallica 's The Outlaw Torn and most of the other songs sound like they used the first riff that popped in their head and used it for the whole song . That 's too bad , since everyone in the band is talented , as shown in the fury and hooks of Adrenaline ( Before Chino ruined his voice by shouting so much ) and the beautiful music of White Pony . Try those out if you like , but be quiet and drive ( far away from this CD ) .	-1
Boring . If we were only allowed one word to describe an album , that would be it . 5 out of 5 ? Absolutely amazing ? Excuse while I clear up the wet patch I made with my laughter . I mean , yeah ! Lets make a wall of fuzz , hit the snare drum about 4 times a minute , whisper into the mic and occasionally scream - but instead of making it a cool , gut wrenching scream , it sounds like a mouse who caught his jabber in his flies . A powerful singer ? Bruce Dickenson is a powerful singer . Geoff Tate is a powerful singer . Matt Barlow is a powerful singer . Even King bloody Diamond has a more entertaining voice ( albeit for the wrong reasons ) . Chino Moreno is just an average nu-metal vocalist - nothing more.I suppose I could praise the Deftones for ( A ) not rapping ( most of the time ) , and ( B ) putting more than 2 chords in their riffs ; but even Slipknot ( who are far more commercial ) have some degree of excitement and energy . How a group of Deftones fans slagged me off for liking Iron Maiden claiming that they had & quot ; no edge & quot ; is beyond me . I mean , what is THIS then ? The musical equivalent of a ninja scimitar ? Nu-metal sucks , and along with Korn , Limp Bizkit , Sevendust , Slipknot and all the other crap that 's out there , this is proof why . I know I 'm not the most open-minded metaller but I do recognise that Deftones are one of the few slightly intelligent nu-metal bands ( Tool being another - I do n't like them much but they 're better than THIS ) . But this is boring ! The only even slightly bearable songs are Be Quiet And Drive and Headup.And to the reviewer who said this was one of the heaviest albums ever , HA HA ! ! You 're entitled to your opinion but this is not very heavy AT ALL . What is it with you people ? Have you never heard of death metal or something ?	-1
this is a terrible album ! the riffs are bad and the lyrics are bad ! there 's better albums ! try somethin ' like led zeppelin !	-1
Hard rockers are back with a new album full of the same undistinguishable songs . The album 's big single & quot ; Shove It & quot ; is a great heavy metal song in it 's own right , but the rest of the album crumbles under the pressure of that one hit . Not much potential any way you look at it .	-1
Boy , what a pile of dung . All of it . I fully agree with all the electronica fans who rated it as garbage.Oh , hold on a second : I just remembered , all of electronica sucks , every single & quot ; song & quot ; or whatever electronica is.So let me rephrase my critic : this album is a great , perfect example of today 's electronica .	-1
& quot ; Forzen & quot ; is pure excellence . I really looked forward to the rest of the CD upon purchasing it . It turned to be 12 other tracks of Madonna hopelessly trying to ape Bjork . Pathetic . Orbit has talents , but nothing could lend credibility to the sorrowful attempt for Madonna to become a rave hippie .	-1
This is supposed to be techno ? If that 's the case , then 'N Sync must be a hardcore punk band . I 've listened to the tracks and there is no bold reinvention , no meaningful lyrics , no substance at all - just a somewhat technologically-advanced version of the adult contemporary pap Madonna has always recorded . She somehow managed to turn what should have been 15 minutes of fame into 15 years , but it was n't her music or singing that did it . Her voice is still painfully thin and often nasal , the music is nowhere near as entrancing as REAL techno , and the lyrics rehash the same themes . Take this example : Apparently Madonna has a fleeting interest in becoming a neurosurgeon , as we 've concluded from these lyrics - you 've got & quot ; You 're frozen when your heart is not open & quot ; from & quot ; Frozen & quot ; , and & quot ; Your heart is not open so I must go & quot ; from & quot ; The Power Of Goodbye & quot ; . Many of the other lyrics also sound like a self-absorbed pat on the back , but that 's to be expected from Madonna . Anyway , most techno sounds better without lyrics/vocals unless they add something bold and interesting to the songs ( like Underworld and Apollo Four Forty ) - that 's not the case with the dull and predictable Ray Of Light . Trust me , once you get into some real techno ( not some adult contemporary act who 's desperately trying to make teenagers think she is cool ) you 'll forget this ever existed .	-1
this disc is one of the most overrated ever.her voice sounds as bad as ever and the music has been done back in the 80's.the group garbage did a better job at the eletronica thing.remember erotica ? did it already and it was n't good then and is n't good now.her first album and bed time stories are far better.and awards do n't make a lasting album .	-1
this is for lost teenagers who want to experiment drugs , and promiscuous sex .	-1
This is a re-review , I 've done some personal research with this album and gave it another chance and I just ca n't get into it . Mainly it 's the music . The lyrical content is just fine , and as Ive mentioned in my other reviews for Madonna albums that Im not fond of 'Its amazing what some beat adjustments , DJing and remixing can do to a song ' it gives the song entirely new vibe and perspective.When it comes to Madonna I prefer her as a pop/dance artist with attitude , sass , glamour and edge . All of what I personally look for and expect in Madonna is n't present in Ray of Light , which makes a very boring and disappointing collection for me . Ray of Light ( like Music and American Life ) is a complete snooze to me . These three albums in my opinion are all alike and have a huge overlap with one another while still being their own record . Ray of Light through American Life is a Madonna within itself . Not one that Im personally excited about.The issue here is not that Madonna has chosen to switch gears , the mood and style are not the problem ( even though Id prefer a higher energy ) the problem is that the beat arrangments arent the best of their kind ( for me ) , Ive heard better trip-hop or mellow pop songs with this same feel . This album ( like Music ) still has elements ofdance music but its a sub-genre of its own , its sound is a more distinct one . Its more like contemporary lounge music . Very conservative , mild and mellow mood . Its an album that would play on low with recessed lighting and light cocktails with indoor voices and no dancing . Evening attire , dim lighting and a very chic lounge . In that sense it works but thats not a daily activity . This album isnt something I would listen to on full blast everyday of the week , its more of a mood . Something you 'hear ' but dont actually 'listen ' to if that makes any sense.A few important elements are missing in this album as well as Music and American Life . All 3 are missing the passionate singing that 's found in her most popular work . There 's barely any yells or massive vocal performances . When listening to songs like 'Open your heart ' 'Vogue ' 'Like a Prayer ' 'Confessions on a dancefoor ' and other hits like 'Secret ' you can hear what 's missing in her vocals on this album . Sure , there are songs on this album that exhibit some passion in her vocals but its very subtle as to noy disrupt the mood of the album . Madonna is not Whitney Houston or Celine Dion ( we know this ) but she has a really good pop vocal that 's amazing . If you watch her perform Frozen & Power of Goodbye live the songs are comparable to really big favorites of mine like 'In this life ' from Erotica or 'Oh Father ' from Like a Prayer . Lots of vibrato and range , you can hear in these live performances that her voice has not changed much since 1989-1994 . Yet her studio performances with this album sounds as if her voice has matured to a point she sings alot different from that time frame . Her vocals are distinctly different on this album from the ones prior , but the live performances from then and on.this album all sound like the ecact same voice ... Strange , I really think this album wouldve been more popular had she showcased her stage vocals in the album work.Ive learned to respect this album even though it does absolutely nothong for me . I respect her evolution as an artist and trying new things but this album to me was just completely flat and lifeless . Ray of Life is a matter of taste , anyone can listen to it and hear that everyone is not going to like this album . The sound is a very distinguished one . Sure there 's some pop flavour on certain songs but not enough that it would be classified as being 'pop'.I thought that this album was completely terrible , but Its not the songs that I dont like . Its the music that I dont like . I know this because I was online and stumbled across a remix of Candy Perfume Girl and could n't believe it was the same song . I downloaded it and played it back a few times , the remix has a hip-hop groove and a modern grunge feel to it , very edgy and dynamic . Which is exactly what I was looking for in this album . I began to come across different remixes such as Swim , this remix ( again ) had a 90 's hiphop groove with industrial sounds and a grunge styled edge to the beat , After all these years I said to.myself 'this is it , this is the Ray of Light album I wanted all along ' it was perfect.Another remix I enjoyed was the Sticky & Sweet tour version of the Ray of Light track . The pitch was taken down and more pop with a more melodic sound opposed to the original . I personally never liked the original versions of anything on this album . As I mentioned before Ray of Light is something you 've got to have a taste or mood for . Its not a basic or traditional pop album and theres nothing wrong with that , I wouldve preferred better craftsmanship with the music , which ive found on my own through alternative measures such as remixes , club mixes , live versions and so on.One song that caught my attention when I purchased this album is Little Star , but the music spoils it for me . I just dont think the insyrumental is a good pairing with this song at all . I would prefer the same vocals and lyrics on a different instrumental . The music is too sharp and technical against this soft and delicate song . The music is way too polished and sharpedged for the message in the song . I also was taken by 'nothing really matters ' but somethings missing in this song , I like it because its more dancey than anything else I can think of on this album but the energy that I want is still not present in the track . I have not found a good remix for this track yet , the onrs ive heard so far havent done anything for the track yet . Im sure ill find what im looking for , I.always do.I have all the remixes for Music , American Life and Hard Candy and its intriguing and fascinating what a club mix and some beat rearranging can do for a song because I can listen to these remixes as if theyre the original songs thats how rich they are . The original albums are just not the same . As Ive said time and time again , if Madonna 's albums arent cutting it go for the remixes they never seem to fail ... .Last but certainly not least , The drowned world tour does this album so much justice . There 's added elements in alot of the songs that are not present in the original formulas ( the album/studio versions ) . Candy Perfume Girl is a rocked out version of the song , the performance is wicked ; an extremely thin man does contortions in a spotlight as she stands still playing guitar and singing . I think this is the Silent Remix done live , the title is completely ironic as it 's not silent at all . Another great twist from drowned world tour would be the Mer Girl/Across the sky contraction ; I think the live versions of these songs together make the songs more passionate and she 's actually singing with more effort which adds more vocal and feeling . Especially from all the movong around and dancing she did on that tour ; she was slightly winfed therefore the singing has more 'push ' and effort . She doesnt sound as nonchalant like she does on the album ( I hate that ) , and again the remixes are better tooI rewrote this entire review , it was more judgemental = )	-1
Not the highpoint of her career , I 'll say that . Yeah , the title track is a great bit of 90 's Hi-NRG techno . Catchy stuff . If you just want that track , buy the single and see if you can get some remixes of it too.Sadly , this thing is an album . Albums are inhently prolonged affairs , and here , Madonna seems bent on putting forward a set of songs that ramble on for far longer than they should . I mean , none of these 13 songs are shorter than 4:10 ! ! ! Most tracks begin as a snoozy collage of synthesized dwaddling , with the eventual trip-hop beat sneaking up and suffocating the track with monotony . Some might have some uber-fast dancefloor throbbing , but a bout of four on the floor repetition does nothing to decrease monotony.If you ever needed an excuse to hate 90s techno , well , listen to this album . Then again , listening to any 90s techno will automatically induce human beings to vomit in order to purge their systems of that foul guff . Ugh ... Highlights include : `` Ray of Light , '' and that 's about it.I 'd suggest that you buy The Immaculate Collection and then pick few select singles ( `` Ray of Light , '' `` Music , '' `` Beautiful Stranger '' and `` Hung Up '' ) . That 's pretty much all the Madonna you 'll ever need .	-1
As usual with a Audio Fidelity release , the sound is poor . I am utterly surprised that people buy their stuff-They make the sound far worse than the remastered ordinary release.Kevin Gray and Steve Hoffman are suposedly legendary , but what for ? Bad sound ? It is really annoying to read what the companies write in their commersials : Dynamic , open sound , the best ever , etc . It is just not true . They sound the opposite : Veiled , dark , flat , muddy . The music is very good of course , but the sound-A pity	-1
I am a huge Steely Dan fan and I do n't really like the song selection on this one disc compilation . The music on this disc does n't even fill up the 80 minutes on a CD . I think that a more reasonable one disc SD compilation would look like this:1 . Do it Again2 . Dirty Work3 . Reelin ' in the Years4 . Bodhisattva5 . Show Biz Kids6 . My Old School7 . Rikki Do n't Lose that Number8 . Pretzel Logic9 . Black Friday10 . Bad Sneakers11 . Kid Charlemagne12 . Do n't Take Me Alive13 . The Fez14 . Black Cow15 . Peg16 . Josie17 . FM18 . Hey NineteenYes , all that can fit on one disc ! Putting `` East St. Louis Toodle-Oo '' on here is ridiculous , and not including Josie , Dirty Work , and The Fez is simply unnacceptable .	-1
You know you 're in trouble when a greatest hits album is dull . But then Steely Dan 's obsession with studio perfection and fascination with Jazz clich & eacute ; s is not exactly the stuff of greatness . In fact , I would argue that given Dan 's obsessions , it would be impossible for them to be any good , but they did have a few good tracks . If you are interested , this might be the place for you to start , but I recommend CA N'T BUY A THRILL , it 's not a great album either , but it 's probably the best album this band ever put out .	-1
Floridays is pretty much the lowpoint in the Jimmy Buffett catalog . Outside of the title track & amp ; the melancholy of & quot ; Nobody Speaks To The Captain No More & quot ; , there is n't much to speak of . & quot ; You 'll Never Work In Dis Bisness Again & quot ; lacks the typical Jimmy Buffett humor and & quot ; Creola & quot ; , & quot ; I Love The Now & quot ; , & quot ; First Look & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; No Plane On Sunday & quot ; are dreadful . This unfortunately is a downer for Parrotheads and Jimmy Buffett fans .	-1
I never got it . In the midst of Zeppelin , Sabath , Elton , Doobies , Stones , Santana , Humble Pie etc . you had these guys singing in front of a backup band and singing stuff like `` One '' and `` Jeremiah Bullfrog '' or whatever . Man , if I want to hear the Righteous Bros then I will listen to them . My wife picked up this CD and it did n't do it for me then and it still just hits me as top 40 70 's ish pap . I do n't even know what kind of music this is - maybe Vegas ? For you fans of this type of stuff , I guess it is good stuff .	-1
3/5 of New Edition branch out into & quot ; mentally hip-hop smoothed out on the r & amp ; b tip with a pop feel appeal to it & quot ; , if I may quote the cover . They have the right ingredients , but they do n't sound so good today . These guys are better singers than rappers IMHO , and they did n't seem to have much to say . Outside of the songs about , um , the band ( & quot ; BBD I Thought It Was Me & quot ; , & quot ; Ronnie , Bobby ... & quot ; , & quot ; Ai n't Nut'in Changed & quot ; ) , we learn that there 's girls they wan na do ( & quot ; Do Me ! & quot ; , & quot ; Dope ! & quot ; ) , girls they ( and their crew ! ) used to do ( & quot ; Poison & quot ; ) , and girls they used to do but do n't anymore ( & quot ; When Will I See You Smile Again ? & quot ; ) . The beats and music are serviceable and occasionally engaging , but generally the whole affair is unremarkable . A remix of & quot ; Poison & quot ; is included for those who thought the major problem with the original was that it was too short . Seems like most the positive associations I have with this album are just that - associations ( & quot ; Remember hearing this while cruising down ... ? & quot ; ) . Good for a nostalgia trip , perhaps , but that 's about all .	-1
The year was 1990 , the sound was `` new jack swing '' ... R & B ; laced with hip-hop..the group was Bell , Biv , Devoe..3 former members ( Ronnie Bivins , Ricky Bell , Mike Devoe ) split off from New Edition , the hugely successful R & B ; `` boy band '' of the 80s . The band racked up a quick 6 Top 100 Billboard hits and then disappeared from the charts.HIGHLIGHTS : The title track is far and away the best song here and the only hit that still sounds pretty fresh . The group moves from strength to strength with sharp hip-hop beats , occasional harmony , and a really funky break ( after `` Blow ! '' ) . Outside of that , the album track `` Ai n't Nuttin ' Changed '' is a nice slice of old school hip-hop with a Sly and the Family Stone sample to boot.LOWS : '' Do Me ! '' was a big hit back when , but the junior high locker room ideas about sex are pretty boring to me in my 30s ( it 's no `` Let 's Get it On '' ) . `` Word to the Mutha '' and `` I Do Need You '' do n't really go anywhere musically.BOTTOM LINE : This band was definitely a singles act , you do n't really need the album unless you 're a diehard fan who wants the extended remix of the title track and album track `` Ai n't Nuttin ' Changed '' which is also pretty tough . Outside of that , all the hits can be found on the `` 20th Century Masters : Millennium Edition '' ( ASIN B000066F0S ) or if you really only want `` Poison '' , '' B.B.D . `` , and `` Do Me ! '' you might go for New Edition 's `` All the Number Ones '' ( ASIN B00004T0EB ) which gives you those 3 tracks plus several big 80s hits from their old band .	-1
i like do me & amp ; poison but that 's about it.i though the music was chessy then and even worse now.Ricky Bell had some talent but never got his stuff out.Bivins was a good talent scout ( Boyz 11 Men ) and what did Devoe exactly do ? however there impact is all over current R-n-B & amp ; Hip Hop and that 's not good .	-1
Lynyrd Skynyrd is absolutely one of my favorite bands . They , to me , epitomize what Southern Rock/Bar Rock oughtta sound like . However , I am somewhat of a purist and refuse to listen to anything post Ronnie Van years ( itssssaaaa SIN ! ) My moms bought this album back in the day , back before I knew anything about Lynyrd Skynyrd . This was my first glimpse of the band , and luckily not my last , because if this was all I knew of Lynyrd Skynyrd.. I probably never would have touched them again . This disc is lousy.The faults on this bit go on for miles . Ronnie Van must 've been proud that he was being a tributed , but was prolly rollin ' over to discover it was all a plea to make some of these survivors a little more bread.They should have come up with a different name ... like a tribute name ... Kin-of-Skynyrd ( I just came up with that in two seconds.. it was n't hard ) they vowed never to use the name Lynyrd Skynyrd again in the seventies , and looky here ! 20 years later and the travesty continues ... less than a quarter of the original line-up left ... constant quarrels between members , on who has the rights to what ... real great tribute . Ronnie must be proud.Thats really not the main problem though . New Skynyrd sounds like a country band.. Real Skynyrd was not a country band ... they were a ROCK band ... and who has time to listen to the audience sing the entire Free Bird ? Certainly not I . Go get ONE FROM THE ROAD live circa '74.. the only live skynyrd you need ( good stuff ) , and leave this one for the other birds ... .	-1
despite the importance of this group think r.kelly.jodeci , mary j bliege , dru hill , etc.. this album is not on par with the first disc.teddy is a great producer but a bad vocalist.he nearly ruined long gone.Aaron hall sounded strong.he has n't had anything that has matched his guy days but his influence has continued.the grooves slipped on this disc.but the slow jams held up such as lets chill.hopefully the new one will get it right.however this disc is still better than blackstreets last one by a 100 % .	-1
Bobby Brown lost his flavor on this record.the songs Produced By New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley two can play that game , get away , till the end of time are tight as is the LA & amp ; Babyface cut good enough.but the problem is the wack singing of Brown.he sounds flat.it was n't as bad on this disc as it is now.now he is a tone deaf.also while the album has highlights it has downs as well.besides Bobby 's bad singing some of the music make this album Do n't be cruel part 2.with the right voice this album would have been done better .	-1
Everyone knows this ai n't one of the best Elton albums -- he regularly disowns it during interviews -- but it does have some great material on it . Why is 'Victim Of Love ' remastered and not 'Leather Jackets ' ? It 's about as good as 'Ice On Fire ' and 'Breaking Hearts ' . Songs like 'Paris ' , 'Slow Rivers ' and 'Angeline ' deserve better treatment , along with those missing b-sides . Rocket has done a fine job with all those discs missed by the so-called Classic Years . Get onto it , Rocket !	-1
Leather Jackets , Elton 's 1986 effort is one of his weakest releases . I actually enjoyed it when it was released , but it does not stand the test of time . Once again , Elton 's personal problems were distracting him from making great records . Leather Jackets has a couple of great songs on it however . Hoop of Fire , Slow Rivers and Paris could rank up there with the best of them.But the rest seem like leftovers ( which many were from the previously released and ill-conceived Ice On Fire ) . Elton shares songwriting credits with Bernie Taupin , Cher and Gary Osbourne . Taupin does n't seem to have much to say while Osbourne turns in yet another routine love song on Memory of Love . And the Cher song , Do n't Trust That Woman , is , well , it 's best to leave that one in the cannons of album filler to never be heard from again.Meanwhile , the other songs sound just plain tired . The title track , in which Taupin evokes the great 50 's rock stars gets the snythesizer treatment that buries a perfectly good lyric that could have been another homage to the genre like Crocodile Rock . Elton completely missed the point of Taupin 's lyric here . Go It Alone , a wanna-be heavy rocker , sounds more like Bob Seger 's Shakedown . And that 's not a good thing . The album 's lone single in the US was Heartache All Over The World and the over the top production and endless chants of & quot ; girls , girls , girls & quot ; would have been better suited for any number of generic 80s bands than Elton John.Gus Dudgeon , the master producer of Elton 's golden 70s era , does n't have much to work with . The album has a slick , very 80s production but it ca n't disguise the fact that many of these songs just do n't hold up.The last song , I Fall Apart , is very sad and as Elton pleads throughout the chorus & quot ; it seems to be the night time when I fall apart ; this house can get so lonely & quot ; - you feel his pain.Luckily , his personal life would soon start to turn around and he would prove that there are still some great songs yet to come . We all know what happened . He went on to make some great albums and recharged his batteries.Leather Jackets was a temporary setback for Elton . Vocally , he sounds drained and lifeless . Things got better.And he has never co-wrote a song with Cher since .	-1
Elton does n't like this . I do n't like this . Not many people do . But really , a couple of the ballads , like Paris or Slow Rivers ( with Cliff Richards ) is melodically quite fine . But many tracks is among the most dated , un-creative , un-intelligent pop he ever made . Most of the performances just sounds tired , and his voice was n't in the best shape at the time . With the exception of his 1979 disco album & # 34 ; Victim of love & # 34 ; , this is probably his weakest .	-1
John by this point was probably so tired , and sick that he just probably released this to fufill his contract , and move on . He did have some successes at Geffen , but this sounds like the relationship had soured as there is no traditional piano on this as it sounds like all keyboards and machines . It really zapped out the beauty of what these songs could 've been . I do n't feel that anyone could in his right mind release such material as this . Mind you I found 1986 to be a rather off year for music anyway as alot of the songs seemed to be taken over by machines . Fortunately John got out , and went back to his roots .	-1
Well this album is usually regarded , with the exception of & quot ; Victim Of Love & quot ; , as Elton 's weakest effort . For the most part , I agree , but even though most of the material is faceless , I feel there still is some decent pop music here . & quot ; Heartache All Over The World & quot ; was the single , and while it failed to crack the top 40 , it still was somewhat catchy , I 'd love to see the video for it . Like many other reviwers have said , & quot ; Paris & quot ; and & quot ; Hoop Of Fire & quot ; are decent , & quot ; Go It Alone & quot ; , a song somewhat similiar to & quot ; Act Of War & quot ; ( minus Millie Jackson ) keeps things going in the right direction , while & quot ; I Fall Apart & quot ; sounds as though it could be a lost cut from & quot ; Blue Moves & quot ; or could be included on the future & quot ; Big Picture & quot ; . Okay , so there are about five decent songs , the rest is pretty much filler , but still makes for decent background noise , still , this album can not be viewed any worse than the likes of & quot ; Ice On Fire & quot ; . The thing is , Elton could do so much better , and he eventually did with & quot ; Sleeping With The Past & quot ; .	-1
I 'm amazed at the reviewers below who state that Leather Jackets is not one of Elton 's best , but nevertheless give it 5 stars anyway . The purpose of writing these reviews , after all , is to help potential buyers make choices ; this is not an Elton John fan forum.That said , to anyone who might be contemplating buying this album , I have two words of advice : Stay Away ! Take it from an EJ fan who 's familiar ( and objective ) with all of his work . This one 's a real stinker . Even the borderline-hit Heartache Over the World is mediocre ; it only sounds decent because the songs surrounding it are sub-par . The only winner on this album , in my opinion , is Hoop of Fire , a really lovely R & amp ; B ballad . The rest of this record , though , is mechanical , synthesizer-driven , boredom . The picture of Elton looking tough as a motorcycle gang member is awful funny , but it ai n't worth the price of the CD .	-1
I guess Elton and Bernie were running out of steam , Elton was tired of David Geffen 's record company , or perhaps both . Although this album does have a couple of decent ballads , & quot ; Slow Rivers & quot ; ( Elton 's duet with Cliff Richard ) , & quot ; Hoop Of Fire & quot ; , and especially , & quot ; Paris & quot ; , the rest is dreadful filler , including the only hit single from this album , & quot ; Heartache All Over The World & quot ; . It 's a pity that Gus Dudgeon 's last studio recording with Elton was this dreadful mess . Still , this album is better than Elton 's brief foray into disco , & quot ; Victim Of Love & quot ; , which is certainly his worst .	-1
this album has been trashed as much as his duets with kiki dee-but let me tell u-theres ' some good stuff on here-yeah-i know-madman and gybr-made in england and songs from the west-yes-they r great albums-but take this for what it is.the title song ... -and the single- '' heartache '' -thats just what it is-elton and bernie at their lowest point in songmanship-hey-they r only human -but elton did n't give up- '' hoop '' has some great soul to it- '' do n't trust that woman '' -written by the snow queen herself and `` lady choc ice '' -whoever that may be-but he listed her as a source of inspiration for this album-that says it all-it actually should have been the single off this mess-its catchy and its fun- '' go it alone '' -used in commercials for dog races-has some really good pulsating piano-and theres ' a lot of vocal emotion in `` gypsy heart '' - '' slow rivers '' -a duet with cliff richard is pretty good- '' angeline '' is just some rockin ' fun- '' memory '' -gary and elton never gelled { maybe on `` jump up '' } -but its ' a heartfelt song-something my grandma would like-not for me- '' paris '' -to me-is a classic-the best song on this album-bernie finally gets serious and elton reacts-just a breezy-cool tune that captures the moment- '' i fall apart '' -i do n't know-i 'm still tryin to figure it out-some good vocals though-ok-this even is n't anywhere near their best-bernies lyrics are lame-even though he tries to be convincing on the homage to fifties music idols on the title track-he misses-'cept on paris-c what happens when bernie does n't come through ? -it shows here-but elton manages to redeem himself-and especially bernie-this is n't `` caribou '' - { though close to it } -and it definitely ai n't `` victim of love '' -but give it a spin-i bought it on cd for paris-and i was surprised that there was some other good songs -hey its listenable-check it out -- -- -- --	-1
This is one of Eltons worst albums , produced at a low point in his private life . Worse still ; this is the low point in the way Eltons albums were produced throughout the 80 's and to a lesser degree the 90 's . The album is full of credits like `` Synth Sequences '' , GS-1 , DX7 etc . As as a result the album sounds awful - all the bad things about 80 's music are evident on this album.So why 2 stars and not 1 then ? Well I 'll tell you why , because there are some good songs buried behind the monstrous production . Despite his drug and alcohol problems at the time these are still Elton John songs . However even on most average Elton albums you 'll normally find one classic track - not this album I 'm afraid.So my recommendation is do n't buy it .	-1
Elton was poised for a brief artistic comeback with his next album , Too Low For Zero . This one , `` Jump Up '' , is the last album from that period of creative confusion and drift that affected Elton from 1976'sBlue Movesup until this album . Elton would soon reinvent himself into an adult contemporary soft rocker , a purveyor of muted pleasantries.Bernie Taupin is peeking in the door again as occasional lyricist but many of the songs have the functional but uninspired lyrics of Gary Osborne . The band has a generic 80s adult contemporary sound to it , more wallpaper than backing , so when Elton dishes up a rote number like `` Princess '' it 's not like a fan can point to brilliant performances or musicianship to turn the song into a silk purse.Two songs are on theTo Be Continuedbox set , `` Blue Eyes '' and the homage to John Lennon , `` Empty Garden ( Hey Hey Johnny ) '' . If you have those two winners already , then it 's albums like this that mp3 downloads were made for . Grab the jumpin ' lead track , `` Dear John '' and leave the rest to the hardcore fan base . `` Dear John '' is a wonderful rocker that leaps out of your speakers , sounding like it could have come fromDo n't Shoot Me I 'm Only The Piano Playerand is a far cry better than anything on 1978'sA Single Manor 1984'sBreaking Hearts . If you want to be thorough you might give a listen to the solemn six minute closer , `` All Quiet On The Western Front '' .Once you have `` Dear John '' and the two hits , step forward a year and check outToo Low For Zero , Elton 's best album of the ten year period following his classic era .	-1
Do n't even read the lyric sheets . Just read the titles . & quot ; Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back & quot ; , & quot ; Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are & quot ; , & quot ; Good Girls Go to Heaven ( Bad Girls Go Everywhere ) & quot ; , & quot ; I 'd Do Anything for Love ( But I Wo n't Do That ) & quot ; . It all sounds like a bad joke , and I for one have never bowed to the concept of & quot ; bad is good & quot ; . In the case of Jim Steinman and his fungus-covered bag of awful songwriting tricks , bad is bad and nothing else.Well , to backtrack a little , bad in this case is also & quot ; big & quot ; . The arrangements and production on this album are about as unabashedly big as on the original Bat out of Hell , and Meat Loaf 's voice remains robust , though thanks to the inept songwriting , Meat Loaf once again finds himself using that grand voice to express worse than nothing . And with all these overlong tracks , the only unqualified pleasure I found was in & quot ; Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through & quot ; , thanks to a great-sounding backing-vocal section , a less awful Steinman lyric than usual , and good arrangements . & quot ; I 'd Do Anything for Love & quot ; , the brain-dead lyrics aside , offers some moments of catchiness ( hindered by the hookless lyric ) until Ellen Foley comes in with that second vocal to ruin the sense of romantic wonder that Meat Loaf managed to conjure out of the rest of the song . And , astonishingly , Steinman 's lyric deteriorates even more at this point into supra-awkward phrasings , lyrics that must be Steinman 's idea of poetry , completely amateurish and ugly to the ear . So when this song is over , all that 's left of it is the Michael Bay-directed music video , a nicely photographed extravaganza drawing from Beauty and the Beast and Phantom of the Opera.Steinman should just stop writing . It 's time his carcass of a songwriting instinct was severed from Meat Loaf . You can have a good strong vocalist like Marvin Lee Aday and a crack band with E Street Band 's Roy Bittan in it , but if the material stinks -- and here it does -- it 's to no avail .	-1
Unfortunately with the DVD , the new interviews were done in widescreen , however , the old video footage was not - but they spliced it in as widescreen . So what you get is Jimi 's face stretched out wider than it is high . It is too , too bad . I bought this CD for the DVD and was hoping to see some vintage Jimi . Instead his footage is all distorted . Whom ever did the DVD needs to go back to school and learn how to do this correctly . Janie should have this fixed and offer a free disc exchange . Maybe this is why this set is only ten bucks .	-1
Loudness War wins ! I was wondering from the discussion of the 1997 vs 2010 discussion and took a look . The 2010 version is definitely clipped . Sadly I thought it actually improved the sound ( imaging ) while equally destroying it - yes I notice the clipping - idiots . FWIW .	-1
Janie Hendrix , Jimi 's adopted sister and sole heir to his music copyrights , dropped the MCA record label and signed a new contract for reissuing Jimi 's catalog on Sony in 2010 . It seems kinda ridiculous that every 2 or 3 years , whenever she wins a copyright lawsuit or decides to switch record labels , she `` remasters '' the entire catalog . How many victory reissues do we need ? Anyway , she decided to reissue these albums on CD in 2010 , which not only generates buzz for guaranteed sales but , also makes her a lot more profit off Hendrix 's name . She cares more about benefits from sales of the physical product more then about protecting the legacy of a great musician . Here 's the truth ... These are the 1997 remasters in new `` earth-friendly '' cardboard packaging with a worthless DVD . It 's a 17 minute DVD with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer talking about Jimi and playing a snippet of a few songs . We 've already heard the songs and know he 's good . Nothing interesting or new . The albums should have gotten a fresh remaster for 2010 and the second disc could have been better utilized as bonus tracks , such as outtakes or live stuff . Even the booklets and disc labels themselves look exactly the same . If you bought the last remasters you do n't need any of the main 3 studio albums , Band Of Gypsys , or First Rays . 5 stars for the album itself but , zero stars for the disc . This 2010 reissue is not a remaster and is definitely screwing the public .	-1
Words can not describe my intense dislike for Jimi 's guitar `` skills '' . This guy is a HACK . All songs sound exactly the same , the drummer is weak , does the bassist even exist ? Listen to some REAL music that actually requires talent- like Nickelback !	-1
Everybody goes & quot ; Ooh , Jimi Hendrix & quot ; just because he died . I do n't think his music is particularly good . In fact , some of it stinks ! ! ! And , I 'm sick and tired of people calling hard rock or metal . HE IS NOT ! ! ! Why ca n't people get used to that fact . He 's just really soul with some rock influnces . Nothing wrong with that , of course , but I 'm tired of seeing heavy metal lists with him in them . Some of the songs on this album are okay , like 'Purple Haze ' and 'Fire ' , but a lot of them are not really rock at all . Psychedelic trash , some of it is .	-1
This was Hendrix 's best album , and it has a couple good moments on it , but it 's really not worth the effort . He was a technical genius , without a doubt , but he was neither a song writer , nor a band leader . Maybe if he had gotten off the drugs , he could have lead a great jazz band , like Miles Davis did . We 'll never know .	-1
Jodeci was one of the most popular R & B ; groups of the '90s . They drove women wild with their leather outfits , backwards caps , and crooning voices . `` Diary of A Mad Band '' was released when they were still very popular . Although I am a Jodeci fan , this is not a good albun . I have heard better coming from them . The album is dry and bland . I did n't feel any real excitement while listening to this LP . The greatest thing about this album is their voices . These men can harmonize very well , and not many sound as good as they do together . I was very impressed with their vocals . This album is also sexually distasteful . There are many sexual overtones , and they are just too raunchy for me . Artists can speak of sex and still have tact . These guys just get nasty and provocative . `` Ride and Slide '' is not a good track . Its very sexually explicit , the lyrics are bad , and the production is bland . I found nothing appealing about this song . It was obviously a filler . `` Sweaty '' is also too sexually distasteful . In this song , they speak about intesnse sex . The production is lackluster just like the song . `` Feenin '' is not a bad song , but its definitely not this groups best work . This song talks about feenin ' to sleep with a woman . Now who would have guessed that ? The harmonies on this song are worth mentioning because they did very , very well . Overall , a pretty bland and not memorable song . `` Cry For You '' and `` Jodecial Hotline '' ( which is actually an interlude ) are the best songs on this piece of work . These songs are lyrically strong , contain decent production and good lyrics . They are both simply marvelous ! A very young Missy Elliot is heard on `` Wo n't Waste You '' . She delivers a supbar rap to go with the whack song . This song is about two people not wasting each other 's time.I did not enjoy this album overall . The production and instruments are used repeatedly and the lyrics show that this group obviously had a one track mind while they were in the studio creating this . Next please.Mikeisha 's Top 51 . Jodecial Hotline2 . Feenin'3 . Cry for You4 . My Heart Belongs to You5 . What About Us	-1
At first glance , this SEEMS like it will be phenomenal . Elton established himself as a star in the 70s and has continued to have hits to varying degrees ever since . The album pairs him with Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Little Richard , country great Tammy Wynette , Grammy winner Bonnie Raitt , and soul great Gladys Knight among others . This should be great , right ? Well , it SHOULD ... but it is n't . It 's not even average . A surfeit of covers guarantees that the remakes will be given a side by side comparison with the originals and in most cases they pale.Paul Young and Elton plod through 60s classic `` I 'm Your Puppet '' ... '' Love Letters '' fares no better despite some nice slide guitar from Bonnie Raitt . The oddest pairing on the disc , `` Born to Lose '' ( Leonard Cohen and Elton ) suffers the most . Leonard sets an appropriately somber mood with his first verse , but then Disneyesque strings send it hurtling towards pap . Elton 's overly sunny vocal places it firmly there . RuPaul adds some techno glaze to John 's `` Do n't Go Breaking My Heart '' ... and makes an already lightweight song LESS substantial.What about the rest ? `` The Power '' is Little Richard and Elton doing faux gospel , Nik Kershaw strings some cliches about friendship together , Tammy Wynette wastes a decent performance on a boring tune ( `` A Woman 's Needs '' ) .BOTTOM LINE : If you are a COMPLETIST , buy this USED ( it 's only 99 cents ) to get the `` lost disco '' of `` Teardrops '' ( with K.D . Lang ) , Chris Rea and Elton 's `` If You Were Me '' semi-crooner and George Michael 's guest shot on `` Do n't let the Sun Go Down on Me '' ( the best pairing here if not far afield from John 's original ) . But the average Elton fan ( and most pop buyers ) will be happy to get `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on Me '' elsewhere .	-1
When you start with cheesy , synthesized , over-blown , boring , soulless music arrangements it does n't much matter who 's singing ... and no one singing on any of these songs does Elton John any favors ... and Elton does himself a huge disservice singing such garbage . Not one decent song exists on this CD . One might ask , for example , & # 34 ; Why not include the original terrific duet 'Do n't Go Breaking My Heart ' with Kiki Dee ? & # 34 ; ... because that would have made every other song sound *obviously* like complete and total junk.Elton John has made so many worthy albums in his career ; do yourself a favor and avoid this one , please .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... sadly , the best song on the CD is the one NON-duet song , `` Duets For One . '' This just does n't work .	-1
Only a die-hard , hardcore Mary J. Blige fan will appreciate this CD . Most of the remixes do no justice to the original mixes . The remixes of & quot ; What 's the 411 & quot ; , & quot ; Sweet Thing & quot ; , and & quot ; I Do n't Want To Do Anything & quot ; did n't excite me . However , it is worth the buy for the remixes of & quot ; Real Love & quot ; and & quot ; Love No Limit & quot ; . Peace El-715	-1
Only Because SHe has so Much Depth & amp ; feeling in Her voice do I Give it a Two.but the Mixes do n't add nothing to the already Established Foundation on The Original Album.I Never Have Liked Re-Mixed albums Because they Usually Mess up what has been Established.this is only for DIe-Hards .	-1
& quot ; What 's The 411 ? & quot ; ( featuring Biggie ) , & quot ; My Love & quot ; and & quot ; Love No Limit & quot ; are all off the hook remixes . The rest are pretty boring . Yawn . Puffy did a terrible job on & quot ; Changes I 've Been Going Through. & quot ; Turned a really nice song into generic background music . & quot ; Real Love & quot ; and & quot ; Reminisce & quot ; I listen to once in awhile . There is no remix for & quot ; Slow Down , & quot ; a song from What 's The 411 ? that I liked pretty well . Instead it was replaced with some other song I never heard of before . Die hard fans only .	-1
What happened , Mary ? The remix album to & quot ; What 's the 411 ? & quot ; is kind of sloppy . The Uptown flavor skits at the beginning of tracks 3,4,9 , and 12 are okay . & quot ; I Do n't Want To Do Anything & quot ; , which was her duet with K-Ci is just as good as the original version .	-1
Sorry I ca n't rate this one higher but its not for the music which rocks but for the remastering . I heard the original on tape and then bought the remastered cd . This was conceived as an official bootleg and was the first of its kind . It was a clever idea as the bootleg industry was gaining steam at the time and the band wanted some of the cut . Fair enough . The original record and cassette said something along the line of `` clicks and pops intact '' . In other word it was rough and raw similar to a bootleg but without the guilt . Perfect for a band who have called themselves the `` godfathers of punk '' . However , this reissue despite having many more songs ( the complete concert , plus their full set of Tommy if you buy the deluxe version ) has been remastered and overdubbed so it hardly sounds live at all . I do n't want to know how the Who wished they had sounded live , I want to hear how they actually did sound live ( which judging by the concerts I 've heard from the 60 's is pretty damn good ) . Bring the clicks and pops back please .	-1
I was at the CD store at the mall and the cashier asked if they could help me find anything . I said that I wanted to get a live album so he said `` You got to hear Live At Leeds by The Who ! ! It 's the greatest live album ever ! '' . If you 've read my previous reviews I have expressed by dislike for The Who and how I think they 're generic classic rock for aging hippies , but I decided to give them a second chance . Bad idea ! The singer 's voice was cracking throughout the album , the drumming is sloppy and all over the place , there is WAY too much talking between songs , the guitar is below mediocre and the bass sounds ridiculously bad . All of the songs are boring , unoriginal and all sound the same . I 'm returning to the mall tomorrow to trade it in and use my money on another Nickelback poster.For some REAL great live albums you should listen to these instead : Live at Sturgis 2006- NickelbackLive Trucker- Kid RockWhere The Light Is- John MayerThe Final Riot ! - ParamoreTonight Not Again/Live at Eagles Ballroom- Jason Mraz	-1
The Who were a great band . To be precise , they were definitely one of the top three or four British beat groups of the Sixties . Pete Townshend wrote great pop songs ( as long as he was depressed by the size of his nose ) and they delivered them with fire and flair . But then , by means of a combination of drugs , alcohol and transcendental meditation , Pete became reconciled to his nose and the band fatally lost momentum . It did n't help that he was n't a very good guitarist . A superb riff-maker , which is a major gift in itself , but not someone you can trust to carry you through an extended live jam with a ceaseless flow of musical invention . ( The phrase 'ham-fisted ' comes to mind . ) Meanwhile , the rest of the band ( 'this ****ing sausage machine ' as Pete once called them an in interview ) were all full-on monsters of mayhem , but were equally little-known for their subtlety and sparkling imagination . When in doubt , they riff like mad and hope that nobody will notice that it 's still the same song.The unfortunate result of this combination of factors is that 'Live at Leeds ' has a reputation far in excess of its listenability . I 've gone through two copies now ; the second one I got recently , just to see if it was still as boring in its extended edition as it was when it was just an audio cassette . The answer is yes . This is an album that I just can not listen to all the way through , and I have an appetite for noise and sonic devastation , from Hendrix and Sonny Sharrock to Black Flag and Sonic Youth . The problem is that The Who live were just ... boring.The shorter songs are fine , but somewhere in the middle of the 15-minute ( ! ) version of 'My Generation ' , the eyelids start to droop . Townshend 's gifts as as a composer are at their strongest when writing hits , which is why the best Who albums are compilations . Live , he and his mates could think of no better way to hold the audience 's attention than to turn up louder than anyone else , which was far from the most inspired way to do it.I foresee that my CD of 'Live at Leeds ' will , like its tape cousin , sit on the shelf unplayed until I either sell it or give it away . The meat- & -potatoes tedium of their live assault has once again not done it for me .	-1
Umm , so yea , this album has a bit of sexual connotations expressed . From `` Fun 2 Nite '' to `` Pump It Back , '' these are for those right-moment perverted acting people who 'd like to get it on with their , hopefully , sexual partner ( not lover for life ) . So right there , y'all know I 'm against that whole marriage idea of `` Love U 4 Life . '' Not that it 's a bad idea at all . Actually , it 's good ; good if you could make that commitment , but I 'm exploratory . The problems within this album is the excessive interruptions . Another not so big dilemma is the fact that they apparently derive their flow or style from some other R & B hit or singer prior to them . What I also thought was excessive was the extent they took their lyrics to that pervade throughout most songs on here . Definitely did n't go out with a blast . & `` Time & Place '' does n't last half as long as it says ( 6 minutes ) . There are a couple things to look forward to with this album : most melodies and rhythms and a maturity from their prior works with regards to a delving into profane content . Ha .	-1
This is just another flash in the pan meat loaf album . To this dat all you need from Meat Loaf is BOH .	-1
As we all learned with Midnight at the Lost and Found , Loaf - Steinman = middling-to-bad album . Now add a +Diane Warren , and you 've got a date with disaster . Warren is not so much a songwriter as a cliche-database -- type in your subject and she spews a lukewarm , familiar-sounding song about it . Steinman takes chances with his wordplay and imagery , Warren never would . So her three tracks sound like an imitation of a parody of Steinman 's work.Steinman 's two tracks are good but not his best . Rounding out the album are what sounds like a Van Halen B-side , an over-histrionic cover of Tom Waits ' sedate & quot ; Martha , & quot ; and a couple more Steinman knock-offs interspersed with less-than-a-minute filler.All of which leads me to one conclusion : If it features Meat Loaf and the title does not include the words & quot ; Bat & quot ; or & quot ; Rocky Horror , & quot ; leave it on the rack .	-1
Get Van Halen 3 instead . If you 're a headbanger , that is .	-1
What kind of garbage is this ? The beats sound like they are copied off of other ska bands like No Doubt , Sugar Ray and others . Eventhough Sublime came before Limp Bizkit and Sugar Ray , I would rather buy Sugar Ray than this Jamaican beats ripoff . The lead singer died of cocaine overdose in 1996 and that shows that Jamaican/ska bands like Sublime can be gone in a blink of an eye . Sublime tries to rap in Bob Marley style beats , but it fails miserably . The lead singer sounds like he sung in a styrofoam cup . Everbody thinks this band is a classic while it lasted , but this CD is just a headache for the ears . They think they 're so cool , they rap about the LA riots in 1992 . Big deal . I know Sublime had released four CD 's before this last CD , but all of their albums are just cardboard . This bands ' last CD is not a classic at all .	-1
i first heard this album when i was 13 years old . at the time i absolutely loved it ! it was one of the most original things i had ever heard . then i heard fishbone , RHCP , living colour , bad brains , and all that and i totally ignored sublime after that.the only good songs on this are covers , and not even good ones at that . this album is a complete waste of time . what 's worse is that it 's their best album.basically ... this band sucks . hard . do n't buy into it , there is far better music out there . funny thing is that i 'm sure the band would actually agree with me . just do n't waste your time with this crap .	-1
I got this album as a gift . Thank goodness cause all the tracks on the album is BAD . Very bad . It 's unlistenable .	-1
funny considering their impact on the business as solo artists they never quite give you a full album.and that 's because they were there influences out more than they give of themselves.for instance who can keep up vocally with Johnny Gill ? Ralph can sing but has been sounding like a 2nd tier Michael Jackson forever.same can be said of Ricky Bell.Bobby used to have something but it 's now Lost.Hit me Off was catchy.Jam & amp ; lewis do ok on the album but this disc is no N.E.Heartbreak.they do more Fresher Material as solo artists than as a group.this album suffers from Formula .	-1
Maybe its because I was born in the early 1980 's and grew up with New Edition ( and other 80 's classic soul ) , but I think the reunion album could have been a bit better . 1996 was a dramatic change for not only Hip/Hop music ( back to the pop party rap and fall of G Funk and Gangsta Rap ) but also in R & B . Like the Temptations came up with a reunion album with the brief return of David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks ( adding Rick James as their new producer ) in 1982 , NE came up with a reunion cd with the return of Bobby Brown and the productions of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ( adding Diddy as their new producer ) . Like the Tempts in 82 ' , NE sort of failed and it was not because of Bobby being Bobby . All members had been out of the limelight since 1992 and they were in competition of new R & B male acts such as Ginuwine , Blackstreet , Dru Hill , D'Angelo , and 112 . Let 's get to the point of the cd , Hit Me Off , I 'm Still In Love With You , and Shop Around are the only tracks that I liked from this cd . Latter for the rest . This may not be no Candy Girl , Self Titled , or Heartbreak , but it only beats 1 Love ( latest cd ) . This cd should be avoided unless you are a true NE fan and want it to be added just to decorate your cd rack .	-1
Even though I truly bought this for one song , I thought it would be at least 3 or 4 in total that I liked but I was wrong . NE could have done better .	-1
They had two good songs and they are both on this album . However , the rest of the album is just there and it does n't stand out and say listen to me because I 'm good . This is worth buying if you are a huge fan of the group , but if not , just wait to find it used somewhere .	-1
i will give them & quot ; She Drives Me Crazy & quot ; , & amp ; & quot ; Good Thing & quot ; , but after that it 's a Poor Mans Simply Red on a so/so day.catchy production & amp ; playing but nothing that sticks to you.very forgettable after a couple of listens.you just know that someone will sample them & amp ; make them look better than they were.i hope not.two cool tracks is enough .	-1
Janie Hendrix , Jimi 's adopted sister and sole heir to his music copyrights , dropped the MCA record label and signed a new contract for reissuing Jimi 's catalog on Sony in 2010 . It seems kinda ridiculous that every 2 or 3 years , whenever she wins a copyright lawsuit or decides to switch record labels , she `` remasters '' the entire catalog . How many victory reissues do we need ? Anyway , she decided to reissue these albums on CD in 2010 , which not only generates buzz for guaranteed sales but , also makes her a lot more profit off Hendrix 's name . She cares more about benefits from sales of the physical product more then about protecting the legacy of a great musician . Here 's the truth ... These are the 1997 remasters in new `` earth-friendly '' cardboard packaging with a worthless DVD . It 's a 17 minute DVD with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer talking about Jimi and playing a snippet of a few songs . We 've already heard the songs and know he 's good . Nothing interesting or new . The albums should have gotten a fresh remaster for 2010 and the second disc could have been better utilized as bonus tracks , such as outtakes or live stuff . Even the booklets and disc labels themselves look exactly the same . If you bought the last remasters you do n't need any of the main 3 studio albums , Band Of Gypsys , or First Rays . 5 stars for the album itself but , zero stars for the disc . This 2010 reissue is not a remaster and is definitely screwing the public .	-1
though her voice is still intact the music is gets real boring and very safe.she has n't been the same artist since this disc.it 's been very down hill.this disc is to soft and to much like a poor Mariah Carrey knock off.her first two are still her best two.a few songs since then but overall she has lost her edge .	-1
but if you are considering this cd ... skip it . The radio played the mess out of what could have been one of the few interesting songs on the cd ( I Can Love You ) . This cd is sooo commercial . It feels like air . None of the bangin ' beats characteristic of the Queen of Hip Hop Soul are present . Searching has a cute break beat thing happening . Other than that I really felt like getting my money back . I recommend What 's the 411 , My Life or Mary .	-1
Loose Ends is one of those groups that has one GREAT song on every CD , hidden amoungst a bunch of mediocrity . & quot ; Hangin ' On a String & quot ; is very strong , but the rest of the CD is on cruise-control .	-1
Made in EU in 1996 , Serial # EXP-029 , Playing Time 48:24Yes , it comes as a picture disc ... but what we have here is some cover band performing tracks originally played by Steppenwolf ; since there are absolutely no credits on the CD , perhaps it features a former band member ? No matter , this is NOT Steppenwolf ... does n't even sound like Steppenwolf ! There have been `` versions '' of this material ( even one with the official Steppenwolf logo ! ) under various titles ( even one called `` Born To Be Wild '' ) . [ ... ] Track listing is as follows:1 ) Born To Be Wild ( `` Steppenwolf '' ) 2 ) Magic Carpet Ride ( `` Steppenwolf The Second '' ) 3 ) Monster ( `` Monster '' , performed as mixed for single version ) 4 ) America ( nothing to do with the track of the same name on `` Monster '' ) 5 ) Power Play ( `` Monster '' ) 6 ) What Would You Do ( `` Monster '' ) 7 ) The Paymaster ( origin unknown ) 8 ) Back Home ( origin unknown ) 9 ) Draft Register ( sic , `` Draft Resister '' from `` Monster '' ) 10 ) From Here To Eventually ( actually `` Rockbuster '' , origin unknown ) 11 ) Three Stripes ( origin unknown ) 12 ) Suicide ( nothing to do with the track of the same name on `` Monster '' ) I 've included above the albums that contained the ORIGINAL versions , just to make sure nobody confuses this release with their 1st album . The versions here are n't bad , but it 's NOT Steppenwolf.Caveat emptor !	-1
A great album , a classic , great songsunfortunately the label is still selling us a twenty year old copy of a mixdown tape , instead of going back and digitally remixing the master tapes and removing the noise.five stars for the music , minus 3 stars for the poor sound quality . My forty year old scratchy LP sounds better than is CD , sorry to say .	-1
After his 1979 disco Lp , '' Victim of Love '' , I expected something more Eltonish from my beloved EJ.Interestingly , we got a mixed bag boasting gems like love song LITTLE JEANNIE and the confessionals WHITE POWDER and CHASING THE CROWN while also featuring mediocre tunes such as DEAR GOD & NEVER GON NA FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.Elton 's voice is at its best , yet there is a sense of tiredness in the performing and in the arrangements.Not a bad album , yet far from a classic .	-1
I 'm not rating this as I feel that there 's been a mistake . This is not the album `` 21 at 33 '' . I know this because `` Little Jeannie '' does n't sound like the `` Little Jeannie '' I 've heard over the last 25 years . This sounds like pan flute music . I wanted to bring this to someone 's attention .	-1
I just borrowed this album from a colleague and I seriously have a hard time figuring out what makes this album deserve five stars across the board , even after reading some of the other reviews . Granted that most likely it 's only been reviewed by his fans and his opposers do n't waste the time to drop a line criticizing his work in Amazon , I felt I had to step in , representing the latter group . As a whole , the album lacked substance in more than one way : lyrically it was weak , almost meant to not think about it ( even if you try ) , which I guess is fine , if all you want is not to think ... as in a beach setting . However musically , most songs sounded like a refry of Cat Stevens with harmonica . In my mind , if you want beach music that is really good , you tune to The Beach Boys , so no : I did not like the album , and I would n't recommend it .	-1
I was a big Olivia Newton-John fan when this album came out when she was doing country music . A lot of these reviews are 5 stars . I dont get it . The title song Come On Over is good . And I really like the way she does Greenleeves . But to me the rest of the album does n't work . A cover of Dolly Parton 's Jolene . And to me nobody can do Dolly Parton ( not even Whitney Houston ) . She does Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain . And I know Willie Nelson was n't the first one to sing that either . But she recorded this about the same time Willie had his version out . And no matter who else does Willie a Willie Nelson is song is a Willie Nelson song . And to be honest I dont really like any of the rest of the songs either . The cd is listenable to . I dig it out and play it every once in a while . It 's just not up to her other stuff .	-1
This is one of Olivia 's worst albums , it feels like a filler of well known cover versions - almost like she had to produce an album . Theperformances are good , but often do not compare well with the originals which probably means a bad choice of material . & quot ; Jolene & quot ; is a good recording but hell of a song to compete on , as are & quot ; Come on Over & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't throw it all away & quot ; , but things like & quot ; Greensleeves & quot ; should be left for Medievil banquets ! I bought the album in 1975 , but it has been played less than & quot ; Back with a Heart & quot ;	-1
Riddles In The Sand is not one of Jimmy Buffett 's best efforts . & quot ; Ragtop Day & quot ; is great song and conveys the sense of fun that Mr. Buffett is best known for , but the rest of the album seems forced . Even song titles like & quot ; Knees On My Heart & quot ; & quot ; She 's Going Out Of My Mind & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; When The Wild Life Betrayed Me & quot ; sound like he trying to hard to be witty . & quot ; Come To The Moon & quot ; is n't half bad , but & quot ; Who 's The Blonde Stranger & quot ; , & quot ; Love In Decline & quot ; , & quot ; Burn That Bridge & quot ; & amp ; the rest are not up to Mr. Buffett 's high standards .	-1
This album has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . It must have been some sort of contractual obligation thing . This must be what JB sounds like after a weekend without either rum or tequila . Return to sender ... postage due .	-1
I 've been listening to Jimmy Buffett 's music almost from the beginning , it was clear that this was a guy who could write a great song and did n't appear to take himself real seriously . You could identify with a lot of the stuff that he sung about and hell , it was fun to listen to.Through the 70s , Buffett kept putting out great work and his popularity grew . And being the bright guy he is , he realized that with the right marketing scheme -- `` Margaritaville , '' etc. , he could turn his adventures and passions into some serious money -- and he did just that . He started making music for money , ya know what I 'm sayin ? Which leaves us with his work in the 80s and beyond , which with a few exceptions , does n't come close to his classic albums -- `` White Sport Coat , '' `` Livin & Dyin ' , '' `` A-1-A , '' `` Changes in Latitudes , '' `` Son of a Son of a Sailor , '' and `` Havana Daydreamin . '' All of these were just great ; Jimmy Buffett at his creative best . `` Son of a Son , '' marked the beginning of the `` Parrothead , '' commercial era which continues to this day . `` Somewhere Over China , '' seems to me like an album that was made just to keep his catalog moving . Something to talk about between tunes at a show . Look , it is n't junk ; the music is pretty well crafted , the lyrics clever , the musicianship just fine , but for whatever reason , this album just sits there doing nothing and going nowhere.You know the Sopranos ? Remember the episode `` A Hit is a Hit , '' where Christopher is trying to help out Adriana 's friend 's band and the band basically does n't have it ? And he takes the tape to Family associate Hesh to listen to -- Hesh being an old record producer -- and Hesh tells him that the music is n't going to make it ? Well , there you have `` Somewhere Over China . '' Hesh knew a `` hit '' when he heard one and vice versa . The vice versa applies to this recording.Hey , you might like it . I kind of do sort of , but hell , in the 23+ years that I 've owned the vinyl copy of this album , outside of the first week that I had it , I have n't played it hardly at all . I listened to it again for this review , just to make sure my original assessment was correct and my opinion has n't changed.2 Stars .	-1
& quot ; The Royal Scam , & quot ; and then some . This is the first negative review I 've written , and I will not brook argument.Somehow Steely Dan has gotten a reputation for being Jazz . I think anyone who has ever listened to 2 minutes of Charlie Parker , Ella Fitzgerald or Oscar Peterson probably either laughs are gets nauseous to think that Jazz artists and poseurs Becker and Fagen have anything in common beyond their brand of cigarettes.If you listen to & quot ; Aja & quot ; or & quot ; The Royal Scam & quot ; or most anything else Steely Dan ever recorded , what you hear is n't Jazz , and it is n't Rock . For that matter , it is n't Pop or R & amp ; B either.It 's DISCO . Rolling Stone magazine loved Steely Dan because the group allowed Stone writers to feel artsy -- 'hey , saxophones and spanish drums ! Far out ! & quot ; -- but I contend that Steely Dan was the best hype-machine running in the 1970 's , and I include Kiss and Casablanca records in my calculations . They convinced everyone that , while you might not like their sound , you had to respect it because it was & quot ; serious & quot ; music . Once again , saxophones and spanish drums smoked the average music reviewer.They covered their tracks by hiring great studio musicians and hanging out with the Doobie Brothers , but Steely Dan and much of the sound coming out of Miami in the mid-70 's was just pre-DISCO , preparing for it 's precipitous fall into the whole & quot ; Do a little dance make a little love & quot ; nightmare that began the end of Rock.If you want to put on some ugly clothes , shake your little behind and tell yourself you 're hip , this is the group and the album for you.If you want something that rocks with soul , move along . Try the real deal -- Santana , for instance .	-1
Much has been made by Poco fans of how the Eagles 'stole Poco 's sound ' and proceeded to dominate the charts while Poco unjustly floundered commercially , but let 's be realistic . The Eagles had released `` Hotel California '' by the time `` Indian Summer '' came out , the latter of which utterly pales in comparison to the former . `` Hotel California '' is n't a perfect album , but it IS pretty damn good anyway , and there 's no denying that the Eagles had things to say . On `` Indian Summer '' , Poco sound desperate , churning out routine songs with painfully unimaginative lyrics . At least 1975 's `` Head Over Heels '' makes for thoroughly respectable background music -- unfortunately , that 's not the case here . Rusty Young goes way overboard with a strained , lame-brained attempt at SOMETHING with the 10-minute , 3-part 'suite ' `` The Dance '' -- I guess it 's supposed to be uplifting , but it 's pretty pathetic and lyrically weak . The first part is `` When The Dance Is Over '' which is at least respectably tuneful , but it really falls apart on the second part , the air-headed `` Go On And Dance '' which reuses the main riff from `` Makin ' Love '' ( from `` Head Over Heels '' ) ; and then there 's the mercilessly repetitive , sax-laden `` Never Gon na Stop '' part which is downright grating and obnoxious . `` Stay ( Night Until Noon ) '' is credited to Timothy B. Schmit and Noreen Schmit , and it 's also very weak with its tossed off melodicism and piss-poor , annoyingly self-righteous 'tough guy ' lyrics . The one other track Schmit co-wrote , the acoustic ballad `` Find Out In Time '' , is much better with nice twelve-string guitar work , but it 's flawed with some weak turns of phrase and sickly-sweet harmonies . Paul Cotton 's got 4 solo compositions here , and they 're mostly weak -- the vamping funk-rocker `` Win Or Lose '' is another one of his tunes with an absolutely toothless verse melody ; the uptempo riff-rocker `` Living In The Band '' has overwrought Cotton vocals and pathetic , senseless 'celebratory ' lyrics ; and `` Twenty Years '' is a tired shuffle . Cotton 's best track is the title track which has a somewhat nice dreamy feel and a chorus that does catch the ear , but it 's not particularly well-written , and like usual , the lyrics leave a lot to be desired . Young 's `` Downfall '' has nice crunchy guitar work , but the song is half-baked with annoying repetition of the title , and the lyrics are so unimaginative and dull , it 's eyeroll-inducing . Schmit 's ballad `` Me And You '' is pretty good with a catchy chorus , though the opening verse is sadly rote . Ultimately , it 's hard to feel sorry for the guys ' lack of commercial success with an album as weak as this . There are solid ideas floating around , but the inability to focus them into quality , fully developed songs is incredibly frustrating and disappointing .	-1
`` Indian Summer '' is certainly a 4 star album . The last album recorded with Tim Schmit before he went off to join the Eagles , the songwriting is top notch here.Unfortunately , the Lemon reissue is clearly pulled from a vinyl source NOT the original mastertapes . Why did n't Lemon use the mastertapes or a safety master from the UK ? Unfortunately only the label knows because the packaging is quite nice including a nice replica of the original insert with the lyrics and album credits.The sound on this remaster is compressed and harsh as well as much too bright sounding . Perhaps this is a means to hide the source material -- I 'm not sure but this is NOT the version to get.Avoid this edition and try and find the MCA original CD release.Original Album : 4 starsOriginal CD master : 4 starsThis remaster : 1 starAvoid .	-1
I wish I could give this one 2 1/2 stars . I do n't have the heart to give it three ( why others are giving this thing 5 stars is beyond me ) . I do n't know why so many people criticize these sessions so much . Yes , it 's a bit disco , but people forget -- or are too embarrassed to admit -- that disco is not a bad word . Sure , disco unfortnately had a lot of bad performers , but it also kept dance music alive during a time when dancing in popular music was near extinction . Also , disco fused together two important subcultures : gay and Black . It 's an obvious choice , actually , that Elton would record this type of record , given his soul leanings ( and he proved on Philadelphia Freedom that he coul write/record a heck of a Philly soul number ) . This EJ disco/soul offering is a lot more fun than the horrid Victim of Love ( horrible , not so much because it was disco , but because it was Euro-disco . i.e . Disco minus the fun , minus the soul ) . I have to admit , however , that some of the songs drag on a bit too long . Disco songs are meant to go long , of course , but some of the cuts on this record just are n't strong enough to last 6+ minutes . Still , this album is one of EJ 's more consistent , enjoyable efforts during a 1978-1981 down-time of dull releases such as A Single Man , 21 at 33 , and The Fox .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... '' Shine on Through '' is the one decent song , but Elton and pop disco do n't work well together .	-1
This is one of those albums that you wish never existed . Much like the Black Plague it 's legendary evil is notorious . Whether it was the videos , the dancing , or that ridiculous haircut , everything Bobby does is cruel.Mass hysteria broke out over this album as boys and girls could n't get enough of it . I smelled a conspircacy . I bought the album and studied it 's various parts and searched for hidden clues . What I found frightened me.In 'My Perogative ' turn the bass way up . The drums are actually beating out a Morse Code ! The message is ... ... ..'I 'm gon na be a crackhead and so are you . I 'll sell you crack and smoke it with you . 'Scary stuff .	-1
This album was produced by Bob Ezrin , who also produced classic Alice Cooper and Pink Floyd 's The Wall . A lot of this album actually ends up sounding like a bad imitation of The Wall . There are direct copies of Dave Gilmore 's licks.Pink Floyd is not the only group copied here . There are bits that sound like Yes . Most of the vocals are that screeching kind that was popular in corporate rock in the late eighties . Similar to groups like Foriegner or Journey.Steve Morse plays guitar on this album . He is been a great addition to the band , especially for their live shows . He does have some nice moments , but spends a lot of time imitating others like Gilmore and Steve Howe . Note that Morse has moved on to Deep Purple.Some people have raved about Rainmaker . But , I found it to be one worst , most pretentious songs Kansas has ever done.In the eighties , many classic groups from the seventies tried to change their sound to match the times and get a hit . Most failed . There are a few good songs on this album , but not enough to recommend it .	-1
The 80 's was a rough decade for BOB EZRIN ; KISS/MUSIC FROM THEELDER was a commercial flop , tho it was a great album ; ALICE COOP-ER/DADA was a low selling and very strange album , tho ' it didcontain ALICE COOPER 's funniest song ever in I LOVE AMERICA , andthen we had PINK FLOYD 's A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON , which soldVERY WELL , but was a horrible album . Then we had this album , INTHE SPIRIT OF THINGS . BOB EZRIN was clueless with KANSAS . Whydid they employ so many outside writers and extra studio musi-cians ? Is that supposed to be FREDDY KRUEGER on the back cover ? What happened to PHIL EHART 's hair ? Did he buy a wig or a toupee ? Or did he actually grow all of it back ? He was starting to gobald on POWER ! As a concept album , this record does n't work , BUTthere are still some nice moments on this album , like the openingsong GHOSTS , which is very mellow and has some nice singing fromSTEVE WALSH . ONE MAN , ONE HEART has some good vocals on it , too.I saw KANSAS in concert back in 1994 and one of the highlightsof the show was THE BELLS OF ST. JAMES , which STEVE WALSH reallysang the heck out of , almost destroying his vocal chords in theprocess ! POWER had alot of great lead guitar playing on it bySTEVE MORSE ; this album does n't have as much and the songs areweaker and less KANSAS like . I wish my vinyl version had thesong times on it !	-1
ASTRA is nothing more than ASIA going totally mainstream , losing all the force of their magical debut , ASIA.Of course , all the musicians involved here are highly talented and we have some few decent tunes . But the overall sound is clearly commercial , too polished , too mellow ( the worst examples being & quot ; Too Late & quot ; and & quot ; SUspicion & quot ; ) . It seems they were written by a pop metal band.Also , with the exit of Steve Howe , keyboards here are more predominant than ever , suffocating the guitar.It 's not a great album , no way . But the tunes are so commercial that you can listen to it wihtou being & quot ; hurt & quot ; by it..	-1
AFter the & quot ; pop-opera & quot ; ALPHA , Steve Howe ( who contributed not a single song for it ) went away . In came Mandy Meyer ( who ? ? ) , a respectable guitarrist with a lot of edge to his playing , but caught in the middle of Asia 's worst album till date , when Weton and Downes struggled hard to write pop songs who could mantain their sales above the platinum status ! ! So , all spontainety was gone , and the result was an album with a handful of great songs ( GO , VOICE OF AMERICA and the best , ROCK AND ROLL DREAM ) , but all of them going towards unashamed pop-glam-hair-American-AOR music ( Ufa ! ! ) . The logical conclusion was that the band closed operations after this thud .	-1
I was 9 years old when I first heard & quot ; Incense and Peppermints & quot ; , and I was absolutely mindblown with the title of the group Strawberry Alarm Clock . Well I have since learned not to be swayed by names . I purchased the single of & quot ; Incense and Peppermints & quot ; when I was 15 , and was very disappointed as it made me have thoughts of suicide . I mean all the way to the key the song is put in it just made me not want to live anymore . I know that this group would have future Skynyrd member Ed King , but that 's not enough to make me like this album , and the rest is alot of off the wall acid tunes trying to pass off as a combination of The Association , and Spanky and Our Gang . I guess it wanted to be the next hot trend in a fad that was doomed to failure from the start . The song & quot ; Incense and Peppermints & quot ; went # 1 after the hippie culture was starting to die as they did a mock funeral of the movement in Golden Gate Park 6 weeks before & quot ; Incense and Peppermints & quot ; went # 1 . They followed up with & quot ; Tomorrow & quot ; which just got in under the wire of the top 40 , and it was a song in the movie & quot ; Valley Of The Dolls & quot ; , and then the group all went thier separate ways .	-1
I 've seen some pretty cheap CD 's but this one tops them all . If you seen the movie Austin Powers you 've heard Strawberry Alarm Clock and there song , `` Incense And Peppermints '' , at the beginning , so lots of people have heard them without really caring . This CD proves there music is near dead though the song , `` Incense And Peppermint '' , is a good song , really just download the song off iTunes , instead of buying a CD of them for just one song.Strawberry Alarm Clock were just another 60s pop band that used the whole psychedelic thing as the basis of there songs which is'nt a bad thing , but when all your songs sound the same it gets a little much . This band is so un cared for they dont even make there original albums , they just have this CD thats all you can get by them new ! How sad is that when your albums arent even printed anymore ? So if you want to hear this band buy these CD 's now because in a few years they wo n't be making them anymore since it really is a waste of paper and plastic , because only about 200 people buy it , there only cool song the title song just download it people seriously.For all the fans of Strawberry Alarm Clock please comment	-1
Man this thing sounds as dated as dated can sound , it even surpasses `` In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida '' . Lets face facts though , the title track is the only reason this thing was even put out on CD and not left to rot in a record comapanys vault somewhere . And what about that title track -- -well it too unfortunately is dated however there is and always has been and undeniable charm with that song . Overall this stuff is better left alone and if your so inclined you can find the title track elsewear without all the hippy dippy trippy mumbo jumbo smiley face crap .	-1
I just got this CD yesterday and am terribly disappointed . Whoever mixed this remaster screwed up in a huge way . Gary Green 's guitar tracks are mostly missing from the album . Sure there 's some there on Give it Back and Empty City , but most of the rest is entirely absent . The guitar solos are mostly there , but they are sometimes painfully loud and harsh.The CD also has a rather bland sound stereophonicly ( or is it even in stereo ? ) . The sound quality could also have benefitted from more treble / high end frequency response , but that 's a complaint I 've had about some of the other releases as well.You 'd think that DRT would have better quality control . At the very least , someone with some knowledge of music should of at least listened to thing before distributing it .	-1
I have never liked this album ! I think side one is GG at theirleast listenable , even tho ' the chorus for , & quot ; I 'M TURNING AROUND & quot ; is very strong and may be the highlight of the album . Low points : & quot ; TWO WEEKS IN SPAIN & quot ; and the embarassing rocker & quot ; I BETCHA THOUGHTWE COULD N'T DO IT & quot ; . Side two is just a tad better than side one , tho ' it 's rendered practically unlistenable by it 's over pro-duction . ME NO LIKE ! ! !	-1
-The band finally caved to their label 's insistence that they do a & quot ; commercial & quot ; album.They did n't know how to make commercial music , and it shows ( they finally figured it out on the next ( and last ) album , CIVILIAN , but by then it was too late ) .There are only one or two good songs here - everything else is as embarrassing to GG fans as TORMATO is to Yes fans ! But , I have to say the guitar riff that opens & quot ; Little Brown Bag & quot ; rocks my face off.Completists only need apply.-	-1
This is unfortunately the worst Gentle Giant ( which is weird to say since all the rest are good ! ) The band hit a very low point with this , their second to last album . The only songs that are worth mentioning are the title track , Words to the Wise , and Friends , which is the only song featuring drummer John Weathers on lead vocals . Most of the rest are very bland . One of the really bad songs is Spooky Boogie ; extremely un-Gentle Giant.I 'd only recommend getting this if you have every other album and only want to complete the collection.JR	-1
for a long time through an unknown land and be at the mercy of the musical taste of the local radio station 's DJ , this album is a good alternative - it will not distract your attention from reading the road signs . Yet you may enjoy some guitar passages and the vocals on Words Of The Wise , bits and pieces of the old glory ( but not the old power ) . Amazing is their ease of imitating different musical styles but overall the music is mediocre though some pieces would make an honor to such groups as Aerosmith or Bon Jovi .	-1
Of Gentle Giant 's original albums , this was the weakest . If you 're building a Gentle Giant collection save this one toward the end . As others have noted , this does not represent Gentle Giant doing what they do best . If I recall correctly , by this time the band was in the orbit of consultant Lee Abrams who was doing his best to help the band find a happy meeting ground where they could sufficiently compromise to meet the needs of commercial radio playlists . While I do enjoy plenty of mainstream rock and even outright glucose confection , I recognize that such an approach did not play to Gentle Giant 's strengths.That said , although I tossed this to the used vinyl bins back in the day , now that individual downloads are available I selected `` Little Brown Bag '' , `` Friends '' , `` Words From The Wise '' and `` Spooky Boogie '' as the redemptive moments from this disappointment . Those newly interested in the band should hastily gravitate toward `` In A Glass House '' , `` Power and the Glory '' , `` Octopus '' , `` Free Hand '' and `` Interview '' as a starting point . I must admit that I 'm glad that Gentle Giant 's salvo at commercial acceptance failed . I 'd hate to see them have endured another twenty years issuing the equivalent of `` Abacab '' .	-1
We crack your head in half ( a big , back woods semi retarded giant head ) it was n't funny but we laughed something something something i forgot cauz im not a painted up fairy who listens to that trash ( that much ) .	-1
Back in 1978 , after buying half a dozen other Gentle Giant albums ( I especially recommend the PRETENSIOUS best-of ) , I thought this was The Worst Album Ever Made . Though this is MILES more commercial than their earlier work , it 's not even close to being the Worst Album Ever . There are at least 3 keepers : The opener `` Words from the Wise '' starts with the Gregorian-chant style old GG fans love & then works out from there . `` Take Me '' is a sweet love song with nice choruses . `` Giant for a Day '' is obnoxiously catchy Jethro-Tull-like fun . The rest are at least inoffensive . Nowhere near as tricky or intricate as the earlier ( recommended ) FREE HAND , OCTOPUS , THREE FRIENDS , POWER AND THE GLORY , ACQUIRING THE TASTE , etc. , but worth a listen for the open-minded ... .	-1
Stiff , uninspired & quot ; jazz rock fusion & quot ; at its worst . This does n't even bear comparison with the band heard on the first three Soft Machine albums , largely because it is n't the same band . The only member left is keyboardist Mike Ratledge , and he lets newcomer Karl Jenkins create most of the alleged & quot ; music & quot ; on here . The playing is efficient , predictable , spiritless and dull , and the compositions are purely mundane exercises in jazz rock . On top of this , the production is dry and ugly , making it perfectly clear that this version of the Softs had nothing to say and were saying it in the most unpleasant manner possible . If any record ever deserved the phrase , & quot ; A Must To Avoid , & quot ; this one certainly does .	-1
This for me was painful to revisit after many years.By this point , it was obvious the once-brilliant Soft Machine had run out of ideas , and worse yet , made a very bad choice in its lineup , namely Karl Jenkins . Do n't misunderstand , Jenkins did not lack talent , but he was NOT a good choice for SM as his interests and sensibilities were far better suited towards minimalism.Despite the presence of ace jazzers like drummer John Marshall and bassist Roy Babbington , it 's just not enough to lift this thing out of the doldrums . The songs tend to be simplistic and repetitive riff-based things or just very non-descript wallpaper instrumentals . The worst thing though is `` Days Eye '' which is a rather blatant and baldfaced rip-off of John McLaughlin 's `` Follow Your Heart '' , FOR SHAME GUYS ! ! ! Although Mike Ratledge is on this , he 's just barely there , and quite often deferring to Karl Jenkins ' far less interesting playing . The total picture just adds up to a lot of efficient and competent , yet horribly uninspired and mediocre playing and writing.For die-hard completeists or insomnia sufferers only .	-1
I do n't quite get how everyone thinks that Gentle Giant is so progressive . I just think that about all their songs sound kind of stupid . Nothing they 've ever done sounds very commercial ( usually you need to be at least sort of commercial to become a big likeable band ) that would get radio airplay . I 've never heard one of their songs played on the radio ( maybe they did have a couple of songs that got radio airplay but I doubt they ever did ) . I 've bought about 7 of their cds at one time and the only one that I could get into was AQUIRING THE TASTE . I just put up FREE HAND and OCTOPUS for sale on Amazon because I just could n't get into them . I do n't see how everyone thinks GG is so complex ( try early Kansas for progressive commercial rock ) . I guess GG just is n't my cup of tea but for others like the previous reviewers they are . I think groups like Kansas , Moody Blues , Alan Parsons Project , ELP , Jethro Tull , Yes , and Rush etc . are far far better than GG . If I were you I 'd skip this and only buy AQUIRING THE TASTE from these guys .	-1
One of Gentle Giant 's best , but do yourself a favor . Get the release which contains both Freehand and Interview instead of the One-Way label version ( Interview is also very worthwhile . )	-1
Surely the Pet Shop Boys were bowing to record company pressure to release this . These mish-mash remix albums WERE popular at the time , to be sure . I even bought a copy ( I must admit I buy everything PSB release ) . But these song snippets rarely last long enough to get into the groove of the remix ( two to four minutes , tops ) before they are pulled out again . And the repetitive beats just bludgeon the listener until the entire cd becomes one long mind numbing mess . Compared to Disco ( which was a radical idea for its time , an entire album of remixes from one act , from one album - Please ) and Disco 3 ( a great album in its own right , as it contains several new songs as well as remixes of recent songs ) Disco 2 can not be considered worthwhile . If I owned a Stairmaster ( which I do not ) I might listen to this . Otherwise it sits , lonely , on my shelf .	-1
This is the only PSB album I do n't like . The source material is great , the remixing is sadly below par . The whole spectacle is only lifted by the inclusion of 'We All Feel Better in the Dark ' at the end . However , the whole thing just becomes too generic with little of the boys humor , wit , intelligence , or just plain sense of good music on show . Maybe the boys themselves saw this as Disco 3 is a giant improvement .	-1
All the other reviewers have said it ... and I say it too ! I am a big PSB fan and I think this is the worst thing they have ever released : a non-stop sequence of lousy remixes-extracts . It all keep repeating itself . I found it so annoying that I could n't even listen to it for more than two minutes ... I just kept passing the tracks untill there were no more tracks left ( laughs ) . Even the fans ( like me ) will be bitterly disappointed . Forget it !	-1
Having finished up the quite possibly the best album of their career , they release a mix compilation of remixes from that album with a couple snapshots from the Behaviour period . The concept is great and should be followed by any other band doing a remix compilation : Create a seamless mix of your dance mixes into one seamless mix to keep the beat going . However , they failed in picking the best mixes from the period . Here , there is one too many repeat mixes of the same song or wretched mixes like the E-Smoove mix of Liberation . Missing are some of the finer mixes from this period such as the Jam And Spoon Mix of Young Offender , or some other mixes from the behavior era , or some of the mixes included here presented in their entirety ( the too cut up approach does n't work ) to make the compilation a little varied ala the original Disco compilation.One thing I do like is the mix of We All Feel Better in The Dark here , as even though this mix of songs is a little lackluster , it makes great for driving to or going to sleep to , so that very sensual ( despite the loss of Chris 's vocal ) mix of We All Feel Better in The Dark is a nice added touch at the end.Perhaps a better Disco 2 could have been achieved had the Boys waited for a couple more albums where they could have made a nice flow of mixes between each era from Behaviour up to Nightlife , which would have made a real good listen .	-1
Easily the very worst of all the Pet Shop Boys material combined ! Even the remixes for the then-new & quot ; Absolutely Fabulous & quot ; singles leave a bitter taste in my mouth . What happened to the good job well done from the first & quot ; Disco & quot ; ? I think that the Boys could have probably chosen to recruit the same mix-masters to produce this mediocre , futile effort . There 's also a mix of one of & quot ; Very & quot ; 's B-sides & quot ; We All Feel Better In The Dark & quot ; , the much better version being found on the double collection & quot ; Alternative & quot ; . This pitiful CD is for Rabid Dance-Remix song fans only , others ( even tried and true PSB fans ) beware at all costs !	-1
First off , I absolutely adore the Pet Shop Boys . While mainstream America abandoned them by the start of the 1990s , my loyalty to the group grew stronger , and I have openly praised all of their studio albums . It is therefore with a heavy heart that I report that this remix album , the `` sequel '' to `` Disco , '' is a disaster ! A continuous mix of various remixes , `` Disco 2 '' is a messy affair from start to finish . It 's not that the remixes themselves are awful , but the the way they are pieced together on this recording is shameful . To begin , the mixes sound like they 're being played at twice the speed : this is particularly noticeable on the remix of `` Liberation , '' David Morales ' treatment of `` So Hard , '' and Rollo 's remix of `` Absolutely Fabulous . '' Plus , they omitted quite a few good ones : what about MK 's remix of `` Can You Forgive Her ? , '' `` Murk 's slammin house treatment of `` Liberation , '' and Morales ' re-working of `` Where The Streets Have No Name '' ? I played this CD recently and after 10 minutes , I had to turn it off because it was getting that bad . Unless you 're a PSB completist like myself who has to get EVERY release of their catalog , this CD should be avoided .	-1
I have this cd and as fan of the Pet Shop Boys I have their other albums . The remixes in this album are boring and repetitive . In one remix , Go West , the chorus is repeated ad nauseam . It gets really irritating after a while . The remixes remind me of those boring and repetitive dance club mixes done by DJ 's who do n't have a clue about what the original music was about . The only people who would enjoy such repetitive mixes are drugged out clubbers who are just there to move with the beats of the music . The only track that was decent was `` We All Feel Better in the Dark '' which was only hampered by a woman 's moaning . And the moaning can be embarrassing if you are playing it on your stereo and others can hear it . But there is a much better remix of this track on the Pet Shop Boys Essential which is by far the better remix . The remixes on Disco 2 are more or less reinterpretations of Pet Shop Boys tracks . Essential is more of an extended version of the tracks . If you are looking for remixes of songs by the Pet Shop Boys that are in keeping with the originals , then you are looking for Essential .	-1
Carefully packaged anger , cliche attitude , the issues stay the same : I 'm angry , I 'm depressed and it pays.Wondering why ?	-1
The # 1 single `` Biotch '' rocketed Meredith Brooks into the American consciousness and left her with the image of angry alterna-chick . Listening to the album it 's clear though that `` angry '' is just not Meredith 's style . She may have adopted much of Alanis Morisette 's musical style of gnashing guitars , but there 's not a whole lot of confessional songwriting going on here ( other than a few notable exceptions ) . Essentially , this is crunchy pop-rock with some angsty window-dressing here and there.HIGHLIGHTS : '' Biotch '' is the absolute highlight of the package as Brooks asks her lover to take her moodiness as part of the package ( `` I 'm your hell , I 'm your dream/I 'm nothing in between/You know you would n't want it any other way '' ) . `` Watched you Fall '' is a peak into Brooks ' soul as she accepts responsibility for a failed relationship . ( `` I was blind to ya/Was lying to you/Said I love you but I 'm laughing/When you crawl '' ) . `` What Would Happen '' finds her lusting after a married man . ( `` What would happen if we kissed/Would your tongue slip past my lips/Would you run away , would you stay/Or would I melt into you ? '' ) `` Birthday '' may be the 2nd best song here as Brooks takes on the persona of the desperate date ... the woman promising too much too soon ( `` Let 's trade numbers/Let 's trade beepers/So I can find you any place '' ) . It 's nicely creepy.LOWS : Unfortunately , one of the album 's worst tracks leads off . `` I Need '' is just a laundry list of things Brooks claims she `` needs '' while also claiming `` see how easy I am to please '' . So what 's she need ? `` a diet that works '' , '' Cool friends '' , and `` a Mercedes 280SL '' among other things . Blech . `` Somedays '' is the oft-told tale of a bad day that 's been done so much better by others . It 's no `` Mama Said '' [ Shirelles ] , `` Bad Day '' [ Fuel ] ... it 's not even a `` Turndown Day '' [ Cyrkle ] . `` Wash my Hands '' finds Brooks shrieking that she 's done dying for the past . The forced emotion of her voice is really grating here.BOTTOM LINE : Take the angst of Alanis , add some hip-hop drum loops , and you have this album from Meredith Brooks . While it 's not a complete travesty , most of this ends up being well-produced craft that 's ultimately empty .	-1
This music has a word on it that takes away a person 's personal power . I dont want to repeat it here , because i dont repeat filth ! ! Seriously ! Why does Amazon sell this ? ? ?	-1
When I first bought this album in 1983 , it had an excellent 5:20 version of & quot ; Hungry Like the Wolf & quot ; , the highlight of the whole album ( next to the title track ) . When the first CD of & quot ; Rio & quot ; came out , & quot ; Hungry Like the Wolf & quot ; was much shorter ( like they wanted to hurry up and get it over with ) . This shorter version killed the appeal of the whole CD for me . I hoped someday they would re-release & quot ; Rio & quot ; as & quot ; the original vinyl version. & quot ; I thought that day came this past July 3rd , 2001 . I was let down again . The same short version of & quot ; Hungry Like the Wolf & quot ; , but now remastered . Sad ! Would anyone like to take this lame CD off my hands AGAIN ? Never mind , I 'll go trade it for something else somewhere . The closest we 're going to get to the original vinyl version of & quot ; Hungry Like the Wolf & quot ; is on the & quot ; Night Versions & quot ; collection . Not exactly the same , but close . Since Capitol created this confusion back then , why did n't they just feature the alternate tracks as & quot ; bonus tracks & quot ; to make everyone happy ?	-1
I JUST CAN NOT COMPREHEND HOW ANYONE CAN GIVE THIS LOUSY ALBUM FIVESTARS.THIS IS OUTDATED CHEESY EIGHTIES DANCE POP MUSIC FROM THESE HAS BEEN MUSICIANS WHOM VERY FEW PEOLPE LISTEN TO THESE DAYS.I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO GIVE THIS LOUSY ALBUM A SKIP.GET THE BEST OF FOGHAT INSTEAD .	-1
Words resurrected from the netherworld and assembled in a manner that could be called abstract , if Slick Rich could sing it like that . Musical arrangements as flat and colourless as a razor blade . Like a razor blade , it seems pleasing and smooth at first . Then one really listens and discovers that , actually , this baby is nasty , sharp , and dangerous . Since it 's one of the best examples of the soulless , superficially-divine pop of the Eighties , the album 's artifactual ; but unless this became a personal favourite as you were growing up in that period , just leave it on the shelf -- or better yet , in the closet .	-1
So , I bought the one disc version and looked at the tracks and thought only 9 ? Bought it anyway , but still had a nagging feeling something was off ... and then when I got to `` No Words '' and then `` Picasso 's Last Words '' came up next it hit me ... NO `` Helen Wheels '' ! I have to buy the 2 or 3 disc version to get that on one of the extra discs . It 's on my old vinyl version . wtf ? Thanks for nothing , Paul , thanks a lot ... OK , and for those getting on my case about not reading the listing online : I saw it in a store ( remember those ? ) , grabbed it , bought it , played it , not even thinking the record company had screwed around with it . Lesson learned : caveat emptor.And give us Yanks the US version , Paul ! A 10 song album is now 9 songs ? Come on , son ...	-1
` Band On the Run ' may be the best single that Wings ever produced , it is everything that Wings was , radio friendly , poppy and meaningless . I 'll admit that I liked Wings when I was twelve . At twelve , the bizarre stream of consciousness lyrics of a song like ` Jet ' seemed to imply poetic depth , of course a year later I realized that it was just doggerel . That is what McCartney offers to the world , vapid pleasant sounding emptiness , junk food for the ear . For all the meaning of lyrics , he might as well scat .	-1
Hairspray , Spandex , makeup and a goofy guitar player . Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me . Take the worst parts of Alice Cooper , The Worst parts of Kiss add some average muscicians and trite song writing and you get Poison . God how I wish the 80 's would just go away ... ... .	-1
This is the best album ever . You can tell it 's some pretty heady , affected , quirky stuff because there 's a copy of The Trial on the cover next to that girl who 's feigning fashionable malaise . The Trial is a book written by a smart Russian guy called Franz Kefka . I love books .	-1
Belle and Sebastian are a sensitive , pale group given to fits of shivering and meloncholy . That they are bright there is no doubt , but they do n't apply themselves to their work . They do n't make eye contact , have trouble socializing and have few friends . Perhaps there is trouble at home ? I 'm afraid the other bands find them to be an easy target for bullying and often steal their lunch money . Just the other day they had to be sent home after the Smiths tied them to a tree and refused to give them back their guitars . We 've noticed some troubling self-esteem issues : the singer is so ashamed of his braces that he refuses to open his mouth wide enough to sing properly . Perhaps someday they 'll adjust and become productive citizens , although school is often indicative of how well a band will do in later life . Oh well ...	-1
I dunno ... it 's not a terrible album by any means , but certainly not worthy of the copious amounts of praise everyone 's heaping on it . Do n't get me wrong ; I like wordy , pseudo-intellectual music as much as the next person , but I find large portions of If You 're Feeling Sinister to be intensely irritating . Most of their lyrics , to be frank , really are n't *all that* clever -- a flaw which could be overlooked if the melodies were better , but they really are n't much either ; many of them have a kind of annoying sing-songy quality to them , and Murdoch 's voice can become very annoying indeed , especially since he sings everything in basically the same tone . Okay , it has a few halfway decent tunes ( Stars of Track and Field , Get Me Away From Here ... ) , but I have to say it : The Boy With the Arab Strap is an infinitely better album ; If ... Sinister ... had been been my first taste of B & amp ; S , I can safely say I would never have given them a second glance . That 's all .	-1
My first encounter with Belle and Sebastian came in '97 , when `` Sinister '' rode a tsunami of ecstatic , sky-high praise . Bold comparisons were made . `` The Go-Betweens ! The Smiths ! Felt ! '' Most people know not to toss those references around lightly . With these bands topping my mental `` greatest bands ever '' list , and being painfully aware how badly the 90s lacked something comparable to that genre , I immediately bought a used promo copy of `` Sinister . '' A huge sticker on the jewel case displayed heaps more gushing praise . My expectations were through the roof.You can see where this is going : I get home , pop this puppy in my CD player , long story short - I 'm a little let down . But , before digging up my receipt , I give it another listen . Okay , `` Seeing Other People '' is actually pretty cool ; great piano , nice chord changes , a bit sophisticated . Ditto `` Dylan in the Movies '' with its glockenspiel . The title track is catchy , but nothing extraordinary . The simple , jazzy opening song is nice , although the over-long intro does n't stir up the drama the band might 've envisioned . But after repeated listens , the other songs failed to leave any real impression.But wait ! Sure , `` Sinister '' has its moments , but geez , the Go-Betweens and the Smiths ? This pales next to them ! Show me a B & S ; melody as melodic or emotionally stirring as `` This Charming Man '' or `` Unkind Unwise . '' Show me where the B & S ; rhythm section comes close to the inventiveness of Vickers/Morrisson or the confident muscle of Rourke/Joyce . This demonstrates the dubiousness of the Smiths/Go-Betweens comparisons . B & S ; are merely above-average twee-pop . The Go-Betweens and Smiths avoided twee with inventive chord changes and arrangements , and eclectic influences that went far beyond the insipid jingle-jangle of most c86 . So , why not instead compare B & S ; to bands like Brilliant Corners , the Pastels , or the Close Lobsters ? Those decent , yet sometimes faceless , pop acts that burst onto the scene , desperately - and badly - aping the Smiths and Orange Juice.Where the Go-Betweens sang with heartfelt , unique voices of ironic tales about things that *adults* generally experience , singer Stuart Murdoch merely throws together trite , precious , self-aware lines about the more unsavory people in his puerile `` scene '' . Even when he 's critical of the scene , he still seems very much *a part* of it , like he 's writing about all the petty dramas his pals got caught up in last week.So , why all these comparisons to bands whom , after close scrutiny , B & S ; has little in common with ? And do I really want someone to sound just like the Go-Betweens and the Smiths anyway ? No , I merely want someone who writes songs that affect me as strongly ; someone who breathes new life into pop music , who is daring , innovative , with their own take on those weak-in-the-knees melodies . `` Sinister '' is their best album , and the one to start with ; I do n't have anything nice to say about the bland cack they 've churned out since . But if you must own one B & S ; album , you know the drill ...	-1
There is one rule of thumb in buying Beasite Boys records , and if your new to the Beastie 's camp , then you need to know this : avoid anything that is predominatly hardcore.Sure , there is some hardcore stuff on both `` Check Your Head '' and `` Ill Communication '' , but there 's also really cool jazz and rap songs on those . `` Some Old Bulls**t '' compiles two early seven inchs from the Beasties sub-par Minor Threat days , as well as the `` Cookie Puss E.P . `` , their first foray into hip-hop , which is little more than the Beastie 's making prank phone calls over a mediocre tape loop.Sure , fans may get a laugh out of this , but not even they should want to keep this record .	-1
THE TITLE SAYS ALL THE THINGS I GOT TA SAY ABOUT THIS COLLECTION . YEP , THE SAME GUYS THAT RECORDED THESE WEIRD SONGS ARE THE SAME GUYS WHO MADE SUCH RAP CLASSICS AS `` LICENSED TO ILL '' , `` PAUL 'S BOUTIQUE '' , `` CHECK YOUR HEAD '' , AND `` ILL COMMUNICATION '' . THIS COLLECTION IS JUST A BUNCH OF RARE AND VERY OLD BEASTIE BOYS SONGS . MUCH OF THESE SONGS ARE NOT EVEN HIP HOP SONGS , BUT ROCK SONGS . MOST OF THESE SONGS DO N'T EVEN LAST A MINUTE , AND ALL OF THESE SONGS REALLY DO N'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHAT SO EVER . IT 'D BE BEST NOT TO CHECK THIS ONE OUT .	-1
Some ha-ha-funny stuff . A lot of juvenile stuff . Nothing of real quality . Pass .	-1
I bought this in 1993 , & I was a bit disappointed that `` Castles In The Air '' is a re-recorded version & not the original version I had back in the 70 's as the original flipside of the United Artists single `` Vincent '' . I used to love `` American Pie '' until radio overplayed it to death , now my favorite McLean song is the last song here , `` Prime Time '' , though I do n't know when it came out .	-1
Too many & # 34 ; simple love songs & # 34 ; . The album got boring after the 3rd song . No songs with good themes . All FLUFF . Too bad a man of this guy 's talent ca n't commit to music with a better purpose . The & # 34 ; simple love songs & # 34 ; get tedious after a while . Donated the CD to the local Library .	-1
The Thompson Twins made mediocre synth pop in a time when that was really cooool . Now they just sound dated . Valuable for nostalgia only .	-1
At this point in their career , it 's very obvious that the Alan Parsons Project was trying to update their sound for the mid 1980s , digital synthesizers ( DX-7 , for example ) and drum machines . Unfortunately they were really beginning to play it safe , in fact too safe . Most of it sounds like anonymous pop . What progressive was left over on their previous release , Ammonia Avenue ( like the title track ) is pretty much gone here . Even the instrumental & quot ; Hawkeye & quot ; is n't much to write home about , in my book . Of course , by this time , the band had no more hits . You do n't find a single song on this album that gets regular radio airplay . It 's plain to see that the album sounds quite stale and they 've ran out of fresh ideas . I Robot , on the other hand , is the sound of the Alan Parsons Project with fresh ideas and much better music . They were n't playing it safe in '77 and I like that very much . So if you 're a diehard fan of the APP , of course , Vulture Culture will be part of your collection , but if you thought they started losing their freshness after their first three to five albums , skip this one .	-1
This is my introduction to APP . I do n't recognise anything vaguely like prog-rock or concept album . Sure , the lyrics are all about the moral degradation of society , but that does not make for a concept album and this is hardly original subject matter . And as a collection of pop songs , neither does it work . It all sounds too much like low-grade Supertramp . Shrill vocals , predictable boring pop beats , nothing at all noteworthy in the musicality of the band ... only diehard fans would make apology for this . As a newcomer I find this such a poor album that I doubt whether I want to hear any more of APP . IF you want 80s pop rather get the real stuff like Thompson Twins or Yazoo . Utter disappointment all round and I would give this 0 stars if the site would allow that , meaning that I rate it so poorly that I think it should never have been recorded .	-1
I love this band but only because of the catchy songs and because of Ann . I think she has a really great voice . She does n't sing on most of these tracks though , and the girl that does has a very mediocre voice . They should have let her sing more . The only songs I really liked were `` Tell Me Why '' and `` Your Baby Never Looked Good in Blue . ''	-1
I have to agree with Chris Heath 's review . Although I like this album for nostalgiac reason , it is not as conistent as the first LP and lacks the electricity of the first LP . On this one Lewis Martinee tries to meld r & amp ; b grooves with the Miami sound . It was a success commerically for him ; but perhaps over time it is a flop . Martinee should have stuck to his successful sound . Later he will try his hand at house and continue to fail even more miserably . Finally he will no longer have involvement with the group . There are some nice sentimental ballads on this CD . It is the last CD where Gioia Bruno ( the brunette ) is involved with the group . This CD 's best moments are & quot ; What You Do n't Know & quot ; ( brassy Miami pop ) , & quot ; When I Looked At Him & quot ; ( sappy ballad that will make you sentimental ) and & quot ; Stop Look Listen Think & quot ; ( brassy Miami pop on CD -- -promo 12 & quot ; mixes were ahead of their time in terms of house ) . I saw this band play at Oh ! Lazer Cl ! ! ub in Tijuana , BC . A very cool thing admist the whole posh 80s thing .	-1
I have to admit that when the title song came out in 1989 , I really loved it . I also loved & quot ; When I looked at him & quot ; . The entire album , however , does not have the same hooks as the first album . The entire first album was able to hook me from the beginning . The two songs that I just mentioned before are the only two songs that I like on & quot ; What You Do n't Know & quot ; . & quot ; It Echoes Every Night & quot ; is also a great song .	-1
When Whitney aproached to make her third album she stood by some old time friends , but she managed to team up with the famous producing team of Babyface and LA Reid , somehow that came as a tragical direction for Whitney ... she sounded like she wanted to fit in a musical style that was n't her ... but great tracks came as a result & quot ; My Name Is Not Susan & quot ; although the title is corny and stupid ... the song chorus and beat managed to stay in a great taste that captures the late 80 's beats , & quot ; I 'm Your Baby Tonight & quot ; first single managed to reached # 1 , gracefully because it was a Whitney Houston but it was really far from Whitney 's classic upbeat songs , & quot ; All The Man That I Need & quot ; is one of the songs that really stand aside from the filler cuts that crowed this LP , and surprise this was n't produced by Babyface ... .so this album should be call the album that & quot ; almost & quot ; killed Houston career , saved later by The Bodyguard smashing soundtrack .	-1
Houston 's third effort in five years saw the up-and-coming producer Babyface take charge . It also saw Houston 's sales statistics fall to career lows by failing to top the diamond sales mark ( 10 millions copies ) in the U.S. And as you think , `` Well , those are pretty lofty expectations ! '' I proceed to show you the sales statistics ( Album # 1=12,000,000/Album # 2=10,000,000 ) And then when you consider that it is n't a stretch ... you then realize that the album only sold a petty four million copies in the U.S. Then you listen to the album , and you know why . I 'm Your Baby Tonite is ultimately over in three tracks . The rest of the album will fin the listener nodding off , or discover that their thoughts have wandered and they did n't hear the last two songs . Not that they were worth hearing . The album yielded two gold singles , one incredible vocal performance ( `` All The Man I Need '' ) and one great title track . ( which were the two gold singles ) Perhaps this is the reason why Houston exiled from solo studio albums and went into the soundtrack game ... it certainly would n't surprise me . This album would certainly give that action justification .	-1
The Theme of this album seems to be about `` Growing Old '' which no doubt Ms. Simon can relate to well.In the track `` Have You Seen Me Lately ? '' she uses the same old line about `` Falling back on dreams '' which is heard on one of her earlier albums . Do n't ask me which one . After awhile they all start to sound the same to me . Perhaps Ms. Simon is running out of original lyrics to write . However as usual , ad infinitum and ad naueaum Ms. Simon sings about How Great She Thinks She Is In Bed with the track `` Better Not Tell Her '' . Then of course there is the ironic song `` Waiting At The Gate '' which is about a celebrity getting out of Rehab . No doubt Ms. Simon can relate to this well too . I give this album 5 stars because the cover shows what great work the hair , makeup and camera guys can do to a woman over 50 .	-1
Were you recently released from a mental clinic where you were involuntarily confined ? Really ? You were ? Well , do you remember those moments as you slowly passed through the fortified turnstile -- so heavy after all those days spent sitting motionless in a padded cell -- the doctor told you to listen to music that scrupulously avoids any hint of reality ? Music that has no sense of irony ... that has absolutely no edge ? Music that is studiously undemanding ? Music to pet cats by ? This album , then , is just what the doctor ordered . Perfectly competent , very well produced , very pretty ... ..drivel . Sarah has fumbled her way to an aggravating crock with plenty of takers . I say do n't get taken.Incidentally , have you noticed that negative reviews of this album and other sacred cows get very low ratings by other Amazon shoppers ? Take a look sometime and see how unappreciated negative reviews are on Amazon . Great evidence that people only look to have their preconceived views confirmed as opposed to learning through challenge .	-1
Man , I 'm all for deep introspection , but this chick takes the cake ! ! Talk about a dull , uninspired recording ! The only song worth anything on this record is the first one , the beautiful `` Possession . '' After that , however , it 's Sleep City - BIGTIME ! ! To be fair , Sarah M. writes ethereal , piano-sprinkled tunes that can strike a nerve every so often . Plus , her lyrics are indeed heartfelt , and for that I commend her . Nonetheless , whatever happened to Lauper 's famous motto : `` Girls just wan na ' have fun ! '' Sarah M. seems to be just the opposite : `` Girls just wan na have depression ! `` Well , at any rate , it 's better than April Lavigne or Nickelback.PEACE 'EM UP ! !	-1
Many moons ago , around the time of her first release Touch , Sarah McLachlan had the makings of a really interesting artist as a singer and songwriter . She was gigging at cool university bars . Campus radio stations would play her and consider her slightly alternative . At first blush , Sarah McLachlan could have taken her career in any direction . She chose the popular chanteuse route and hence the dreck she releases today is the kind of music your dentist prefers in the background as he drills holes in your molars . Artistically , Fumbling Towards Ecstasy was the beginning of the end for Sarah McLauchlan . The songs are mostly weak ; the muddied , unsympathetic production by Pierre Marchand is simply dreadful . Save your hard earned money and buy the Cowboy Junkies great new album Demons or just about anything by Kate Bush or Margot Smith .	-1
how did this group ever blow up in the first place ? point of no return & amp ; let me be the one are just the same song formula.with the weak take that goes for Latin pop today they would be huge .	-1
`` Another Night '' is one of my favorite songs . I like `` Run Away '' as well . Aside from those 2 songs , the rest of this CD is monotonous . All the songs sound alike to me . None of them stand out at all .	-1
2 1/2Competent though disappointing , this highly referenced trance album can not escape it 's plodding , dated backbone of a beat , no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be . Of course , listening to the album 13 years later , one immediately feels the bland , aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality , which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is . The thudding , ever present , 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper , rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal . Thankfully once in a while , particularly at the start and finish of the disc , a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions , allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways .	-1
I have a very different worldview then every artist I have listened to . I can still enjoy their music . This is the first album that does n't allow me to do that . First of all abortion is a womans ' issue . Glad to see Grahams ' point of view ignores the woman right to choose and allows him to choose without even carrying the baby . As for life beginning when an embryo is made . One could argue I am filled with sperm that has the potential to fertilize the egg of the girl that just passed me by . Not having sex with her aborts the potential life form . Since the argument for when life begins can not be settled , it is up to the women to choose . Those who are pro-life seem to be happy to have unwanted children that can not be cared for populate our country . The option of adoption is another argument from pro-lifers . I have seen this and grew up with a number of adopted kids . I know this is a generalization , but from my experience these kids came out extremely screwed up . The more religious the parents were the more screwed up the kids were . There is now a shortage of families wanting kids so it is much more likely for a child not to be adopted . Not only this , but I have n't seen any pro-lifers adopt a child . Put your money where your mouth is Graham . This is n't a political forum , but since this issue is at the heart of this album I felt it necssary to address it . After all this song ruins the album for me . Like the House Of Freaks say , The Righteous Shall Fall .	-1
I only like 3 of the songs which are `` Angel , '' `` Building a Mystery , '' and `` Adia . '' The rest of this album is extremely bland . Both the musical arrangement and vocals are unimpressive .	-1
This CD is at best poor , at least by the high standards that Mrs. Maclachlan has set in the past . There are only two songs on the whole CD that stay true to her roots of creative lyrics and beatiful music , Building a Mystery and Sweet Surrender . The rest of the songs range from poor to average . I will definantly be selling this one to the used CD store as soon as I can .	-1
The oversampling is poor and teh compressin is all Wrong in the left channel so i can only give this a One star . Wait for the SACD to come out to see if they improve the sound . Seriously , how can anyone with ears listen to this mess of a production ?	-1
This set of super-slick , over-produced , sample-laden , desperately contemporary songs simply are not worthy of the Queen of Soul , Aretha Franklin . No doubt she is in fine voice . And true , this cd SOUNDS good . It ought to , considering the producers du jour involved . But listening to this album today , several years after its initial release ( when it was hyped as `` a Comeback '' ) is something of a chore , not the pleasure it ought to be . It has that regretable patchwork sound that comes from working with so many different producers . And I get the feeling that many of these songs are leftovers that some other younger , more `` current '' soul singer , some sexy little Diva-ette , turned down because they did n't have enough hooks . I can understand some artists sampling Aretha Franklin ( which HAS been done , by the way , by the 49'ers , on their club hit `` Touch Me '' , which has vocal samples of Aretha 's `` Rock A Lott '' ) but for Aretha Franklin to sing a song whose main hook is sampled ... it 's just beneath her . This cd is very calculated and formulaic , and ultimately disappointing , because those are things Aretha has never been .	-1
Unfortunately , this CD is among Aretha 's all-time worst albums . Shame on Arista Records ' boss Clive Davis and the producers involved for trying to make Aretha Franklin sound like just another Hip-Hop artist -- instead of giving her better material that would do an artist of Aretha 's status justice ! ! ! Only `` The Woman '' and `` How Many Times '' manage to NOT sound dated . Not surprisingly , this CD is now out-of-print .	-1
I remember the days of singing `` Take Me Home '' , and I still like the song , but that 's not enough to make me a fanatic about this album . I like `` Back Home Again '' alot better than this . I know `` Starwood In Aspen '' and `` Rhyme and Reason '' are enough to make me an emotional cripple as they cut me to tears . There is some other good stuff like `` The Eagle and The Hawk '' I would 've loved it if Denver stretched it out for a little longer than the 2 minutes and 10 seconds that 's on here , `` Sunshine '' is also a lovely song I ca n't deny that , `` Leaving On A Jet Plane '' is pretty decent , but I like Peter Paul and Mary 's better . This is just a below par compilation . It 's not too too bad , but it 's also not the greatest either .	-1
JD had a string of hits over a period of a few months , reaching the apex of his fame with `` Rocky Mountain High . '' It was a time when people could actually talk about `` starting a commune '' and not get laughed at , when `` getting back to nature , '' starting a compost heap , and passive/almost feminized masculinity were considered hip and enlightened . JD , with his suede jacket , buster brown hairdo , jeans and boots , seemed to be the musical man of the moment . His dorky looks and whiny voice seemed to fit in with the whole countrified hippie lifestyle then aspired to by many in the middle class . JD was locked into that moment and image , however . The commune people found out that you ca n't leave your sinful and fault filled humanity behind in the city - people suck just as much in Idaho as they do in Manhattan ; the middle class found out that being a struggling , poor farmer is neither ennobling nor fun ; most men found it nauseating to always have to be gentle and non-aggressive ( they also found out that the women - no matter what they might say publicly - left the wimps for the high-achievers , high earners , and other alpha-males ) . The culture moved on into the high achieving eighties and JD was left behind in the country , confused , neglected , and with an alcohol problem.Being in musical vogue for a brief time is certainly not an indicator of the true value of your music - great musicians and composers are sometimes only appreciated long after their deaths . In Jd 's case , however , the music has little to recommend itself to posterity . There are a handful of very simple but tuneful odes to nature but there are also a large number of embarassingly trite emotional songs that resemble simpleminded greeting cards . Inane lyrics can be redeemed by great music and/or a powerful performance , of course , but JD was incapable of producing either . His performances are whiny and annoying - they come across as the mooning of a lovesick adolescent who mistakes the call of his pubertal hormones and his own emotional neediness for profound romantic love . His melodies , at their best , are merely pleasant.At the time , JD 's songs , because of their subject matter ( Mother Nature , endangered species , romantic yearning ) were treated with almost sanctimonious reverence . The backlash to that is that he is now easy to mock .	-1
This is a very dated collection of greatest hits . It was released back in 1983 . At the time , it probably was a very good greatest hits collection . It contains 12 songs and back 20 years ago , to get any release with 12 songs was great - but that was in the pre-CD/digital days . Since then , Hall and Oates have released much better and more complete greatest hits collections . I 'm recommending `` Ultimate Daryl Hall and John Oates '' . This contains every song on the `` Rock and Soul Part 1 '' CD , plus it goes deeper where Rock and Soul Part 1 failed to go and it contains post 1983 material.One thing that really annoyed is when an artist calls something `` Part 1 '' and never comes out with a `` Part 2 '' . To me , it would have been very easy to come up with a `` Part 2 '' of their post 1983 hits and have another CD . This is just a gripe that I have . The liner notes are also pretty thin in here . Not a lot in terms of credits , discography , photos , etc . Inside the liner notes is a pseudo handwritten version of the lyrics for `` Adult Education '' . I also did learn that Mickey Curry was the drummer for Hall and Oates . If you are a Bryan Adams fan , you will know Curry 's work . Two glaring omissions from this collection are `` Family Man '' and `` Did it in a minute '' . I would have liked to have seen these songs on the collection . This was probably to make room for `` Adult Education '' and `` Say it is n't So '' which were newer songs that were released for the first time.In the post 1983 work , Big Bam Boom would become the next release . It was the most successful album by Hall and Oates and its hard to now see any Greatest Hits collection without songs from that album . You ca n't blame Rock and Soul Part 1 on this one , its just that more time passed since this was released.Chances are , if you do get this CD - you probably are going to get it either used or at some sort of bargain sale . And if you can get a good price on it , go for it . Otherwise I 'd recommend the 'Ultimate ' collection is the way to go as the way to start up your H & O ; collection . The content is still there on the CD and there are some very good songs on here . My advice there are better places to start with Hall and Oates .	-1
I became an even bigger fan of Sam Cooke fan than I already was because of his live album 'At The Harlem Square Club ' because it showed him as he really was . It is more a gospel album but with secular tunes . It 's one of the few albums that after five years I still enjoy listening to and I was delighted to read that there was a new reissue . However , it is a dissappointment.Let 's start with the reasons why this edition is better : first of all the artwork is very nice . A new front , more text and one of those neat cardboard covers , not the plastic case . The CD itself also looks great , as an old record . It also has a longer introduction and the final song 'Having A Party ' has two minutes added . The sound does sound clearer , especially the guitars.Here are the reasons why should look for the older edition1 . somehow the audience is mixed to the back . One thing what makes this album so great is the old gospel style call and answer with the audience , however they are sometimes hardly noticable on Feel It and Chain Gang.2 . Bring It On Home To Me in this live version is in my view the best Sam recording of all time . What especially makes it so great is the long 2 minute introduction where he tells the audience a story with Clif White 's shivering guitar on the background . As a preacher he brings the audience slowly to an orgasmic highpoint when the opening notes of the Bring it on Home riff are being played . As in point number 1 unfortunately you can hardly hear the audience answer his pleas . However , it 's now impossible to listen to these two things combined . The intro is now the outro of the preceding song and the song itself starts with the opening notes.3 . On the 'original ' edition a saxophone can really be heard , I only hear it now because I know it 's there.So please look for the original CD ! it 's also part of the Man Who Invented Soul Box but there is suffers from the same bad mixing as here . So get the original and put in this case.I ca n't believe they released this in this way . I am still hoping they can find a way to combine the two version so we can truely have a great album .	-1
Before he became a first amendment hero John Denver was an exponent of tortuous schmaltzy schlock country like this album . If Tipper Gore had suggested banning music like this the country would have made HER president .	-1
I bought this cd hoping that it would be good , but the only good song on this entire album is 'the way it is . ' I would not recommend purchasing this album because it only has one good song it .	-1
Ok what is here is ok but really ? ? ? ? ? ? Where are Cuddly Toy , The Puppy Song , and Living Without You ? ? ? ? ? A complete idiot must have put this together ! ! ! ! Avoid at all costs and get Greatest Hits instead .	-1

Before getting steamed at the title of my review , take time and read my review in an objective sense . My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible . I took my time listening to every single `` song '' on this album , so this is n't an uninformed review . Now to the review. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Hell on Earth , Mobb Deeps third release , came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef . Throughout the album , you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time . The songs and lyrics on this album , in every way , reflect that era . Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental . Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying , tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental . Though this album has 14 tracks , you 've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it was n't for the switch of beat . The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album , lyric wise . There are little to no song concepts on this album . Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot , how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you , and how they are from Queensbridge , etc . Through the lyrical context of this album , you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time . You get the sense that they 're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them . Cuts like `` Drop a gem on them '' and `` Bloodsport '' find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur . The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking . You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material . About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals . Dark , grimey , and horror movie like , they paint a background of horror and terror . Though good , the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album . After a while , they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.I 'm sorry , but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated . Lack of variation in topics , Ignorant , mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth . If you 're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts , do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost .	-1
Ms. Diana should have overseen the assembly of this compilation ; there is not a hit that I really want here . & quot ; Pieces of Ice & quot ; , her sorely underrated # 30 or so pop hit is conspicuously absent . Diana has admitted not being able to remember the hits of some of her Supremes days , so maybe its omission is all for the best , as she would be forced to own up to it in concert and probably does not have the recall at her age to do so . Some of her fans who bought such a 'Greatest Hits ' compilation may expect it-even if , arugably , it was not one of her classics . Its mere appearance on a Greatest Hits set does make it somewhat mandatory for concerts , though , and my intuition tells me that & quot ; Pieces of Ice & quot ; is something she would rather forget-even if it was progressive '80s music . On the brigher side , classics & quot ; Muscles & quot ; and Daryl Hall 's & quot ; Swept Away & quot ; are here though .	-1
Was n't really a fan of Diana Ross until she started her solo career in the 70 's . With Hits such as & quot ; touch me in the morning & quot ; , & quot ; Last time I Saw Him & quot ; , & quot ; Ai n't no mountain high enough & quot ; , and & quot ; Reach out and touch & quot ; . My admiration for her music grew greatly when she Dueted with Lionel Richie with & quot ; Endless Love & quot ; in September of 1981 . At this time she started recording for RCA , and over the coming nine years would produce her finest material . Albums like & quot ; Why do fools fall in love & quot ; ( 1981 ) , & quot ; Silk electric & quot ; ( 1982 ) , & quot ; Ross & quot ; ( 1983 ) , & quot ; Swept away & quot ; ( 1984 ) , & quot ; Eaton alive & quot ; ( 1986 ) , & quot ; Red hot rhythm and blues & quot ; ( 1987 ) , and & quot ; Working overtime & quot ; ( 1989 ) . I 'd love to buy all this stuff on CD , but for some weird reason , RCA 's attitude towards reissuing back catalogue material is pretty appalling . It seems out of all these albums , I be lucky to pick one up on ebay , most probaby paying a hundred smackers for it ! What 's even worse , a greatest hits compilation that 's not . Perhaps just a few hits a heap of misses . I love all the songs on this album , but many of her greater hits are missing , such as the Ray Parker Jnr . produced & quot ; Pieces of Ice & quot ; , the do wop sixties sounding & quot ; So Close & quot ; and several others . Perhaps this could of been a two CD edition . With her best material coming out in the 80 's , I thought RCA could of done a much better job of it ! Find more album reviews at [ ... ]	-1
Dated trip-hop is neither offensively out of style or retroactively radical but instead merely offers a humble signpost to the blossoming sub-genre over a decade ago .	-1
When I read all of the reviews about & quot ; the best album ever & quot ; and stuff like that I expected an awesome LP . What I got was a mediocre rap album . The beats are pretty repetitive and most are ... well ... weak . No doubt these two are great MCs , but you can only listen to the same lame beat for a little while . Noreaga 's NORE is definitely a better buy if you want to try some of his stuff .	-1
The revisionist history being espoused by rock critics embraces this one as a long lost gem . Actually it is a sickly sweet sounding bit of pop poop with maybe two good songs on it . When the strings are n't sending you into a diabetic coma you might catch a whiff of a couple of excellent songs like & quot ; Preacher Man & quot ; . Basically these are interpretations of other people 's songs & amp ; I ca n't for the life of me understand why this soul-less wonder is being lauded as a classic . There is plenty of great soul out there , but this ai n't it folks ...	-1
The , as they claim , rehearsal Take , mix of The World Is A Ghetto sounds ( audio ) pathetic . Mixed by John Morales to make War a Hip-Hop sounding group with a few hundred decibels of bass . I 'm guessing , this is not a rehearsal Take at all , but an early version . You get to hear what War actually sounded like in the studio .	-1
As a drummer , the most interesting thing about this recording is how David Garibaldi 's style evolved from the way he played on East Bay Grease to later recordings ( In the Slot and Back to Oakland , for example ) . He progressed from a great drummer to a deity in a period of a couple years . The songs on East Bay Grease are , at times , barely up to the standards of your average garage band -- though the playing is substantially better . If this was Tower of Power 's legacy , they would have been forgotten 30 years ago .	-1
Only worth buying for two songs . The trippy & quot ; Porpoise Song & quot ; and & quot ; Daddy 's Song & quot ; , where Davy goes Sammy Davis Jr. on the audience .	-1
Aretha 's most productive period was between about 1967 to 1971 . This is an unfocused album -- not representative of her best years . So Swell When You 're Well is an absolute masterpiece and is worth the cost of the disk . For completists .	-1
I admit , if it was n't for this group , there would be no rap , but it is so hard to put this group in the same category as Project Pat.I never really listened to rap until there was gangsta rap.I thought all that funk rap , such as Kid'n'Play , Kool Moe Dee , and this group , was pure comedy.This CD is lame , dull , boring , stupid , and worst of all , WACK.Not one song on here is worth bragging about , maybe Rappers Delight since it brought rap to the mainstream , but that still does n't mean that it is any good.The lyrics are dull , the beats , oh my bad , the breakbeats are dull , and everything about this CD is beyond stupid.I only really listen to this CD , or any other funk rap CD if I want a good laugh.This is the kind of rap that you should avoid.Here are some rap CDs that are WAY better : '' Nellyville '' by Nelly '' Layin ' Da Smack Down '' by Project Pat '' The Blueprint '' by Jay-Z '' God 's Favorite '' by N.O.R.E.These CDs , unlike this one that I'am reviewing , are way better and have everything that the Sugarhill Gang , or any other funk rap group , lacks , such as great lyrics , fantastic beats , and all the other good stuff that funk rap seems to avoid.I hope this review was helpful to you and will let you make a better choice.And remember , lets keep it gangsta.Peace Out	-1
You know all these 70 's MOR bands were really confusing . They all sounded the same . I 'm beginning to think that really it was just a bunch of studio muscians who put out a bunch of records under different band names . Firefall sounds like Player sounds like Orleans sounds like the Paul Davis ... .Anyhow & quot ; Dance With ME & quot ; their one hit was n't bad I guess but again I have to believe & quot ; The Best of & quot ; could have fit onto a CD single ... ..	-1
I had high hopes when I bought _No Protection_ , having read a review of _Protection_ that claimed that Mad Professor 's effort was a massive improvement of the original album , but listening to the album proved just the opposite . Mad Professor turns the involving , grim songs of _Protection_ into unoriginal dub-scapes . As a result , almost every song sounds the same , and very boring . I 'm happy Mad Professor left out & quot ; Eurochild , & quot ; which was my favourite track of the original , as hearing him butcher that one would be too much to bear .	-1
& quot ; Protection & quot ; was Massive Attack ` s worst record , but this remix album is even worse , destroying the few interesting moments that the band ` s second effort had . Remixer Mad Professor deconstructs the songs and gives them a dub/ reggae-oriented sound , something that ` s decent enough during the first two/ three tracks but soon becomes terribly uninspired , repetitive , boring and formulaic.There are no variations or contrasts in this remixes , the process is always the same and the album seems endless , almost impossible to listen through in one sitting while managing to remain awake . Seriously , this is a major disappointment , and certainly one of the most monotonous , one-dimensional and flat records around.For fans and completists only .	-1
Why in heck did this jerk leave the Trees ? That was the most happenin ' band in Seattle , we all loved 'em . & quot ; Nearly Lost You & quot ; was the best song of the '90s , by far ! Now Lanegan leaves Queens of the Stone Age and what are we left with - nothin ' ! ! ! The Trees were a top Seattle band that kills the morbid junk on this dusky album . Again , I do n't see why Mark Lanagen left the Trees to join Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters , then later Q.O.T.S.A . Those bands had something to offer , but Lanegan as a solo artist is Dullsville , U.S.A. , as you can tell by my low star rating . In fact , I only gave it 2 stars because one of the songs on this CD sort of reminds me of the Trees.For reviews on all top albums of the day , keep checking in on my site.THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
A couple of note worthy songs by Lou . The rest of the album falls way short . The Eric songs are utterly bizarre and creepy . I actually like Eric 's contributions on some of the earlier albums , but these songs just make me go 'huh ? ' . Lowenstein 's material has always been hit or miss , and he 's definitely a miss here.Lou gets very personal about his relationship on this album , it 's not my favorite stuff he 's ever done but I saw a few concerts in the 90 's where the songs on this album really stood out . Lou probably should of taken over and wrote most of the material for this album . The democratic approach to creating this album did n't work out and the results are a really disjointed and jarring .	-1
I know my opinion will be an unpopular one here , but I bought this CD based on all of the wonderful reviews here and was severely disappointed . I am not a music novice . I have literally thousands of CD 's and LP 's in my collection and I have to say that this album is one of the best examples of pretentious , self-indulgent noise I have ever heard . ( Well , next to that horrid Lou Reed & quot ; Metal Machine Music & quot ; LP . ) I just do n't see the genius in writing completely unintelligible , atonal music that is seemingly devoid of any melody at all . This album simply drones and whines and goes absolutely nowhere . It is not fair to compare this SDRE album with the music of the Cocteau Twins , because their music is beautifully composed , soaring , and melodic , though at times challenging . I will agree with the other reviews in that this is an extremely challenging recording to listen to . It may take you a hundred listens to become familiar with the songs on the & quot ; Pink Album & quot ; , but why the heck would you want to endure that ? There are many other artists that deserve your attention and are willing to work for it . Pass on this one if you put any importance in melody and songcraft .	-1
LIZ PHAIR `` Exile in Guyville '' is at best a demo disc -- mainly aimed at stoned-out hippies and 'rug munching ' feminists who blame men for their problems . Maybe `` Lizzie 's Lezzie Laments '' or `` I Got ta Lotta Chips on My shoulders '' would have been more appropriate album titles.To begin with , it 's unlistenable -- the vocals sound like someone practicing in the bathroom -- off key , not well structured , and sloppily delivered.The instrumental parts sound so generic , trite and un-inspired , that it 's probably best that they 're mixed down a bit . They remind one of summer camp sing alongs or the lame folkie-stuff they play at 'progressive ' churches.The lyrics alternate between whining about others ( the first 2 songs , anmong others ) , to whining about being unappreciated ( 'Canary ' , [ ... ] And Run ' , etc . ) to generic whining ( most of the other songs ) .If Liz Phair is an exile in guyville , then it seems it is by her own deliberate choices.It 's obvious why she 's been sidelined , and why no one ( except dorky music critics ) thinks she 's even close to being cool . No ROCK Fan will find anything redeeming about this collection of reject-songs . They were ignored upon initial release in 1993 -- and deservedly so.Addumdum : based on the feedback , it seems more people read ( and raacted to ) this review than bought the actual CD . The fact that people ca n't even get $ 0.01 here on Amazon.com speaks volumes -- the public agrees with this review , and has not bought the hype ( or the CD ) .	-1
Liz was lame when she was an indie `` it chick '' and she 's lame as a complete commercial sell-out too ! So she is consistent and that 's about it.As an indie darling , she could n't play guitar , sing or write a decent song . Back in the 90s that translated into `` cutting edge , '' most likely because she sang about giving bj 's . But lame music is lame music no matter how you spin it . And that 's what `` exile '' is ... lame . End of story.When she completely sold out a few years ago , she was laughably incompetent as a commercial pop singer . Funniest moment was when she appeared on The Regis and Kelly Show and Regis asked her `` Liz , you 've been away for awhile . Why do n't you tell us what you 've been up to . '' C'MON ! Regis had no idea who Liz Phair was before she decided to let a major label run her career in the hopes of scoring a big paycheck . That was a good chuckle.Liz , where are you these days ? Hmmm ... neither incarnation of your lame career ever took off , did it ? At least it 's proof that when you have zero talent ( other than to write sexually explicit lyrics and show half a nipple on your album cover ) , you 're on a road to nowhere.Buh bye , Lizzie Poo . Please do n't embarrass yourself by releasing any more music . Please ! ? Pretty please ? ? ? ! ! !	-1
Alien Lanes being guided by voices 1995 release is truly a mediocre album with a sound that sounds like unfinished melodies and lyrics that were written on a lunch break . I usually somewhat agree with Allmusic when they write reviews . However , to give this unoriginal rock standard sound 3.5/5 is beyond me . The booklet is nothing short of a travesty with a horrid cover , font that makes you think they could have afforded a better printer . 2/5 .	-1
This is the only place in the world where a fat , ugly drug dealer can become a star.His voice is mediocre and he wouldnt of got anywhere without poop diddy.The beats to the songs on this album are okay but are nothing special.Overall , this album lacks substance and creativity.Too many sampled parts in the music and poop diddys voice is annoying.He glorified violence and ignorance so thats what led to his demise.He is way overrated like 50 cent and eminem.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
STOP OVERRATING THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALL OF THAT ! THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME IS TUPAC . IF YOU WANT TO HEAR REAL MUSIC , CHECK OUT TUPAC 'S CDS .	-1
I know , I know . How could I give one of the hottest hip hop albums of all time two stars , right ? Well I 've got a better question for you : How could Bad Boy piss all over Biggie 's legacy and mutilate this classic ? Before they spend their money on this fakeness , the fans have the right to know ... especially the young folks who were n't even around back in the day ... that the album you see before you ... this so called `` remaster '' ... is NOT what Biggie fans rocked out to in '94 . This is NOT the album that was bangin ' in the clubs , in our cars , or at our house parties . Take it from someone who was there , this so-called `` remaster '' is not just an enhancement of sound quality as the name might imply , it 's a totally different album.Do n't get it twisted , the original version , the one with the white cover , was n't some rough mix that was stolen from Easy Mo Bee 's basement and released on the streets as a bootleg or whatever ... it was the official studio release . The one you bought at Sam Goody , Coconuts , or , until 2006 , right here on amazon . And now it 's gone forever in favor of this inferior mess.And why ? Money , mostly . And a touch of political correctness.1 . ) Bad Boy 's legal department apparently f 'd up and some of the samples used on the original were n't cleared properly , so rather than tap into their billions and just pay whatever licensing fees were necessary for the re-release , Diddy and company decided to just CHANGE THE ORIGINALS ! ! ! So now , tracks like `` Machine Gun Funk '' and `` Ready to Die '' sound totally different . They are not at all what we heard when we first bumped this album back in '94.2 . ) Some of Biggie 's original lyrics were apparently too raw for the sensibilities of the new millenium so they were edited out or backmastered . Most notably on `` Juicy '' where he spits `` time to get paid/blow up like the World Trade '' referencing the 1993 attack on the towers . On the remaster , the words `` World Trade '' are edited out , presumably because someone might think he was making a reference to 9/11 seven years before it actually happened . While I understand that 9/11 was a catastrophic and horrible event , and would certainly agree that a rapper using it as a euphemism for accruing wealth would be unbelievably crass , I also do n't think that record companies should go back and selectively edit albums that came out seven years before the tragedy even happened because someone might think that Biggie was Nostradamus and predicted the whole thing in his crystal ball , thus compromising his original vision and lyricism.Now that this `` remaster '' has come out , the only way to get the original is to run it down in some used record store . Think about what this means . Kids who grew up hearing that Biggie was the best and wanting to hear the album that their elders say prove it will rush to purchase or download this `` remaster '' , because it 's the only thing available , not realizing that they are NOT hearing what those of us who copped the original heard back in '94 . They 're not hearing Biggie as we heard him . They 're not hearing his magnum opus . They 're hearing a compromised , mutilated version of that album . Again , think about what this says about Bad Boy 's respect for their greatest artist , the man whose talent they pretty much rode to wealth and glory . Would anyone dare to dream of doing this to the Beatles ' `` Sgt . Pepper 's '' , Bob Marley 's `` Catch a Fire '' or Marvin Gaye 's `` What 's Going On '' ? No ? Then what does this say about Bad Boy 's respect for Biggie and hip hop as an artform in general ? Because it 's Biggie , I ca n't bring myself to give even this mangled version of his vision one star , but because this musical mutilation is the auditory equivalent of putting boxer shorts on Donatello 's David or a bra on the Venus de Milo , I also ca n't bring myself to give it more than two.To the young hip hop headz out there , consider yourselves warned . If you want to hear Biggie as 90s headz heard him when this classic disc first dropped back in the day , this is n't the version you 're looking for . Pressure Bad Boy to re-release the `` classic version '' full and intact . Peace .	-1
this was an iight cd , but im still a pac fan 4 ever , you can buy it if u want but i recommend pacs cd PEACE ! ! !	-1
about this being the greatest double c.d . and all that other [ stuff ] , `` all eyez on me '' was and still is the greatest double album and in fact album period . i only like `` notorious thugs '' in this whole album , westcoast for like man , 2pac is still ballin homies .	-1
This album is way too overrated by all the controversy surrounding it.The fact is that this album really sucks and is a poor excuse to make money by poop diddy.There are only 5 good songs out of 26 total songs on the album.All the rest are only filler material.This rapper died because the rap world is full of criminals , materialism , greed and jealousy.This guy is no angel himself because he used to sell crack for his own materialistic ends and never really helped his own community when he could have.DO NOT BUY THIS SUCKY CD ! ! !	-1
Im a big hip hop fan , my favorites being Drake , Lil Wayne , Soulja Boy , Limp Bizkit , Vanilla Ice , and MC Hammer ... but lately ive noticed alot of folks seem to dislike good musicz . Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap . things were great before fakes started taking over the scene ! Studio gangsters like NWA , Snoop Dogg , Warren G , Ice Cube , 2Pac , and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this Notorious BIG guy faked his death to make more money ! I mean comon , its sooooooo obvious hes not dead . If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale ? Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck ! ! Stupid songs like `` Notorious Thugs '' and `` hypnotize '' have STUDIO GANGSTER written all over them ! For good hip hop stick with Kid Rock , Limp Bizkit , Akon , and Lil Drake .	-1
I accidently bought this edited version instead of the explicit version . The songs are pretty good but most of it is edited and about half the album is dropped from the explicit version ! If you want this album , do n't get this version of it !	-1
Truth be known . BIG was NOT the king of Eastcoast hip-hop as much as he was credited for ( or at least never on Puffy 's label ) . The entire label is based on using premade samples from oldschool artists ' , that 's not being original . Not only that , but lyrics lack substance horribly and serve for very little meaning . You ca n't consider yourself a king of hip-hop if all you 're doing is biting off other artists ' beats . Perhaps if BIG was under another label with better guidance , be could have easily been a much better artist , perhaps even be alive today .	-1
Puff Daddy is , in my opinion , one of the most over-rated rap performers in the current climate . As a rapper he has a generic flow , trips over his lyrics with alarming regularity and generally comes across as a bad copy of most of the other East Coast rappers . As a producer , he would have to rate as one of the least imaginative of all . Where other producers sample quality music and make it new , Puffy removes entire sections of songs and goes to no effort to liven them up. & quot ; No Way Out & quot ; is quite an appropriate title for this album , as there really is no way out for Puffy and friends from the trap which they have made for themselves - the trap of cheap lyrics , bad beats and generally uninspired work.I might as well admit that when I bought this album , I was very pleased and did my & quot ; I am very hardcore & quot ; routine for a few weeks . Now that I compare Puffy to the Gurus , Q-Tips and Chali 2nas of this world , I can see exactly how awful he really is.As previously mentioned , the music is one of the big problems with this album . Puffy has & quot ; sampled & quot ; ( his words ) or & quot ; ripped & quot ; ( mine and most others ) backign music from - among others - The Police ( & quot ; Every Breath You Take & quot ; , used on & quot ; I 'll Be Missin ' You & quot ; ) , David Bowie ( & quot ; Let 's Dance & quot ; , used on & quot ; Around The World & quot ; ) and Grandmaster Flash ( & quot ; The Message & quot ; , used on & quot ; Ca n't Nobody Hold Me Down & quot ; ) . In doing so , he has attempted to revert sampling to the old , illegal days . Every single one of the songs sampled is an accepted classic - in the case of & quot ; The Message & quot ; , classic may be an understatement - and Puffy 's treatment of them ( de-fanginf guitars , speeding up beats and so on ) shows his total disregard for music in general.The lyrics of the album fall into two main divisions . Some are the big & quot ; let 's party , get drunk , take drugs and have lots of sex & quot ; theme . As well as being very unoriginal , these tracks have possibly the worst backing music that I 've heard and thus lose the party appeal that they may have originally had . The rest of the lyrics are mourining the death of Notorious BIG . Yes , it is a terrible loss that BIG is dead , however the relentless messages to him throughout this and other Bad Boy albums begins to sound a bit creepy . What 's even more creepy is the appearance of BIG on a few tracks and on the back cover - the man is dead , maybe leave him dead.Of course , the other problem is that Puffy has brought in a collection of guest stars . On the surface , this is a great relief from his lack of talent - however , the guests do n't really seem to try very hard . Ma $ e ( who shows up far too much ) is hardly the most talented rapper around , but to compound the problem he produces carbon copies of the & quot ; Message & quot ; chorus on & quot ; Ca n't Nobody & quot ; and also raps out what sounds like the chorus of 2 Unlimited 's & quot ; Break My Stride & quot ; in the same track . What 's also well worth noticing is the fact that where skilled rappers mould their lyrics to the beat , these rappers do not even make that attempt.Finally , there is that monstrosity & quot ; I 'll Be Missin You & quot ; . It 's great to see that BIG was venerated so highly over the course of his brief career but & quot ; Missin You & quot ; is quite frankly the most awful way to send him off - the Police were clearly insane to let & quot ; Every Breath & quot ; be sampled for this track.I would have given this album one star but I ca n't really bring myself to be that cruel for some reason . Do n't buy this album unless you either like wasting money or are one of those pop-gangsta fans . Everyone else , buy if you want a good laugh but otherwise save your money .	-1
Puff Daddy/P.Diddy 's debut album `` No Way Out '' was half wayed from the beginning . Straight from the lyrics to mostly the production was mostly the wackest I 've heard from him . It 's not as bad as many of the reviewers have been saying that makes you wish you were deaf . You 've heard more horrible albums believe it or not.Reading the reviews almost everyone who bashed Sean Combs , said something about beat jocking old 70 's and 80 's hits . True , I do n't like the style at all . But have you noticed almost everyone , new and old , has `` jocked '' songs that were 15 years old and rapped over them . Puffy is not the first to cash in on this style , and surely wo n't even be the last . People crying when Puffy did it , but when someone else does it and raps over it , its a whole different ball game . He 's just exploited in an unintentional way , by crossing the line . The stuff these people say . What really weighs the style down is the lyrics on the songs that he jocked ( I 'm pretty sure you know which origonal beats he stole , so I wo n't get into it ) . Something tells me that he did n't put any thought into what he wrote down . An example is on one of the single 's `` Victory '' as he says `` ... Put your money on the table and get your math on/break it down , split it up , get your laugh on/ see you later Dog , I'ma get my stash on/ there 's a bed full of money that I get my a** on ... '' Not very good lyrics , but you ca n't blame him for writing his `` cashed in lyrics '' .Guest appearances , could n't be more horrible . Well not exactly . It 's hard to tell if Puffy outshines his guests or do they outshine him . With the exception of `` Is This The End '' and any song that his Big 's vocals , you know exactly what I 'm talking about . Lets start with the first single `` Ca n't No Body Hold Me Down '' as come to learn that both Puffy and Mase makes the song look like a commercial joke ( And the fact that Mase is immitating Grandmaster Flash on his verse , could have made the origonal look the same way ) . Foxy Brown 's verse is horrible on the song `` Friends '' ( like it made a difference ) . `` Do n't Stop What You 're Doing '' should have never seen the light of day . On some occasions there are some good guests . Black Rob 's debut his decent as he raps the first two verses in the song `` I Love You '' . The Lox 's `` I Got The Power '' is somewhat decent as Puffy does the hook . The best song `` Young G 's '' which features Notorious BIG and Jay-Z as each person spit one long verse . Also most of the verses ( I said `` most '' meaning everything on the second verse that Kim and BIG says ) on the biggest hit `` All About The Benjamins '' . Puffy gives a somewhat tribute to the passed Notorious BIG on the song `` I 'll Be Missing You '' .No Way Out is the bad album most people says . Most of the rhymes are just halfassed to a certain point . I 'm not going to lie to myself and say that I hated this album , because when the videos came on the televison , I was happy as my child age to see them , no matter how overrated the album and the singles were . As one spolight reviewer says about hated the beat jocking but jumped on the dance floor when Puffy 's songs came on . I would have done the same thing . I 'm no Bad Boy fan , but I 'm not going to point the finger at Puffy for his damage in rap . Thats everybody else 's job .	-1
hahahahahahahahaha come on now this is PUFF DADDY or P DIDDY , and I just figured out what P in Diddy stands for ... POOP . Cuz this cd like everything else he does or will is POOP . cuz he does n't write rymes he writes checks hahahaha and all he wants to do is MAKE U DANCE hahahahahaha	-1
Puff dud or poop diddy whatever his name is must really be desperate for some fast cash with the release of this garbage.What an opportunity to exploit his friends death and make some money by stealing the police song every breath you take and renaiming it & quot ; ill be missing you & quot ; .Everybody knows that puff daddy was never really friends with biggie and used him only to make more money.P diddy was responsible for the deaths of 9 people for failing to do his job as an event promoter and he let his so called friend go to jail for him.People you must ask yourself if this is the type of of self centerd and greedy human being you would want to support with your money.This man has absolutely no talent as he steals other hits and calls them his own.To conclude , Im very surprised no one has sued p diddy for beat jacking and I would really give this cd 0 stars if I could.Have a nice day .	-1
Listening to this album will make you wish that 2pac and Biggie were still alive . Hip Hoppers , we have go to be more selective and not let bullsh-t like this slide for rap ! El-715	-1
I bought this album back in the day when I obviously didnt know what I was doing . Puffy , D.Puff , Diddy Puff , whatever his name is has absolutely no skills on the mic . He 's the lamest rapper of all time . He should seriously stick to producing and I aint saying he 's all that either . He 's so rich no thanks to his rapping ability . Thank You	-1
Big and Jay-Z It wouldnt be any stars because that song is hot but the other radio played tracks are good but not great dont let the hype fool you dont buy .	-1
Puff Daddy came from nowhere and become on of the most selling rap artists of the remaining decade after this cd was released , but was it really that good ? . `` No way out '' got to be one of the most commercial and overhyped albums of the 90 's . Most of the songs were samples nah i rather say covers and Puff is far from a songwriter and producer as he claims to be , neither he is a very good rapper . He has to thank Biggie Smalls for the huge success of `` I 've been missing you '' cause if it was n't for his tragic death i do n't think Puffy 's , sorry diddy 's career ever would have kicked off . `` I 'll be missing you '' was more of less a cover of The Police 1983 hit `` Every Breath you take '' only diffrence was diddy 's rap . And the Rap was as commercial as it could be , i think i 've learned it word by word after hearing it twice , but that 's the plan ofcourse . The easier a song get 's in your head the better it sells . Diddy continued with other `` covers '' such as `` Been around the world '' based on the hook from Lisa Stansfield 's `` All around the world '' from 1990 and David Bowie 's 1983 hitt `` Let 's dance '' as the melody , Diddy and Mase teamed up here more annoying then ever . `` Ca n't nobosy hold me down '' was a remake of the classic 80 's rap song `` The Messeage from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five , not very fun when a rap song is beeing remade by other artists but diddy had n't had enough here cause he later covered Public Enemy 's `` Public Enemy # 1 '' . We hear Lil Kim on `` Do n't Stop What You 're Doing '' , and boring `` it 's all about the benjamins '' , I liked `` Senorita '' though but the good part is the melody not the rap . This cd sure helped Diddy and his bad boy 's friend earn some cash and fame but it never gave anyone of them the reputation as good musician , Mase retired when people got annoyed by him , Puff Daddy , i mean P. Diddy is still around but his success has decreased , still he 's `` producing '' and appearing on pretty much stuff but i doubt his popularity will ever be as big as it was when this album came out and thanks god for that .	-1
Weak , fluffy , hyped-up garbage . The beats are weak and the rhymes are weaker . The highlights of this album are the guest appearances , without question . If you made the mistake of purchasing this album all those years ago - good luck getting rid of it . Probably would n't even sell on eBay.Diddy is a great entertainer with great vision , he is just not a legitimate hip hop artist .	-1
i wish he would stop ruining records that i grew up on.he ca n't rap the music is cheesy and is embarassing.how do so many bums today get record deals ? not an ounce of originality in there pinky.playing over songs is not creative.where have the standards gone ? he gets the most blame cuz he is the most influential rapper out there period.until folks stop all this endless sampling then puffy is there leader.a mind is a terrible thing to waste .	-1
Puffy is the worst rapper ever ! Correction : Puffy 's ghostwriters are the worst ghostwriters ever ! Puffy 's delivery is deadly dull and the beats ruin every timeless classic he sampled . It 's true that other producers sample beats but the difference is that they make you appreciate those classics Puffy makes you hate those classics . Standout Tracks : Every song featuring Biggie might have been a standout track if puffy wasnt on them ! Filler : Pain , Cant nobody hold me down , Friend , Is this the end , Been around the world , Dont stop what youre doing and the rest of the album ! Puffy is where hip hop went wrong so unless you are ready to hold him responsible for his actions ( opening up the door for hip pop icons ) dont bash jafool into oblivion for participating in hip hop 's destruction !	-1
There are a few absolutely awesome tracks on this album , there are a few decent tracks , and there are a bunch of [ bad ] ones . You 're better off just downloading `` Victory , '' `` All About the Benjamins , '' and maybe `` Been Around the World '' and `` Ca n't Nobody Hold Me Down '' ... I would highly recommend those songs because they do feature some incredible , mind-blowing rhymes . Other than them , there really is n't much else here so do n't waste your money .	-1
I remember back when the singles from `` No Way Out '' were on the radio constantly and I was young and bought into the hype of it all . I 'm sure alot of people can relate to what I 'm talking about ; this album was being shoved down everyone 's throats back in 1997 and Biggie had just died so there was a level of sentimentality that went along with this album at the time.In 2012 , that does n't hold up anymore . This is called Puff Daddy and the Family probably because Sean Combs knows he has no business rapping ( or should know ) . Every track on this that features Puff Daddy rapping solo with no guest artist , is average at best ; you could pick a random unknown underground MC to rap over the track and it would sound better.The reason this album gets 2 stars is because there are some songs that are saved by the guest artists : Been Around the World ( Mase and Biggie rescue this one ) Do n't Stop What You 're Doing ( Lil ' Kim actually stops this from being trash ) It 's All About The Benjamins ( The Lox , Lil Kim , Biggie , they all turned this one around ) I 'll Be Missing You ( do n't get me wrong , Puff Daddy 's raps suck but Faith Evans and 112 sound beautiful for B.I.G . ) Ca n't Nobody Hold Me Down ( without Mase in this , Puff Daddy would n't have a leg to stand on here ) Not a very good ratio for an album with a large amount of songs . If you get this , get it VERY VERY cheap . I would n't pay more than 2.00 for it and I hope that Sean Combs stops making music sooner than later for all our sakes .	-1
This album is a complete piece of sh*t. Pretty much everything Fluff did after the terrible death of Biggie was crap . The only thing I 'll ever give him props for is bringing up and mentoring Biggie , but serioulsy how hard could that have been ? Biggie was a once in a lifetime talent that was waiting to blow , anyone could have made him into a star.I do like his production on Big 's albums , I 'll give him that . But then you realize that ( almost ) all of his beats are straight ripped-off loops , and the choruses and hooks he employs are jacked from popular '60's-'70 's soul/funk tracks . His production is all straight ripped-off in a totally unimaginitive form . Yes , I know , Hip-Hop was built on sampling , but everyone else does things CREATIVELY , fluff does n't have a creative bone in his body.All his big hits ( the beats AND hooks ) were unimaginitive rip-offs of old songs that everyone knows already . `` Been around the world '' - straight jacked . `` DIDDY '' or whatever that sh*t track was called , was jacked from BDP 's `` JIMMY . '' `` Bad Boy '' the Mase track , I could go on and on . ***The real reason I wrote this review was to let the world know something that is truly disgraceful . We all know how fluff brutally jacked Sting for the track `` I 'll be Missing You , '' which pretty much angered the whole world . That track was supposed to be a heartfelt tribute to his fallen homie Biggie ( R.I.P . Big Man ! ) BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT HE DID N'T EVEN WRITE THE F*CKING LYRICS ! ! ! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ? ! ? ! SAUCE MONEY WAS EMPLOYED BY FLUFFY TO WRITE THE LYIRCS FOR THE `` EULOGY '' OF FLUFFY BEST FRIEND . I READ THAT IN AN ISSUE OF THE SOURCE AND I WAS FLOORED . THAT 'S LIKE PAYING A STRANGER TO WRITE YOUR FAREWELL SPEECH AT YOUR BEST-FRIEND 'S FEUNERAL . ***Pass on that info , please . I ca n't stand anything fluff does and he get waaaay too many undeserved and artificial props in this world . He is a corner-stone in Hip-Hop 's selling out demise ... F*ck you fluffy , you piece of sh*t. Peace .	-1
how in the hell did puff doofy make his money ? ! ? ! ? ! ? did he become the smartest pimp and sell mediocre rappers to the masses 10 at a time ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? as for the umbrella holder ... ... ... ... HAVE YOU NO SHAME ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
THE LOX NOW ARE IMPROVED AND WITH A BETTER RAP FAMILY.THIS ALBUM IS WACK DO N'T BUY IT .	-1
despite going over to ruff ryders who are as terrible as puffy when it comes to that stuff they call music this group is weak.they have no flow or feeling in there work.puffy tried to give them character and they still stunk up the disc.and now with the way overrated ruff ryders production & amp ; crew it will get even worse .	-1
There is nothing more to these four and five star reviews but pure nostalgia . I hated this album from day one . Prior to this album , anybody who heard The Lox on a mixtape circuit knows that they gave it to you raw and uncut with witty rhymes that made you say `` did they just say that '' ? They were signed to Bad Boy and the hard edged and witty side of them was exchanged for a corny and commercial appeal . The first single Do You Think Im Jiggy ( which poorly sample Rod Stewart 's dreadful If You Think Im Sexy was the wackest song I heard in 98 ' . There 's listenable tracks like Money Power , Respect feat Lil Kim and DMX , The Heist Part 1 and All For The Love . These tracks are the only tracks that stop it from being a certified frisbee . Other times on the album they sound bored out of their skulls . Lackluster tracks like Livin This Life , Get This $ , Let 's Start Rap Over , I Wan na Thank You , Cant Stop , Wont Stop , Not To Be F****d With and the extremely overrated B****es From Eastwick are evidence of that statement . So Right would clear any dancefloor and while We 'll Always Love Big Poppa wasnt awful , The Lox could have done a better tribute than that . The skits are stupid as hell especially The Mad Rapper skit that stopped being funny after Life After Death . In closing , this album is far from The Lox 's true potential . This was a Puffy-inspired nightmare that almost killed their careers before it got started . It 's a good thing they broke camp because they sound a lot better now than they 've ever been . And for those of you who think this snoozer is better than We Are The Streets , get off the crack !	-1
Its sad tha Lox had to deal with tha post biggie bad boy family I kno dey gots tha but P diddy or wateva his name is now ruins it . I knew backden tha Lox were tha future n a way to save rap from its state now . Buy We are tha streets its almost classic or check out tha solo albums .	-1
I can see why the Lox do n't like to talk about this debut . This sounds as if Puffy did the whole album . Puffy and his Bad Boy production team produced most of the songs and it sounds like complete rejects from his No Way Out album instead of a Jadakiss/Sheek Louch/Styles project . Money , Power , Respect with DMX and Lil ' Kim is the only strong song on the album . And what was the point of having the Mad Rapper on this album ? Even the Hitmen 's offerings come off as lame . The Ron Lawrence/Deric Angelettie song come off as lousy . And the ones from Nashiem Myrick , Stevie J and Carlos Broady come off as mediocre . But the low point is the pop-driven sound of If You Think I 'm Jiggy , which Puffy produced and what worked for Mase does n't work for the Lox . The song blatantly interpolates Rod Stewart 's 1978 disco-driven hit Do Ya Think I 'm Sexy . It 's got a catchy beat a la Puffy , but the song 's pretty bad and overly commercial . Out of 40 to 60 songs that Puffy produced in 1997 for artists , that 's his worst ! The lyrics on the album come off as materialistic and do n't tell me too much about the group 's background . Jadakiss had harder-edged rhymes and lyrics on the Lox ' 2000 album and his solo stuff , but there 's nothing he really offers here . The album 's commercial sheen comes off as creatively empty . They should have let Puffy rap on this album instead and called it The Four Beats to Shake to .	-1
This is so wack Common ripped them so bad . Yo Common told Mack 10 he ai n't no Mack 10 he 's a 22 .Ice cube just got shredded and after his first album it was a wrap . He was better of getiing his money snatch by Eazy E and Jerry Heeler .When I get my deal they will get dissed so nasty but not W.C because I like his music	-1
Ghetto D was really the album that made Master P a short term MTV superstar and assured him his 15 minutes of fame . With surefire hits like `` I Miss My Homies '' & `` Make Em Say Ugh '' , P got dealt a hell of a good hand and went on to make millions off of music , movies and clothing . The best song on the album , this many years later , is obviously `` Burbons & Laces '' , which can still bang in your trunk or on your system at home on any given day . If you 're looking for P 's best work , you 'd be better suited purchasing MP DA LAST DON or THE ICE CREAM MAN .	-1
Yet another crap cd by a crap producer slash whatever.This cd has no rhythm and is chalk full of the same stereotypical nonsense which is expected from hip hop.Only a person with the intelligence level of a fourth grader would buy this garbage.I cant wait for the demise of this trend called hip hop which is rotting our ears on the radio on a daily basis.Its only a matter of time that this genre of simple minded music gets exposed for how unoriginal and ridiculous it really is . ... ..	-1
I had forgotten all about this crap until I was watching & quot ; I Love The '90s & quot ; last night , and & quot ; Make 'Em Say Uhh & quot ; was one of the vid picks . All the commentators were basically making fun of it ( DMC from Run DMC saying Master P probably came up with the lyrics while on the john ) . What did you expect ? People PRAISING this ? People even COMPLIMENTING this ? Hell no ! This was the official declaration that real , respectable rap was dead and buried , and annoying , unimaginative dreck was here to stay ! Back in 1998 ( I think ) , this was the new low for not only rap , not only music , but American pop culture as we know it . I mean , we have the same stupid & quot ; DUN DUN ! DUN DUN ! & quot ; beat going the whole time , and then the brilliant lyrics : & quot ; MAKE EM SAY UHHHH ! UHHHH ! NA NA NA NA ! & quot ; Compared to that , & quot ; On Top Of Spaghetti & quot ; rivals anything from Maynard James Keenan . This was a total & quot ; style-over-substance & quot ; kind of ... erm , & quot ; album & quot ; . I could come up with a better song in my sleep . And people actually bought into this ? And the rest of No Limit 's god-awful catalogue ? ? Yeccch ! Sorry people , but a shiny cover with lots of pretty colours does not a good album make . It 's because of & quot ; Masta PPPPPPPPPP & quot ; that we have unlistenable crap like DMX and Ja Rule . So thanks , Master P. Thanks for contributing to the official downfall of respectable rap music as we know it . ( At least Cypress Hill and the Beasties are still going strong . ) Eric & quot ; Eazy E & quot ; Wright must be spinning in his grave.Shhhh ... now here comes my favorite part ... this is where the offended mental midget clicks the & quot ; Not Helpful & quot ; button ...	-1
It seems to me that each year no limit is coming out with worst and worst records . back in 94 when master p came out with The Ghettos Are tryin 2 kill me , all the tracks were bumpin . now when i listened to only god could judge me , all the songs seemed like r & amp ; b trassh quality except for & quot ; nobody move & quot ; which is only good becuase of skull duggery . If u want real music get true and ghettos are tryin 2 kill me	-1
Let me start off by saying that the cover art alone deserves 0 stars.How original ? Has anybody noticed how ridiculous all of these hip hop albums look.It is a well established fact that this loser stole all the beats on this record from others and he probably didnt even write the lame and ghetto lyrics on this cd.This guy claims to be a christian while singing only about thugs , cars , money and b*****s.Does anybody really think that this guy has a clue about real hard work or struggle.I think not.How intelligent do you have to be to say things like & quot ; we bout it , bout it & quot ; or & quot ; ugh , ugh , ugh & quot ; .Please dont buy anything from this sellout studio gangster and support real artists .	-1
this cd is the turn in no limits music , before beats by the pound , mostly all tracks were bumpin , but this cd had 5 good songs , because some where put on before being produced on by the pound . if u want real music , get ghettos are tryin 2 kill me and true	-1
This piece of ignorant trash single-handedly ruined rap music , misled a generation , and destroyed the hip hop culture . These five fakers exploited the pathology of ghetto culture that NONE of them really lived in , and brainwashed many impressionalbe young people ( many whom I 've mentored at my job ) who had no one else in their homes or hoods to teach them any better , into thinking that gang life , violence , and disrespecting women were cool ! Thanks , NWA , for making a bad situation worse while laughing all the way to the bank ! May hell be your next spot and may your CD 's be used for skeet shooting !	-1
The first two songs are amazing , the rest of the cd lags . I cant think of what else to write haha	-1
I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD . I expected this to be a soundtrack of songs played by NWA ( Northwest Airlines ) on their planes . Instead I heard a couple of guys whining about police and white people .	-1
Anyone who is n't familiar with this particular record might be surprised with what they hear . Much of the record has a disco-dance feel to it and it rarely uses the hard gangsta beats that would later make the group famous . There are really only 4 tracks worth your time and three of them are featured in remixes on better NWA albums ( Boyz N The Hood on & quot ; Eazy-Duz It & quot ; , 8-Ball and Dopeman on & quot ; Straight Outta Compton. & quot ; ) Unless you are a collector and need all of NWA 's material , avoid this particular album .	-1
I was pretty much dissapointed with this album , I just did not like many of the tracks , except for & quot ; once upon a time in the projects & quot ; and 2 or 3 others , this album really falls short . For some reason every one I talked to says this is his best album , I do n't know what they are thinking but I did not like this album one bit . In my opinion Cube 's best albums were after this one , but was at his best with NWA . Nothing on this album will impress you .	-1
The fact that Ice Cube left N.W.A to make trash like this only speaks about his crediblity . He should just stay acting and stay off the music buisness .	-1
This mess marks a low point in rap lyrics . While it is musically tight , the crude rants against Whites and Jews ( True to the Game ) women ( Nappy Dugout ) , Asians ( Black Korea ) and speeches from the late super-lunatic madman supreme Khallid Muhammad , one can hear Dr. Martin Luther King spinning in his grave in Atlanta . In 1959 , the good Dr. warned against Blacks & quot ; stooping to the low and primitive methods and rhetoric of our enemies & quot ; and this is it ! However , while Cube was supposedly all 'fight the power & quot ; and militant , he was also a spokesman for St. Ides Malt Liquor and songs like & quot ; Nappy Dugout & quot ; did nothing to uplift Black people . The fact is , this kind of garbage sold well among confused and misguided Black people ( and some equally maladjusted Whites ) with no direrction in the early 90s and when the market for such junk ( mercifully ) died out , Cube went back to gangster rapping . Hypocrisy or hatred , take your pick .	-1
& quot ; It was a good day & quot ; is the only song worth listening to more than one time . The rest of this album needs to be scrapped and then add some new tracks . Ice Cube needs to go back to NWA because his solo efforts are n't even worth listening to , let alone purchase .	-1
... have fun in prison you creep . I hope bubba gives you a Christmas gift all year around , while you 're in the shower with him . Enjoy your time in the big house , ya murdering little goon .	-1
When BTNH came out , they were still attached to Eazy-E and the only difference in the dumb NWA-style `` gangsta '' rap and theirs was the speed . This may be a `` classic '' rap album , but to make it onto a `` classic rap albums '' list , your CD has to be absolute trash , so I do n't like this one . The newer stuff is better .	-1
The Promise Ring are from my hometown of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . I really wanted to give this disc a higher rating for that reason alone ! However , this disc does not quite cut it for me . I own it , but rarely listen to it . In order to enjoy it I have to be in just the right sort of mood ; one that craves rather disjointed music that does n't really rise and fall at all , but just is . This is not a bad album . This is not a great album . It just sort of is . The first track is decent , but it does not go anywhere . The rest are rather forgetable . They all kind of run together . I enjoy some emo , but as others have said , I do n't really care too much for the lead vocalist . Again , he 's not bad , he 's not great . He just sort of exists and drones in the same manner on all tracks . I remain curious about `` 30 degrees everywhere '' . Perhaps that is a better disc . Hit and ( mostly ) miss . I might recommend checking out the little heard , now-defunct band BLOOMSDAY as an alternative to this album .	-1
This album reminds me of when , in the late 60s , Sammy Davis Jr. or Dean Martin would go on TV , wearing love beads and flowers , their hands dancing with faux LSD moves . It was so contrived , it was funny in the most unintentional ways . Several points arise:1-This is the worst Sgt . Pepperploxtation I know of . Neon Philharmonic take the worst psudo-psycadellia , and the worst soft rock mush , and put them together , making the horridness of the music actually grow expadentially.2-Everything here is over-the-top and brash . The strings , horns , and vocals are all interesting in theroy , but it is as if one of the Texes hicks in Easy Rider got a copy of Forever Changes and decided to cut a record in a very expensiVe drug store booth.3-The singer ca n't sing , and much worse , THINKS HE CAN ! But definately buy this . It is so bad , you need to have it , just for novalty value . ( I remember being at a party completely sober and rolling on the ground laughing at this . ) Everytime you buy a new CD of any genre , you 'll be able to take this out , knowing your new purchace will be comparatively better .	-1
Other than the genuinely great remix of Atomic by Diddy , the remixes here are highly forgetable . Most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck . Avoid .	-1
but I do n't like super smooth jazz like that . but I respect the fact that alot of people could like this . It 's good for what it is , boring guru-type rapping and super smoove jazz . if you like that , get this you should n't be disappointed	-1
I recently borrowed this CD from my local library . Whereas , Mr. Coltrane is a very talented saxaphone player , the songs ( and I use that term extremely loosely here ) are not very memorable to say the least . I can not understand for the life of me how one of the editorial comments can say that this work is focused . So many of tracks just fly off on wild instrumental breaks that you really wonder the mental state of Mr. Coltrane at the time . Iris and Stellar Regions are probably the most memorable tracks on this release . The keyboard work on these particular tracks nicely compliments some of Coltrane 's saxaphone soloing . However , there are times when the sounds from Mr. Coltrane are so disonant that it sounds like he is murdering the instrument . This is mostly for completists and die hard fans of this man .	-1
John Coltrane may be the most influential and important voice in jazz after Charlie Parker , but many of the concerts he gave 1965-67 , as well as the recording dates from that period , are not the way I prefer to remember him . Because of the success of truly great albums like Kind of Blue , Giant Steps , My Favorite Things , A Love Supreme , Impressions , and Transition , his concerts were sold-out events . But I recall that on three occasions the house was less than half full by the end of the concert . Alice had replaced McCoy , and John usually sought additional musical stimulus from the likes of Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders . These were less musical concerts than & quot ; happenings & quot ; during which the musicians would linger all night on a single & quot ; tune , & quot ; attempting to get beyond the strictures of musical form altogether in the quest for spiritual rapture . Unfortunately , the results , from the listeners ' vantage point , were frequently sonic mayhem and total boredom . But for many Coltrane disciples , especially inferior tenor players , this was the ultimate Coltrane , a license to abandon tonality and technique in the quest for & quot ; freedom. & quot ; Coltrane was one of the most recorded instrumentalists in the history of jazz , and 90 % of his output justifies his later canonization . But the same can not be said for efforts such as this late Vanguard date . Unlike the ever-vital & quot ; Live at Birdland & quot ; which preceded it , this album is a curious period piece unlikely to be played through more than once by most discerning listeners and musicians . Start with the aforementioned albums , and then work backward through the Prestige recordings , before giving this one a thought .	-1
Many serious Beck-o-philes refer to this disk as prime , unadulterated Beck . I think it has more to do with the fact that it 's a relatively rare record and they feel cool because they own it , but maybe not . I know people that say the less bells and whistles Beck sticks in his songs the better . But I like those bells and whistles ! I also think Beck is a very gifted songwriter , but there 's simply not much here that turned me on ! I do n't own it curently , but I 've heard it repeatedly and I just ca n't get into it . Sorry Beck-o-philes , but I 'll definately go for MELLOW GOLD , ODELAY , MUTATIONS and MIDNITE VULTURES , - not this .	-1
Disclaimer : Big time fans of The Sundays should not read this review since they obviously will not like it . This review is for casual listeners to give them an unbiased account of the music on the album . Thank you.For the rest of us , The Sundays sophomore album is largely a snoozefest of interchangeable songs . If you 've heard the band 's one big original hit , & quot ; Here is Where the Story Ends & quot ; from their debut album , you know the drill ; mid tempo accoustic rock augmented by Harriet Wheeler 's little girl voice . The problem is that the band rarely comes up with a good hook to give its songs vitality . It is no accident that by far the best performance here is the rousing cover version of The Stones ' & quot ; Wild Horses. & quot ; The sharpness of Jagger-Richards 's songwriting makes the rest of the material pale even more in comparison.Overall , a bland period piece with one cover track to at least partially redeem it .	-1
It would seem that Weezer 's recent track `` Beverly Hills '' is one of few I like from the group , for this album did n't really appeal to me at all . In many cases , especially for track # 9 ( Holiday ) , the lyrics are hugely lame , sometimes trying to fit the word `` anyway '' into one syllable , or choosing the topic of destroying sweaters . Despite this , I was able to mildly enjoy two tracks on this C.D. , one of them being `` Buddy Holly '' . This tune is a blend of hard guitars and a melody somewhat similar to Waltzing Matilda . Once again the lyrics are pretty uninteresting , but the progressions and all are fairly good . This song and many of the other tracks are actually very similar to The Ramones , for the chord progressions used are often simple , and when combined with the vocals have a very comparable feel . I would definitely not recommend Weezer 's blue album , for what this band is doing on it is n't all that exciting.Recommended tunes : Buddy HollyUndone- the Sweater Song	-1
I can remember owning this album when I was in high school , so even though I now can not stand Weezer in the least bit ( now being 26 ) , it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time . After all , at a younger age , most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated , right ? To stay on topic with this album , I can now honestly say that Weezer are just NOT a good band by any means . The guitar work is just lame , simple and sloppy , the drumming is lazy ( I have been playing drums myself for 12 years , so I WOULD know ) , the lyrics are cheesy at best , and Rivers Cuomo is just NO GOOD at all when it comes to conveying edge or emotion . If anything , he is just whiney.After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older , I stumbled upon A LOT of much better bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer , but who blow them to pieces in terms of the actual artistic value of their music , be it vocally , instrumentally AND lyrically . Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius , Symphony X , Kamelot , Sonata Arctica , to give but a few of so many examples . Those bands actually know how to be creative , complex , artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music , nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.On the flip side , however , I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways , and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager , I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned . After becoming a major fan of those bands , however , I can not help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon myself . It is just that I have developed to the point that I look for something much DEEPER than just a mere jolt of happiness when it comes to musical appreciation.All that being said , I have since tossed this album in the garbage , along with their Yellow-Green self-titled album , and now they are likely both laying to waste in a garbage dump . Look , I just had to be honest about all this , so please do not bash me . I am a former fan who has been there and done that , so DO NOT think for a second that I do n't know what I am talking about.Peace ! \m/\m/	-1
Weezer is one of those bands that is good for making hit singles . Every song that Weezer has ever released as a single has been pretty good or at least decent . I know Im gon na get told off for this one but Weezer is the like 90 's version of CCR . Rivers is a pretty decent guitar player , well when he tries anyways.This album has three songs that I like . I got this because of the song 'Buddy Holly ' I love that song , and its a really good song , not a searous song by any means but a pretty good song . 'The Sweater song ' is alright and 'Say It Aint So ' is the best song on the album because it is the one with the most supstance to it.All the songs on the album have pretty good guitar work like I said but its nothing to listen to repeatedly or anything but its worth getting for 'Buddy Holly ' and 'Say It Aint So ' wait never mind I still wouldnt recomend getting this album I would just say wait for Weezer to come out with a greatest hits or a best of .	-1
There 's a couple good tracks on here , but this is mostly dance music , so if you 're not at a `` rave '' under the influence of `` E '' , then this gets very tiresome very quickly .	-1
2 1/2The widely regarded lite-jazz fusion group excelled at smooth radio-friendly material but conversely produced a majority of slick , impersonal fare which can only serve its greater purpose cozied with irrelevant magazines and stale snacks . Enough material provides slight compositional insight to counteract vocal-driven bores .	-1
2 1/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai , and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room , unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies . The clue as for which tracks to avoid ? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding .	-1
I hate to be a wet blanket thrown over very warm reviews here , but this album does n't do much for me . It lacks the bounce and giddiness of the Jazz Samba album , the collaborative briliance of Getz/Gilberto , and the energy of Captain Marvel -- all albums that I have listened to repeatedly . This one , however , I have played only 2 or 3 times . What does it sound like ? It is Getz playing mostly to string accompaniment . One could call this Getz 's `` Sketches of Spain '' album . It sounds a bit like Getz playing a musical score for a film that you are not watching . For me , the melodies -- Getz 's strong point -- just are n't here . It is an earnest effort , to be sure , but it felt too much like noodling .	-1
Getz remains my favorite sax player , but Focus is perhaps one of the worst jazz albums I have ever heard . They claimthis was Getz'es favorite . Maybe so . Even in Donald L. Maggin 's Getz biography the author points this out : Focus was at the top of Stan 's list.Well , guess what ? It does n't rate , as far as this fan of jazz is concerned . Not only that , but my attitude is quite a bit of classical is unbearably bad and impossible to listen to.What 's wrong with Focus ? It comes across as jumbled movie music created by an overrated composer . No , am not talking about Stan 's playing , but the guy who wrote the `` score . `` It seems they atttempted to mix classical & jazz -- and it does n't gel , does n't work.My final take on this ? If somehow we could seperate Stan 's playing from what sounds like hoaky B movie music , then you might have something worth listening to.It 's hard to put down anything Getz had a hand in , but what can you do ? So many of Stan 's other CDs are so incredible ... and I refuse to praise something simply because `` professional '' critics tell me it 's great.Yes , it 's different -- I 'll give them that -- but praise it I ca n't .	-1
The two Sonnys `` bring it '' , but with each rapid-fire exchange of fours or every squealing high-note that Dizzy squeezes off during one of his solos , I just get a headache . Right off the bat , we get a vocal ( ! ) from Dizzy that makes Sun Ra sound like a great singer , and then the album launches into the buzzing maelstrom of the tenor battle . This is more of a stunt than great music . As for Sonny Rollins , he seemed to have had a strangely schizophrenic career at this time , recording lasting works of art for Prestige , Blue Note and Contemporary , and then crossing the street to do hysterical recordings like this ( or the Big Brass session ) for Verve . As for Dizzy , he 'd already made himself as irrelevant as Louis Armstrong at this point , riding his historical reputation ( and wasting his considerable chops ) through various all-star sessions . Maybe it would have been fun to see this particular tenor battle live -- Sonny Stitt is pretty impressive -- but , on record , this is a hard one to listen to all the way through to the end . It 's like sitting through a 40-minute commercial break during the old Johnny Carson show .	-1
I bought this on the strength of the reviews , but I 'm not happy . The bass is dominant throughout the entire cd , sometimes even pushing vocals to the background . I know some people really like a strong bass mix , but if you like more balance , you wo n't like this .	-1
`` Electr-O-Pura '' is one of those records that it seems like everyone likes more than I do -- it 's not that it 's a bad album per se , but certainly , I feel like Yo La Tengo had done ( Painful ) and would do ( I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One ) much better.My biggest complaint about the record is its penchant for a sameness of sound -- it 's a pretty dark record , full of moodiness , loops and downtempo sounds -- in fact , the record is completely dominated by these ( opener `` Decora '' , `` The Ballad of Red Buckets '' ) . None of them are terribly bad , though some ( `` Pablo and Andrea '' ) are more listenable than others ( the somewhat grating `` Paul is Dead '' ) . Having said that , right in the middle of all of this is a slice of pop heaven -- `` Tom Courtenay '' may be the best pop song in the band 's catalog , with a fantastic hook , chugging guitars , a great vocal and a superb feedback-drenched lead guitar.But like I said before , this is a record that a lot of folks rather like , so it may be something to check out -- there 's many records by Yo La Tengo I prefer to this one , but as deeper exploration of the band 's catalog ensues , this might be worth looking at .	-1
but there 's just no beauty in the words or melodies on this CD . It 's the first CD I 've picked up by Ani , and , I 'm disappointed to say , the last .	-1
I own Not A Pretty Girl , Dilate , and this album by Ani Difranco . While I thouroughly enjoy the first two -- Little Plastic Castle never pulled me in at all really . I 've given it numerous listens and still I do n't think it remotely compares to the other two albums I own by her . The only song that sticks out to me is & quot ; Gravel & quot ; and even that song I am having trouble recollecting exactly in my mind . I suggest the other two if you are a starting Ani fan . I must admit I 'm surprised by the overwhelming popularity of this one .	-1
2 1/2Overpraised as a staple of underground hip hop , Keith 's delivery of science-sexy nonsense can be entertaining but grew stale along with the 90 's beats .	-1
I mean what the fudge is this , you call this spit hip hop ... . I wasted my dollars . I am not feelin or have any comprehension for this style of dark , fake Dr. Funkinstein or whatever . I tried to have an open mind and listened a second time but I could not find a song title , track , beat , rhyme , flow or concept that I could get with and I am an openminded individual , trust .	-1
i liked iggin ' me but mainly because of El.Chico is a so-so singer and the music does n't change that much.he should do more up-tempo cuts.now on the other hand EL Debarge would have made this record a smash .	-1
i do n't get the 5 star reviews for this release ... . i mean the samples are good but the production value falls far short . the drum and bass aspects are simply just missing , he does n't have layers to his music , its very 2 dimentional and uninteresting . after listening to beats from dj 's the likes of bassnectar or stoupe or snowgoons ... .this guys is just sad . he weaseled 2 stars out of me for sheer content , but he lacks as far musical quality and drum and bass , its hard to groove to something when its lacking bass . there were a few tracks on this album that were showcased by other reviewers as being melodic and amazing , but when i heard them it sounded like a simple drum loop minus the bass ... .the beats just were n't complex enough . all the hype for this release and the buzz surrounding it is disappointing when you actually listen to it . this is why i usually do n't like to read reviews for something before listening to it ... .you get caught up in the reviews and expect something ground breaking , but after listening to it its just heart breaking . i urge you to try real beat makers : the prodigy ( fat of the land ) , Bassnectar ( Cozza frenzy ) , or even the snowgoons instrumentals ... .they will give you chills . shadow needs to work on his drum and bass aspects if he wants to be sucessful ... .thats my opinion .	-1
What is with jazz musicians naming their debuts egotistically anyway ? Mingus ' first major label album gets pegged as Pithecanthropus Erectus , which just screams `` I am artist , hear me roar ! '' Miles does Birth of the Cool ( that 's right , this is the birth of cool jazz ! Right here , baby ! ) , Ornette refers to his debut as Something Else ! ! ! , the ever-pretentious ( but still good ) Mahavishnu Orchestra have the Inner Mounting Flame , Monk 's got Brilliant Corners ( well it was for all intents and purposes his first LP , since it was preceded by a covers album and a collection of 45s ) , and Hancock 's is Takin ' Off , which implies he 's launching himself into the atmosphere or something . Hey guys , these are your debuts ! Try to be a bit less assuming ! Anyway , this is actually a fine album once you get down to it . At least if you 're listening to the right stuff . `` Watermelon Man '' is a good example - his first release , and he 's already experimenting with a rhythm that 's sure not traditional jazz . Of course he later had a hit with the remade Headhutners version , but let me tell you , this one 's better . Song rules either way , of course . Now the problem with Takin ' Off is that Hancock spends most of it milking the `` Watermelon Man '' groove for all it 's worth , which is why I only give Takin ' Off two stars , instead of the five it could 've gotten if everything was as good as `` Watermelon Man '' . He does make it work on `` Empty Pockets '' , but `` The Maze '' and `` Driftin ' '' just left me wondering whether or not he planned to expand . And is the ballad `` Alone and I '' a good one ? If you answered `` No '' , you just won today 's prize . So like all the stereotypical debuts built around a well-known song , it shows promise , but does n't achieve that promise . That would come later .	-1
I made the mistake of taking this album along to a cockfight at Vato 's last weekend . No , not that kind of cockfight , not that there 's anything wrong with that . Had I been feeling adventurous , I 'm sure everything would have gone fine , relatively speaking , until I had to go home to the missus and explain why I was walking with a pronounced limp and smelled like baby wipes.I was shocked to find that `` Back at the Chicken Shack '' is not at all as advertised . By the album cover , I thought the music would help Big Red perform better , what with the chicken shack in the background . I like to keep my prizefighter under wraps until it 's time to show the boys what I brought . But Vato and his buddies were disappointed . I do n't know if it was the sappy `` Fat Albert '' music that saturates this album or if Big Red just was n't up to performing that day . In any case , I 'm not invited back anymore and now I 'm not sure what to do with my little friend . Actually , he looks like he could use some exercise right now !	-1
... but I do like and own almost all of Miles Davis 's albums . I really do n't care for `` Birth of the Cool '' . The sound quality is great , the musicianship is excellent but it feels clinical and cold . Again , I am not an avid fan of jazz ; I do not have the background or education of a jazz fan , but the reason I have such a deep Miles collection is that his music , by and far , is very moving . Not this album . Though technically proficient `` Birth of the Cool '' does not have a mood or `` feel '' to it that I associate with Miles Davis . If you are not a big-time jazz fan per se I would not recommend this as a starting point for Miles Davis ; save it for the experts !	-1
I know this is contrary to what the reviewers are saying , but I did n't like the direction Sting took on this record . Most of the songs are slow , boring pop , with none of the jazz , raggae or new wave influences that made his earlier work interesting . The whole album is made very unpleasant by the chromatic harmonica that is laced troughout most of the songs . Maybe some people like the sound , but I found it to be awfully annoying.There are two good songs on this CD , but they are n't the two hits . If you think that the song & quot ; If Ever I Lose My Faith In You ' is a great song , then this is the CD for you . Most of the rest of the material is along those same lines . Otherwise , stick to the earlier ablum like & quot ; Dream of The Blue Turtles & quot ; .	-1
Sting 's first 3 albums were all amazing collections of well-written music with great production . His 4th , & quot ; Ten Summoners Tales & quot ; was still a catchy , if rather pedestrian album . Clearly aiming at the top 40 charts . This one , & quot ; Mercury Falling & quot ; ( read - interest falling ) , is an attempt to cash in on & quot ; Summoners ... & quot ; success ... it sounds forced . Nothing memorable here . Sting sounds bored . The only good thing I can say about it is that the production values are still high , but if the songs are n't there , what 's the point ? Total lackluster.It seems that el-Stingo wrote best when he was going thru emotional crises of some sort . Now he 's rich & amp ; contented , and obviously trying to remain that way by cashing in on his sucess & amp ; prostituting his writing skills . Maybe he should write only when truly inspired so he 's not wasting his time ( or ours ) .After a truly DULL concert on the & quot ; Summoners & quot ; tour and then this album , I 've lost my faith ...	-1
I have this on CD and mistakenly ordered it from Amazon Cloud I guess-I do n't need it three times ! Please reverse I will not pay !	-1
It is well known that every questionable restaurant in the English speaking world has a copy of this record . Indeed , certain commentators are known to judge the repute of a given restaurant on this single fact.For nothing , but nothing , is guaranteed to expel straggling punters into the chill night air than a blast of these hoarse mediterraneans shouting their way through a foreign language version of `` My Way '' . And if that does n't do the trick , Bamboleo surely will.It rids the kitchen of vermine and wards off vampires , too.Olly Buxton	-1
I was disappointed in this CD , looking for something more hardcore . Too much unison . After all , with a cover of & quot ; Volar & eacute ; & quot ; how intense is it gon na get ? Not to totally trash this CD . The singing is strong and a wall of sound from the acoustic guitars . Just not what I wanted .	-1
Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips 's debut 'The Indescribable Wow ' , an album I love so much I thought I 'd give 'Song Cycle ' a shot.What a feeerocious disappointment ! I 'd give it zero stars if I could , but amazon would n't let me ! My god , that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie ... `` The Laughing Gnome '' Bowie , that is ... I 've seen the word `` coy '' pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing , er , style , but I 'll go them all one better ... `` smug '' . All I hear in it is `` Ooh , I 'm so smart . What a clever lad am I . `` The arrangements or orchestrations , or whatever you call them are all pointless . It gives me the feeling that Van 's dad bought him an orchestra and said , `` Here , son , have fun . '' So young Van did ... without ever really learning how to use it properly . Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra ; check out his best album 'Sail Away ' . The arrangements are tasteful and , key word here , SPARE . He never clubs us over the head with them.The lyrics , if we can call them such , have no attachment whatsoever to the music ... . but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it 's to be expected.So , what we have is a trifecta of awfulness : bad voice , bad lyrics , and bad music.HOWEVER , he did make 'Song Cycle ' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow ' in 1988 ... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years , namely that arrangements are NOT songs ; they 're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener ... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that ...	-1
Wings specialty was the blandly innocuous ; the band was basically the Huey Lewis of the seventies , but without the sense of dumb fun . On this album , McCartney makes some stabs at Hard Rock , this makes it worse than the average Wings album , is it the worst one ever ? Perhaps , then again , who cares ?	-1
Before having cross-over appeal ( as a trio ) with `` Fire '' , `` Slow Hand '' , and the huge Pop hits `` Jump ( For My Love ) '' and `` I 'm So Excited '' , The Pointer Sisters - then , for the most part , a quartet - recorded in the 1970s on the Blue Thumb label.YES WE CAN : THE BEST OF THE BLUE THUMB RECORDINGS consists of 14 songs from 1972-1977 ; tracks are not in chronological order . Disc packaged in black jewel case ; total running time : 75:27 . Booklet includes an essay by David Nathan , a couple uncaptioned b & w ; photos , and limited track information ( songwriting and release years are provided ; not provided are albums of origin , recording information , musician personnel , chart positions , etc. ) . Sound quality is excellent.The songs , taken from their four Blue Thumb albums ( 1973 's `` The Pointer Sisters '' , 1974 's `` That 's A-Plenty '' , 1975 's `` Steppin ' '' , and 1977 's `` Having a Party '' ) and a soundtrack contribution , range from Blues to R & B ; to Jazz , and includes `` Fairytales '' , the song for which they won the 1974 Grammy award for `` Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group '' .Here is a track listing , with Titles , [ year ] , music description , ( time ) , and my 0-5 star rating:01 . Yes We Can [ 1973 ] mid-tempo R & B ; ( 6:02 ) ***302 . Wang Dang Doodle [ 1973 ] up-tempo Blues ( 3:56 ) ***303 . Fairytales [ 1974 ] Country ballad ( 3:03 ) zero04 . Going Down Slowly [ 1975 ] up-tempo funky R & B ; ( 7:52 ) ****405 . How Long ( Betcha ' Got a Chick on the Side ) [ 1975 ] mid-tempo R & B ; ( 7:22 ) *****506 . You Got ta Believe ( from the film `` Car Wash '' ) [ 1976 ] up-tempo R & B ; ( 2:53 ) ****407 . Cloudburst [ 1973 ] up-tempo bebop Jazz ( 3:10 ) *108 . Jada [ 1973 ] slow-tempo Jazz ( 4:41 ) *109 . Black Coffee [ 1974 ] Jazz ballad ( 6:07 ) **210 . Steam Heat [ 1974 ] showtune from `` The Pajama Game '' ( 5:40 ) zero11 . Salt Peanuts [ 1974 ] up-tempo bebop Jazz ( 5:10 ) *112 . Having a Party [ 1977 ] up-tempo R & B ; ( 4:34 ) **213 . Love in Them There Hills [ 1974 ] mid-tempo R & B ; ( 8:31 ) ***314 . Do n't It Drive You Crazy [ 1977 ] slow-tempo R & B ; ( 6:18 ) ***3While the collection only includes 14 songs , it totals over 75 minutes of music because several of the songs are over 7 minutes long . Their vocals and harmonies are great , especially on Gamble/Huff 's `` Love in Them There Hills '' , where they do some Sweet Honey in the Rock-like vocalizations . Another great song is `` You Got ta Believe '' , the song they sing as the `` Wilson Sisters '' - singing church ladies to Richard Pryor 's preachin ' pimp character in `` Car Wash '' . There rendition of `` Wang Dang Doodle '' , the Willie Dixon song made popular by his protege Koko Taylor in the 1960s.This is a great CD , if only for `` You Got ta Believe '' and the songs the precede it , `` Going Down Slowly '' and `` How Long ( Betcha ' Got a Chick on the Side ) '' - the latter being the inspiration for Salt-N-Pepa 's `` Chick on the Side '' in 1988 . The Pointer Sisters ' original line-up was June , Ruth , Anita , and Bonnie ; June left the group for a time for persona reasons ( after their third album ) , but rejoined the group when Bonnie left to pursue a solo career.The music here is very eclectic . The Country song ( track 2 ) and showtune ( 10 ) seem out of place , but do demonstrate that eclecticism . And while the booklet is lacking , most of the music included is very enjoyable .	-1
This is Camel 's tenth studio album . It is the second one that is truly a solo project by Andy Lattimer . It is 42 minutes long.This CD sounds just like an Alan Parsons album . It has the same feel , structure , quality and style . With Chris Rainbow on vocals on Cloak and Dagger , this song could have easily been on Parsons ' Eye In the Sky.If you like everything that Alan Parsons has done , then you will love this album . I like many of Alan Parsons ' CD 's but did not care for the more commercial ones like Eye In the Sky or Turn of A Friendly Card . Stationary Traveler is like Parsons at his commercial worst , looking for a hit.This is n't a horrible album like Camel 's previous album , Single Factor . It does n't have any really bad tracks on it . And like all Camel albums , there are some really nice guitar parts from Lattimer . It just does n't have any that really stands out . I would rate it around three stars . If I lost it , I would n't bother to replace it.This is really a solo effort from Lattimer . He plays most of the instruments on most of the songs . Mel Collins does add in some nice sax parts .	-1
There was a lot I wanted to like about a-ha 's Scoundrel Days . It was a follow-up album to an absolutely sensational album in `` Hunting High and Low '' . My expectations remained high once I got the CD - it had a beautiful almost `` scandinavian feel '' with shades of blue and green making for a mountain and ocean-like feel . Not only that as I started playing the first song I was very impressed , but then after that I was completely shocked - the CD becomes a major letdown as there really is n't much that follows this . The question becomes `` what went wrong '' ? The first song is the title track & quot ; Scoundrel Days & quot ; . The formula is the same as from & quot ; Hunting High and Low & quot ; , some great Pl Waaktaar songwriting using the power of lead singer 's Morten Harket 's voice . In fact this song is as good as any by a-ha . The second song is solid as well & quot ; The Swing of Things & quot ; kind of reminds me of & quot ; Train of Thought & quot ; from the first album . But as the album progesses , it is clear to me that this sophomore effort might have been rushed a bit . The success of the first album might have rushed a follow-up only a year later . The big problem is that the songs just do n't have that & quot ; something special & quot ; like the first album . The only other song that is up there is & quot ; Maybe Maybe & quot ; . Harket 's vocals do soar in this song - the problem is its only a 2 minute song , but this was a Mags song - not a Pl Waaktaar song . Waaktaar is a much better songwriter.While Morten Harket really did a great job on & quot ; Hunting High and Low & quot ; , I do n't think Harket could elevate the tracks on & quot ; Scoundrel Days & quot ; . The funny thing is that Alan Tarney is the album 's main producer . Tarney produced the two big hits on & quot ; Hunting High and Low & quot ; which were & quot ; Take on Me & quot ; and & quot ; The Sun Always Shines on TV & quot ; ( Tony Mansfield produced the bulk ) . Tarney knew what a gem he had in Morten Harket 's voice , so I 'm questioning a lot of what he was doing with many of the songs on the album . To me a song like & quot ; October & quot ; does n't provide the forum for Harket to use that great voice . & quot ; Manhattan Skyline & quot ; to me seems a bit labored by Morten and the group . On & quot ; Cry Wolf & quot ; , I also think that Morten could have done much more with his voice . . I do like & quot ; We 're Looking for the Whales & quot ; because it was a different type of a-ha song - its a pop song like & quot ; Take On Me & quot ; , but a little more catchy - but again Harket 's dynamic vocals just do n't do much here.The liner notes do contain all of the lyrics and all of the credits , so that is a plus.I think die-hard a-ha fans will like this album , but the average fan will probably have this on their shelf more . I loved & quot ; Hunting High and Low & quot ; , but saw a tail off on this album . By commercial standards this album did n't do well in the U.S. and is probably the reason why a-ha is categorized ( unfairly ) as a one hit wonder . If you manage to get this album at a good price , you will be treated to the three good songs I mention above , but otherwise you 'll probably overpay for what is n't a great body of work .	-1
This cd is ok plain and simple hes definently had way better than this . All eyez on me is definently a 5 star pick that up and get strictly for my niggaz that bangin too but this nahh jus not fellin it .	-1
I dug His Anger about The Problems Facing Brothers & amp ; All but the Music was Super Wack.and the only Gem is Brenda 's Got A Baby.He Would Get Better with the Music & amp ; the Words.but this Album Compared To Ice Cube 's Amerikkka 's Most Wanted is Tame.he was going for the same vibe & amp ; results but he comes up empty except for Brenda 's .	-1
I know a lot of you might say this album is hot or classic because it 's Tupac but you have to be real with yourself . This album is one of his weakest . Brenda 's Got a Baby is the only great track on this album . Nas , Jay , and Biggie all dropped classics on their debut but it took Pac 4 albums to finally get there . He 's a legend no doubt , but just because you love Pac do n't lie to yourself and say this album is great . Though Pac did n't do too well on this album , it is nice to see that he was trying to rap way back in '93 . Once the east/west war started though , that 's when he finally got popular and started making decent music . RIP Tupac .	-1
Scarface is without doubt one of the greatest emcees ever ( no-one could write sicker rhymes than him ) , but this album is just terrible . The production is pretty dull on most cuts , and there are way too many guests . & quot ; Sleepin In My Nikes & quot ; ( with the late Seagram ) is pretty nice though . A cut that could 've been good is & quot ; Homies And Thuggs & quot ; ( with a raw verse from the late Tupac Shakur ) , but it 's ruined by Master P 's UUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHH 's . Do n't waste your money on this . Scarface 's three other albums are much better .	-1
What is up with all the glowing reviews people are giving this disc ? ` mezzanine ' marked the end of my love affair for massive attack and I 've never looked back . I 'm not even remotely curious about their latest release 100th window . From what I 've heard it 's not even the full line up anymore. ` angel ' is a grating , irritating and annoying track . Just because it 's been used in countless films and commercials does not make it amazing . I 'm just not `` getting '' the attraction to that song . The only tracks that make this disc worthwhile are the beautiful collaborations with liz fraser of cocteau twins . Liz 's voice is beautifully complimented by slow , dark crackling beats on ` teardrop ' , ` black milk ' and the first half of ` group four ' . Unfortunately the second half of ` group four ' falls back into the annoying elements that made ` angel ' such an awful track . I wish someone would do trip-hop remixes of cocteau twin songs or liz would come out with her own disc of triphop dreaminess . She could be the reigning queen of triphop and put this sub par disc to shame . The only other worthwhile track is the oppressive darkness of ` man next door ' . Horace Andy 's depressing vocals , the dark mood of the track and the sample of the cure 's ` 10:15 On A Saturday Night ' make this another track to check out.Outside of that ` mezzanine ' is pure unfocused garbage . If you have n't already , checkout ` protection ' . The title track alone is goose bump inducing . Who can resist Tracy Thorn 's voice ? Throw in Tricky , Nicolette and Horace you have a masterpiece . ` mezzanine ' is far from that .	-1
Teardrop , with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser , is the standout track - unfortunately the rest does n't quite measure up . Do n't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very `` listenable '' album , something that works well playing in the background at night ( some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits ) . It 's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead .	-1
The first album I thought was their best work . This album is just pitiful . & quot ; Bustin Back & quot ; just shows how badd they are . All they talk about is shootin Bone and smokin . The beat is good and all but the song is pitiful . A third of the time , they 're just mumbling . Listenin to the first one on the mic , at one part it sound like he just making noise . C'mon . To be honest to you , I think they 're trying to be like Bone . They should just change their style . Bone do n't got time to be dealing with Do or Die right now . & quot ; Pimpology & quot ; was my jam . It had an ok beat and it was chillin . & quot ; Still Po Pimpin & quot ; is n't better than the first one . But it was aight . Overall , this album is trash . Do n't get it . Lucky for me , my cousin got all three of them instead of me . If you see this album in stores just walk away from it .	-1
This album gets 2 stars because it has a few DECENT ( I dare not say good ) songs on it , but for the most part , it 's just pansy beats with pitiful rapping and poor attempts at singing . Do or Die has nothing to offer ; they just want to show up Bone Thugs and after listening to what is supposedly their best album , it 's quite obvious why they have n't .	-1
Shellac is a GREAT live band . On record , they just do n't translate ! The folks out there who give this 5 stars , are just Albini A** kissers , is all ! ANYTHING after Big Black & Rapeman , except for 10 songs , ( see At Action Park review ) is absolute crap . The only good one on this waste of vinyl is `` Copper '' -- Hang it up , Albini , just stick to playing live , with no more recordings . & you 'll gain the most unique `` indie cred '' anyone could ever enjoy !	-1
I only liked one song , Invisible Man . The rest of this album is a bunch of mediocre to flat songs , from the lame , bland Dane Deviller and Sean Hosein ballads to the ones that Montell Jordan and a just starting Mario Winans contributed . Only Nick Lachey is the best singer out of this group and Jeff Timmons and Drew Lachey did n't sound good here . Their '98 album was much better than this fluff . It has an R & B feel , but the group does n't know how to pull it off ! They would have easily been forgotten if they had made another half baked effort like this one !	-1
... .Frankly , I dont know what everyones talking about . This did n't strike me as anything special . I certainly dont think its worth making/buying this single . If this was on a full album it 'd be a song I 'd always skip . Although both Meth and Mary are talented , I would n't recommend this album .	-1
Cappadonna - The Pillage ( Epic Street , 1998 ) Talk about taking the wind out of a sail . When Cappuchino first appeared on Raekwon 's & quot ; Ice Cream & quot ; ( & quot ; Thirsty for my catalog , baby/Shopping spree of lovin ' & quot ; ) and especially & quot ; Winter Warz & quot ; from the & quot ; Do n't Be a Menace While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood & quot ; soundtrack , everyone was calling him the next big thing . Unfortunately , he changed his name to Cappadonna for some reason , his straightforward sharp verses turned into lazy phrases that sometimes did n't even rhyme . He expressed that skill on this album which makes it a pain to listen to . The Primo-esque dope beat on & quot ; Everything is Everything & quot ; is wasted due to Donna 's weak delivery , and & quot ; Pump Yo Fist & quot ; is just plain wack . He does show promise , though , on the title track and & quot ; Check for a N***a & quot ; . But , as with all post-1997 Wu-Tang projects , without RZA producing everything , this album is a rather disappointing listen . Cappa would never return to form ; his second album flopped and the compilation , Cappadonna Hits , was proof that he would eventually be dropped from the label . He severed ties with the Wu and is now concentrating on his wife and triplets . -EJR	-1
I really thought this album was gon na be tight , but after the first few songs it gets boring . When I listen to this album in the car only two tracks get play after that I 'm popping in another CD . After 3 plays in my car I was bored of this CD and never played it again .	-1
Cappa had mad promise from his dope , dope verses on different Wu projects ( Winter Warz ... DAMN ! ) But his performance on this and on & quot ; Wu Tang Forever & quot ; prove that he ai n't really that dope . Their are a few dope tracks on this like & quot ; Black Boy , & quot ; & quot ; Everything Is Everything , & quot ; & quot ; Splish Splash , & quot ; and a few others . This is where most people realized that everything with a & quot ; W & quot ; on it was not exactly bound to be dope . Cappa does n't have the power as an MC to carry an album himself .	-1
OKay rza did his job as far as the beats on diz album ? Classic but the lirycs ? Awfull ... I got diz only enjoy the beats but cappa is horrible @ rhyming . Skip & copy gza 's liquid swords or ghost 's ironmman ...	-1
Jerry Cantrell 's first solo album makes a good effort , but unfortunately I was dissappointed with it . The record starts out ok with the first 3 songs , & quot ; My Song & quot ; being my favorite , but then it seems to just fall down from there . All the songs on this record are plainer and of a more lighter mood then that of Alice in chains ( Cantrell 's previous band ) , but without Layne Staley there to offer those dark moody lyrics , I just felt something missing . This is not to say that Cantrell is nothing without Staley . Cantrell is one of the greater songwriters of our time as he can still write great guitar music without always having to rely on melodic vocals . It 's just that the songs one this album do n't ever really get you on your feet , they just seem to cruise along.Another thing I was GREATLY disappointed over were the lack of Cantrell 's guitar solo 's he was so magnificent on for Alice in chain records . I swear this guy can thrash grunge solo 's like no one else , but of course this record is n't a grunge record , and there are hardly any solo 's ( if any that I can remember ) on this one.If you are an Alice in Chains fan like myself , I would n't go buying this expecting to hear more of that dark , thrashing rough heavy blues guitar style of music , it 's not gon na happen . Borrow it from a friend , download some stuff , buy it used , just do n't spend full price on this one , it 's not worth it . I heard Cantrell 's second solo album was a good improvement , so I 'll give that one a try , and so should you .	-1
Esthero has a devoted following . Many people claim to be fans of her music . I am not one of them . I first got her second album , `` Wikked Lil Grrrls '' , after seeing her perform on `` Jimmy Kimmel Live '' . I was not impressed by the album - I guess I was expecting her to be more like Jazz-fusion singer Lina . But I read that her first album was actually superior . So I got it and ... I do n't get it . I do n't get what the fuss is about.BREATH FROM ANOTHER consists of 11 tracks , comprised of 10 songs , an instrumental interlude ( track 6 , `` Flipper Overture '' ) , and a `` hidden '' bonus instrumental track heard after `` Swallow Me '' and then five minutes of silence ( track 11 ) . Booklet includes some track information , no lyrics , and a couple artistic photos.The music is mellow and dreamy trip-hop . Some of it is good mood music ; some is borderline annoying ( The clanking bell on `` That Girl '' is jarring ) . Her vocals are nothing noteworthy ; I 'd describe her voice as Bjork without the quirkiness . I wanted to like her , but in the end I think Esthero is just overrated .	-1
Total gibberish from this band . They must of had to much fried chicken	-1
i am not sure what it is but after BFP i think tori is cranking out the same old same old . her style has NOT chnaged at all and this album just added to the mix of mediocrity . her best work remains her 1st album LITTLE EARTHQUAKES . everything after that is ok but her magic is gone and the quality get worse with each album . if you want some vintage tori see also the CRUCIFY EP	-1
Being a Tori Fan since her first solo album & quot ; Little Earthquakes & quot ; I have collected her albums and singles since what seems the beginning of time . When & quot ; The Choirgirl Hotel & quot ; was relesed , I heard parts and I was confused . Was this the girl with her piano anymore ? No . She 's more than that now . Sure , it still has that Tori touch , but it does n't seem to have the feeling in it anymore . Is this Y Kant Tori Read all over again ? I will have to admit , I did listen to it for a while . They almost sound like her remix extras on her singles . Sure , they 're a novelty , but after a while , you get sick of it . That is how I view this album . You listen to it , and then it will be like the rest of those CD 's sitting on your rack . You can say you have it , but it will more than likely just collect dust .	-1
No offense Pun , but you were just too fat and sucky that you got a heart attack & died ! The only good soong on her is Twinz & that iznt even my type of rap song ! Buy Yeeah Baby instead , it still sucks a little but ittl grow !	-1
What has the rap world gone to ? I am a big rap fan and I own like , Snoop Dogg , Method Man , Master P , Dr. Dre , etc. , and this is just terrible . I own this cd . It sucks . That 's just the way it is . The only good songs on there are Beware , Still not a Player , and Punish Me . The rest is just ... trash . I do n't like it one bit . Do n't buy it .	-1
I 've heard Big Pun as a guest artist on a few cuts and have liked those cuts very much but I was extermely disappointed with Capital Punishment . All I can say is that it 's standard fare from today 's group of rappers.Hopefully his future efforts will be more musically engaging .	-1
I dug Still Not a Player but the Music & amp ; the vibe did n't really hit home.but Pun was A Cool Cat.he deserved better Material than the stuff he got.Maybe given sometime down the Line His Stuff Might have Gotten Better but this Album & amp ; His Last One are Typical Industry Projects.He had some flow but the overall Feel goes Nowhere .	-1
Not a lot to say here . This CD is Okay and that is about all .	-1
My enjoyment of old Hooverphonic lead me to recommendations of Mono . However , at close listen Formica Blues proved to be too mediocre to enter my collection . Most songs sound too contrived to float , and ( yawn ) I was n't impressed with the inarticulate composition nor musicianship . Their fleeting glimpse of aural brilliance and fame on `` Life in Mono '' is available on single , so I happily purchased that instead .	-1
Mono adds a eurotrash element to their cliched chick vocaled electronica , there ai n't nothing exciting here , go buy another Portishead album instead .	-1
In the mighty history of rock music and all its joys and glories , there has never been any-one as completely out of touch and hapless as Gary Numan.Fat and futile , Numan represents in a single human form , everything that 's wrong , and ever has been wrong with popular music . Clunk-headed and entirely cretinous ( whether crashing his plane in India and getting arrested for spying , or marrying his stalker ) , he is a career loser . Lacking soul , warmth or even - God help us - humanity , his miserable drones reveal better than any review the true depths of defeat and hopelessness he plumbs.His contemporaries thrashed him outta sight : OMD , Eyeless in Gaza , Trio , even gimpy cruds like Blancmange kicked his rump effortlessly - but then they all had tunes , a modicum of self-effacement and were n't solemnly and indignantly pretending they were 'futuristic'.Futuristic ! ? This stuff set music back 20 years - it was as if punk had never happened . Dressed in what looked like a DS9 leisure suit and with a voice so nasal it made Kenneth Williams sound like James Earl Jones , Gazza went on and on and on ... . croaking incessantly about sub-Arthur C Clarke themes like alienation in ( gulp ! ) the 'modern ' world ; dehumanising mechanization ; space ( the final frontier etc.. not the stuff between his ears ! ) ; bio-chemistry and the like - you get the picture.Write down the most boring , nerdy topics you can think of and within an hour you 'll have a pretty comprehensive and astute summation of 'The Pleasure Principle'.Ever the space-cadet with the intellectual capacity of a weather-balloon , Gazza would have us believe he 's some kind of proto-new wave Mr Spock , but in reality , he 's more aligned with Kowalski out of 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea ' ; bashed with a spanner every week but relentlessly returning to stupidly get bashed again.You can be too serious about this electro stuff . It had a bad rep as cloying and un-emotive , but others managed it ok . It was only Gazza who made himself a Holy Show with his Billy Idol snarl and short-circuited robo-dancing.Begrudgingly ; 'Complex ' has the foetus of a good tune , soon lasered away by the unnecessarily brutal 'Metal ' ; smothered to death by Gazza 's parachute in the guise of the hideous 'Random ' and wait 'til you hear the live version of 'Me , I Disconnect From You ' - a fun-packed extravaganza of doom and horror guaranteed to forever shift your aunt ( y'know , the rich one , the one leaving all her money to the Battersea Dogs Home and none to you ! ) when she decides to descend on your parlour , tea , and scones.Get those samples going , you do n't need to hear the full album to experience the despondency and it 's saying something when your brave-heart reviewer had to physically stop his ears oscillating , such was the feeling of discomfort and unease brought about by a cover version of 'On Broadway ' - the final cankerous catastrophe.This review could apply to any of Gary Numan 's albums as they 're all as bad as each other .	-1
Jay Z is the real entertainer as we know ... he is on the cover and is the promoter here . He shines when he is on the mic , but the others do get showcased being connected with him .	-1
The only reason people like him is because he screams . He is the wackest MC ever , probabaly . And he has no talent at all . Have you ever heard him rap when he dose n't scream ? He sounds wac as hell in 14 of the songs . The only good song is Ruff Ryders ' Anthem . If you think DMX is the best east coast rapper , then You do n't know nothing about rap . The only good rapper in Ruff Ryders in Drag-On .	-1
He 's oppressed ! Our president oppresses him . So oppressed he abuses defenseless animals.If you must listen download for free . Do n't make this guy an even richer role model .	-1
it is and WAS garbage . i do n't know how this guy blew up . i 'm thinking it 's cause pac had just died and dmx was as close as we were gon na get . i mean looking back x had no talent to begin with . he was just a character . barking on records and shooting people . but he prayed at the end of every record which confused me cause he killed half of the united states on this one album but ended the album like he was a religious man . for some reason he got annoyed when questioned about his comparisons to tupac and even disrespected tupac while he should have been honored because x has no lyrical talent and any song he was on was terrible unless he had a good beat to carry him . do n't get me wrong , x played that dog gimmick well and it showed by him having 5 # 1 albums in a row but if you think about it x is forgetten and nobody EVER mentions dmx as one of the greatest in hip-hop . he is and example of how you can have minimum talent and still make it in the hip-hop game today.image seems to be more important than talent.he 's no pac , big , pun , big l or nas . put him in the `` good character '' section with fifty cent .	-1
ILL beats . DECENT rhymes . DMX does n't really have much to say . how many times can a person say where my dogs at ? IN all this album is ILL if you like partying , but it showed not a bit of insight.For those of you who like to listen to versitile rap , DMX is NOT your man . ON this album he talks about the same thing every other rapper does , weed , sex , killing ( of course he has a couple of tracks where he tries to come off like a decent man ) .BEWARE ! When you first hear the album you will be enticed by the ILL beats-this is what happened to me . I copped the album from a friend , took it home , played it and then realized that the brother had no REAL lyrical skills-it was strickly beats . I give DMX props in that area because without the beats , he 's pretty much outdone by REAL rhymers such as CANIBUS , RAKIM , NAS , etc.peacemic-12	-1
Man , whoever wrote that this was the best hip-hop album of all time was trippin HARD ... what were they listening to ? After the 3rd track , I was getting sick and tired of DMX yelling out & quot ; dog , & quot ; & quot ; ruff ruff , & quot ; & quot ; yeah , & quot ; and & quot ; uhh & quot ; ; this is n't even close to good music . If you ask me , DMX 's lyrics are weak ( especially with his obsession over the word 'dog ' ) , and his beats are the usual Ruff Ryder style ... WACK . I do n't respect DMX at all and this album was almost as disgraceful as all the CASH MONEY records . Trust me , this album is getting WAY TOO MUCH exposure , and it does n't deserve it .	-1
My 10-year cousen loves this CD . I had never even heard of DMX ( And still do n't find to many people who have ) so when he poped this into his CD player and was enjoying this music so much I was worried . This guy does nothing but curse , and put down blacks ( No , I 'm not a black ) , and talks about people and the world VERY BADLY ! ! ! Right now I 'm praying for who ever likes this CD and thinks it 's great . Oh dear Lord please help us all .	-1
Do n't give your hard earned cash to this creep . DMX has been busted twice for animal cruelty . He 's a weazel .	-1
I should know better by now than to buy a whole album on the strength of a single song , but apparently it 's going to take more hard lessons like this one to really grind that point home for me . I fell in love with Anggun 's version of the song `` Snow On The Sahara '' and found myself frustrated by my inability to download it on iTunes , unless I bought the entire album . The only single version they had was a cover by Sarah Brightman , which was great ( Hey , it 's Sarah Brightman , so it 's not like it 's gon na suck , right ? ) but definitely not the same.Finally , I swallowed my pride and forked over the ten bucks , hoping against hope that the rest of the CD would live up to the promise of that song . In brief : it does n't . The only song on here that even approaches the haunting beauty of `` Snow On The Sahara '' is `` On The Breath Of An Angel '' .I definitely regret this purchase . The music just is n't for me .	-1
Bell Biv DeVoe half or spin-off of the group New Edition drop fall short with second release . Nothing close to Poison , so do n't be surprised . Nothing on here seems to hold my attention either . The only reason I gave it a one star is because of tracks 9 and 10 . Both `` Something In Your Eyes '' written by the great Babyface and `` Please Come Back '' are slow jams that you can play continiously over and over again .	-1
just like Poison this disc has a few ok songs but pretty much forgettable.SOmething in your eyes is the cut but overall this is very average.catchy at the time but nothing worth getting.wait for New Edition .	-1
Hootie Mack was the second studio LP from Bell Biv DeVoe . Circa 1989 - 90 , the alumni of New Edition ( including Bobby Brown , Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant ) began a hot streak of solo ( and in BBD 's case , spinoff-group ) hits . BBD 's debut LP Poison was multi-platinum and yielded several substantive chart hits , including at the crossover level . By working with a combination of hip-hop friendly producers , BBD crafted a hybrid hip-hop/R & B ; sound that fit in perfectly with the nascent new jack swing movement in urban music.Hootie Mack attempted to recreate the formula , but with mixed results . Strangely , none of the original collaborators on the Poison LP ( Hank Shocklee , Elliot `` Freeze '' Straite , Timmy Gatling ) were found here . Early lead single `` Gangsta '' ( which attempted to build buzz in late '92 ) failed to make the final cut of the album 's 11 songs ( cassette purchasers at the time had to settle for 10 ) . The LP lead-off song here is `` Nickel '' , a pro-pot ode that owed something to the then-recent success of folks like Cypress Hill , Redman and Dr. Dre . The basketball-themed `` Above the Rim '' was a nice up-tempo number , but not quite in `` Poison '' territory.In fact , none of the songs here are . `` Ghetto Booty '' was a thematic sibling to Sir Mix-a-Lot 's `` Baby Got Back '' ; `` Straight from the Back '' is a barely-coded paean to Kama Sutra sensibilities . Not that it makes them bad records , per se , but on the previous album the guys limited the horn-dog carrying on to `` Do Me '' . Unchecked libido is definitely the driving lyrical force on this album.It is perhaps ironic , then , that the biggest hit here ended up being the more subdued-in-comparison ballad `` Something in Your Eyes '' ( penned and produced by Babyface . ) It 's a touching nod , as is `` The Situation '' , which offers the story of a former after-concert `` conquest '' showing up a few years later with child in tow . But those moments are fleeting on `` Hootie Mack . `` By the time of this LP 's release in 1993 , the floodgates had been opened with a glut of R & B ; vocal acts that followed in the wake of BBD ( including BBD prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; s Boyz II Men ) and while 1993 was a record year for R & B ; singles hitting the pop top 10 , `` Hootie Mack '' only barely went gold , a sharp drop from the sales heights of `` Poison '' .Despite its faults , `` Hootie Mack '' is a decent time-capsule for urban music of the time . Enthusiasts of early 90s R & B ; or New Edition completists may cop this on reflex , but the uninitiated should definitely cop `` Poison '' first .	-1

Embarrassing , ludicrous junk . Although I was n't expecting much , I was still bowled over by the sheer , consistent , seemingly deliberate lack of musicality of every track . Like Julian ( who could at least sing ! ) , Sean Lennon is destined for the bargain bins , at best . Worst album of the year .	-1
With 1997 releases like Ghetto D , Charge It 2 Da Game and Unpredictable , No Limit was being hailed as one of the dopest record labels around . Back then it seemed like nobody had more fury than Mystikal , nobody could tongue-twist a verse better than Silkk the Shocker , and you just could n't TOUCH Mia X . But after a while people started to realize that all the No Limit albums pretty much sounded the same , but at least they were still pretty good . Master P seemed to be on top of the world , so he decided to give the people what they wanted : a double dose of him and his crew ; also , he announced that this would be his last solo album . But would MP Da Last Don be the album to keep No Limit Records on top of their game ? The answer is no . Even diehard No Limit fans knew that after one listen of this two-disc set . The album is filled with mostly overused ideas , and even though P was never really an impressive lyricist , the lyrics still seem watered-down after the Ghetto D phenomenon . In fact , there are only two songs really worth listening to on the whole set : `` Soldiers , Riders , and G 's '' and `` Snitches '' . Both songs feature Snoop Dogg ( who was new to the label ) , and he rips up those songs so well that you do n't even care about the lyrics that P and the other guest stars spit . `` Make ` Em Say Ugh 2 '' is okay ( though the skit was hilarious ) , and `` Thug Girl '' was pretty good , but nothing else really stands out . There is an obligatory `` Is There A Heaven For A Gangsta '' -esque song ( `` Goodbye To My Homies '' ) , and `` Thinkin ' Bout U '' featured Mia X doing some off-key singing over off-key piano licks.After this lackluster album , Master P decided he was n't going to retire after all , but I 'm not sure if anyone cared . Because no one rushed to the store to buy Silkk the Shocker 's Made Man , Mercedes ' Rear End ( sorry to remind you of that ) , or even Mystikal 's Ghetto Fabulous . I guess it 's true what they say : what goes up must come down .	-1
There is 2 CDs so you know that will be and issue wich it is.It has 29 songs on it and has some guest apearences and also hasyour typical what you get on a Master P album feel to it.Lyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 3/10 Style 7/10 Voice 7/10Music 5/10 Innovative 4/10 Classic 2/10 guest 8/10 Blends 6/10Overall=55 wich is good for its 2.5 Mic rating that it getsMaster P fans it is and Ok buy no buy anyone else .	-1
My main problem with Mr. P ( aside from the fact that every one of his songs & quot ; Features & quot ; somebody else ) is the unbelievable sense of him repeating himself after every dang song . There is NOTHING in this whole album that we have n't heard before , so why bother spending TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS for it ! The problem with rap is that today all these kids are stealing one hook from one piece of music ( & quot ; Sampling & quot ; if you will ) from the seventies and eighties . Sooooo ... what 's a rapper to do ten years from now when everybody 's sampling music from the nineties ? It 'll still be the music of the seventies and eighties ! Sampling worked in stuff like & quot ; Paul 's Boutique & quot ; because that had so many of them that it did n't exploit just one particular hook . Ever heard Will Smith 's new song & quot ; Willennium & quot ; . Okay . Will knows that all he has to do to make a hit record is sample nice melody from an old song no teenagers have ever heard before ( in this case & quot ; Rock the Casbah & quot ; by The Clash ) , loop it , and then rap over and then BOOM ! He 'll make a million dollars ! Anyway , this album sucks . We 've heard it all before . How many damn 2Pac or Biggie tributes do we need ?	-1
i wish they didnt make into a double cd , cuz if i got 2 choose which 1 i would take , i would definately take disc 1 , becuase sum of the songs have a hint of good west coast rap in it , like let my 9 get em ' . The whole cd has probably like 6 good songs on it , E-40 duz a track on which made the song sound tight . But u should get Ghettos are tryin 2 kill me or True	-1
I 'm gon na just make this plain and simple , this album is way too long and most of it has that west coast feel too it ( which is n't bad if you like it ) . Not that many guest appearnces which make it good but again , this album suffers from way too many of the same formulas on some of the songs . Tales of drugs , sex , and violence.If this album could have been cut to 15 tracks and had some songs of sex , some songs of violence and some songs of bling bling , street tales , and etc. , this album could have been a classic in a way , beacuase Master P can rhyme and can make hits , but this album is more of a publicity stunt to try to get people to buy his last album which really is n't his last album ( Master P is rich and is a better money maker than music maker ) . `` Da Last Don '' , can be past on as of many other Master P albums after Ghetto D. If you are a hardcore No limit fan or a Master P fan you can pick this one up but if not , I suggest you past on this mediocore effort .	-1
Not sure what happened here , but you can skip this one for sure . All of their albums are very inconsistent with some great songs and many horrible songs , but this one is AWFUL ! ! Only Muskrat Love and She 's Gon na Let You Down are ok . AVOID ! ! !	-1
I waited along time to find a remaster of this record , one of my all-time favorites . The original , while weak in volume , certainly trumps the sound quality on this . They corrected the volume , but the lack of clarity is unacceptable , especially for something calling itself a `` remaster '' . Very disappointed .	-1
Great music ; and as the other review say ; pink floyd , Camel , Alan Parson lovers will enjoy this stuff . But the singing ; ah the singing is a kill to all the music on this album . Those guys speak broken english and sing IN ENGLISH . I say stay away from this one and go for `` The power and the Passion '' Instead .	-1
I 've heard some people who have said that this is the best Gentle Giant release ( this is the first GG disc I ever listened to ) , but it 's very hard to believe that this is their best because all of these tracks are so simple and minimalistic and just do n't sound at all to me like complex progressive rock . The first track `` Proclamation '' sounds simple and stupid and really all the tracks are just about as bad as the first . If you want to try Gentle Giant out , do n't try this one first and maybe never buy it because this is n't challenging enough for real progressive rock lovers . I just heard AQUIRING THE TASTE just after I heard THE POWER AND THE GLORY and that might be an alright choice for your first choice , but since I 've only heard two GG released so far , you might take the other reviewers advice on that . AQUIRING THE TASTE is in my humble opinion , far better than THE POWER AND THE GLORY . I really do n't think THE POWER is even one of those albums that will grow on me . I think they talk about not making commercial music because possibly they could n't make anything that the masses like , so they say stuff like that . I still am going to listen to another five Gentle Giant discs or so , and see if I can get into any of those albums , but it looks like there 's a reason that this group only has a very small cult following . You know how the affluent avant-garde like caviar even though it tastes awful , you might want to use that analogy with stuff like this .	-1
Malmsteen dropped the ball big time here . Having assembled a quality band for Eclipse he kept basically the same guys that cut that album with him . Everything should of been ready , he was signed to a major , had a worn in band of quality players and could still get himself on the cover of mags like Guitar World etc.Alas this album starts off with an instrumental . I 'm all for not sticking to prevailing formulas but what were they thinking ? Luckily it 's not a bad track . Things pick up with Dragonfly and Teaser which are more normal rockers . Then we get to the crux of the problem - the mid section of the album.I dunno , I was such a one eyed yngwie devotee for so long it still hurts to have to say this - but much of this critically reviled album does indeed suck . Dragged out tunes with production that feels too 'soft ' somehow and way too much emphasis on the keyboards . Some fans hated the string sections on this album but I never felt that was such a problem . For me , many of these tunes work in isolation such as No Mercy and Fire and Ice but put in seccession the whole just does n't gel into a good album.There are some tiny spots of glory for those willing to dig - the slower structures of some of the tracks is something a little new for Yngwie and follows on from slower tunes from Eclipse , the band is quality ( Goran Edman has been so great on so many albums ) and this album has that rarest of beasts - a Malsteen ballad that works in the form of I 'm My Own Enemy , the lyrics of which were written by Goran in relation to his marriage breakdown . And the little instrumental Golden Dawn seques into Final Curtain which is a way cool rocker replete with thunder and rain sound affects.Only for dedicated fans - of which I am one - but my love of the guys music must take 2nd place to my deisre to write honest and genuine reviews . This disc is a clunker .	-1
If it were n't for the three new songs on this disc , I 'd probably give it ZERO stars . I mean , come on -- why did he think it would be a good idea to record new ( WEAK ) studio versions of Beatles ' classics ? ? God bless Ringo for refusing to play on them . And WHY did he choose to re-record fluff like & quot ; So Bad & quot ; that came out just the previous year ? At least there were three good new songs ( FOUR counting the dance version of & quot ; no more lonely nights & quot ; ) . & quot ; No More Lonely Nights & quot ; was his best single in years , and & quot ; No Values & quot ; and & quot ; Not such a Bad Boy & quot ; represented his most convincing rock'n'roll since late-era Wings .	-1
I hate to use that demeaning of a title , but what else is the objective listener to do , even if he 's a huge Paul fan ? Mindless drivel is what you get with London Town . The whole thing sounds like it was done in about two days , composition to finish . Drab songs , sloppy playing and lyrics ( Morse Moose and the Gray Goose ? ) , and very uninspired performances . Linda never sounded worse , and she was horrible all around , God rest her soul.Paul 's problem was , and is , that nobody has the balls to tell him when his material stinks , a roll that all four of the Beatles filled with impunity .	-1
Part of an underachieving four-album run ( Speed of Sound , Back to the Egg , Mc Cartney II ) , London Town shows Mr. McCartney at loose ends . The song fragments do n't work . I remember how frustrated I was the first time I heard Backwards Traveller- a short burst of infectious song followed by uninspiring synth junk.Earlier in McCartney 's career , albums that received mixed reviews -- Ram , Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway -- all had enough gold in them to satisfy , nevertheless . By contrast , London Town -- as well as Back to the Egg -- very nearly miss completely.Fortunately , Tug of War was four years off . But then , another drought until Flowers in the Dirt , and so on ...	-1
I think people who give this a & quot ; 3 & quot ; star rating do NOT really realise what the & quot ; 3 & quot ; means . 2.5 in my estimation would be average ... and this disc is painfully below average for the master of the pop-hook . I never EVER liked any & quot ; D.L. & quot ; songs and this disc just showcases his lack of talent . I do not know why Macca picked this dude up , his songs are ALL uninspired , but sadly Mac 's songs on this disc are n't much better ... there are only 4 out of 15 that merit any praise . First up is the song that was n't even originally included on the album & quot ; Girls School & quot ; is a fun romp , and sounds like a precurser to an INFINATELY better disc , Back to the Eggs ' Spin it On . I 've Had Enough , With a Little Luck , and Name And Address are good and that 's it ... if you are looking for goods Wings try : Back to the Egg 5 stars , Venus and Mars 3 stars , and At the Speed of Sound 3 stars ( this includes the bonus songs )	-1
In a 2008 interview , former Rainbow crooner Joe Lynn Turner and his hair painted a somewhat euphoric picture of `` Slaves & Masters , '' the only album he recorded with Deep Purple . He had replaced the recently fired Ian Gillan , whose notoriously strained relationship with guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led to his second ( or third ) exit from the band . Turner said he had urged Deep Purple to go into a more `` commercial '' direction , `` much like Desmond Child and Aerosmith. '' ... what ? Turning Deep Purple into a glam-commercial pop-rock group is like giving Jason Statham a role written for Michael Cera . If 1987 's `` The House of Blue Light '' had been ( unfairly ) called `` Deep Purple trying uncomfortably to sound like Rainbow , '' then `` Slaves & Masters '' was a full-blown foray into wuss-rock . Not that Ritchie Blackmore 's Rainbow had been wuss-rock , but ... well , it was , but they sounded far better , and wuss-rocked far harder , than `` Slaves & Masters . `` So , on this 1990 album , Turner , Blackmore , Roger Glover , Ian Paice , and Jon Lord churn out an embarrassing mix of a Warranty , Def Leppardy , Bon Jovi ... y , glammy , distinctly late 80s/early 90s generic rock . Many Purple fans - and Purple themselves - have called 1973 's `` Who Do We Think We Are ? '' the band 's worst album , but at least it embodied the band in its turmoil , fitting for the unsung heroes of heavy metal . Jon Lord does some impressive work , even if he uses some now-heavily dated equipment , and Ian Paice anchors things with his drumming , but it seems Roger Glover 's bass is buried , as the album is terribly mixed . The attempt at a bluesy sound in 'Fire in the Basement ' is watered down and weak , while tracks like 'Truth Hurts ' find Turner crooning as if he 's fronting Cinderella , the rest of the band all the while trying to keep the nails-for-breakfast metal they innovated from clawing through the weak production.Do n't get me wrong - the presence of the extremely talented Turner did not make this album lame . What made `` Slaves & Masters '' a poor effort was that it did n't need to happen ; there was no inspiration , motivation , and no Gillan . Deep Purple 's heralded `` Perfect Strangers '' reunion in 1984 produced two great studio albums and awesome sold-out concert performances , but the reunion of the MkII lineup was dragged on too long . Their post-Blackmore efforts have been outstanding , but the initial spark of the MkII reunion was gone , and `` Slaves & Masters '' did not have the sound or the power to reinvigorate it .	-1
This is Deep Purple at the bottom , releasing a mediocre set of songs aimed directly to sound commercial and almost pop at some points.Of course , when you talk about Paice , Blackmore , Lord and Glover , you will always find some great stuff in the middle of this waste , given that they are such stupendous musicians.Have no doubt : this is the `` Bent Out of Shape '' of Deep Purple 's discography . ( for those who do n't know , Bent Out Of Shape was the last Rainbow album with Joe Lynn Turner - and it 's disastrous , an abomination . )	-1
Maybe I was just naive to expect Deep Purple to have come up with songs which demanded to be heard . After all , that 's what made this band so extraordinary.Joe Lynn Turner ( Ian Gillan ` s temporary replacement ) is a solid vocalist , but his approach to singing is to rock-Vegas . It 's hard to listen to SLAVES & MASTERS and not overlook this . But on to the album it 's self.The first three songs all have promise `` instrumental wise , '' particularly KING OF DREAMS , which grooves along with some inspired keyboards from Jon Lord and attractive little touches of Ritchie Blackmore 's guitar . The band are virtually rocking on THE CUT RUNS DEEP and they hit full stride on FIRE IN THE BASEMENT , a fast shuffle powered along by bassist Roger Glover and drummer lan Paice . FORTUNETELLER & TRUTH HURTS both start slow but pick up . LOVE CONQUER 'S ALL is a beautiful balled , which is right up JLT 's alley . Then there 's TOO MUCH IS NOT ENOUGH , absolutely the worst song ever recorded by Deep Purple . You must skip over this song ! Then , the album closes with WICKED WAYS , which is a good performance and I like JLT 's vocals on the Chorus'.So , if you 're a fan of Rainbow ( with Joe Lynn Turner ) then check it out . It would have been classic Rainbow , had it not been Deep Purple ! The bottom line , the legendary band seemed to have lost all sense of purpose ; for the moment .	-1
SLAVES & MASTERS is not a bad album , but it 's not like a DEEP PURPLE album ... the truth is , PURPLE NEED IAN GILLAN 'S vocals ! ! ! ! ! He is not only one of THE MOST INFLUENTIAL singers ever , but also write cool lyrics and yells and roars in perfect harmony ! ! ! the singer here is not bad , but do n't sound like PURPLE at all ...	-1
Yes , with the so glorified Ritchie Blackmore they did this awful recording . Joe Lynn Turner vocal sound is 80s , so therefore he sounds like all the bunch of heavy metal singers of that decade , that you ca n't tell who is who ... ALL SOUND THE SAME , BORING ! Joe Lynn Turner has been being a filler in bands for decades and recording the worst albums of the bands he was into . Unfortunally this time it was Deep Purple turn . WAY MUCH BETTER the version of DP with IAN GILLAN and STEVE MORSE , than RITCHIE BLACKMORE and JOE LYNN TURNER . So I 'm glad Ritchie is not in the band anymore . He 's just troubled thinking he 's the leader of the band . Ritchie needs to know that he was playing with JON LORD , IAN PAICE , ROGER GLOVER , GLENN HUGHES , IAN GILLAN or DAVID COVERDALE , and with all of them , he 's an equal . So what I mean is that Blackmore is to the guitar , what Lord is to the Hammond organ , Paice to the drums and so on.James Mogan , no one cares for how long you have been playing really . This line up sucks and that 's it ... so keep working harder on your playing , maybe one day you got it right ; - )	-1
Of course it sounds more like Rainbow . Three of these guys were IN Rainbow . Of course , half of Great Britain was in Rainbow at one point of another ( the other half were in either Deep Purple or Black Sabbath ) , so that 's not entirely fair . Either way , it 's not a bad album ... if you like glossy late 80 's radio-friendly hard rock , then this should scratch your itch . `` King Of Dreams '' and `` Fire In The Basement '' are catchy , decent tunes . The rest of it grows on you with repeated listens . It is however likely the weakest in the post-70 's Deep Purple catalog . I 've never heard `` Bananas '' or `` Rapture Of The Deep '' , but I 've got all the rest of them , and this CD just is n't up to the same level as `` Perfect Strangers '' , `` Purpendicular '' ( the most underrated album in their catalog ) or even `` House Of Blue Light '' . If you 're a completist , by all means , get it and be happy with it . If you 're a newbie , start with `` Machine Head '' or `` In Rock '' and kinda jump your way around through the Purple 's admittedly spotty output and find your favorites .	-1
Ok , it has some strong tracks , but this is below the standards.It is very duranish , but still different.Not bad , but weak from such a great band.Save your money , and get the Duran albums instead .	-1
Duran Duran are great , whether as a 5-piece or a 3-piece . I bought this CD out of nostagia as I had the original vinyl version way back when CD 's did n't exist . Arcadia were a Duran spin-off where Simon , Nick and Roger did this album and Andy and John went on to form The Power Station . The songs on this album do not come near the quality of Duran Duran and are at best B-Sides ... The singles at the time did not sell well and the album received luke-warm reviews ... Nothing has changed in 20years and the album still feels like a non-event ... Stick to the Duran albums ! ! !	-1
Imogen Heap tries to be the next Alanis on this album , but she only succeeds in taking Alanis 's worst traits and magnifying them . Lyrics not edited from spur of the moment inspiration , a voice that is n't attractive at all , and wannabe rock out moments . She tries to do it all with her style as well , and fails . The only decent songs on here are & quot ; Candlelight & quot ; and & quot ; Come here Boy & quot ; and there are moments in those songs that are repulsive as well . The result is a muddled album with no focus at all , playing the forlorn star in her own eyes . There 's potential in all of these songs . But she tries too hard copping an & quot ; angry gurrrrl & quot ; attitude that it ruins the moment . Skip this album if you can . I 'm glad I bought it used .	-1
I 've been a Neil Finn fan practically my whole adult life . First I become exposed to his brilliance via I Got You , the break through song of Split Enz a quarter of a century ago . That album , True Colours , is jam packed with great melodies and fun arrangements . Although their later albums did not match that peak , they were still enjoyable . When Crowded House became huge , I liked their albums ever more . Their first one , despite including the classic Do n't Dream It 's Over , is their least interesting one but during the final album , Together Alone , Neil Finn and Crowded House were making among the best music of that era.I was obviously very excited when Neil Finn released ( Try Whistling ) this album ; what would he deliver this time being alone and apparently with all the freedom to experiment ? Before hearing the album in its entirety , I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner , both great tracks and worthy classics . She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm . Sadly , these were the only tracks worth any attention . The production of the album is very flat , everything very professional like but lacking an edge . The songs really never come to life . I tried several times listening to the album , hoping I would get it , but no , this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark , something I ca n't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn ( his next studio album , live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better ) . Actually , this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.It is interesting but this album gets high marks from many reviewers , actually most reviewers . My sister and one of my best friends are also big Neil Finn fans . Their reaction to this album was , however , almost identical to mine , close to being boring and not living up to expectations . It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it . My advice , however , is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn .	-1
Wow . Only two songs out of this whole album even approximate Neil 's customary brilliance ( & quot ; Sinner & quot ; and & quot ; Truth & quot ; ) . This is the very least-involving CD he 's ever made , further testament to the fact that comfy home and hearth often make musicians very dull boys . Almost makes me wish he would have another falling out with his brother or stray from the marriage bed again -- such terrible events seemed to light a fire under him ( e.g . & quot ; Temple , & quot ; parts of & quot ; Woodface , & quot ; & quot ; Together Alone , & quot ; & quot ; Finn Bros. & quot ; ) . Tsk , tsk .	-1
Well , see , that 's the problem : she does n't get anything right in this crappy disco collection . I 'm glad she did n't write the material . It 's disco , and it 's not even good disco : the uptempo dance tracks are pretty much the same waste of a backing track recycled - four-on-the-floor beats , awkward slap bass , swooping disco strings - if you can imagine Aretha singing `` I Will Survive '' , here 's what you 've got . So not only do the title song , which actually made number one in spite of being awful , and the Top Ten hit `` Every Girl ( Wants My Guy ) '' , but to `` I Wish it Would Rain '' . Yes , that 's right , `` I Wish It Would Rain '' gets the '80s disco treatment . Who 's idea was that ? Perhaps it can be blamed on producer Luther Vandross . And the ballads ... oh , my god , the ballads . It 's hard to sit through `` Pretender '' and `` Better Friends Than Lovers '' - they pile on all these glossy trappings , but forget to give either any substance . Way to go ! The last two tracks are all that redeems this , more specifically the lazy `` Giving in '' ; `` I Got Your Love '' gets stale after five minutes , though at least some of it is listenable . I hope Aretha saw how bad this was , at least .	-1
On Love & Consequences , Gerald LeVert makes a few overtures to hip-hop , but he remains , in his heart , a sensitive loverman -- which is both a good and bad thing . LeVert is a powerful , soulful vocalist who can deliver love ballads as well as any of his contemporaries , but he does n't always exhibit much musical imagination . `` No Sense '' may have cameos from rappers Layzie Bone and Ken Dawg , and `` That 's the Way I Feel About You '' is a duet with Mary J. Blige , but they only illustrate that LeVert is from the old school and does n't really have the desire to bring his music into the present . Which means , of course , that Love & Consequences is n't much different than any other LeVert album from the '90s -- it has a slight modern sheen , but it 's a quiet storm album at its heart . It does n't offer any surprises , but LeVert is a professional -- and that means there are enough solid songs here to make it enjoyable , but not quite enough to make the entire album memorable .	-1
... makes Gaucho unbearable . Both Aja and Gaucho have excellent studio production and should be studied by audio engineers ( I know I test out stereos using Steely Dan albums ) . But the perfectionism that makes Aja so vibrant makes Gaucho seem lifeless by comparison . There are exceptions , I found Time Out of Mind and Hey Nineteen to be as good as anything on Aja . But ultimately they are just that , exceptions to the normally bland material . The only reason I bought this album was to complete my Steely Dan collection ; and the only other reason to buy it , Hey Nineteen , is on Classic Rock radio enough that you do n't have to spend the money to buy the rest of the album .	-1
This is the worst Steely Dan Album . Period.Babylon Sisters is a great opener , but the rest of the album can be heard playing on elevators everywhere ... .Overly polished and stale sounding overall.Do n't Bother .	-1
This 180 gram vinyl reissue was made from the digital master they use to make the CD 's . It sounds just like the CD , dull and flat . All the imperfections from the CD are on here also . On Time Out Of Mind the sound drops out in several spots just like the CD . If you want this LP just hunt down an original pressing from 1980 . Do n't waste your money like I did . Its sad because this is one the greatest albums ever .	-1
I do n't even get what some of these songs are about . The single stood out most and there were maybe 2 other tolerable songs but the others left me lost.I 've been meaning to write this review forever but never got around to it . Forgot about it even . But then I started listening to Maxwell 's `` Til The Cops Come Knocking '' , came here to see the actual name for the CD it was on ( could n't remember ) and kinda saw this CD right after his debut..I was like , `` OK. Time to speak my mind . `` The sounds are very different and it will take you forever to understand what he 's talking about on some of these songs.I bought it for less than 7 bucks used but hey , that 's cause I 'm a fan of some of the songs he 's done in the past ( Til The Cops ... Lifetime , This Woman 's Work , etc ... ) and will always be a fan of his smooth vocal delivery.Should have just purchased Maxwell 's Urban Hang Suite ... ^_^1.8 stars.End Note : I like different , original music but this was like a Rubik 's cube ; impossible for me to solve and figure out ! !	-1
With his first album , Maxwell had the potential to be one of the greats and he almost lost all of it with this album . I do give Maxwell credit for attempting to be different however on this album he confused with the odd song titles and overall mood of the CD . Maxwell wants to be so much more than just another soul crooner , but his gifts become obscured the more he pushes them forward . Maxwell does have a remarkable voice and he can write really good modern soul songs -- it 's just that he has a tendency to think that 's not enough and then he overstuffs his songs with ideas that lead nowhere which is why this CD floped so hard . Luckily he reedemed himself with Fortunate in 1999 and his thrid CD NOW in 2001 . Because this CD almost destroyed a promsing carrer .	-1
I LIKE MAXWELL BUTTHIS ALBUM WAS BLENDEDTOO MUCH YOUCAN BARELYTELL THE SONGS APARTFROM ONE ANOTHERTHAT 'S WHY I GAVE ITONE STAR IF ONLYTHERE WAS SOME DIVERSITYHERE WITH THE TRACKS I WOULDHAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS .	-1
aside from Luxury Cococure , & amp ; Matrimony maybe you this disc is very average to boring.there are really no songs.to slow and not focused.it 's a downer after the first album & amp ; unplugged show.but fourtunate is a step in the right direction.that song that came out just before last summer sounds better than over 90 % of this disc.so there is hope .	-1
After hearing 357 , I really wanted to hear more from Cam . I finally bought the CD as the used CD store , and I 'm glad I did n't pay full price . Yes Cam shows mad styles in 357 . Yes Feels good is a favorite of everybody . Heck , most have some they love even if `` her rings were rusty , feet were crusty or arms were musty '' ( or something like that ) even if we wo n't admit it . And Horse and Carriage is undeniable . So what 's wrong with the rest of the CD . Half the problem is Cam . He spends half the album trying to do it for the streets . Theirs nothing wrong with that , but the dark and uninspiring beats combined with the lyrics will get this THROWN in the street . Okay , the lyrics are n't that bad , and he tries some new angles . But in the end , they do n't overwhelm , and this combines with the music for an unfulfilling sound . And they sound fake when he tries to be the next Ma $ e on the other half of the CD . Nothings wrong with Ma $ e , but Cam 's impersonation is all wrong . The samples he uses are n't even catchy , and he chooses to rap the same way the whole CD , even though he does n't have to . Cam'Ron ahs some skills and some good ideas . But the trick of trying to appeal to the streets and the suburbs is a tough act to pull of , even for rap vets , let alone a rookie . If he figures out who he is as an artist , he 'll surprise people . He definitely has the talent , and with the right production team , Cam can be a star .	-1
This is the album , unfortunately , that I try so very hard to forget came from Cam'ron - but , what 's done is done . After hearing the first single off the record , & quot ; Horse and Carriage , & quot ; I was n't too motivated to buy a copy , thinking that songs like that were what to expect from the CD . Despite my friends many arguments to look past the single because the album was & quot ; blazin ' , & quot ; I decided to borrow the CD and peep it . Not only was the record a waste of time , but I was enthused by the fact that Cam'ron was supposed to be an underground emcee , yet , the whole album was commercially drenched . The only joint I found worth listening to off the album was & quot ; Wrong Ones , & quot ; but other than that 'Confessions of Fire ' is the epitome of the new style of music nodding heads -- hip-pop , and oh boy , is it wack .	-1
I originally posted this back in 2010 . Why it disappeared is anyone 's guess , but at least it was still on the UK site.Having had both of the previous Japanese CD releases , I was prepared to purchase this album yet again for the bonus material . As has happened far too many times , especially in recent years , I have to hold on to two issues of this CD . This is because regardless of the following false claim ; `` Beautifully remastered from original master tapes for pristine sound quality '' , the CD has not been remastered from the original tapes . Track 1-12 were provided in compressed MP3 form from that last Japanese issued CD to the person doing the `` remastering '' . This is also confirmed by the fact that track 10-12 are vinyl rips , as they were on the Japanese CD . The compression is visible in any basic audio program that displays a spectral view of the waveform . There are only a few tracks on this CD actually from master tapes , and uncompressed . If you read the CD credits , you will see that only two songs are mentioned as being pulled from tapes . Being that there have been way too many poor quality CD masters being produced lately , I 'm going to post 1 star reviews for each one until these lousy companies , both indie and major , learn to stop releasing CD 's that are vinyl rips , compressed MP3 sources , or blown so darn loud that they are unlistenable due to having most of the sonics squashed out in favor of volume . I 'm obviously a fan of this album , but not a fan of how poorly it 's been `` remastered '' . I 'm sure it sounds fine to most of you , but that mindset has done nothing but encourage these labels to continue substandard reissues . As an audiophile , I 'm dead tired of it .	-1
Wagner , King Crimson , John Coltrane . Pizza , coffee ice cream , Starburst . All great , but not necessarily great mixed together.I tried to like Magma , but it seems to me that their cult status and faux-etymological gimmicks are their main draw , rather than their music . Their studio work has dated poorly , and now comes off like a textbook of weirdy-beardy prog cliches gone super saiyan .	-1
It definitely is very sad when one great icon , can try to gracefully change the course of pop music , and yet can make a lackluster record in the process . That happens with so many acts from all over , and Elton John was definitely one of those acts . Even though he made so much in stellar music in the 1980 's , he also made some unfortunately bad music . Although most of his sonnets and songs were great , not every record was met with the exact same reception . After his symphonic well recognized Live In Austrailia performance with the Melboune Symphony Orchestra , he did lose a lot on the next wave.Reg Strikes Back , Elton 's 1988 album , was arguably met with a lot of angst , and tabloid fallout from The Sun magazine , and his end of a marraige as well . The album simply put does have some bright spots within great tracks like I Do n't Wan na Go On With You Like That , and the soulful A Word In Spanish . Other than that , the album does n't try to capture Elton very well in this compilation , especially with so many unfortunate tales including a less than embraceable sequel to Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters , and some even more weak tracks like the grim Goodbye Marlon Brando as well . Although the album has been remastered wel , the songs still do n't have the feeling other records did.For die hard Elton John fans , Reg Strikes Back is not one of the must owns in any album collection . Other than only buying this for a pair of pop gems , this record does n't carry a whole lot for everyone . Many will want to go on with this like that.Album Cover : B+Price : C-Songs : D+Remastering : C+Overall : D+	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... this would probably be considered the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Elton LPs if it we're n't for the fact that the re-release includes the Shep Pettibone remix of `` I Do n't Wan na Go On . '' It improves the song 100 % and actually makes it a good dance tune . It 's hard to find anything else worth listening to ( Mona Lisa 's and Mad Hatters possibly ) .	-1
NOWHERE is that stated on the release itself is it a remastered . I decided to look at it vs the old version - I was using - The Sea Lion . This mix is definitely hotter . They pushed it all the way to the top or higher so it is louder . Looks different as far as the mix so it could possibly be a remastered but why o why go to the trouble just to damage it with too much amplification ? If they took the old mix and amplified it to the level of this it would absolutely clip . This mix totally hitting the ceiling and I really ca n't see how it 's not clipping some of the peaks , almost all of them are maxed . So it looks like this too is a casualty of the loudness wars . Not the worse I 've seen but wounded never the less . Sadly . Loudness is better right ? FWIW .	-1
What a huge disappointment ! Now I know why this title has been out-of-print for so long . What sacrilige to ruin 'Dreams ' with horns . In fact , there are horns all over this disc . The Cowboy songs do n't work here at all . I 'm do n't know what Mr. Allman was thinking when he chose this ensemble , but it just does n't fly with this long-time ABB fan . Take away the strings , horns and those mixed-too-far-up-front back-up singers and this disc may have been far better than it is . I want my money back Polydor !	-1
When you ask many Adrian Belew fans what their favorite album by him is , quite a few of them will answer `` Inner Revolution '' .I have to confess , I 'm hard pressed to understand why . The album is full of catchy pop songs , but they 're all largely similar , and its this similarity that I find largely unrewarding on the album . Admittedly , there 's at least two classics in goofy `` Big Blue Sun '' and the Beatlesque `` Everything '' , but with so many songs covering no different ground ( `` Inner Revolution '' , `` The War in the Gulf Between Us '' ) , I ca n't bring myself to listen to this one much.On the other hand , it is in print , which is more than can be said for most of Belew 's catalog , but I 'd recommend `` Young Lions '' or `` Here '' before this one .	-1
I do n't understand the reviwes below ... By reading them , you 'll think this is the best Deep Purple album ever ! Ridiculous ! COME TASTE THE BAND is not that good , I assure you ... Of course , since it 's an album recorded by master musicians , it has a lot of quality , but nothing , I repeat , NOTHING in it can be copatred to the best Deep Purple albums ! ! Coverdale 's voice here is annoying , and there are early signs of where he would lead his career after Deep Purple ( come on , a Deep Purple song called & quot ; I NEED LOVE ! & quot ; ? ? ! ) The best moments are when Hughes sings , sure .	-1
This CD came out in 1991 , after The Fixx took a three year break . It has 12 songs and is 52 minutes long.Everyone has their own musical tastes . Other people below rave about this CD . I think it is the worst by the The Fixx . One reviewer says that the first 5 songs are the greatest songs ever . I think that 4 of the first 5 songs are the worst The Fixx has ever done . I feel there are only 4 songs of any value on this CD and they are at the end of the CD.The Fixx were a very popular and very typical New Wave band of the eighties , with short , catchy songs . The band went into hibernation for three years , and when they came out in 1991 , New Wave was dead . But , that should n't matter , as long as The Fixx made a good CD , but they didn't.On this CD , The Fixx try to incorporate their sound with other styles . The first half of this CD is more like the New Wave Pop of the eighties , sounding like something Duran , Duran might do , but not as good . Other tracks sound like they are trying to copy David Bowie . Another track sounds like INXS.The tracks I do like on this album are more along the lines of the traditional Fixx sound ( except for Shut It Up , that sounds like the INXS copy ) . The other good tracks are : Yesterday , Today , One Jungle and Make No Plans ( which might be one of the Fixx 's best songs of all time ) .I have nothing against bands experimenting and trying new things . But , they must have a vision , instead of just trying to copy the successful forma of others.After this CD , the Fixx died , but then made a comeback in 1998 .	-1
I am a fan of Ralph Tresvant and I picked up this cd but I was very disappointed with the content . Hopefully if he comes out with something again , it will be better than his previous products . YMMV ! NEOSOUL06	-1
This is my first Snoop Dogg album , so I really do n't know what he sounded like before No Limit . However , something 's just not right on this album . One of the major problem are the beats . You ca n't really bang your head to it . Also , the lyrics are kind of strange too . Snoop 's lyrics almost sounded like Silkk the Shocker . This is a very dissapointing album ( again ) from No Limit . The track & quot ; 20 dollars to my name & quot ; is one of my favorites . It does have a good beat and better than the other songs . Also & quot ; Still a G thang & quot ; a snoop solo , can become a classic . 2 good songs for 14 bucks is painful for a rapper as talented as Snoop .	-1
First off all snoop is a big sellout now and this is where it started.He used to diss the eastside of rap and now hes with the eastsidaz and working with master p.What a hypocrite and a sellout.The beats on this album are lame and theres probably only one good song on the entire album.It wouldnt surprise me if he started working with poop diddy since he is a sellout.Snoop needs to retire and become a comedian because he sure is one funny looking guy.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
This Is BY FAR Snoop 's WORST album . Coming from a Hardcore Snoop Fan ( me ) this album is not worth your time or money ; however if you see it in the used section definitely pick it up quickly . This is the album where people labeled Snoop a sellout , Studio Gangsta and just plain wack rapper who fell off . I highly disagree with these views but after listening to this album his future as a rapper looked really short . Fortunately he stormed back but anyway Out of 21 songs there is probably 5 or 6 worth listening to . The other songs cant even be considered filler just wackness.Songs To Listen to : Slow Down , Woof , Hustle & amp ; Ball , Tru Tank Dogs , Still A G Thang , 20 Dollars to my name . If youre not listening to this open minded the only song youll like is Still A G THang to be honest.Songs NOT to Listen To : rest of the albumThe beats and production dont mesh well with Snoops laid back flow and all the sound effects really drown out Snoops voice . All in All this is only for Snoop 's hardcore loyal fans and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone else .	-1
Snoop comes with a very disappointing third effort and first on No Limit since leaving the Death Row Empire . All in all this cd has quite a few below average tracks and only one great one and about 6-8 good ones ( 21 total songs are on the cd so only about 40 % of the cd is quality ) . Features too many songs with No Limit artists ( something they are known for ) . The production is too southern for Snoop 's delivery and style and it effects the quality of the cd ( Beats by the Pound make some tight beats but they do n't fit Snoop well with too many of the songs on here ) . # 1 - 7.5 ( f/ Master P ) # 2 - 7.5 ( decent slowed down song - f/ Mia X & O '' Dell ) # 3 - 4 ( f/ Fiend & mystikal ) # 4 - 6.5 # 5 - 4 # 6 - 3 # 7 - 5 # 8 - 4 ( f/ Mystikal ) # 9 - 9.5 ( great g-funk beat - f/ Master P on the hook ) # 10 - 10 ( a classic - definately the best song on the cd ) # 11 - 6.5 ( f/ Soulja Slim ( R.I.P . ) , Silkk the Shocker & Fiend ) # 12 - 5 ( f/ Master P & Silkk the Shocker ) # 13 - 8 ( f/ Silkk & C-Murder ) # 14 - 8 ( f/ C-Murder - remake of NWA 's `` Gangsta Gangsta '' ) # 15 - 8.5 ( gangsta track - f/ Steady Mobb'n ) # 16 - 7.5 ( f/ C-Murder & Mystikal ) # 18 - 3 ( f/ Mia X ) # 19 - 8 # 20 - 8 ( produced by Soppafly & Daz ) # 21 - 7 ( F/ Master P - samples `` Bout It Bout It '' beat ) b.

Man , I 'm sorry , but this album was a HUGE disappointment . I liked much of Snoop 's earlier work , but after he came out with this album and & quot ; Topp Dog , & quot ; his second No Limit album , it ruined his career . It left me with only one belief : Snoop Dogg is falling off . He 's lost his 'bounce to the ounce ' and funky rhythm that he once had . I 'm sorry , as much as it pains me to hate on Snoop Dogg , I have no choice ... he did n't show me nothing on this album besides the fact that he 's losing his edge in the world of hip-hop music .	-1
Snoop had the voice in the early to mid 90's.He was Rap 's Version of Michael Jackson and Dr.Dre was The Quincy Jones.but after Dre Left Death Row Snoop was Forced To Play 2nd FIddle to 2pac and Never Recovered.The Dogg Father was Wack but not as Bad as This Mess.No-Limit & amp ; Their Beat-less Crew make a Mockery of Snoop here.Gin & amp ; Juice11 & amp ; Woof are some of the Worst Tracks Snoops ever Recorded.well this Album is The Worst on a Whole.His Last Album was a step back in the Right Direction but he is one of those Artists that You Wonder What if ? Instead of Getting Watered Down.for a while He was The Voice but you have to wonder how many more Albums Like This Before folks are thru with him ?	-1
When you get this album you will get it in an akward case . Its made out of the same stuff as a kids lunchbox and has a realy shinny cover that was badly made by a five year old on a computer . On the inside there literly about 50 promotions for No Limit clothes and albums.When I got into Snoop Dogg everyone told me not to get this one cuz its just bad . So I got all his albums and always but never got this one . Finaly I got this simply so I could say I owned all of Snoops albums . I got the album with very low expectations . Actualy this was good cuz the album ended up actualy being worth keeping cuz I expected nothing and got something ( little as it was ) .I should also mention I hate No Limit and Cash Money because in my eyes they 're ghetto boybands . This is Snoops only full on `` No Limit pride '' album by the way.The first track is actualy good exept for whens Snoops trying to rap but its covered up by an anoying `` UHHHHHHH '' from Master P who I think has no talent as a producer or a rapper . So after that song I was excited but the next two songs were all No Limit and realy let me down . `` Gin & Juice II '' is actualy good other than the very confused chorus . `` Show Me Love '' is a good song and is produced by DJ Pooh . The beat is n't one of his best but its a break from No Limit . The next two songs are actualy not bad evan though they 're by the Pound ( no limits producers ) . Than the album takes a turn for the worst with `` True Tank Dogs '' and `` Whatcha Gon Do '' where Master P sounds well they wo n't let me tell you how he feels as he yells `` RUUUUUUNNN '' . Than the album is saved by `` Still a G thang '' witch is a great song that would be good on any of Snoops albums . The next three songs are terrible . `` DP Gangsta '' is a cover of `` Gangsta Gangsta '' by NWA . The olny problem with this song is the chorus . Other than that i realy like this song . `` See Ya When I Get There '' is pritty good but too mutch C-Murder on it . `` Picture This '' is listenable if you fast forward past Mia-X part . `` Doggz Gon na Get Ya '' is a real good song and i like the lyrics . KLC is the olny No Limit producer that has the ability to make a good song on a constant basis . Than comes my favorite song on the album `` Hoes , Money & Clout '' witch has a westcoast beat and Snoops flow is very good . `` Get Bout it & Rowdy '' has a good beat but a bad flow and more yelling by Master P.The bottem line is that these beats do n't work with Snoops voice . The olny people that should get this album are people who olny buy albums for a few good songs , Snoop Dogg fanatics and those people who somehow like No Limit `` music '' . Fortunetly this was a one album slump . Every album sience has improved at least some what.I undrstand why Snoop went to No Limit cuz he needed a friend but it was n't a good carer move .	-1
Lets get one thing clear . Snoop and crunk dont mix . You can tell that Master P had full control of this poopfest . Snoop is a laidback rapper . No Limit artists yell so loud you cant even hear the beat . How can you not see something wrong with this transition ? The only good tracks are Woof , Still A G Thang , Dont Let Go and Slow Down . The rest of this album is straight ... ... Filler : Snoop mutilates the old BDP classic Love 's Gon na Get Ya with the extremely soft sounding Doggz Gon na Get Ya . His main man died in 96 but he gives tribute to his fleabitten mutt that passed on in See Ya When I Get There ( why do we like this fool again ? ) . Snoop ruins a good thing with Gin & Juce II which sounds like a bad horror flick and Get Bout It And Rowdy is too stupid to describe with words . Dishonorable Mentions : Hoes Money & Clout , Snoop World , D.O.G 's Get Lonely Too , Hustle & Ball , Tru Tank Dogs and the rest of this album . Bottom Line : Snoop 's first album on No Limit is a certified stinker . Even though his later albums on No Limit where good this one was fully controlled by Master P and you can tell . Snoop was out of his element on this one plus the beats were rank to begin with .	-1
Positives : I 'm hard pressed to find positive things to say about this record . Snoop is one of the greatest and Doggystyle proved he can make premium rap music.Negatives : This album proved Snoop is also not afraid to fall flat on his face . I do n't know where to begin on this album . Any tracks that are n't & quot ; No Limitized & quot ; are just too soft . Snoop has that kind of soft flow but tracks like & quot ; Show Me Love & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Doggz Gon na Get Ya & quot ; are not his patented gangster rap norm . I do n't know how I managed to stick with Snoop after this attempt . Every other record Snoop has ever and will make is better than this one .	-1
I agree with the other negative reviews here . Get the blue album , Greatest Hits , instead . Like one reviewer said , & # 34 ; bargain bin compilation & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; cash grab by the music company & # 34 ; are thoughts that came to mind when I bought and listened to this .	-1
If you 're going to buy a greatest hits package by The Bangles , buy their 1990 release `` Greatest Hits '' . This release is nothing but a cash grab for their record company and it does n't even feature all of their hits . Avoid this !	-1
I think the fact that the average rating for this album is 4 stars is a bit of an inflation . Do n't get me wrong , I own all their recordings and love The Band just as much as anybody else , but this album , though it has a couple highlights , sounds mostly burnt-out and hollow , making it subpar ( for ANY band ) and WAY lower quality than we 've come to expect from The Band.I 'll start with the negatives , since they mostly outweigh the positives , then move to the album 's highlights later ( please remember , I 'm trying to take off the rose-colored glasses and be realistic about this album ) . First off , as everyone knows , this collection of songs is , and never was , an album . It 's a collection of unreleased studio tracks strung together to fill The Band 's contract . Consequently , the songs were n't conceived as part of a cohesive whole and the album has no flow whatsoever . Likewise , the rest of the album reflects this : a lack of attention , care , and soul.By this point , a lot of Robbie 's writing became really tired and forced -- listen to `` The Saga of Pepote Rouge , '' and `` Let The Night Fall , '' and you 'll see what I mean ( spaceships ? ! ) . There 's not much inspiration , and he seems to be ineffectively trying to follow stock song blueprints that worked on their better albums . The magic that buoyedNorthern Lights-Southern Cross , making it one of their strongest records ever , is pretty much completely absent , which is a pity . You can really tell on these songs just how bad Robertson wanted to be done with The Band and move on . The playing is pretty similar . The Band members go through the motions , passing around lead vocals , Garth plays a bunch of instruments ( a lot of easy-listening sax this time around , not really to my taste ) , and Robbie contributes some pretty gnarly guitar , though it 's not supported by well-written songs . Although the songs are pleasant enough , there 's not really much to get excited about , and it really sounds like the musicians are n't emotionally invested and inspired in making these songs as good as they can be . On a final note , `` Knockin ' Lost John '' reminds us why Robbie did n't and should n't have sung on almost all of the Band 's releases.Now on to the album 's saving graces , since there are a few . No matter how bland the songs and how uninspired the playing , it 's still The Band doing it , which counts for something . Even though much of their signature sound is being replaced with a more late-70 's lite-pop production , it 's still a bit of a pleasure to hear Rick 's , Levon 's and Richard 's voices . `` Georgia On My Mind '' is worth the price of admission all by itself . Richard Manuel 's voice was getting pretty haggard due to his hard living , but I 'll be if it did n't add even more soul and texture to his always sublime vocals -- I could listen to the guy sing grocery lists and probably still be entertained . Robertson actually did write a couple decent tunes , like `` Christmas Must Be Tonight '' ( although an arguably better version was already released as a bonus track on the superior Northern Lights - Southern Cross ) , and `` Right As Rain '' is n't too bad , though it really does n't sound like The Band . It 's also pretty cool that Rick Danko helped out with the songwriting with `` Street Walker '' ( Robertson always complained that he had to do all the work ) , even though it 's not that great of a song . Unfortunately , though , most of the album 's good points are only mildly pleasant , and after it 's over you get the feeling you 've just listened to something with little substance that The Band cared about just as much as you probably did.I 'll probably get axed by hardcore fans for not giving it 5 stars , but seriously , it 's not worth that many by anyone 's standards . If Islands deserves 5 stars , how much is Music From Big Pink worth ? ! I 'm glad I own it because of its highlights and because I 'm a completist , but not everybody is . Islands certainly is n't essential , but you might get some enjoyment out of it . Just make sure you have everything else first .	-1
This cd isnt that good , many of the songs are not worth listening . Probably the 2 worthy songs are nitty gritty and justice against yall oppressors which features e-40 & amp ; cube	-1
I do agree with another reviewer that Canadian native Deborah Cox is one of R & B 's most underrated singers . I was extremely dissapointed and angry at Clive Davis for underpromoting her ( he even dropped her from his label J Records ! ) when she actually has a better voice than labelmate Whitney Houston . `` One Wish '' is a great contemporary R & B album featuring some Hip Hop ( `` One Wish '' featuring Snoop Dogg ) , Jazz ( `` I Wo n't Give Up '' ) , Adult Contemporary ( `` One Day You Will '' ) and straight R & B ( `` Nobody 's Supposed To Be Here '' -- originally written for Patti LaBelle ) . Her voice is phenominal . She can softly whisper like Mariah but also belt out like Celine . A lot of the songs have potential hit . Another favorite of mine is the mild Urban hit `` We Ca n't Be Friends '' featuring Next group ( also an underrated R & B act ) member R.L . Overall if you liked Deborah 's radio hits I strongly reccomend this album . I really think it 's her best . Overall grade : B+	-1
Apart from `` September '' , which has a semi-decent melody , all these songs are forgettable , even the Diane Warren songs . Add some ridiculous production , poor interpretation , and over-singing , and you have an album that would have died very quickly without Deborah 's great voice .	-1
this album is wack the only 2 songs on here i like is1 nothing even matters2 ex factory but other then that i was so diappointed when i bought this album 8 years ago i was salty this is the worse album i ever bought in my life besides whats the 411 by mary j blige	-1
It 's funny , I can never figure out the music business and MTV any more . This is the most overrated , overhyped album I have ever heard , and yet they talk about it like it 's gods gift to music fans . I admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that I like , but the rest forget about it . Being a somewhat introspective person myself , I understand that this album is a personal expression of sort , but where is the melody on most of these tracks ? I love soulful , heartfelt music as much as the next guy , and I think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from Lauryn ; however there is n't much else in this album . I think Brandy is much better than Lauryn , but does n't get nearly the credit she deserves .	-1
she is a good artist for these times but she is overrated and stated.a few good songs but the music sounds all the same.it ai n't no thriller , songs in the key of life , what 's going on , sparkle , superfly.to be more blunt & amp ; honest it 's not as good as wycliff 's disc.he tried to something different at least.l-hill to me is a better producer than artist .	-1
If I ever hear another song from her again , I 'm just going to go freakin crazy !	-1
There is only one great song on this CD , Christmas Canon . It 's a masterpiece of Christmas artwork , and thank you for whoever was in charge for doing it . The rest is absolutely a test of your will and patience . The tunes are contrived and repeatitive , I would expect such a menu of songs from my local pub on kareoke night . It is Christmas Canon that brings out the visuals of the true Christmas spirit , the rest would bring Woodstock to shame , its that bad . Do yourself a favor and download the single of Christmas Canon on amazon MP3 .	-1
As a music fan , you better go into this album absolutely fascinated with cheesy heavy metal to an extent that stretches far and beyond what 's normal in order to appreciate what Rob Zombie 's doing here . Maybe this kind of music was cutting edge at one point in time , but now it 's anything but . `` The Ballad of Resurrection Joe & Rosa Whore '' begins with a neat beat and guitar playing before the unforgivably atrocious vocal melody comes in . The song then turns into a bunch of overbearingly crappy useless noise with an average guitar riff covering the uninteresting vocal work . Now when I say `` uninteresting '' , what I REALLY mean is that this barely qualifies as singing . You ca n't understand a single word thanks to the guitar riffs being played so incredibly loud . I can make out a few severe swear words which makes me realize I 'm not missing out on anything interesting as far as the lyrical portion is concerned . `` Return of the Phantom Stranger '' suffers the same fate- a nice steady beat in the beginning with vocals that are just deplorable on all counts . The short use of cliched orchestration during the chorus fails miserably . Only when Zombie screams `` PHANTOM STRANGER ! '' can I remember the vocals . I do like the brief part near the end when the choir and orchestration play together . This is actually listenable . `` Superbeast '' might actually finally be a good song ! Hold on ... let 's wait for the vocals ... So far the fast-moving beat is really awesome . Alright , tolerable vocals ! Hooray ! The guitar riff is really good , the `` Hey yeah I 'm the one that you wanted '' chorus is decent , and much to my amazement , it 's an overall pretty decent song . `` Dragula '' is the hit song- basically the same thing as `` Superbeast '' and utterly decent and memorable only because heavy metal stations play it on a daily basis so many of us are familiar with it . `` Demonoid Phenomenon '' begins with a sludgy Black Sabbath-like guitar riff that 's pretty awesome before the vocals do absolutely nothing to wow me over and sound like a waste of my precious time . The `` turn around and meet the hater '' part is sickeningly awful . I truly despise this part of the song . `` Spookshow Baby '' ... oh no , please Rob , do n't try implementing Middle Eastern arrangements ... oh *feels relief* they 're gone ! He only implements them briefly . The vocals are sort of quality-worthy in the begining since he 's basically singing in a really low pitched range , which is infinitely better than the over the top screaming we normally associate with Rob Zombie 's style.Overall , you 've been warned .	-1
To put it rather bluntly , Rob Zombie has sold out . He leaves his great band , replaces them with a much less talented band , dyes his hair to make him look like he 's 65 years old , and makes a solo album with more programming than & quot ; Tomb Raider & quot ; . I really loved White Zombie 's debut , I thought it was one of the coolest , most original albums I 've ever heard . Then , he made & quot ; Astro Creep & quot ; , which was a gigantic step down . So , when I heard that Rob was on his own , and then heard the song & quot ; Dragula & quot ; , I was intrigued . Hmm , good song . Had he got out of his slump ? So , I buy the CD , only to find that he sunk even lower . & quot ; Dragula & quot ; is the ONLY good song , and even that one does n't come close to anything on & quot ; La Sexorcisto & quot ; . And , what 's up with Rob 's vocals ? The only place where his trademark growl is even recognizable is on & quot ; Dragula & quot ; . Everywhere else he wheezes like an old woman . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this album . I really ca n't . The new one sounds like it 's probably even worse . I heard & quot ; Feel So Numb & quot ; recently , and I thought I was in some kind of '80 's dance club or something . Could this really be the same guy who did & quot ; Thunderkiss '65 & quot ; ? Come on Rob , enough of this . Get back to the basics . Where 's the beef , ese ?	-1
Rob Zombie seems to be more of a Gimmick than real Artist.it 's loud & amp ; brash fit for MTV but just listening to this as a whole is a bad joke to the mind & amp ; ears .	-1
He is an embarassement . I hate him so much I did n't even want to give it a review . I do n't know what people are thinking , saying he is the Micheal Jordan of rap ? You should start listening to some Wu-Tang or Drag-On , some real rappers . The only good song is Money Cash Hoes because of the beats ( I like this song not because I like DMX . X is WACKER than Jay-Z ) . East Coast rap is just so good . So why do you have listen to him when you can get some other rapper with better flows , lyrics , and beats ?	-1
I liked & quot ; Reasonable doubt & quot ; and & quot ; the blueprint & quot ; but this is a weak album . The best track on the album is the first Priemier track and jay doese n't even rap on it ! The only other dope track is & quot ; Resevoir Dogs & quot ; . The rest of the album is just to jiggy	-1
This is the only country in the world where people with no talent can brag about what other people give them and make lots of money.The cd probably has only 2 songs worth listening to and the rest is pure filler material.The beats are simple as could be expected and the lyrics are even simpler.Its commercial hip hopers like this clown who are eventually going to lead to the demise of hip hop one day.I cant believe people are not tired already of the same mindless drivel from these commercial sellouts.People are just throwing their money away and supporting their rich lifestyles.DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING FROM HIM AND VOTE FOR MY REVIEW .	-1
this cd sucks , i would n't suggest this album to jay-z himself , this is a bunch of crap , do n't buy it .	-1
i dont care what people say about this guy selling out or being a greedy -- -- -- this cat has got some serious flow check out some of his freestyles with big L. None the less this is an extremely weak offering from a man who has the ability to produce Hiphop of a genius caliber . Besides the singles there are really only about 2 other songs on this CD that I really listen to and thats sad because with a single like Hard Knock Life you are expecting to pick this thing up and hear some serious bangers . If you are looking for a better offering from Jay-z I would suggest Reasonable Doubt . This was a time when Jay-z was a little more focused musicly and definitely showed more promise than this .	-1
Most overrated rapper of all time ! This album is wack ! All the beats are simple and the lyrics are boring.All he raps about is money , cash , hoes , cars , and how tough or great he is.That Hard knock life song was garbage ! Joe camel gets worst and worst as time goes on.Save your money and do n't by this garbage !	-1
As you already know , this is the album Jay-Z officially sold out on . If you do n't believe me , listen to & quot ; Moment Of Clarity & quot ; from The Black Album where he admits in so many words that he sold out for the money . He changed his style and flow ( for the worst ) dramatically and it resulted in his most successful album at the time . Just like everyone back in 1998 , Jay-Z decided to go with everyone else in the Timberland and Swizz Beats movement .	-1
This is the defining moment right here . This is when Jay-Z fell off in my eyes . From here on out , his credibility was GONE . Anyone who let Swizz Beatz do a song on their album gets a strike in my book.There is very little good about this album . The production is just flat out bad . Swizz ( Pizz Poor ) Beatz ' contributions are either boring ( & quot ; If I Should Die & quot ; ) or distracting ( the painfully annoying organ fall in & quot ; Money , Cash , Hoes & quot ; and every single keyboard line in & quot ; Coming of Age : Da Sequel & quot ; ) . Timbaland produces two more fast-paced-but-somehow-slow-and-annoying songs ( although Jaz 's verse at the end of & quot ; Nigga What , Nigga Who & quot ; is GREAT , better than ANY of Jigga 's verses ) . The only production worth a ... at all is Erick Sermon 's execution of & quot ; Reservoir Dogs & quot ; and DJ Premier 's opener & quot ; Hand It Down. & quot ; I do n't like to say it , because & quot ; Reasonable Doubt & quot ; is still one of my favorite albums , but Jay-Z fell off hard . Yes , he 's still popular , but check with real heads , where he got his start , and see where he stands now .	-1
this album isint bad for an average rapper but for jayz this was a crossover album lost street cred this was an album that WAS FULL OF GUEST APPEARENCES ! ! ! ! ! and only had 14 tracks and one was just a throw in jermaine dupris money aint a thing jayz has skills on this barely lp but after classic releases and guest spots all over this is a terrible jayz album5.5 of 10 lyrics 6.5 of 10 beats	-1
YO WUD UP HOMIES ! DIS GOOD ! I IT DOWN WIT JAY-Z ! DIS DOPE ! Just kidding.I think that anyone who likes this subhuman junk must be on a lot of sedatives.Bad poetry juxtaposed to a drum machine thud is just not my thing.And so what if he 's an upstart , name one of these douchebags who is n't .	-1
So much has been said about this album , that Jay-Z was & quot ; completely in a zone , focused and creative & quot ; during the making of this album . After getting a few years of perspective on this album , how can ANYONE say that this album is EXCELLENT or BORDERLINE CLASSIC ? How ? This album might have sold many units , but top notch records sales DO NOT equal a classic album . Vol.2 Hard Knock Life was hailed by critics and fans alike as some of Jay-Z 's best material . I & quot ; respectfully & quot ; disagree . Here 's the COMPLETE review : Album Highlights : Hard Knock Life , A Week Ago , Money , Cash , Hoes ( w/DMX ) , and N**** What N**** Who . Every other song on this album is ABSOLUTE filler and it 's not worth your time in listening to it.Production : Thumbs in the middle , leaning towards down . Not the best production in the world . Timbaland and Swizz made the best tracks , Everything else is either poorly composed or mediocre at best ( check Kid Capri 's track ) .Lyrics and Subject Matter : Thumbs in the middle , leaning towards down . Jigga represents on the tracks mentioned in the album highlights section . On everything else , lyrically , is not material to gloat about.Originality : Thumbs WAY down . If Jay-Z would have done this album in a way like The Blueprint , it would have been better , but since NEARLY every song features another artist , this album loses SERIOUS points with me.The Last Word : Not too much to say here that I have n't said already . Is this album worth buying for the four best songs ? Certainly not . Jay-Z did n't slip up with In My Lifetime Vol.1 . He slipped up here , and it shows . Overall , I ca n't seriously recommend this album . But if you consider this a must have of any type , be prepared to be disappointed . Otherwise , do n't even bother .	-1
I had high hopes for this . I like Bacharach 's stuff..songs like `` Walk on By '' , '' Any Day Now '' , `` This Guy 's in Love with You '' , '' Raindrops Keep Fallin ' on my Head '' , `` Close to You '' and `` One Less Bell to Answer '' rank among my favourites of all time . Costello 's smart but jagged punk anthems like `` What 's So Funny 'Bout Peace , Love , and Understanding ? `` , '' Allison '' , `` Blame it on Cain '' , '' Everyday I Write the Book '' , `` Less than Zero '' , and `` Pump it Up '' also hit a chord with me.So it 's with sadness that I report that overall this disc just does n't grab me much . Costello turns some nice phrases here and there but there are n't enough `` stick with you '' hooks . Bacharach 's music acquits itself nicely but it seems like wasted effort in some of these cases : like spraying glitter onto peeling paint.HIGHLIGHTS : '' Toledo '' is where Costello 's girl lives ... the one who wo n't understand his foreign tryst : `` But it 's no use saying that I love you/And how that girl really did n't mean a thing to me/For if anyone should look into your eyes/It 's not forgiveness that they 're gon na see.. '' while in `` I Still Have that Other Girl '' Elvis struggles to allow himself time to get over a lost love before seeking a new one : '' Despite the temptation I try to be very strong/In my reluctance seems a surprise/It 's not 'cause I do n't want you ... '' `` God Give me Strength '' from the Brian Wilson homage flic GRACE OF MY HEART is another standout . ( `` Since I lost the power to pretend/That there could ever be a happy ending/That song is sung out/This bell is rung out.. '' ) LOWS : '' Such Unlikely Lovers '' is the most mismatched pairing of Bacharach 's stylings and Costello 's wordplay . `` The Sweetest Punch '' is lovely musically but the meter of the lyrics seem `` pinched '' into the tune . It 's just awkward sounding.BOTTOM LINE : This should have been so much more . *sigh* It 's not awful but I ca n't really say it 's memorable either.2 1/2 stars	-1
The 2 fab tracks are THE SWEETEST PUNCH and TOLEDO . The rest is utter crap . And it 's Bacharach 's fault since he 's the only one with any talent anyway . Costello continues to wring his precious song-lyric metaphors for all they 're worth . Check out the ultra-emetic MY THIEF ( or better yet , do n't ) with its precious girl-singer mewling about a `` perfect alibi '' . It made me wan na fwow up all over Elvis 's collection of cutesy-poo hats .	-1
Not unlike Bob Dylan 's brazen phony flirtation with Christianity , Elvis Costello proves his desperate desire to remain in the public eye holds no bounds . While displaying his usual hack prowess at songwriting , the over emoting Costello transcends from angry young man to dandy old man . With the possible exception of & quot ; God Give Me Strength & quot ; , Costello proves his run as an interesting and provoctative writer may have reached it 's end . In continuing to betray the style which placed him squarely on the forefront of the so-called New Wave movement , Costello once again demonstrates he 's & quot ; been around so long , but still does n't know what to do. & quot ; As he now turns his charms to the geriatric set , the die-hard fans of Elvis Costello will undoubtedlty view this outing of songs , including such puff pieces as & quot ; Toledo , & quot ; as another statement to his songwriting depth . The sad truth is that Costello , who seemingly pines for the days of Tin Pan Alley , once again turns to a musical formula that has worked for others in the past ( commercially or not , i.e . country , chamber , American folk , punk , new wave etc . ) and then vainly tries to put his own spin on it . While other reviewers will fawn and coo over Costello as he again attempts to become an American master , the broad reality is that Declan MacManus will grab on to any style , provided it helps sustain his presence in the public 's eye . Needless to say , if Costello had maintained even the vaguest credability ( like fellow aging genius Iggy Pop , ) the music world would be much better off . Bye Elvis . R.I.P .	-1
was a little dissappointed ... and ... sleepy `` zzz ... zzz..zzz ... '' i can not blast this record with the one star rating i typically save for crap like britney spears , menudo , or michael bolton , or beyonce.however , this album is kind or boring and not very memorable . yes some of the arrangements are ok. there are a few decent tunes on here , the most noteworthy is God give me strength , which was included in the movie , grace of my heart . i will sort of give it the benefit of the doubt , maybe i simply have n't given this album enough listens for it to grow on me . but , that being said , i have owned it for a quite few years already and maybe have heard it five times or so . unless you 're a hardcore e.c . fan , you may want to pick up a 'greatest hits ' comp , or my aim is true . also , there 's some great late period stuff , like spike or if you venture into the world of bootlegs , try to track down mccartney and mcmanus , a series of unreleased recordings with e.c . teaming up with paul mccartney ( the songs they worked on on those sessions made their way onto assorted solo efforts from both artists , albeit in different versions0	-1
Someone gave me this disc and the result was a lot of lost time and productivity in my life.Seriously - This album does n't make any impression either musicaly or lyrically . It is totaly forgetable and leads you to complete nothingness . Its like eating the main course only to find yourself still hungry , ordering another meal to eventually find yourself broke and starving . Its as harmless as raindrops in a puddle and there is no beauty or melancholy here - rather a complete and utter experience of blandness.Perhaps the ultra-fragile types on the verge of a physical and mental breakdown might find temporary sedation in this and no doubt intellectuals and critics worldwide will praise it .	-1
At the height of drum-and-bass 's popularity , the electronic outfit Baxter releases its self-titled debut in 1998 . The first two tracks , & quot ; Television & quot ; and & quot ; Fading & quot ; effectively provide chilly landscapes of hyperactive drum beats , eerie synths , and an overall dark and etheral environment I have n't experienced since Portishead 's debut . But , boy , is it a steep dive from there . Tracks get repetitve when there should be variety . The record gets boring when it tries to be mellow . And the lyrics , sung in a spoken-girl voice by lead singer Nina Rambsy , are simplistic and embarrassingly plain . & quot ; Baxter & quot ; gets the mood and feeling right when it wants to , but it 's way too uneven for me to recommend .	-1
Mack 10 's third album `` The Recipe '' is nothing special for this reviewer . On this album I find Mack 10 's gangsta style lyrics to become repetitive and brings nothing new with this album , not to mention a guest appearance on almost every track . A lot of this album has a lot of skip that flows throughout . The first song that stood out was `` Money Just A Touch Away '' featuring Gerald Levart ( R.I.P . ) , as he rhymes about him comming up in the rap game . Another dope track would be `` Ghetto Horror Show '' with Ice Cube and Jayo Felony . Mack 10 teams up with Snoop Dogg over an old school beat for the song `` Long Beach & Inglewood '' . Mack 10 teams up with a lot of guests . Many East Coast and Down South , as well as some West Coast rappers who hit ( Big Pun , Buckshot Shorty , ODB , MC Eiht ) , and some who miss ( Jermaine Dupri , Foxy Brown , Master P , CJ Mac ( sorry I ca n't stand him ) ) . That can really cause an imbalance on the album and have some filler tracks like `` Made ****** '' and `` You Ai n't Seen **** '' . Mack 10 closes the album with him addressing the critics on `` The Letter '' , followed by a rock sounding track `` Should I Stay , Or Should I Go '' featuring Korn and Ice Cube . I enjoy Mack 10 , but personally believe that he lacks charisma of carring an album by himself , and find it better when he is either rhyming in a group ( Westside Connection ) , or being a guest on someone else 's album ( which might explain the high amount of tracks that feature guests ) . This album has your average dated topics and common material that might have sounded good back in 1998 , but years later is dated . There are a few tracks here and there , but not enough to keep the album togeher . I find that this album is more suited for east coast listeners than it is for west . I understand the unity that was going on back then due to the circumstances of recent events , but this album pulls too far from it 's west coast sound that makes the music sound the way it should . Unless you 're a hardcore fan of Mack 10 , I recommend that you find this album at a used price . Peace.Lyrics : C+Production : BGuest Appearances : C-Musical Vibes : CTop 5 Favorite Tracks:1 . Long Beach & Inglewood ( LBC and the ING ) ( featuring Snoop Dogg ) 2 . The Letter3 . Money Just A Touch Away ( featuring Gerald Levert ) 4 .

Mack 10 is good for a laugh.these lyrics & amp ; music are played out like 5 years back.i hear Cube pulling the strings here and that 's one of the reasons why he has fallen off so bad.trying to give a 3rd tier rapper 2nd rate Rhymes.and the guests alone do n't make no sense .	-1
the guy has no rap skills whatsoever.the music is a bad joke.he has style but it has nothing to do with music at all .	-1
Why am I not surprised that we have a top 500 reviewer giving three and 1/2 stars to an awful album ? How much more proof do you need that Top 500 and Top 1000 reviewers are whackos ? Okay , there is a reason why Fugee fans never mention Pras . Can you guess why ? HE SUCKS ! His rhymes are a**crack and he has the personality of a hermit crab . The only good song he has is Ghetto Supastar featuring Ol ' Dirty ( RIP ) and its the best song he 's ever made . Free of 106th and South Park ( I meant to write that because I hate that show ) fame couldnt save What Cha Gon na Do from being a waste . As soon as Pras opens his mouth its over . Another classic example of this is Cant Stop The Shining ( Rip Rock Part 2 ) . Canibus and Free had some great verses but once again Pras messes up everything with his elementary style of rapping . His second single Blue Angels was horrible and Frowsey not only suffers from lame hooks disease and it suffers from horrid beat virus as well as wack rhymes plague ( okay , I 'll stop . I promise ) . Murder Dem is another stinker with a corny country music sounding beat as well as some uninteresting lyrics from Pras . Yeah Eh Yeah Eh and Wha What Wha What are just as wack as the titles are . More disposables : For The Love Of This , Get Your Groove On and all those stupid a** telephone interludes ( as if anybody cares about who is cool with Pras ! ) should have been scrapped like this cheesy album . Bottom Line : Hands Down , Pras 's Ghetto Supastar is the worst album of 1998 . That is not hatred it is the truth ! Crummy beats , wasted guest appearances and a terrible performance by Pras himself . Pras can not carry a whole album by himself and if you were listening he was the weakest link out of The Fugees . Listen to Blunted On Reality for proof . Then listen to this album and Win , Lose Or Draw for concrete evidence of his wackness . If you not convinced that he is weak after hearing all that then I cant help your a** !	-1
'Cultural Seismology - An attempt to record the shifts and displacements of sensibility that regularly occur in the history of art , literature and thought . 'It makes you wonder does n't it ? Phil Collins was/is a member of ancient rock group Genesis , and a releaser of diabolically bad solo music.He is bland and non-descript in a nails-down-a-blackboard , bite-on-cotton-wool sense , and his music contains not one note of interest or revelation to prove otherwise.For years he was in Genesis . What can you say ? Genesis , who even by the early 80 's , were bitterly embroiled with the Moody Blues in a 'Who 's the Deadest Rock Group ' competition . Phil apparently became disillusioned and a bit stale so decided to go his own way.Left poor Genesis ( who must 've been crestfallen ) , and joined that rather sad little band of going-nowhere monomaniacs - Gabriel , Sting , Weller , McCartney , et al.Folk who sensible people shun like lepers and who should 've finished scratching and pecking around the music business DECADES ago.Into this erstwhile company leaps fiery Phil - a 'rocker ' with all the threat and endangerment of a King Charles Spaniel.Why is n't he a vicar ? The Church would n't have him . Imagine being on your deathbed and the Rev Collins coming to give you comfort and succour ; `` Do n't call me vicar , just call me Phil ... '' and `` Miracles CAN happen '' .I believe you Phil ... .groan.Anyway , you need to show some signs of actually being alive to fight in God 's corner and Phil would fail there and then . Listen to his cd : 'Sussidio ' , 'Two Hearts ' , 'Easy Lover ' . Fibreless . Weak . Tired . Unemotional.Quite clearly , Phil needs SONGS as opposed to nebulous yik-yak , needs dynamite in his arrangements . Something..anything ! 'One More Night ' . Beyond a joke now . Phil 's in the studio , swaying gently to the music . He does n't realise it 's so bad . He 'd stop surely ? Drums pulse gently when they should fire-crack , lyrics barely exist , weedy strings flutter away in the background ... you get the picture . Lethargic . Small . Underwhelming.This stuff is ruthlessly exploitative as well , scientifically aimed at middle aged housewives doing the hoovering , who do n't want anything too demanding , or they 'll get a migraine.It 's stubbornly inward looking , a pompous slop-rock ghetto . A niche , a mono-directional phenomenon , an artistic void , destined for the barren Woolworths shelves ... Nothing on 'Hits ' is good or even mildly diverting . There 's a dramatic chord change towards the end of 'Groovy Kind of Love ' that threatens to rescue the whole song , but , ahh hopes are dashed and we 're soon back on the snoozy track to the rocking chair and oblivion . So close there Phil ... There seems to be a mad , spurious trust between Phil and his audience . I 'd imagine it 's the same kind of thing Daniel O'Donnell has with his . A we-won't-do-anything-awry understanding , beginning in earnest and ending in Switzerland.Maybe some-one should give old Phil a gentle nudge , tell him Justin Heyward 's just released an lp . That 'd get him going ... perhaps.Perhaps he could do a tour , a triple header with Twinkle and Alvin Stardust . Or he could just sleep , bless him . Pop 's dreariest man looks ( and sounds ! ) weary . Just put ` In the Air Tonight ' on and have 40 winks . Shhhh ... ..Do n't go waking him .	-1
Other than a couple of killer tracks , this CD is pretty repetitious and boring when you really listen to it . 'Illin ' in Heaven ' is a total waste of disc space ( the 'F ' word repeated ad naseum - how deep ) , plus 'Praise You ' sounds an awful lot like 'Unbelievable ' by EMF . The Housemartins ( Cook 's band from the 80 's ) simply blow this mess away . No they were n't dance pop , but they had far more depth and variety than found on this limp CD .	-1
this group is way overrated.one beat and the same song over & amp ; over again.if you put beck into the group could you tell the difference ? it 's mindless weak boring music .	-1
I only have a couple techno cds and this is one of them . It 's not my favorite one . I bought it after I heard Praise You on Now 2 and Rockafellar Skank on the radio . I found it good but hard to listen too . There are some songs that are just great and really easy to listen to like Right Here , Right Now , The Rockafellar Skank , In Heaven , Gangster Trippin ' , and Praise You . The rest are hard to listen to . I like Eiffel 65 and Alice Deejay better .	-1
John Cougar Mellencamp have been very uneven throughout his long career with the exceptions of the brilliant `` Lonesome jubilee '' and `` Scarecrow '' . On this album it seems that Mellencamp is trying to start fresh and the self title is sort of evidence of that . The music have more of a modern approach but I do n't think it work at all . It 's very hard to find any song that immediately catches your attention , and `` Your life is now '' is the closest Mellencamp get in that department . Even straight after listening to this album , from the beginning to the end , it 's hard to remember any of the songs , since they are at best mediocre .	-1
If you want to hear some of Bocephus 's music , this is not the album . Lots of ranting , mostly crowd noise , and none of the fun of the studio recordings from the same era ... .	-1
Let me just say that I 'm not a hater of boy bands or pop music . I like pop actually and some boy bands ' songs . I just happen to think that this particular band makes really boring music with no beat and no really special vocals . Nothing about this CD sets it apart accept for it 's extreme blandness .	-1
another one trick pony group.no talent at all.they do run of the mill music and it is really bad.you can put all the boy bands together and you might get one good song ? no you wo n't .	-1
I 'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this crummy CD . 98 Degrees is the worst group EVER ! They are the only group I ever have given 1 star , and the completely deserve it . They are so boring and sound like a bunch of girls on this CD . Their only bearable song ever was & quot ; Give Me One Night ( Una Noche ) & quot ; if you like it , though , DO N'T buy this . It 's not like anything on here .	-1
2 1/2A few standout moments do not justify all the artistic praise in what is essentially consciously experimental , hardcore punk-politics .	-1
ANOTHER HELL-BAD RECORD FROM A SECOND HELL-BAD BAND THIS MONTH . IS JULY 2013 JUST THROTTLING WITH ME THAT MUCH WITH HORRIBLE BANDS ? All this band is capable of is extremely horrifying vocals and screaming that SUCKS VERY BADLY . Not only that , but in the first MOUTH GUTTER BROTH CLUSTERGARBAGE FLOTH track `` Worms of the senses '' , they actually enable a very terrible high-pitch shriekish noise ( NOT FROM THE BAND , and Brody Dalle even is n't able to make a SCREAM that high in a song ) . Is Lostprophets moving to a very high standard here ? Because it looks like Lostprophets may become a descent band . I CA N'T BELIEVE I CHECKED OUT THIS STUPID BAND . When I first checked them out , I though they were going to be only slightly bad , like KillRadio . BUT THEY ARE A POST-HARDCORE BAND . Every single song is just pointless screaming vocals with extremely awful guitars and extremely negative energy . I 'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF FINDING BANDS THAT ARE ABLE TO SUCK THAT BAD . This album is so bad that this TIES with Coral Fang as the worst record , even though I know about other albums that suck JUST as much . This album is offensive not only to rock , but also to any music genre . You know the deal : If this does n't shock you , who are you ?	-1
Billy killed his golden age after the release of the overrated NYLON CURTAIN . He switched to writing lighthearted songs like the overplayed `` Uptown Girl '' , and `` Tell Her About It '' , as the basis of a new album to be released in 1985 . Joel 's songwriting fell victim to decay and his songs no longer were deep or intellectually involved . He would never again turn out any real original material , but only copies of already written songs . AN INNOCENT MAN was clearly evident of Billy 's aging ability.Here , no indepth study is needed . `` An Innocent Man '' is one of the few songs worth listening to . `` Keeping the Faith '' is overrated , and `` Uptown Girl '' is overexposed.Hold off to buy this album until you buy GLASS HOUSES , THE STRANGER , TURNSTILES , or a greatest hits compilation first .

We have another CD with some good , some bad . Basically , the even tracks are the good ones , except for & quot ; This Night & quot ; and & quot ; Keeping the Faith & quot ; , meaning only 3 of the songs are really good .	-1
I 've owned this cd , but did n't keep it for very long because it 's too poppy and slick for my tastes . I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70 's style , and on this offering , he kind of wanted a 50 's or 60 's kind of sound . This stuff is just to slick for this hombre . He never made a solid album , after the release of GLASS HOUSES , in about 1980 . This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about , but if you 've got some integrity , you 'll probably want to steer clear of this one , and buy anything he recorded in the 70 's .	-1
Though a child of the 1980s , `` An Innocent Man '' always sounded to me like an album of no substance merely because it seemed to lack the power that I found back in the 1990s in almost all of Billy Joel 's other works.Nowadays , it is clear to me that a good deal of the apparent power in 1980s music is pure pomp . This , though , makes `` An Innocent Man '' look even more like an album made for the pre-rock masses still very much an important presence during the 1980s.Indeed , it is fair to say that most of the songs on `` An Innocent Man '' do not have any redeeming qualities whatsoever . The title tune , which has at least some weight in it , sounded really slushy even at the time it was released because of the way in which Joel 's voice was put so far up front - at least during the chorus.The other hit single from this album are much , much worse . `` The Longest Time '' was undoubtedly one of the worst moments in pop music history : a hit single so lightweight that it was and is incredibly plain that no melody existed in Joel 's near-spoken voice : he never had any pretensions to be a poet , and no song could show this better . `` Tell Her About It '' and `` Leave A Tender Moment Alone '' were also flyweight in texture and had not a single memorable hook line or melody . Even the soulful `` Tell Her About It '' was redeemed only by its extreme catchiness , but catchiness is something to be expected from a singer who was the most popular musician in Australia for fifteen years . The song itself was lacking in emotion compared with Joel 's other albums , and it has dated so much that it is seldom played even on classic hits radio.If you do n't want to stay in the 1980s , there is no need to buy this even if you like some other Billy Joel album .	-1
This is not one of favourite Bill Joel albums , But it does have some memorable stuff on it among the forgettable cuts . There is the emotional 'An Innocent man ' , 'Uptown Girl ' and Tell her About It ' . The remastering is shrill and tinny , with hardly any bass . this is a shame because all the other BJ albums up to and including 'The nyon Curtain ' Were superbly remastered .	-1
This is where I mark Joel 's decline into fatuousness ( although some would put it earlier ) , and all because of his hooking up with model Christie Brinkley . Her effect on him was rather like Linda McCartney 's on Paul McCartney -- for some reason , she made him stupid . & quot ; Tell Her About It & quot ; and especially & quot ; Uptown Girl & quot ; were his absolute nadir , made more horrible by the preceding nearly perfect albums ( The Stranger , 52nd Street and Glass Houses ) and one fairly good one ( Nylon Curtain ) . To think that this drivel came from the man who wrote & quot ; Honesty , & quot ; & quot ; She 's Got A Way , & quot ; & quot ; New York State of Mind , & quot ; & quot ; My Life , & quot ; and & quot ; Scenes From An Italian Restaurant & quot ; is just appalling . You 'd do much better with ANY of the aforementioned CD titles .	-1
Hot on the heels of the moody and brilliant `` The Nylon Curtain '' album from 1982 , `` An Innocent Man , '' released in 1983 , is a vibrant , mostly upbeat record that contains numerous well-known radio hits . The differences between `` Curtain '' and `` Innocent Man '' could n't be starker -- it 's almost as if Billy Joel emerged from a giant fog and decided to have fun again with his tunes.Unfortunately , this focus on good-time hits from a different era ( the 1950s , I guess ) makes `` An Innocent Man '' a mostly bland , overly pop-sounding , dull listening experience.With its throbbing , lonely bass line and Joel 's observatory lyrics about human nature , the title track on this CD is by far the standout song . Beyond this tune there 's not much to say . Joel was apparently head-over-heels in love in 1983 , but amid his giddiness he forgot to add melody and hooks to songs like `` Careless Talk , '' `` This Night '' and `` Easy Money . '' The rollicking `` Christie Lee '' eventually grew on me , but it 's miles away from Joel 's best rockers.Some might argue that `` An Innocent Man '' features several of the finest tracks available by Billy Joel . It 's certainly hard to deny the chart success of `` The Longest Time , '' `` Tell Her About it , '' `` Uptown Girl '' and `` Keeping the Faith . '' If you like simplistic and saccharine , with lyrics that are a tad self-possessed , then these tunes are for you . Personally , I liked it better when Joel was on a plane and in a fog ... in Scandinavian skies .	-1
Cold Spring Harbor was originally released in the early '70s on a small label . The album was terrific classic Joel , although the vinyl pressing was not : Someone goofed when mastering the album , and sped the tape up by about 8 % , making Joel sound something like a deep-throated chipmonk . The record sold zilch and went out of print long before Joel became a star . In the mid '80s , with Joel now a megastar , it was announced that the album would be remastered and re-released . That was great news to the fans who knew and loved the first effort.But they did n't just remaster and re-release the album . Instead , Joel played with it . He remixed it . He added instruments . He changed the whole sound of the album . What finally emerged was a travesty : Lethargic , uninvolving , lacking most of the charm of the original.I suppose this will do ( and will have to do ) for those without turntables and/or without an interest in record collecting . But be aware that it 's nothing more than a hollow echo of the real beast that owns this name.For shame .	-1
My biggest problem with Joel 's first few albums other than weak production and vanilla session musicians was that Joel 's voice sounds a little too & # 34 ; wimpy & # 34 ; for lack of a better term . He would n't achieve that stronger singing voice until The Stranger but it did get better and better with every release after Cold Spring Harbor . My second problem is the melodramatic lyrics found on most of these tunes . The two stars are basically for the obvious piano playing talent Joel displays here and three songs , She 's Got A Way , Everybody Loves You Know , and Nocturn . And both SGAW and EBLYN can be found in much , much , MUCH better versions on Songs In The Attic , which makes me wonder what other songs on Cold Spring Harbor would 've sounded better with Phil Ramone and Joel 's core road band of the late 70 's early 80 's backing him . Still , this album and his last album River Of Dreams are the two most shelved albums of all of Billy 's in my collection .	-1
Billy Joel , though he was losing his songwriting ability , had somewhat rebounded from THE BRIDGE with a better album , STORM FRONT . It is a history lesson and largely reflects on the cold war and the struggles of the baby boom generation . & quot ; We Did n't Start the Fire & quot ; is the obvious single . & quot ; I Go to extremes & quot ; lacks the guitar depth of & quot ; You may be right & quot ; . It is pointless to go into specifics . Summed up , the album can not hold its own in comparision to GLASS HOUSES or THE STRANGER , . It is probably on a par with PIANO MAN . It is only worth listening to one time only.Save this one for later ... ..	-1
When I heard that Whitney had a new album , I rushed out to buy it . I have been a Whitney fan from the very beginning , and I could n't wait to hear her latest compilation . What a disappointment . The songs on this album are a pitiful attempt to appease to 13 and 14 year old kids who know nothing about the texture of music . While there is nothing wrong with an artist experimenting with different styles of music ( it keeps the creative juices going ) , I fear that Whitney chose the style of music on this album only to make sure that Generation X ( what a bore ) would purchase it . Or maybe , she just ca n't do the strong ballad anymore due to smoking or perhaps she 's too busy monitoring her husband . Anyway , Whitney , go back to the old landmark -- the passionate ballads that made you who you are today . You never really could get the r & amp ; b thing down but that 's o.k. , we love you anyway . Hopefully , you will listen to critical commentary rather than record sales the next time around ... ..	-1
This album is definitely not the big success that Whitney 's diehard fanbase would like to believe . It failed to make the top 10 of Billboard and while it did manage to gain many moderately successful singles , nothing here can hide the fact that Whitney Houston 's glory days are over.Much of that is caused by a poor choice of material . Whitney selected a bunch of midtempo songs that neither entice nor excite the listener . Her attempt at tackling a big ballad , & quot ; I learned from the best & quot ; , fails because of poor production values ( whoever picked that dated keyboard sound really needs to be fired ) . Houston 's vocals are also desperately below par ; she is no longer the expressive vocalist that she once was.Still , the album 's biggest fault lies in its pretention that Whitney Houston is a contemporary R & amp ; B artist . Houston was an exceptionnally gifted , soulful pop vocalist who could infuse the most generic songs with palpable emotion , and invest them as if her life depended on it . It was n't just a question of belting notes or holding them forever - she had feeling just as much as she mastered the singing techniques . Nowadays , she 's just a lazy vocalist relying on special guests , background singers and production tricks . She has been losing steadily her audience by pretending that she 's an R & amp ; B artist , but the scary truth is that she 's not convincing at all in that area. & quot ; My love is your love & quot ; does have a few bright spot - the title track is one of these songs that slowly grow on you , and & quot ; Until you come back to me & quot ; is one of her most convincing ballads in ages . The rest is just forgettable and mildly enjoyable filler . Buy her & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; package instead - you 'll get the singles from this album , but you will spare yourself the rest of this pathetic attempt at sucking up to the R & amp ; B community .	-1
If this is her big comeback cd , she should be afraid , very afraid . Listening to this stuff , and the techno remixes of it in the clubs was was like a combination of waking up from a huge hangover and watching a movie , but the second and third reels of the film are missing . I was left really confused at hearing this stuff . This is Whitney Houston 's new career saver and new sound ? Sorry , but your time has come and gone , and that time was back in the 80s and early 90s . You 've lost that great voice that once could n't be topped , and now she 's doing forgettable junk that sounds like throwaways that other artists passed on . Honestly , her last greatest cd was The Bodyguard Soundtrack . What a waste of a talent . Guess that 's what happens when you marry Bobby Brown : you hang out with a loser and sooner or later you become one . Whitney is no winner with this dud . I 'm only rating it one star for the song I Learned The Best From You . I rest of the cd is so forgetable i could n't recall it if i tried .	-1
nevber did like this song when she was living and yes living proof that drugs do kill and yes we were all wearned about the dangers of drug use cocaine is a mutha .	-1
Ice Cube was yet to release a bad album when this came out . I decided to buy it since Ice Cube is one of my favorite artists , but there is n't 1 good track on this entire CD . It is truly the only album I own that I would give a 1 star rating to , and I have some other fairly bad albums . Please do not listen to this if you want to hear good Ice Cube , any other release from him will do , but not this . His lyrics have gotten to be stupid at times , but by far the worst aspect of this album is the TERRIBLE production . I am not feeling the whole rock vibe at all , I mean it 's cool Cube is expanding his musical horizons , but this is n't that way to do . Thankfully Cube 's nex release , Volume 2 The Peace Disk was much better .	-1
Ice Cube was at his best in the days of Amerikkkaz Most Wanted , Death Certificate , The Preadator and Lethal Injection . He kept it gangsta but at least he slipped you some solid gems through the music . Unfortunately this album is not even touching those albums whether in content or production . Although I understand why he had to back down , I dont understand why would he make himself a laughing stock with this album . This album sounds like an experimental rap album that was poorly executed . The Good : Ask About Me is a good opener . In the song Ghetto Vet ( which was also in the I Got The Hook Up soundtrack ) Ice Cube talks about being paralyzed by gun violence and songs like 3 Strikes You In and Penitentiary remind you vaguely of the old school Ice Cube . Dr Frankenstein and F*** Dying with Korn are also highlights . The Bad : Pushin Weight was a stupid single and Mr Short Khop sucks ! Greed sucked on the Gang Related soundtrack and it sucks now . Ice Cube destroys any fond memories of Once Upon A Time In The Projects with a weak sequel and Cash Over *** will have tapping the skip button with the quickness . The Ugly : The Pecking Order and The Curse Of Money is hot garbage . Limos Demos and Bimbos and X-******* are Ice Cube at his sophomoric worst but as bad as they are they are pale in comparison to the grotesque If I Was F****** You . Bottom Line : This album is a disgrace to the west coast veteran and is Ice Cube 's worst album ever . The production was awful ( did every song have to have an eerie beat to it ? ) and Ice Cube kept talking about the main stuff . Dont mistake this album as Ice Cube 's best and all you kids that keep saying that he stopped making good albums after The Predator need to check yourself . Lethal Injection will still be reached for after all these years when War And Peace Vol 1 will be catching dust like it should .	-1
Is this the same man who was one Amerikkas Most Wanted ? I do n't think so . This cd is pure garbage just like everything he 's put out since Lethal Injection . The only thing decent he 's recently done is Children of the Korn and that wasnt even on his album . The man has totally lost it . Whats up with those dumb a @ # interludes thats pretty sad that u got ta put 10 seconds of Master P talkin nonsense to sell your album . If you have 15 dollars to blow give it to a bum instead of buying this .	-1
A couple of decent tracks ( Round out the Tank , Whacha want Whacha Need ) are n't worth your money . Most of this record is lyrically idiotic and musically weak ; nothing but an example of shameless pandering . Mystikal has an interesting style though , full of fire and loud and soulful . With some sophistication and a little non-existent integrity he might actually become an artist one day .	-1
So many people loved this album , but I just do n't see it . The music is dull and sparse , containing no memorable hooks , and the lyrics just ramble on and on , with no real rhyme . How could this same woman have written Jagged Little Pill only ... oh , yeah , and why did she wait so long to release a follow-up ? By this point , the world just did not care anymore . And what 's with the cover art ? The only songs I like are & quot ; Unsent & quot ; and & quot ; One , & quot ; but even those do n't affect me like any of the tracks on Jagged Little Pill . I kind of wish she 'd left out some of these songs and put in & quot ; Uninvited & quot ; and & quot ; No Pressure Over Cappuccino. & quot ; But oh well ... hopefully , some of these tunes will come into their own when Alanis performs them in concert . She 's awesome to see live , go check her out if you get the chance !	-1
In between recordings , Alanis lost something along the way , but gained something else . That something she gained was maturity and a way with words . Her words on the album are powerful , and much stronger than on her first . But yet that something she lost was everything that helped Jagged Little Pill swallow 16 million fans ! This album seems more of a journal or a documentry than an album . Gone are the great sounds mixed with her agressive lyrics . Uninvited made me yurn for a follow up , but this is not a follow up . She is a different artist here , and that is a bad thing in her case . Pill was a cd that was one of the top 10 albums of the 90s , but here she seems to change , thanks to her indian voyage . There are some good songs ! Thank U is great , and Joining you and So Pure are also worthy of Alanis ' name . But the rest of the songs on the cd are nothing like Alanis ' first cd ! Are You Still Mad tries to bring back that fire from You Oguhtta Know , but it fails to hit the same cord . I applued artists for changing , but she seems to change to the point where she is someone different . The cd is worth buying if you are a die hard fan , but if you are trying to get a follow up to the succesful Jagged Little Pill , you might want to get another perscription !	-1
Since she was angry and depressed on 'Jagged Little Pill ' , what 's next ? We are dealing here with a mellower version of the first album , rehashing similar themes , like the self-fulfilling prophesy of failure.A totally forgettable venture .	-1
Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of the most eccentric albums to have been released in the 90 's . Nobody can dismiss it as a complete failure because it genuinely does have its moments . But then of course there are songs like `` Front Row '' or `` One '' ( to name just a few ) that are shamelessly self-indulgent and should never have been released to the commercial public . The problem with Alanis , is that she has never been able to leave some things to a listener 's imagination . What helped `` Jagged Little Pill '' become one of the ten best-selling albums of all time in the United States is that the lyrics were personal , but generic enough to still spark the fascination of listeners . In the case of `` Supposed Former , '' the lyrics are painstakingly overwritten well beyond the point of gratuitousness and rather than follow a coherent format , they meander . This sort of no-holds-barred lyrical approach suits certain songs -- '' Baba , '' `` Thank U , '' `` The Couch , '' and `` So Pure '' at least adhere their obscure lyrics to a structured melody . If all art is valid , then everyone should have a painting hanging up in the Louvre , but the sign of a true artist is one who can temper their artistic integrity in a manner that engages others . `` Jagged Little Pill '' was a catchy , poignant , emotive masterpiece that struck a nerve with tens of millions of people . `` Supposed Former , '' on the other hand , is far too self-involved and should have remained in the pages of Alanis ' diary ; where such clumsy , wordy , overreaching attempts at poetry belong . Unfortunately , this killed whatever momentum `` Jagged Little Pill '' had created and permanently closed the door on Alanis for tens of millions of fans .	-1
However , that 's not what I 'm here to discuss . I am here to confront a song I heard on WSHE 100.3 in Orlando , and this was around Sept./Oct . 1998 . I know it was from this album , and it was the ending of the song , and she sang about `` Arse '' , and then does a harmonica solo . I 've narrowed it down to 2 songs , and they are : `` That I Would Be Good '' , and `` UR '' . I use the word `` Arse '' because if I used the real word she sings this review will never be posted . Anyway the rest of this album is all over the place . It starts off with a pretty good song called `` Front Row '' which is a rather strong dance tune , but then it gel into hard rock sludge with `` Baba '' , and from there it just seems to run the gauntlet . It was just alot of spitting in the wind as far as I 'm concerned , and to me there has to be a better reason to visit India .	-1
Baby , all you 're diary entries ca n't be songs ! Alanis is surely one of the most pretenious , boring , annoying , andself-absored women in pop.No substance and no sense of humor.Howin the world does this woman sell records ? Does Madonna and the folks at Maverick persaude Madonna 's huge fanbase to buy it or something ? I 'm not trying to down all of Alanis ' fans because like another pretenious , dull singer/songwriter I dislike Tori Amos a lot of people have healed to her music.This is n't a diss to Alanis ' fans but to Alanis herself.Hey , since she 's so self-important maybe she 'll take a trip to India ( which inspriredthis album 's first single & quot ; Thank U & quot ; ) again and she 'll become so & quot ; inspired & quot ; that she 'll quite singing and I do n't know ... write a book.Yeah do that Alanis , anything to stop you from making records !	-1
My track-reincarnation has a three tiered process.Its goal is to keep , to any possible extent , as many of the buyers of J.L.P . as possible . This task involves trying to keep the same sound as J.L.P . while still introducing an evolution of alanis yet keeping a pop feel.By `` mainstreaming '' S.F.I.J. , less `` newbies '' would be turned off , and less `` trendfollowers would be `` put off '' , hence maximizing the retention of buyers.This entire process may only add 1 to 2 million buyers , as JLP was a geniune misnomer , and Napster was in full effect . But still , its worth it to keep Alanis Revelant to pop culture.Task 1 : Editing and Removing from the original tracklist from 18 to a more digestible 12 tracks . Removed:2 . `` Baba '' - 4:305 . `` Sympathetic Character '' ( Morissette ) - 5:137 . `` The Couch '' - 5:248 . `` Ca n't Not '' - 4:3611 . `` One '' - 4:4116 . `` Heart of the House '' ( Morissette ) - 3:4717 . `` Your Congratulations '' ( Morissette ) - 3:55Task 2 : Reconfiguring play list and adding more pop-friendly tracksS*** denotes official single release **Task 3 : Try to Mirror the Sonic Order of J.L.P. , song for song1 . `` Joining You '' ( pop blend remix , add harmonica lol ) S**2 . `` Thank U '' S**3 . `` That I Would Be Good '' S**4 . `` UR '' 5 . `` Princess Familiar '' ** S**6 . `` Would Not Come '' 7 . So Pure S**8 . `` Uninvited '' S**9 . `` These R The Thoughts '' **10 . `` Unsent '' S**11 . `` Front Row '' ( pop blend remix , more chorus , less verse ) 12 . `` I Was Hoping '' 13 . `` Are You Still Mad '' ( Hidden Track ) JLP had 6 official singles / releases . This re-order attempts to mimic that by adding Uninvited ( a number 1 single ) , and release Princess Familiar as a single.and wallah ! there you have it , a fortified , more cohesive Mainstream Friendly HIT album by A.M. ! ! This re-structure helps ward of the sophomoric slump rumours ! ! !	-1
& quot ; Jagged Little Pill & quot ; is possibly my favorite CD of the 1990 's so I had high expectations for this one , but it was a real let down . Almost every song on & quot ; Pill & quot ; jumped off the radio or CD player and demanded your attention , I can barely remember a thing about the new CD after 3 listens . I hate the intros to half the songs . Alanis does not have a & quot ; beautiful & quot ; voice , and she needs tough arrangements around her songs to bring out its qualities . I am really disappointed in this one . I wanted to love it .	-1
Truthfully , i find Alanis Morissette to be one of the most overhyped , overrated females in music today . I do n't care that she has a new cd out called Under Rug Swept which all the fans are gushing over . That song Hands Clean was one of the most overplayed songs on FM radio that summer it was released . What many of her fans seem to forget is that long before she came out with Jagged Little Pill , and long before she started putting her last name on her cds , she was simply known as Alanis and was doing clever and original-sounding dance pop that was fun and exciting , not angry self-absorbed , whiny trips to the psychiatrist 's couch , which is what most of her songs now are . Back then she had two excellent dance cds and a promising career as a pop artist . PLUS , check out the photos in the cd booklets of those two early dance cds and you 'll see a totally different-looking Alanis . You would n't believe the way she used to look . Gorgous as hell , compaired to the dog she is now . She looked NOTHING like she does now . Man , she was a total babe back then , compared to the way she looks now with her long greasy-looking hair plastered to her head that looks in need of a good shampoo . If you saw the sensual way she used to look you 'd think she was just a victim of being lazy about her appearance now . She totally abandoned her dance pop roots in favor of doing songs that are half singing and mostly talking over an acoustic guitar riff , with barely any of the lyrics rhyming . I mean the song where she is reading the unsent letters written to her different ex-boyfriends is beyond stupid ! She might as well open up the phone book and half read/half sing the names and phone numbers and it would be just as interesting . How about putting in some words that rhyme now and then , Alanis ? Otherwise you just come off as some self-indulgent , self-absorbed artsy fartsy who thinks the world wants to hear about all the guys you dated and failed miserably with . I hope Madonna 's record company , Maverick , drops you eventually for boring and frustrating us with your whiny rantings . If you 're the best Canada has to offer in the music industry then i 'm ashamed to say i live in Canada . Go back to the 90s and stay there .	-1
I liked her first album a lot better . I can still listen to it , some 7 years later . But this one ? Nyah . I 've listened to it several times , and it has never grabbed me . But others seemed to like it , so maybe I 'm just missing something . My recommendation ? If you can , borrow it before you buy it .	-1
I do n't think anyone can deny that Jimi Hendrix was a great guitarist . But musical prowess alone does not a good album make , y'know what I 'm saying ? In my opinion , people were so caught up with Jimi 's talent as a musician that they failed to notice ( on the most part ) that his talents as a song-writer were very simple . Much of these songs are very standard and merely impress with Jimi soloing over them . Add to that that much of what Jimi did was improvisation with little direction and what is left is really rather boring . Purple Haze and Voodoo Child are great songs , but the fact that many people have only heard of them ( they would n't hear names like If 6 Was 9 or The Wind Cries Mary and think & quot ; Aaah ! Jimi Hendrix & quot ; ) may explain why.I know I 've done little here except make a load of people angry but I 'm not afraid to speak out against the greats if I do n't like them .	-1
Clearly , CREAM , at their flying best , cruise all over Jimi 's experience . A lot of Jimi 's super-rockers do n't sound much better than fuzz-toned noise . Can anyone , beyond rock fans who may not have explored much else , seriously suggest that & quot ; Are You Experienced & quot ; , & quot ; Purple Haze & quot ; , & quot ; Crosstown Traffic & quot ; , & quot ; Manic Depression & quot ; , & quot ; Fire & quot ; and most of the others , can be listened to on a regular basis ? They 're too loud , and tuneless , and they even seemed so to this grizzled Boomer when he first heard them ages ago . Still , Jimi was close to a wizard with his unique guitar work , melody , and lyrics on three slow ones : & quot ; Wind Cries Mary & quot ; , & quot ; Little Wing & quot ; , and & quot ; Castles Made of Sand & quot ; , three songs which even CREAM could not improve on if they tried .	-1
Yes.I said it.Hendrix WAS not the `` best guitar player '' of all time.Not at all.He was good.Please do n't misunderstand me , but he was n't the so called genius that people try to make him out to be.There were so many other guitar players out there who were a million times better than Hendrix ever was.Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of them guitarists.He took the song `` Voodoo Child '' and made it his own.Hendrix could have only wished to play that song the way Stevie did.There are great guitar players out there that are underrated and do not get the respect that they deserve , such as Robin Trower.I am just so sick of people holding up Hendrix like he was a God or something.Most of the `` music '' he played was nothing but a bunch of noise.Listen to him play `` the star spangled banner '' .He used so much distortion to cover up all of his mistakes.The only time he could ever play a song all the way through is when he was high as a damn kite.I am just telling it like it is folks.Jimi Hendrix is the most overrated guitar player ever .	-1
Juvenile is the perfect example of a rapper who waste great beats . He has great beats some better more talented rapper can use but he takes them for his amateur , elementary lyrics . His flow and his delivery is horrible . He has no originality and cant rhyme worth a damn . He just uses `` aye '' `` yeah '' `` yo '' at the end of each line to make it rhyme.Only good thing about the trash is the beats and throwing distance .	-1
WHAT is wrong with you people ? This CD is not worth buying . Cash Money is already played out . None of the CMR rappers have talent . No Limit is better than Cash Money because they have at least 2 or 3 rappers wit talent . I ca n't believe that SO many people like down south music . If there there was a Canibus CD on the shelf and a Juvie CD . I bet 95 percent of the people would buy the Juvenile album . What is the world comin ' to ? Real rappers like Reakwon , Canibus , Killa Priest , Common . They all gettin ' sleeped on ! You got ta start listening to rappers with talent , and not just makin ' up any word that rhymes .	-1
I 've got to give juvy credit , one mans trash is anothers treasure . He made this junk , ( ... ) If these youngsters are what I have to look forward too in rap I think I 'll change to country and western . ( ... )	-1
The music 's terrible . The lyrics are weak and not creative at all , the beats do n't flow like they should , and the background music on all of the songs are annoying . However ... it makes a wonderful object to throw around the house . Play catch with your dog , it will love it ! Also makes a good hammer too . The CD will be trashed afterwards ... but that 's not a bad thing , now is it ? The CD actually sounds like it makes sense when it 's all scratched up . It even sounds decent . Give it a whirl , why do n't ya ? ? ! !	-1
Do n't get me wrong I love the Cardigans but the only song I ever put into my iPod is `` My Favourite Game . '' Like much of the Cardigans catalogue , there are a lot of less than stellar tracks . They 're a singles band really .	-1
Listening to this album made me furious ! I mean , the Cardigans were once known for being a 60 's style pop band with a special talent to write dreamy pop songs.Along with the Sundays , Saint Ettienne and Cinnamon , they were one of those groups which proved that being innocent is not necesserily a bad point in the music world.So their development was really heart breaking for me.There 's nothing like & quot ; Carnival & quot ; or & quot ; Fine & quot ; here.Most of the tracks are full of loops and enervating refrains.No chance to find a snare or a xylophone , that 's for sure.The & quot ; Life & quot ; album seems to be long forgotten by the members of the group.Ofcourse & quot ; The first band on the moon & quot ; showed a slight new direction but i could never imagine what would follow.The thing is that bands like Morcheeba and Garbage can write this kind of music surely much better than the Swedes and i also think that Nina 's voice is loosing all it 's magic and beautiness by singing all this electro-junk.This is definetely the biggest dissapointment i ever experienced as a music fan .	-1
On this one , the lyrics take a darker , more cynical tone , ( `` Do you really think/that love is gon na save the world ? '' from `` Do you Believe ? '' is just one example ) and the music adds quite a bit of electronic elements , even dabbling at times in trip-hop . In and of itself , growth and change is what keeps a band from stagnating , and generally I 'm in favour of a band shifting from its strengths and struggling to find new ones.One thing that 's non-negotiable in the search for new sounds , though , is strong hooks . The real problem with this album is there are n't enough `` Wow ! '' moments : those songs that grab you and make you sing along.FIRST BAND ON THE MOON had `` Lovefool '' and `` Been It '' along with their cover of `` Iron Man '' and `` Never Recover '' , all of which became stuck in your head with enough play . That just is n't happening for me with this one for the most part.HIGHLIGHTS : '' My Favourite Game '' is the only immediate grabber here and a fairly gritty number for the Cardies . `` Erase/Rewind '' grafts a drum rhythm reminiscent of Queen 's `` Another One Bites the Dust '' onto a shimmering keyboard part . `` Starter '' is a midtempo trip-hop number about reinventing yourself . ( `` Turning the pages/I used to hang on to/I was young and I have changed my mind/and I 'm leavin ' everything behind '' ) LOWS : '' Nil '' is a limp instrumental coda to the CD.BOTTOM LINE : If you loved the bubbly pop of `` First Band on the Moon '' , you 'll be disappointed in this . Even taken on its own trip-hop terms , I ca n't really say it compares favourably with Portishead and the like . Color me unimpressed .	-1
First listen : `` What ? ... Just `` My favourite Game '' is good ? no , here must be another good song '' Second : `` Ok , now i know this is a waste of time '' third : `` Do you believe '' `` Junk of the Hearts '' `` Erase/Rewind '' and maybe just maybe `` Paralized '' could be so-so tracks.CONCLUSION : I want my money back.The entired cd is so slow , calm , and i was waiting some strong tracks , whit fast rythms ... but i got this . Nina Person ( The blond singer ) have a nice voice , but whit this album i was fooled like a tourist in a foreing land .	-1
I read the reviews and went straight to buy this album . What a dissapointment ! I would recommend to skip this one , except for Here Today , maybe my favourite song of his after the Beatles . If this song ever surfaces on a compilation , get that and forget about this one . Any other of his records from the 90 's is better than this one .	-1
I am very amazed that most of the reviews are so positive regarding the sound.The sound is terrible , in fact I gave my sacd to a buddy because the sound was so bad I could not listen to it . The sonics are flat , no low end , no dynamics flat treble and midrange . Lifeless and dull . There is just no doubt about this , so how can people write thatthe sound is good ? I have about 100 sacd 's , so I should know.The music is also overrated , but some tracks are good .	-1
This is a weak effort . Sure her lyrics are pretty good ( hence the second star ) but the high school talent show guitar playing and her countryish voice are not getting it done . I could n't pay attention to one song long enough to remember it . While riding in the car trying to listen to this my mind wandered everywhere and I looked doen and thought , track 12 , already ? I know that this makes some of you psuedo-intellectuals feel & quot ; smart & quot ; when you listen to it , but I suggest you take a course in Differential Equations for that . I love & quot ; Who Will Save Your Soul & quot ; , and wait for an album that sounds like that song , but until then I 'm going to pick on my wife for buying this for me for Christmas ( I could have gotten the Partridge Family 's Greatest Hits cheaper ) .	-1
Juel 's bored look on the album cover perfectly reflects the music it contains . Great for insomniacs .	-1
When I 'd bought this cd , the only other jewel album I owned was & quot ; Pieces of You & quot ; ( AWESOME by the way ) . Since i loved her cd so much , i decided to buy her next one with one of my favorite songs on it , Hands . But once i listened to the cd , believe it or not , i only liked 2 songs on the whole cd . ( hands and enter from the east ) All of her other songs were kind of boring . No beat , nothing but acoustic on most -- which is my favorite instrument -- but none of the songs touched me at all . I dont think I 'll be buying any of her newer cds . Pieces of you was a beautiful cd . I dont know what really happened , but this cd is n't worth any of your money . I 'm not even going to waste my time with scoring them . The two songs i liked would rank a 9 and 10. but all the others would probably rank 4 and down .	-1
for a start this album shouldnt really be called greatest hits , because its a kind of contradiction in terms.oh yeah , i forgot , tupac was an , erm , contradiction.wasnt he ? `` im a pimp and ive got a big stick that a hit hoez with '' , followed by `` i really love and cherish women '' .thats a reeaalll contradiction isnt it . `` ive got loads of guns and im great at using them '' , followed by `` we all in the struggle brothers lets fight the powers '' . could it be that to fill time on loads of double disk lps etc he has to contradict himself so he doesnt run out of things to say ? nah , surely not.what , the beats are standard lukewarm 'wesside ' fare ? nah , you 're kidding me on . anyway , cut the junk this is overlong by at least a disk , if you own `` all eyes on me '' then theres no real need to own this . `` 2 of americas most wanted '' , `` to live and die in LA '' , and of course `` cali love '' , are the only 2pac songs i ever listen to . his rapping style is annoying to say the least , how anyone can say his flow is entertaining is beyond me , and the least said about the guest features the better.how is 2pac so popular ? probably because he got shot and people suddenly believe hes a mafia gambino , but to be honest i dont think thats true at all . one thing that really annoys me is the tyrade of material released after his death.its a shame that his family and record label etc feel the need to cash in on his death by putting out stuff that he 'd never have wanted out.they are urinating on his grave.if there was any justice for him they would have released the greatest hits and left it at that.maybe he wouldve been a great rapper if he 'd lived longer and had time to mature , who knows.but all i know is he is dead and nothing will change that.its a shame really , but that doesnt excuse the fact he didnt leave an entertaining back catalogue.which is a shame , it really is.i liked above the rim , so dont say im a mindless pac hater.really deserves 1 out of 5 , but since he wasnt alive and had no say over his greatest hits it gets 2 out of 5 , more out of sympathy than anything else .	-1
How easy is it to rap ? How easy is it to compose lyrics such as `` i like to smoke weed '' anyone who listens to this crap is enducated and stupid.The day music died was when MTV started airing this junk.The world is still a better place knowing talented genres such as rock and metal exist .	-1
Im a big hip hop fan , my favorites being Drake , Lil Wayne , Soulja Boy , Limp Bizkit , Vanilla Ice , and MC Hammer ... but lately ive noticed alot of folks seem to dislike good musicz . Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap . things were great before fakes started taking over the scene ! Studio gangsters like NWA , Snoop Dogg , Warren G , Ice Cube , 2Pac , and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this 2Pac faked his death to make more money ! I mean comon , its sooooooo obvious hes not dead . If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale ? Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck ! ! Stupid songs like `` 2 of Amerikas Most hated '' and `` Hit em up '' have STUDIO GANGSTER written all over them ! For good hip hop stick with Kid Rock , Limp Bizkit , Akon , and Lil Drake .	-1
Please avoid this album and any 2pac album . I used to think 2pac was a great rapper because I was blinded by his `` Thugish '' attitude which I thought was very cool when I was young and dumb . As I grown up , I learned the real deal . I sat down to listen to some of his records , then I was shocked at how wack his music is . Please avoid .	-1
I 'm not gon na bash Pac or rap in this like most of the other folks did but I will give you a genuine review ... whereas the songs are good on this album they lack the beauty of smile ... Until The End Of Time etc etc ... now I gave this a one specifically for that reason ... to this day smile is played on MTV ... be it Scarface or not Pac was in it ... anyways ... due to lacking them songs it was weak ... it seemed slapped together	-1
Never really liked this cat West coast rap never really moved me plus he wears a gay perm ... .WTF ? ? ? that was never hip hop thats some wack pimp garbage ... .one love to tru headz ... .real niggas is still watching and listening ...	-1
DJ Quik is a great producer , but this album does not show his skills as a rapper . NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
This is the WORST of the Wu.RZA here is trying to play Kool Keith ( i.e . the a.k.a. , the mask , the cape ) . Him ripping off Kool Keith ( even if it is better priduced ) is no where near as fun as listening to Sex Style for the first time oneself , and does n't even come close to touching Dooom or Octagon.So what is redeeming in this album ? Hmm . Some of the lyrics are clever . 'Girl you look as pretty as a brand new glock/or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox ' is about the best line that I have ever heard . There are a couple tracks that expand upon the Wu-formula to great success . BUT , please , if you want an underground album where they are going to play aliases , etc . buy Kool Keith , and if you want a well produced album , buy Peanut Butter Wolf or something.I 'm going to get ripped for writing a bad review of this album . Sorry .	-1
This album is just too strange for a true Wu-Tang fan to be able to appreciate . RZA is at his best when using a sample-based production style . Tracks like `` Domestic Violence '' , although they could be done better , are RZA 's bread and butter . This album shows that when RZA decides to create a track without samples , the outcome will dissapoint . He 's an arranger , not a musician.Some of the beats sound like someone 's little sister sitting at a casio , pounding random keys out of time ( and I am speaking about one of my favorite producers of all time here ) .This album is not Wu-Tang style . Be clear on that if you 're thinking of buying . It 's RZA experimenting with a new sound . He is in unfamiliar territory now and he 'd better find his way home soon .	-1
RZA is not a rapper and unfortunately he reminds us about that throughout this album ...	-1
MY MIND WAS BLANK AS TO WHAT HAPPEN , WHEN I PERCHASE THIS A WHILE BACK ... .WHEN I WAS ON TAPE 'S ... SURE I WHENT , AND GOT THE TAPE ... NO DISS FOR RZA , , , BUT THE BEAT 'S WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE , FOR THOSE NICE BEAT 'S ... HE DID FOR ODB , GHOST FACE , PLUS OTHERS ! ! !	-1
I know that Richard was the talent with the arranging and writing and Karen 's history , but the breadth of what I expected here was more originals vice rehashing other 's work .	-1
A Kind Of Hush is a better than good album . Richard Carpenter has stated that he felt Horizon had a drag to it ( which is not true . Horizon is the Carpenters ' best album ) but he continued to state that he felt A Kind Of Hush is inferior to Horizon . Regardless that A Kind Of Hush is n't the best Carpenters album it is still worth purchasing for the die-hard fan . It has a few excellent songs . Including the experimental Boat To Sail , a great recording of Ca n't Smile Without You and the beautiful One More Time . I happen to really like `` Goofus '' with it 's sharp arrangement and nostalgic feel . While some of the songs are not Karen 's best performances , she still shines as she brings each song on this album to life .	-1
No heartfelt ballads . Nothing like 'I need to be in love ' . This is lifeless pap . 'Strength of a woman ' is bland and has a cringwworthy title . 'Back in my life again ' is a bad synth piece of sappy bollox . I am amazed someone can compare this to the mid 1970 's genius the Carpenters were puting out . 'Beechwood 4-5789 ' , errr no . Just yuck . Some of this just goes over my head.The good stuff ? There are two good tracks . 'Somebody 's lyin ' is a nice , melodic ballad in their usual style . 'Because we are in love ' ( The Wedding Song ) is a gorgeous orchestral ballad , written by Richard . This is the one true standout on the album.The magic seems to be gone here . Sorry .	-1
Anyonw who gives this a fair review must be a family meber of Clue or Clue himself ! Who on earth does he think he is ? If shouting out your name is all it takes to be a DJ , I guess I have it made ! Apart from getting some pretty slick songs and putting them together in a nice neat package , he is the worst person in the music industry ( even below Max Martin , and I hate Max Martin ... ) . I do n't understand why he has to shout his name at the beginning of the song . Anyone who has heard and of the rare songs he seems to get will not tell you that they really love the part when he shouts out his name at the beginning of the song . an even better question would be what the F @ # K he says at the end ( my cousin an i debate that it is either him saying 'ENOUGH ! ENOUGH ! ENOUGH ! ' or 'BLAH ! BLAH ! BLAH ! ' ) . Anyway , leave this alone . Anyone who has not heard anything by him is lucky . Those of us who have will never recover .	-1
Well , DJ Clue is one lousy DJ . He does n't make his own beats like DJ Primo who is the total antithesis and clue 's ego is quite irritating when he starts yelling over the tracks in total reverberation . I do n't usually diss DJ 's but DJ Clue only redemption is his ability to bring together a community of solid artists .	-1
I was really disapointed at this album , most of the beats is the worst I ever heard ... The beats makes NO LIMIT 's early producers sounds like GODS ! U will be greatly dissapointed , buy IT 's DARK AND HELL IS HOT instead it 's DMX 's greatest , they could have easily removed 6 wack songs from this album and made it an EP instead	-1
Terrible , Terrible . What a waste . These songs sound like they were done overnight . It almost sounded like he had nothing to say . There is prabably 1 good song on the album . This is nothing like the first .	-1
This album is proof that time yields better results . This sounds like DMX made it in one day . It really ai n't good at all . Their are a few dope songs , but as an album , this one is garbage . Dark and Hell Is Hot is leagues and bounds better than this [ one ] .	-1
I guess this says you can have the brains and overall dynamics of a Welding Bench and be a success in Hip-Hop . Oh yeah , great album cover . That little Drum machine thud ( or & quot ; beat as these cretins call it ) only kills enjoyment for me . The lyrics are poorly written , casually vulgar , and ostensibly subhuman . Sad .	-1
I am a huge Silkk and No-Limit fan . I got this cd when it first came out and hated it . It had 2 or 3 good songs . I went back to give it another chance last night years and years later since it 's release and it still sucks to me .	-1
Following the release of Silkk the Shocker 's platinum album Charge it 2 da game , P 's younger brother received a lot of critical acclaim . His second effort fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessor.Packed with appearances from Master P , Jay-Z , Snoop Dogg , Mya , C-Murder and Mystikal , Silkk is often lost in the mix . What is missing is the intensity displayed on Charge it 2 da game . For example , there is no soldier anthem , and even the guests are dissapointing.A few good tracks like `` Somebody like me '' with Mya or `` Southside playas '' with big bro C-Murder ca n't save the album . The entire thing seems hasty , as if it has been thrown together in a single day.This marked the collapse of P 's once invincible empire . Most of the original soldiers jumped ship and P 's releases went virtually unnoticed by once die-hard no limit fans . These days P is trying to re-build the empire he created 7 years ago . You can only sympathize .	-1
How can someone make a CD that is THIS BAD ? The only track that stands out are song # 3 and 14 . This is the worst album I 've EVER heard from the No Limit family and there could n't be something that 's worse than this . Silkk 's skills has degraded vastly and now it 's official , The Shocker has no talent whatsoever and he 's the worst rapper in No Limit . This album ca n't even be compared to Charge It 2 Da Game ( Which was a classic ) . Silkk , do n't make any more albums . This is the limit for you .	-1
I CAN NOT BELIEVE I forgot how WACK this album is ! ! ! ! Man a few months ago I proclaimed Mase 's Double Up as the worst album I owned , but then the other day I miraculously found this cd in my case . I had forgotten all about it ! Silkk The Shocker has absolutely no flow and definitely no skills . To Be honest I have no clue as to why I even purchased it in the first place . There are zero DECENT songs . This is by far the worst album I own . I 'm sorry Mase i forgot all about this one . The only thing this is good for is a laugh . Double Up is 1000 times better than this . Silkk has released the WORST No Limit album ever ( this one ) and is the worst rapper on the label ( now or ever was on the label ) Buy this cd for someone that you hate . Trust Me do not even make eye contact with this one it is not worth it . Warning Has Been Issued .	-1
Just 11 months since his 2nd album ( and his best solo ) was released , Silkk comes back with another 18 song album , but it is n't really worth the money , and probably 1 of the 3 worst No Limit cd 's I have ( I have around 16 or 17 ) . It has guests on 13 of the 18 ( like most No Limit releases ) and other then Jay-Z & Mya they 're all from the No Limit camp . It has 1 classic , 1 almost classic , 3 good songs , 6 ok songs , and 7 I skip . Of the 18 only 5 are really worth listenting to . Production is good and bad ( and horrible on 2 songs ) , and mostly all done by Beats by the Pound crew . KLC did 6 songs , Craig B did 4 , Carlos Stephens , & Sons of Funk each did 2 , and DJ Whop , Mo B Dick , O'Dell , and Whole Records all did 1 . Only get this if you are a die hard fan of Silkk , other wise download the few good songs. # 1 - 6.5 # 2 - 7 ( f/ Mya -- radio friendly song ) # 3 - 7.5 ( f/ Mystikal -- part 2 to his song offf his last album ) # 4 - 5 ( f/ Master P & O Dell -- slower song ) # 5 - 5 # 7 - 8 ( f/ Jay-Z & Master P -- about hustling ) # 8 - 9.5 ( f/ O'Dell -- great beat ) # 9 - 1 ( horrible beat & song -- f/ Mia X ) # 10 - 3 ( another horrible beat and song ) # 11 - 6 ( deeper song -- f/ Sons of Funk ) # 12 - 7.5 ( f/ C-Murder & Master P ) # 13 - 5 # 14 - 7.5 ( f/ Commission ) # 15 - 7 # 16 - 4 ( slow song -- f/ Sons of Funk ) # 17 - 8 ( f/ Mia X -- nice beat ) # 19 - 8 ( f/ C-Murder & Master P ) # 20 - 10 ( CLASSIC w/ GREAT BEAT -- f/ Snoop Dogg ) Vyshonne King Miller -- b . 6/1/76 -- New Orleans , LAcheck all my reviews	-1
I would have given this zero stars but that 's not an option . This is Silkk 's most successful album , it went 2X Platinum . That 's really unbelievable when you listen to the cd . I like Silkk The Shocker because he 's original with his own style , his first album `` The Shocker '' was my favorite with some great tracks . I also like a handful of songs off of `` My World , My Way '' and `` Charge It 2 Da Game '' . This flashy looking album however is absolutely terrible . The beats are some of the worst I 've ever heard , they must have put this together in one week . It 's so awful that I ca n't even bring myself to listen to Silkk 's lyrics . There is only one song that is actually quite good and a keeper at that - `` Get It Up '' featuring Snoop Dogg ... . this is some classic No Limit right here and Snoop and Silkk have great chemistry and bring their best to the table . Other than that one solid track , the rest are terrible . I recommend saving your money and downloading this album just to get the one song and throw the rest away .	-1
When i bought this cd , i wuz expecting musical talent involved , but i guess it duznt run in the family . Silkk wuz never any good at rapping and this cd proves it . after listening to the cd 3 times , i put it away , and to today i wont touch that trash . C-Murder seems 2 only have talent nowadays , hes the only smart 1 to jump off of the no limit bandwagon before it becomes the badboy records of the south	-1
I never felt Silkk the Shocker , and do n't think he has any skills . I 'm not a hater , I just tell the truth . He raps for a few seconds , takes a break and raps again.His lyrics is bling bling and stuff you heard 100 of times before from Cash Money . And the beats is very weak . It does n't fit the & quot ; rappin & quot ; at all.I mean I do n't think No Limit is talented either , but they do indeed have something . But Silkk on the other hand might be one of the worst rappers ever . The only reason he sold was 'cause No Limit was hot back then.Mase and even Loon is 10 times better than this.Stay away and buy something by those who deserve it.AZ , Nas , Cormega , Rakim , KRS-One , 2Pac and Mac Mall will get your money well spended .	-1
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? find another cd cause by now no limit has lost it .	-1
This is the worst CD I 've ever heard in my entire life . I 'm SOOOOO glad that I did n't actually buy it . I started to , but I heard a friend 's copy first . While listening to it , I just started laughing because it 's so bad that it 's actually kinda funny that something so horrible was even put out . Silkk the Shocker is really terrible . I would give it negative stars if I could .	-1
I 've been a H & O ; fan for more than 20 years and I 've heard all their albums and I 'll have to say that this together with `` Whole Oats '' represent the low points of the duo.By this time , H & O ; were already tiring of their Atlantic `` masters '' and wanted out . The legend goes that they even pulled out a gun to `` convince '' the powers that be to let them go join RCA instead . Probably untrue but it 'll be interesting to hear from the duo themselves.The 2 stars were for the first two tracks while the other tracks were so obviously TR influenced I believe just because H & O ; just could n't care less . Very mediocre by H & O ; standards and almost as embarassingly bad as Tears For Fears ' `` Raoul & the ... from Spain '' This album just sounds to me as if they wanted to make as bad an album as possible so that Atlantic would just tear up the contract and kick them out . Which is probably why TR had to come in and `` save '' the album in the first place . What self-respecting musician especially coming off a great album `` Abandoned Luncheonette '' would want to surrender creative control so completely to another artist like they did here ? Contrast this with the great `` Abandoned Luncheonette '' just before and the classic `` Silver '' album on RCA just after and you know what I mean about how much better musicians they are than this . They should just rename this `` The Todd Rungren Album . `` If you can get your hands on a used `` No Goodbyes '' album ( out of print for years ) , you are better off as 3 songs from here are on that best of compilation album . But do n't worry , things get better once they join RCA and produce classic album after classic album until `` Oh Yeah '' but that 's a story for another day.Get this only if you are a collector who desperately wants to complete the set . Oh yeah , or if you are a Todd Rundgren fan .	-1
As a big Blondie fan , I was eager to hear some of Debbie 's solo stuff . It does n't measure up . Some people say that & quot ; Koo Koo & quot ; is one of the worst albums ever made . I would n't go that far , but it is not a CD I would recommend to my friends . There are a few good tracks scattered throughout ( & quot ; Oasis & quot ; is a good song ) , but for the most part it is a second rate , bastardized version of Blondie . Even if it had the Blondie name , it would n't have been one of their highly regarded albums . Debbie Harry is a great and dynamic singer , so the lackluster quality of this album was a suprise.But one thing I can say , the album cover is great .	-1
` Koo Koo ' is a truly weird first solo album for someone that fronted what was , at the time , one of the biggest bands in the world . With its heavy emphasis on rap , one can only assume Deborah Harry and everyone else involved had gotten carried away by Blondie 's success with ` Rapture ' . But , unfortunately nothing on this album comes even remotely close to the finesse of that song.Presumably Harry was trying to release something that did not sound like Blondie , which she definitely managed . Instead of working with Blondie 's rock producer , Mike Chapman ( Suzi Quatro , The Knack , The Sweet , Pat Benatar ) , she worked with dance producers Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards ( Chic , Sister Sledge , The Jacksons , Diana Ross ) . The result is that ` Koo Koo ' sports a thin sound , contains slight , lack-lustre songs and , worst of all , fails to capitalize on Harry 's awesome vocal abilities , leaving her enigmatic style sounding silly alongside all the popping basses and excessive rapping.With the exception of the moody and atmospheric ` Now I Know You Know ' , and to a much lesser extent , the single ` Backfired ' , most of the songs are flat out terrible . It is interesting to note that both of these tracks were written by Rodgers and Edwards . Harry and long-term partner , Chris Stein , had a hand in writing most of the other songs . In fact , were it produced by Chapman , the song ` Under Arrest ' would have sounded very much like a great Blondie song . Unfortunately , without him , it and everything else just sounds daft and under-realized . The best thing about it is the incredible cover art by H.R.Giger .	-1
I ca n't understand the mass of 5-star reviews for this album . While the musicianship is fairly solid , the production is very primitive and melody is largely absent . Most troubling is the vocalist 's tendency to ride a single note for extended periods ; and that one note seems to be a B most of the time . He sounds like Zack from RATM trying to sing , and to my ears it does n't really work.I think `` Relationship Of Command '' is a fully accomplished work , but on `` Acrobatic Tenement '' this band was clearly still searching for a voice .	-1
2 1/2There are a few sparkling seeds of abrasive greatness hinting at further gifts to come but the majority of angular , noisy sloppiness emanating from this frazzled neo-punk quintet had much to refine before achieving real power .	-1
Who does n't love the beauty of Karen 's voice ? That would n't be possible ... But this collection of songs just do nothing for me , and sound like left over scraps from a decent album ... ..or a 3rd or 4th great hits.. ( other than the songs we 've heard before on The Greatest Hits ) -- the final song Another Song is particularly ambitious but the album as a whole is totally flat . Pass .	-1
Jay-z resonable doubt ca n't be compared 2 nas 's illmatic . Illmatic is better than resonable doubt . Jay-z is a fake a** thug n a comercial rappa .	-1
This album is one of the weakest albums in all of music history.This overrated and weak rapper steals nas 's style and the beats are just boring.Same old tired lyrics and production.There is only one song worth listening to.People should just accept the fact that hip hop is headed to the grave and heavy metal will once again rule the world.HEAVY METAL RULES FOREVER ! ! !	-1
This is one of Jay-z 's most worst of all baddest attemps.Because he still onces to Try to be big but garbage when nas trashed him and the ROC.It 's good he retired.nas worked his Ass off more than this clown with D*** Suxinlips , the main reason cause nas ' debut album lllmatic wasthe best album of all time , Now on the other hand Jay-z 's debut , this crappy work he had to re-release this album like 3 times in a row for it to go platinum , come on nas puthis record out once 11 years ago and it will be talked about for years to come just like Ready To Die .	-1
Simply put , Jay-Z is incredibly overrated . I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest , I never really liked him . His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again . He mostly raps about drugs , money and cars . Nothing special , nothing new . I 'm just being real about it , since everyone else is on his d ! ck . I think the reason he 's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.Granted , Jay-Z does use some good metaphors , but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.Best tracks on this album : Ca n't Knock the HustleBrooklyn 's Finest w/BiggieDead Presidents	-1
I do n't know why everybody is saying that this album is a classic , it 's not even close . Nas ' Illmatic was a classic , 2pac 's Me Against the World was a classic , not this . This album is Jay-Z 's best work and that 's the sad thing about it . Jay-Z is n't as good as everyone makes him out to be . He 's just like everyone else , listen to his lyrics , there 's nothing special about them . Eminem is the greatest rapper alive , sorry Jigga .	-1
this is the worst jay-z album that he came out with . listen to some real stuff like pac	-1
There was nothing better than hearing Too $ hort lay down those funky tracks back in the days , but years later ( man , I lost count of how many albums this guy made ) , I could barely listen to this CD . Do n't get me wrong , it was nice to hear Too $ hort 's voice again and I still respect him , but this album was flat out boring and horrible . I know Too $ hort is known for his non-stop & quot ; brag-rapping , & quot ; which he does with a fresh style , and his & quot ; baller/pimpin hoes & quot ; lyrics , but this time around , I just got sick of it . If Too $ hort ca n't think of anything else to rhyme about , then he should & quot ; stay away. & quot ; By the way , all of the artists featured on this album come with nothing ... plus they 're all wack anyway .	-1
this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it 's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge & amp ; flow .	-1
There is something fishy about this album . Its sounds like something Too Short threw together just to keep his name relevant . The Good : Cant Stay Away is a good opener and is vintage Too Short . Dont Stop Rappin with EightBall & MJG is the best song on the album and is better than that original version on the bonus Suave House disc on Eightball 's Lost . Here We Go with Jermaine Dupri and Jay-z is great lyrically but the beat is ehhh . More Freaky Tales and Invasion Of The Flat Booty B****es is Too Short at his storytelling best . Honorable mentions : Nation Riders , Good Life and Its About That Money ( Puffy 's boring a $ $ could have been left out you know ) . The Bad : What Happened To The Groupies with B-Legit , Aint No B****es and You Might Get G'eed with Daz , Supafly and E-40 are dull as s*** ! How Does It Feel is just as tiresome . The Ugly : Longevity with Big Mike and Scarface is hot garbage and how such a weak song got Yukmouth to diss all three is beyond me . Dishonorable Mentions : In the Studio ( nice beat doodoo record ) , Dont Trust Her ( YAWN ! ) and G-2000 ( double YAWN ) . Bottom Line : Too Short 's Cant Stay Away is the tipoff that Too Short wasnt going to be the same . The songs were dull and its just sounded like he was busy trying to put his homeboys ( who suck ! ) out .	-1
Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant ) . Which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST ? Not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what ? His voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness & quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound & quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs . We 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs .	-1
While this album is one of the greatest jazz guitar albums of all time , extremely poor mastering significantly detracts from the enjoyment it can bring the listener . Except for the two Monk titles , the RVG Edition is a seriously flawed series , especially the first batch that was released in '99 , and Midnight Blue was among those . Excessive noise reduction has erased virtually all clues of air and ambiance , and they possess a hard glare . The glare is generally absent in releases after '99 , but the other issues persist.Another flaw in this series is that many of the titles are in mono when excellent stereo masters exist . Rudy Van Gelder recorded exclusively in mono prior to March '57 , and stereo exclusively after October 30 1958 . He only recorded in both formats during the time spanning those two dates . While some will rightfully argue that the mono master sounds best in some instances , the RVG series has many titles in it that were recorded after Oct. 30 1958 that are mono . No mono masters exist for these sessions , so these CD 's are simply the stereo master folded down into one channel . What 's the purpose of that ? Relief is Available : Most of the RVG Edition titles are available in an earlier US version and as a Japanese import here on Amazon . These sound dramatically better and actually give you a sense of stage depth and air around the instruments . They are also stereo when possible , and appropriate , and they lack the glare of the RVG Edition . So far , everything I 've purchased that was released before 1999 in the US has been good , and all of the Japanese versions have been good . The imports are very pricey so you might want to get the older US versions through the Amazon Marketplace . I 've purchased many of these for under $ 10 in `` Like New '' condition . To avoid problems , I recommend only dealing with sellers who have a positive rating of 98 % or better . They do n't generally misrepresent the condition , and they 'll usually get it to you within 4 business days .	-1
C-Murder 's sophmore effort , Bossalinie , is the death of Life Or Death . Beats By The Pound were desperately missing on this No Limit release . Do n't get me wrong , the other producers that worked on this album like L.T . Hutton , Ontario Haynes & John Rhone 's tracks were too watered down for the killer voice and lyrics of C. His brother , Master P produced two of the tracks on here , the smooth laid-back `` Like A Jungle '' and `` Livin ' Legend '' . `` Ghetto Millionaire '' featuring Snoop Dogg , Kurupt & Nate Dogg was a good combination and helped on the many holes on this lp . Just when you do n't think there 's nothing left on here , `` Where We Wan na '' featuring Goodie Mob bombed with the odd but good collaboration . C-Murder does n't abandon his fans completely with gangster , ghetto tracks like `` Lil Nigga '' and `` Ride On Dem Bustas '' both produced by Ke'Noe . O'Dell 's production on `` On My Enemies '' is the highlight of this 28 track submarine . C tributes this song to the late 2pac and uses some of his lyrics on verse one with his own twist . Instead of having 28 songs on here he could have narrowed it down to ten and it would have been solid ! Free C-Murder !	-1
C-Murder : I have an idea ! Master P : What 's that whodie ? C-Murder : i 'll copy one of tupac 's unreleased songs word for word and dedicate it to him and fool people into thinking it 's MY song ! I 'll just call it `` on my enemies '' instead.Master P : Cool , that 's how we get down anyway . I heard cash money say whodie and i ran with it ! ( how stupid did they feel when the damn song ended up getting released on one of pac 's posthumous albums ? ! ) moral of the story-do n't rip off a legend and then dedicate it to him . ( cash money are n't legends , just wanted to show a pattern )	-1
I give C-murder 1 star and that 's only for the effort. ( ... ) C-murder is nothing but a wack mc . He steals all tupac 's style . He even tries to sound like him but sounds like an idiot . ( ... ) There 's not much to talk about on this album accept for the fact C-murder wishes he had tupac 's talent . ( ... )	-1
For the record , I believe that the No Limit era of hip hop was iconic , that efforts of Master P , TRU , and the camp gave us a lot of good Southern Hip Hop memories and took the game to another level . However , with regard to my man C-Murder , while I have and always will acknowledge that he was one of No Limit 's premiere artists/lyricists ... it turned my stomach to find out that he ripped 'On My Enemies ' from the greatest of all time himself , 2Pac via of the then black market only , not yet remixed release of 'When I Ride On My Enemies ' ( currently featured on the Death Row rmx release , 'Better Days ' ) . The fact that he ripped it , dedicated the album to 'Pac , and had the audacity to credit HIMSELF as the other totally shot down this album 's potential , the integrity of No Limit as a label , and C-Murder 's reputation as a credible lyricist and writer . If you 'll rip 'Pac in the name of fortune and fame , then who else have you stolen your verses/bars from , homie ? Real talk ... a big mistake .	-1
I give this cd 5 stars compared 2 what no limit is coming out with nowadays . I mean made man wuz disgusting , only god can judge me wuz sum r & amp ; b cd , not gangsta music that it used to be . C-Murder has a musical talent and he knows whos hot and whos not . he fetures kurupt , daz , nate who are the godfathers of rap.Snoop , soulja slim and magic which are the best people on no limit . Life or Death was a little bit better though , peace	-1
only 1 song worth bumpin and that 's ride on my enemies which he had from a unreleased 2pac cd . please pass this by .	-1
Timbaland ruins this album beatwise . The beats are just weak and Ginuwine 's whiny voice just does n't complement it . There are no standout songs and the album just wanders aimlessly from track to track . No coherence .	-1
& quot ; What 's So Different , & quot ; and & quot ; Same Ol ' G. & quot ; I was n't feelin ' the rest . In fact , I was ready to break the CD in two after hearing his remake of MJ 's & quot ; She 's Out Of My Life. & quot ; : ) : ) : ) Just my opinion ... do n't hate on me ...	-1
I really , really do n't understand why people idolize these first two B & amp ; S albums . I like The Boy with the Arab Strap . It has poignant songs that are worth listening to . But on its predecessors , B & amp ; S sound like a band trying very , very hard to be clever and for the most part failing . I do think Tigermilk is the better of the two , marginally . Expectations and She 's Losing It are very good ( & quot ; Who needs boys when there 's Lisa around & quot ; -- ow ! sexy ! ) , but the rest of it , I feel , is average at best , and Electric Renaissance is virtually unlistenable . I dunno ... TBwtAS leaves me spellbound , but for the most part this just leaves me cold -- there must be something good about it if so many seemingly intelligent people are singing its praises , but for the life of me I ca n't tell what .	-1
If you are ever in any doubt as to the musical genius of Eminem , you have only to see how he took Dido 's 'Thankyou ' , a twee and complacent slice of folkfluff , and hurled it into the most savage and frightening nightmare in modern music , completely transforming it into a kind of emotional ghost in a machine overloading with fury , murder , obsession , consuming hopes and desperate loneliness.Such extreme emotions will not be found on 'No Angel ' . Extremes are anathema to Dido , whose warm and reassuring songs smooth over all life 's rough edges , bathing them in a samey wash. For all the modishness of the production , its nods to hip-hop , trip-hop , R'n'B , Massive Attack etc. , this album reminded me of two not very modern forms of music - hazy Celtic muzak , such as The Corrs , Enya , Mary Black and Delores Keane ; and 1980s yuppie soul , such as Sade . These songs , none of which seem any different from its neighbour , have the annoying habit of lodging themselves immovably in your brain , like an unforgiving migraine .	-1
I really do n't know what 's goin'on with all the lines about this album ! It 's a Pop album , not very bad but it offers no new sounds ... It 's the & quot ; same old song and dance & quot ; . The lyrics are absolutely ordinary , no melody at all ... So , this is a sold out Pop album . Do n't waste too much time with this .	-1
The song Here With Me compelled me to get this album though I wish I did n't . The songs all sound the same : same boring synthesizers and dull vocals . There is no range at all on this CD and the lyrics are basically all about lost love . Dido has a lot of potential but I think this release is boring , uninspired , and not too different from what 's already polluting the air waves .	-1
Dido 's name is familiar to us since that fabulous collaboration with Eminem , & quot ; Stan & quot ; . It 's pretty obvious she got all attention of the world after the success of & quot ; Stan & quot ; since she does n't only sing her part in it but also adds to its flavour . Dido 's debut album & quot ; No Angel & quot ; went multi-platin and suddenly she became a superstar . So what 's the reason why we like her so much ? & quot ; No Angel & quot ; does n't exactly stand for easy listening . In each song Dido seems to complain about something , she sounds depressed , yet certain of better future . That 's what we like about Dido : she 's the typical handsome girl next door giving vent to her feelings . She wins in accessibility what she loses in admirability , I defy everyone not to sympathize with her.Dido provides us with a certain intimeness but does that say anything about the music ? Apparently not . The opener & quot ; Here With Me & quot ; starts with an intriguing tune that ties you to the song but it 's a shame what it turns to . As far as I 'm concerned the chorus is supposed to be the climax of a song , here it 's nothing but a huge let-down.The song kind of loses its appeal after the chorus . Sadly it 's the same with almost all other songs on & quot ; No Angel & quot ; . Remember those brilliant , sweet , dramatic lyrics which made Dido famous ? & quot ; My tea 's gone cold I 'm wonderin ' why I got out of bed at all/ The morning rain clouds up my window and I ca n't see at all & quot ; . These lyrics are from the song & quot ; Thank You & quot ; which was sampled in Eminem 's & quot ; Stan & quot ; . The way Dido sings them makes a stone heart melt but the chorus should win the award for & quot ; the most boring chorus ever & quot ; . Further examples are & quot ; Do n't Think Of Me & quot ; , & quot ; Slide & quot ; and & quot ; Isobel & quot ; .Well , seems like Dido has the talent of turning brilliant songs to soothing filler but there are 2 nice exceptions which prove she 's capable of more . & quot ; Honestly OK & quot ; is experimental and trippy with some beautiful harmonica a la Ennio Morricone . And of course , the bonus track & quot ; Take My Hand & quot ; . It combines different styles , Dido 's singing really comes along very well , I love these 6 minutes in the land of dreams ! Anyway , I heard some of Dido 's work with Faithless and it 's better than the better part of & quot ; No Angel & quot ; . It 's just my opinion but I think she should stick with them.I conclude that Dido has quite a lot of things to work on but otherwise , she 's an interesting artist .	-1
I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful , has a decent voice , comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive ... This album is the same - 'inoffensive ' ... some might say , bland ... The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You ' ( used on Eminem 's 'Stan ' ) , but is done solo here and it works , 'Hunter ' and 'Here With Me ' ... The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car ... Nothing much happens , nothing inspires ... I really want to like her , but it 's all been done before ...	-1
... Just like always , I 'm just being real with you all : thisalbum is and will always be garbage . None of the songs on here aregood , and neither are any of the Bluff Ryder artists . The Lox is weak , DMX does n't make any sense , Eve thinks she 's all that when all of you GUYS know she ai n't , Drag-On just BRAGS-ON , and everyone else I forgot to mention from that wack crew , GOOD . Man , just take my advice , skip this at the record store ... it ai n't worth sitting there and getting pissed off about . Once again , I 'm just being real with you guys .	-1
This album is basically just a resume of Swizz Beats ' production skills . The album is n't the best of year , it 's just an album . The only two songs that shine are Eve 's & quot ; What Ya Want & quot ; and Jay-Z 's & quot ; Jigga My Nuh. & quot ; Other than that , the album 's a waste of time and money .	-1
Teddy Riley and the rest of BLACKstreet have put out thier third album and it may be thier worst , actually it is . After a good debut , and a strong improvment on thier second album , they stumble back down the stairs on this effort . Thier first single Boyfriend/Girlfriend was good , it had the beat to get you up and on the floor , but that is the only such song on the album . Riley apparently loses alot of the production that made him succesful with the previous 2 albums and all of his work with Guy , and Wreckx-N-Effect . The album has some nice cameos from artists like Mary J. Blige , and Mya , but they are not enough to help this album stay afloat . Alot of the songs are repetative and dont have the beat that Another Level did . I 'm Sorry and In A Rush are okay , and Can You Feel Me is alright but not even those songs are that great , but at least they are & quot ; Okay & quot ; . Even Riley knows this cd represents the tombstone for BLACKstreet , as he is focusing on the return of Guy . Unfortunatly this album may spell the end of BLACKstreet , which is sad , because up into this album they were a good group . Mabye they can regroup on thier next album , should be any chance for that to happen . But FINALLY , back to album . My recommendation , wait to spend your money on the Guy cd and if Riley can regroup them , because this cd aint worth your GREEN money !	-1
Remember how on BLACKstreet 's second album they tried the revolving door concept and brought in two new members ? And remember how surprising it was that the idea worked ? Well , for this album , Teddy tried the concept AGAIN and brought in Terrell Phillips to replace Mark Middleton . ( Why Teddy thought replacing Mark was a good idea remains a mystery . ) And while this album is not as long as its predecessor , it 's not as good either . In fact , it 's not even close.It 's hard to say what 's the worst song on this album , as most of them are pretty stupid , ranging from the lazy `` Girlfriend/Boyfriend '' to `` Can You Feel Me '' , which uncreatively samples Jackson 5 ' `` Can You Feel It '' yet again . And then lyrics do n't impress either . `` Think About You '' says things like `` I put on my clothes and I think about you '' and `` I fix my dinner and I think about you '' . ( By the way , remember the video when the bridge came on ? Were those supposed to be moves ? ) And the chorus to `` Black & White '' goes : `` I dream in black and white/But I make love in color . '' WTF ? Even though the production and harmony get better toward the end of the album , it still ca n't save songs like `` In A Rush '' , which sounds like it was written , well , in a rush . And the last three songs feel like they were thrown on to fill up space . Two of them are gospel songs , and the other one is the `` Take Me There '' remix from the Rugrats movie soundtrack ( without the rap , I must add ) . I have two things to say about that : 1 ) if you record a song for Nickelodeon , you should n't put it on your album because its theme makes it sound like it does n't belong , and 2 ) when the best song on your album is a kiddie song , there 's something seriously wrong.This album was very , very disappointing . Also , Teddy Riley seems to be plagued with deep involvement with sloppy projects . Guy III was n't any better , and BLACKstreet 's `` comeback '' album Level II ( but is n't that their FOURTH album ? ) got pushed back for the umpteenth time . But if that song `` Deep '' is any indication as to what is expected in the future , I do n't think I 'll be checking for it .	-1
WHAT HAPPENED ? BlackStreet has been one of the rare male groups that I like , that I thought could really *sang* . Their second album was an instant classic ( I still listen to it ) but this one is instant trash . I like & quot ; Think About You & quot ; but they sound like Jagged Edge or some other thrown together group . And what the hell is & quot ; Black & amp ; White & quot ; ? ! Trash , garbage . What happened to the beautiful , soulful harmonies of the days of old ? This is a cd full of disapointment that guest stars could not save . I am with the person who said they were going to sell the cd to a used store . I only hope it gets me more money than that sorry 100 % Ginuwine cd . Save your money for 112 's Room 112 .	-1
After releasing two back to back discs , Blackstreet began their downward spiral with this medicore CD . For starters the group is without the smooth falestto of Mark Middleton and instead were giving Terrel Phillips . Second the huge single Take Me There is presented in a weak remix and finally there 's only good ballad on the CD which is Think About You . I do n't know what happened to the Blackstreet from the excllent Another Level because they for sure are n't on this disc .	-1
EPMD is a legendary group and have dropped consistent albums and a couple of classics for over a decade ... It has 2 DECENT songs in Pioneer and Right Now . and 2 GOOD songs in both versions of Symphony . The rest is pure filler . the only other song that is listenable is THe Fan . Even the usually good Jane song is wack . They retired as a group on a bad note . And if this was gon na be what they were going to put out from then on then it was the GREATEST choice to retire in Hip Hop history with the exception of Mase . If you have to have every EPMD album then dont make the mistake I did and buy this album without the Greatest Hits Cd . ( How dumb was that ) . At least buy the one with the greatest hit cd included , that way it wont be a complete waste of money .	-1
EPMD got more airplay on their arguments and beef than they did on the music from this album and for valid reasons as it showed that the course had run dry .	-1
It takes so much to try to get a musical to make its way upon Broadway . Sometimes you really need to understand how to make it really happen within the passion of the storytelling music . In that case with Elton John , he nearly seemed to make it with Aida . While the music for Broadway always seems to have at least something completely mgaical and a dash of power in it . Sometimes , you really need to understand it , to make it happen , and others do n't see it from the start . Although Elton John has had great music for years , at least once in a era , something goes a little flat.The 1999 Aida , was not a studio album from Elton , but a preview from what was happen on Broadway . The various artists record contains so many different artists in the record including Tina Turner , Boyz II Men , Dru Hill , and the upcoming Heather Headley . Before Heather made it as a singer , she made it right here in Aida , on this record . The only decent song that was a hit was Written In The Stars , which Elton performed with Leann Rimes . The song was also the last song Elton cracked Billboard 's Top 40 . Still , there really was n't a lot of enjoyment within most of the record , and it fell into a sleeper . Considering that Elton is already planning on making another smash musical on Broadway , hopefully he 'll do better with the concept record.When it does come to making it on Broadway , it is n't really anything exciting , unless it truly is a smash , and Aida is a smash on Broadway , just not the record . Still , if you 're a die hard fan of Aida , buy this record . Otherwise , it could be a hitless miss .	-1
as Much as I Respect the Old Elton John the Mid-80 's to Now John is pretty run of the mill.and this disc is a Snooze fest of the first order.the Material is really flat.very boring stuff .	-1
Yo i hate when people like ja dont speak the truth . He talks about all this ( ... ) like he went through it but hes just lying . He 's a WANKSTA and im not sayin that cause i support 50 cause i hate 50 . But hes got a point when he talks about ja . If your a ja fan you are being lied to and wasting your money when your supporting a true wanksta . Yo ja stop stealing Pac 's words if he were alive he would never role wit you . If you want to be lied to and hear the most annoying voice and waste your money by this album or other ja albums .	-1
This is the same old ja rule on this album.Weak beats and ridiculous lyrics with an annoying voice.He claims to be gangster but in reality he is just a black justin timberlake.He needs to retire from music and movies because he stinks.DO NOT SUPPORT HIM ANYMORE ! ! !	-1
Ja Rules best work sounds like Chingy 's worst work . Well yeah Chingy is crap as well but at least he does n't lie to everyone and steal Pac 's words and try to act like him . Ja , stop thinking that Pac would roll with you . If Pac was still here he 'd diss you , oh no wait . If Pac was still here you would n't even be in the game so shut up.It 's no wonder 50 disses you so much . And stop talking like your so gangsta , Everyone outside your blind legion of fans knows that your a fake . How dare people have the nerve to call this rubbish straight hip hop . You want straight hip hop ? Get yourself one of these.NWA - STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTONICE CUBE - AMERRIKKA 'S MOST WANTEDDR DRE - THE CHRONICSNOOP DOGGY DOGG - DOGGYSTYLEBIGGIE - READY TO DIETHUG LIFE - VOLUME 1THA DOGG POUND - DOGG FOODTUPAC - ME AGAINST THE WORLDTUPAC - ALL EYEZ ON METUPAC - THE DON KILLUMINATITUPAC - GREATEST HITSNAS - ILLMATICBIGGIE - LIFE AFTER DEATH50 CENT - POWER OF THE DOLLARBetter luck next time kids .	-1
This album is horrible . It 's all over the place . There 's no coherence . The music is overproduced and sample heavy . Ja Rule 's lyrics are inane and laughable . This album should be canned . Not recommended .	-1
Ja Rule is a freakin disgrace to the rap game ! Anybody who buys his album needs their head checked !	-1
i would n't have such a big problem with rap if they did n't call it music . that 's like calling the teletubbies 'theater ' . a bunch of guys talking to a beat is not music , it 's poetry with a rhythm . and these guys do n't give a f*ck what they are writing about , all they care about is the loot . so f -- - all of these rap artists taking up space on the tv and radio . progressive 4 ever-	-1
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease ! Just because Ja Rule is rolling with the Ruff Ryderz camp , does it mean he has to sound exactly like DMX ? I 'm not feeling his style , his voice nor his beats . Swizz Beats is one of the worst producers I 've heard in a long time . I can easily sum this review up by saying : DO N'T BUY IT !	-1
On a lotta the romantic male singers , I have what I call the 'Wife Test ' -- if she likes something , pay attention to it , if she really , really likes something , I better run out and get it and give it to her ASAP , no questions asked . I thought Eric 's new album was ok , when I heard tracks on it ... I mean , what can I say ? If you have read one of my other reviews you know I 'm pretty much an ol ' skooler -- it takes something very exceptional to move me sometimes . My wife , however , really did not care for Eric 's new one ... & quot ; Not like the one 'True to Myself ' . Now that one was really nice and sexy in a smokey , lazy kinda way . This sounds too much like all that other stuff on radio. & quot ; Then she said & quot ; I thought he said he was gon na be true to himself & quot ; . I dunno , but all I can say is that I thought the original & quot ; Georgie Porgie & quot ; was already a great tune ... .what do you want me to tell my wife , Eric ?	-1
Joe Sample Is a Genius But He has Gotten way to Predictable with Many of His Recordings over the Past Decade & amp ; a Half.I agree with Rickey Wright this is for the most Part very Boring & amp ; Bland.and Please Leave Street Life Alone that was a One In a Million Recording 21 years ago.You Just ca n't capture that Magic again.I Respect Lalah Hathaway she is a Good Vocalist but Compared To Randi Crawford she needs Lessons.this is Not for The Progressive Fan of The Crusaders but more for the Brunch Crew.Joe Sample can do These Runs in His Sleep .	-1
Top Dogg is , at best , a tradgedy . I bought the album a few years ago , shortly after its release , and have only been able to bear listening to it about three times - each time entering with a clean mind , hoping to be impressed , only to find myself extroidinarily dissapointed . Top Dogg does n't touch Doggystyle , nor does it even deserve the recognition Snoop has earned as a featured artist on numerous recordings by Dre . Pac , and others . Unfortunately , much of Snoop 's recent solo works have been terrible . Top Dogg is no exception , it is rather a prime example .	-1
I just was n't feeling Snoop Dogg on this album , just like I was n't feeling him on & quot ; Da Game is to be Sold , Not to be Told. & quot ; Snoop is definitely falling apart ever since he signed with No Limit , and in a way , I hope this is his time to give up rapping and become a producer or something . He needs to save himself the embarassment . The only noteable performance on this album was from Suga Free on the track & quot ; Trust Me , & quot ; but not even the impressive lyrical skills of Suga could save this horrible album .	-1
To start , Snoop is one of the best rappers . But he does n't show this on this CD . To me , it seemed he rushed this CD . & quot ; B Please & quot ; is the only & quot ; good & quot ; track . The other songs are only Ok like & quot ; Buck 'em & quot ; . The only problem with this CD is the beats . They are not good . But the CD does have good lyrics	-1
Everyone told me how good this CD was.So I decided to buy it.Turns out every song on this CD , except for track 5 , is worth skipping.I am trying to sell it and get my money back.But they wo n't buy it because they know how terrible it is.Seriously , track 5 is the only one worth listening to.It ai n't a song , it is some crazy man talking , but it is hilarious.Trust me , do n't make the same mistake that I made , save your money .	-1
This is the worst orbital effort to date . It 's harsh , abrasive , unfocused , unstructured , meandering , boring and irritating . . . did I leave anything out ? After the lush beauty and ethereal wonder of 'in sides ' , I was hoping for 'in sides ' part 2 or some remarkable variation thereof , not necessary a rehash but a continuation of the lovely ambient downtempo that they are so deft at creating . Not the case with 'middle of nowhere ' . 'middle of nowhere ' starts off with 'way out ' , a harsh beat laden teeth gritting experience that seamlessly flows into the next track , 'spare parts express ' which continues this harsh techno beat laden theme before fading out into white noise ( is that hints of electric guitar I hear in there ? ? ) . This thread of assaulting beats and uninspired melodies continues on and on to a point that all the tracks start to sound like each other . The only saving grace is 'otono ' , orbital 's take on house music with 4/4 beats and soulful diva vocals . This track is the only reason to purchase MoN ; by the time 'nothing left 1 & 2 ' with alison goldfrapp on vocals and 'style ' with its cute stuttery blippy melodies , is reached my ears were hurting and my senses were so abused that I hit the off button before the last strains of the music drained itself from out of my speakers . I was hoping that this would be the warm ray of sunshine I expect from orbital . I was wrong in that assumption . 'middle of nowhere ' aggravated me.I suppose orbital is attempting to go back to their roots with this hard edge techno infused effort but the thing I enjoy the most about orbital is their constant forward thinking ideas when it comes to electronic music . This is four steps backwards in the evolution of orbital 's sound . Not worth the money , buy it used or borrow your friend 's copy .	-1
Orbital and Underworld are two of the most consistant acts in electronica and they both released sub-par exceptions to that consistancy at about he same time.This is fine as a record . Their are highlights in every song with none of the songs being highlights themselves . Orbital 's standards were set by their releases , `` Orbital 2 ( the brown album ) '' and `` In Sides '' . Arguably , the best thing that Orbital has ever done are the various 'Lush ' tracks . These works as well as `` Snivelization '' are all more notable than `` Middle Of Nowhere '' as are Orbital 1 ( green album ) classic tracks , 'Belfast ' , 'Satan ' and of course , 'Chime'.It would be an easy stab to say that `` Middle Of Nowhere '' takes you exactly there , the middle of nowhere , but that would be a compromised point and it is n't even really true . MON actually is pretty well focused ( a stength of In Sides ) and fairly diverse ( a strength of Snivelization ) . It is just that it is a much less interesting journey than those albums . It 's like , it does n't matter how precisely you map the coordinates to your destination . If you do n't want to go there , the trip is kind of a bummer .	-1
I am a huge fan of The White Stripes . I think that Jack and Meg White are fine talented musicians . However , their 1st album is n't that great . THis album has the most songs on it by The White Stripes . That does n't mean it 's all good.There are some fine quality gems on this , however . Jimmy The Exploder is a great opener and my personal favorite . The radical reworking of Stop Breaking Down is also a new classic . And , some of the folk songs like Sugar Never Tasted So Good are also great . And Astro is the finest AC/DC song AC/DC never wrote.However , there 's some awful filler in here . Wasting My Time is ruined by Jack 's singing . Although he 's a good singer , he sounds too overly dramatic on that song . Broken Bricks is too short , Slicker Drips is just too short and pointless , and I was never a fan of Bob Dylan , so One More Cup Of Coffee did n't do anything for me.This is not a good introduction to one of the best new bands out there . Try White Blood Cells first , or De Stijl . This should come last .	-1
the problem with sarah is she can not decide if she 'd like to be tori amos or celiene dion . she fails miserably at both . for an example of a TRULY passionate live performance , try ani difranco 's & quot ; living in clip & quot ; or tori amos ' & quot ; to venus and back & quot ; .	-1
I do n't understand the fascination with Diana Ross . She has an average voice at best but yet she is put on a pedestal as some kind of Diva . She ca n't sing like Aretha , she ca n't belt like Patti Labelle and she dose n't have the vocal range of Whitney Houston . But when divas are mentioned and great singers she is at the top of the list . I am usually in aggreement when there are good singers but ever since I was little I just did n't see how Diana could stand out let alone make a life-long career with her whiny , thin , voice . Would someone please enlighten me I 'm confused ?	-1
This album sounds like if John Tesh made an album and hired an Italian singer with raspy vocals . This is not progressive at all , it is worse than most elevator music . In fact this stuff insults good elevator music such as Frank Sinatra and Jobim . I bought this cd without listening to it ... big mistake . A clue should have been the incredibly amateurish airbrush art on the cover of a fairy lying on the beach . What tripe ! People who like this thing are the ones who give progressive music a bad name . Luckily I was able to exchange this with something else . But you might not be so fortunate .	-1
Gimmicky . The only reason this band is famous is cuz they swear a lot ( whooptee doo kiddies , that requires lots of talent ) and cuz they constantly insult people . Wow , now THAT 'S talent . The whole Joker Card or whatever thing gets old too . You want some GOOD rap metal ? Buy Snot , ( hed ) p.e. , Incubus or the first Powerman 5000 cd . This is just 60 minutes of none stop bullsh-t .	-1
How does one describe what 's good about this CD , and more to the point , why ? Let 's just say that the Insane Clown Posse has done the impossible . Innumerable listeners , ( especially the unwilling ones ) , cite sampling - violent , moronic , and misogynistic lyrics - mind-numbing repetition - pseudo-gangster posing - pretensions of significance - cretinous anti-musicality - and the complete absence of anything remotely pleasing or nourishing to the spirit - as evidence that rap represents the lowest point in the history of music . Frankly , it 's hard to take issue with this perspective . But every bottom has a cellar below it and the Insane Clown Posse actually found a way to make rap even worse.When ICP poured out of their little circus car and onto the scene , they brought a whole new level of degradation to the rubble . The clown make-up is probably there for the same reason Kiss has used freakish make-up all these years , to disguise hideous ugliness . That 's one thing . But ICP also borrowed heavily from the world of professional wrestling , that twisted landscape combining pretensions of machismo , thinly veiled homosexuality of the muscle-man variety , bombast , and Cro-Magnon , uni-brow sensibility into an unctuous goo of theatricality appealing to the basest human and sub-human emotions . The ICP 's pointless yelling , rants , challenges , and threats of bodily injury almost provide ample distraction from their complete lack of anything that might pass as talent.With the imprimatur of the Stern show , ( the absolute baseline of all sludge , the gold standard of bad taste ) , they were on their way . Seltzer water in the faces of their fans was only the coup de grace , the last touch . Maybe that 's the good news of ICP . Perhaps they will help people finally see rap for what it is - hideous clatter produced by clowns with no musical aptitude and nothing to say .	-1
I can see why these dudes stay in the Underground scene , NOT cuz they want to , but cuz are wack . I did n't know what a juggalo was until a few months ago , I worked with a guy that was really into it and I took a listen , I did n't want to be rude to the guy and say this sucks . I just told him that is n't my style of music , not because I ca n't handle it , but because it is the most wack stuff I 've every heard . I do n't know how these dudes get any respect in the rap industry .	-1
This group relies on the strength on their profusely vulgar , hedonistic and completely mindless lyrical bank to garner sales from a bunch of dorky white teenage boys having an identity crisis because they 've OD 'd on too much Rap . And there 's nothing new this time around ; just more bad poetry juxtaposed to a drum-machine . Period .	-1
this is not the best beefheart you can buy . get the later stuff or live albums there better	-1
No , not the Primus cd `` Frizzle Fry '' , this is my evaluation of this cd . Good songs but not BURSTING like they were on BSSM or Mother 's Milk and not even CLOSE to Uplift Mofo Party Plan . They play some tof these songs on Lite FM . These guys are getting older with the music . Fishbone-Now there 's a band that has been consistant for OVER 20 years ! Longer than the Peppers ( check you history before you debate me ! ) . They are still great musicians but the Umph is gone . Last GREAT cd was BSSM . One Hot Minute was there downfall . Navarro is an average guitarist . They should have kept Arik Marshall . Just my opinion .	-1
The Loudness War will kill your hi-fi system . This record sounds so awful when pumped in volume it is unlistenable . It 's pretty sad it has come to this with music . There are literally no dynamics left on this disc . There is one mastered level of every peak and dip in the waveform meaning zero dynamics and it just gets louder and more obnoxious when you turn the knob . It 's really sad people have to listen to this and even more sad record companies think these albums are good for anything but coasters . Even on your ipod this one sounds like complete and utter ****.Some really good tunes by the Peppers but just try pumping this on your 5k system and you will be in tears at how awful it sounds . Sadly all of their albums here on out sound pretty much the same .	-1
It 's a shame such talented musicians could make such bland radio friendly pap . Parallel universe and californication are the only standout tracks . The rest of it plays like a bad self parody . Get Blood sugar sex magick of even better one of john frusciante 's solo albums .	-1
I know it is n't very trendy to say so , but I consider the Chilis one of the more important 80s and early 90s bands -- Blood Sugar Sex Magic was 60+ minutes of sustained brilliance . Californication is an obvious attempt to recapture that . Rick Rubin and John Frusciante are back , the sound of the band is somewhat similar , everyone can still play , but somehow , it all sounds forced . How can you measure inspiration ? I do n't know , but the songs just are n't there for me . It 's sad -- I really wanted to like this record , just like I really wanted to like One Hot Minute . I 'll check out By the Way , but I 've stopped expecting much ... . Still , these guys have paid their dues -- if they want to put out mediocre albums for the next ten years and rake in the bucks , more power to them .	-1
they sing and play about peace and love ! why ? that 's terrible ! i do n't like the vocals either !	-1
REd Hot is not able to perform decently live . This is just a studio band . Their live performances are something that defies reasonable explanation . Their performance in ROCK IN RIO III , in RIo de Janeiro , Brazil , in January , 2001 was something so bad that people could not believe . THose who were fans got disappointed at extreme ; those who were not , never will think of buying anything from the band again . This is a fairy-tale band , no substance at all , and CALIFORNICATION is just another step in this process . Get away from this , man .	-1
if it aint pac then it 's outkast cash money or somebody else . these fools teeth should hurt with all the biting they do .	-1
There is a legitimate reason why this double CD stinks . It was being recorded around the same time Cash Money was beginning to take away No Limit 's crown . It shows , as the Miller clan tried a little too hard , and ended up with only a single disc 's worth of good tracks . Among the VERY FEW standouts are & quot ; Hoody Hoo & quot ; and & quot ; Soldier till I Die. & quot ; Best advice -- save your money .	-1
Nothing great or interesting . This is a decent release , fans know what to expect , not much new being said , interesting beats , ok production	-1
energetic , yes . this is good . but smash mouth gets annoyingly happy to me . of all of the songs on this album ( and trust me , my little brother insists on playing all of them above my music ) , not one of them is depressing , or emotional . so that special journey that many artists can take you on is all but non-existant . Not to mention 'All Star ' started to get on my nerves the 3rd time i heard it ...	-1
I picked up the CD for the song & quot ; All Star & quot ; .It was okay for about a week , then it got annoying .	-1
i like the first two alright and parts of the third one but this sounds tired and predictable.it sounds rushed and uninspired.i love good 70 's sounding music when i hear it.the stevie wonder meets roy ayers thing was cool but it 's become stamped and that 's not original.thus far they have put out better singles than discs for me .	-1
Now , call me dumb if you like , but this release just does not drill it'sway into my consciousness . Maybe it 'll kick out some trance jams in a discoteque , but it definetly is one of the worst albums I 've ever heard considering homeplay . The only piece of melody that glued into my brain was the chorus of & quot ; Let Forever Be & quot ; , which - surprise surprise ! - was originally written by The Beatles ! Ok , sure , there is something cachy about the simple yadding of 2Hey Boy , Hey Girl & quot ; , but it just ai n't good enough ! The rest of the album made me feel like I was listening to a repeated lines form the icecreamtruck 's music ...	-1
There 's something overblown about this record . The egos of Tom and Ed seem intent on fuelling their egos and being really 'clever ' . They 've also let themselves be inspired by tacky synth sounds rather than the ferocios techno leanings of Dig Your Own Hole . Having a whole clutch of guest vocalists in just leaves the record short of identity . Let Forever Be sums up the problems . It 's just a lazy retreat of Setting Sun , Noel sounds disinterested , and the boys did n't even conjure up the song themselves . Out Of Control is possibly the only time where a guest singer really gets it right here . Overall there 's too much ego and not enough class . Orange Wedge and Got Glint are n't bad but overall this does n't cut the mustard.And is Hey Boy Hey Girl meant as a joke ? It 's so cheesy .	-1
Compared with their famous 1984 reunion album , powerful and very inspired , 'THBL'lacks a certain spaciousness in sound , actually there are too many layers of sound allowing for clutter and overkill.While there are a few decent tracks , there 's too much filler on this record which still benefited from the momentum of 'Perfect Strangers ' .	-1
F1*Ian Gillan got fired ( again ) after this album , and you can see why . The whole thing is tired and disappointing , and the lyrics are especially poor . After the fairly decent Perfect Strangers , I was excited to get this album . I 've almost never played it again , and when I have , I have n't liked it any more.There 's just not much good to say about it , except that it 's not as overproduced as Perfect Strangers . I wish it had been - it might have been better . As it is , it 's by far my least favorite Deep Purple album , and I do n't like it even as a die-hard fan.Skip this . Do n't buy it , even if you 're a completist.Key tracks : Bad Attitude - mildly catchy* Where F # is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album . F1 is an indication that only diehard , compulsive collectors are likely to want the album . F5 indicates that a complete newcomer to the band would appreciate it .	-1
This album is very uneve , it 's not in accord with Purple 's quality . Anyway , there we have GIllan 's amazing voice and Blackmore 's unique guitar sound . But the songs are weak , that 's the problem .	-1
I had posted this review under my former email address ( Bobbyhill @ cwix.com ) , but I wanted to restate my position for the benefit of those who examine my reviews solely on my & quot ; about me page & quot ; and did not have the benefit of those reviews in total of the album listed here , so this reposting was done in that regard ; some people may not know how I feel about this release if they just examine my reviews in my & quot ; about-me area & quot ; , unless they had prior knowledge that I , Esoterrorca , and Bobbyhill-under which name the same review I posted here- were one in the same . Natalie Cole does best when she does the classic R and B and pop of her late 80s years , but when she reverts back to the & quot ; Unforgettable & quot ; days and the gimmick implied therein , I ca n't say I enjoy it . This album is a case in point of that.This album is a mish-mosh of styles , to a certain degree , but the album is weighted toward classic jazz club/smokey night club jazz and it is as if she sees that as a natural evolution from the 92 & quot ; Unforgettable & quot ; which deomestically sold 5 million copies in the U.S.What happens here is that any originality or star power Natalie wishes to command seperate from the shadows of her father- with whom she has been so closely associated and has she herself felt stunted by which caused her drug daze-is stunted by the antiquated jazz ballroom arrangementsNatalie shines so effervescently and gracefully on the title track -hat initially reminds us of Bobby Brown 's & quot ; Rock Withca & quot ; or & quot ; Roni & quot ; - with its ambient arrangement and aural bath . This is classic Natalie in my opinion-not the stuff of her father . The song has an amazing pedigree : written by Natalie and ( I assume ) J. Geils member & quot ; Peter Wolf & quot ; and has Rodney Jerkins ( of & quot ; the Boy is Mine & quot ; and & quot ; It 's Not Right , but It 's Ok & quot ; and & quot ; If you Had My Love & quot ; fame ) on keyboards even though the song is not a classic contemporary R and B song shows that Natalie can command an a list of producers and arrangers who wo n't compromise her integrity for what they feel they do for other artists ; they recognize the subtle origianlity of Cole and do not hamper it by trying to update her sound.If only Phil Ramone and Foster would have tried not capture the gimmick that was & quot ; Unforgettable & quot ; somehow and has recognized Natalie for the op/ Ra nd B icon that she was in the days of & quot ; Miss You Like Crazu & quot ; and & quot ; I Live For your Love & quot ; , things might have turned out differently. & quot ; Say You Love Me & quot ; and & quot ; More than You 'll Ever Know & quot ; are the only two other stand-outs that ring of classic Natalie for me.The former is a jazzy sultry gospel flavored entry that Anita Baker could have handled with a certain flair for her upcoming release , and sounds classic yet updated enough with its computer-soul and earthy tones that ring of Erykah Badu to have been embraced at Urban AC radio more readily than some might have thought , while the latter reminds me of & quot ; Miss You Like Crazy & quot ; and & quot ; I Live For your Love & quot ; and is destined for MOR/AC status	-1
I 'm a huge fan of Ms.Cole 's , and when I first heard the single & quot ; Snowfall on the Sahara & quot ; ( glorious ! ) I could n't wait to get to the store to pick up this CD . What a MESS ! There is no concept to this crazy quilt collection . & quot ; A Song For You & quot ; is way off target with it 's soul-style embellishments , & quot ; Corinna & quot ; is one the the most god-awful and insipid songs ever , and for some strange reason the lady feels she has to say something cute before actually singing many of the numbers . I have nothing against Natalie singing contemporary material ( & quot ; Everlasting & quot ; is one of my favorites ) but next time out she should choose ONE good producer , some songs that are worthy of her , and just SING them !	-1
this disc is very average.as much as i Respect her great talent & amp ; range this disc just left me cold for the most part.for instance Got ta Serve Somebody the Classic song by Bob Dylan never gets off the ground here just like much of this disc.what a waste .	-1
A friend of mine recommended this by telling me that , at first listen , he thought this was the most trite and idiotic thing he 'd ever heard . Then after repeated listenings , he turned around completely and thought it was a work of genius . Well , it never got past trite and idiotic for me . Add to that the facts that the synth sounds are hackneyed and outdated , the singer ca n't actually sing , and the lyrics sound like something a fourth grade sci fi geek would find only moderately clever , and you are left with a disc that has very little going for it . To be fair to the fans of the Lips , this may just be an acquired taste , but I have no desire to acquire it .	-1
Like the rest of the sheep , I could n't wait to get my ears on this when it first came out -- then I could n't wait to sell this back ! ! WHERE 'S THE ROCK ? -- -ai n't no Lips I 'm used to kissin ' , that 's fer sure ! ! -- I mean I gave it a try more than once , in different moods & everything ! , still NOTHING ! -- The title says it all ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have over 4,000 lps and 5,000 CDs in my collection . Believe me , nobody would ever accuse me of being overtly mainstream . But , as much as I have tried to embrace this band ( I tend to trust my peers when they vehemently reccomend something ) , I ca n't for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to play this . Maybe I need to see them live . For you fans , I do n't want to damper your enthusiasm -- it 's marvelous to truly love a band and it 's music . But , for perhaps the first time ever , I simply ca n't figure out why this is more special , or even remotely as good , as a lot of other releases were in that year . Sorry . Maybe a listenable singer would help , I dunno . I know Coyne 's a supposed `` genius '' and all , but ...	-1
and I had to think about it a little before I realized that this is the worst Yes album I 've ever heard . If the Flaming Lips were ever a good band , this is not indicative of it.Boring , gauche , overemotive without actually communicating anything . Really , kids , I do n't see what the hype is , unless youve smoked a few too many bones while this is on . Sober , it is gon na be difficult to stick in the changer again . The drums were nice .	-1
or that 's what one would gather from listening to this album . Really , Coyne can be a truly outstanding and remarkable frontman or he can be absolutely awful as shown in the Soft Bulletin . Now the Lips have some great works , such as Yoshimi and Transmissions From The Satellite Heart but this is n't one of them . All of the indie kids seem to love this album though , but from what I gather they just jumped on the Flaming Lips bandwagon a little too late and ended up loving the next album they made which happened to be this . Coyne essentially tears away all of the grinding , loud guitars from the earlier albums and all that is left is adult alternative , contemporary music that people in their fifties will love , merely for the fact that the music sounds pleasant enough . Coyne 's never really had all that great of a voice to begin with but he 's at his worst here . He 's damn near unbearable in A Spoonful Weigh 's A Ton . The whole album just sounds hollow , and the production values are n't anything to revel at , which is remarkable considering the Lips were aiming for a bombastic sound . There is some good stuff on here though including Buggin ' , Suddenly Everything Has Changed , and The Spiderbite Song . I 'm really quite frustrated from the acclaim that this album gets when in reality their earlier albums are much more worty of it ...	-1
No ! This album is boring , stick to the first album	-1
Compared to his dynamite album releases in the 1970 's , Barry White 's musical talents have taken him in a slow downward spiral . Years ago , he used to belt out his husky , sexual voice whether it was an inspired , up-tempo love song , or something slower . His voice `` ran the show '' back then , and commanded attention . It does n't anymore . Now lackadaisical , hypnotic instrumentation ( dare I say dull and boring ) rules over his music . This guy was so capable of putting out better music . You know Barry 's creative juices have run dry when he includes the remakes of `` Low Rider '' by Eric Bourdon & War and `` Thank You '' from Sly & The Family Stone on this album . It is such a shame . Bring back the old Barry music from the 1970 's ... .that was truly his best stuff . This 1999 release is just fluff . About as memorably exciting as watching paint dry on the wall .	-1
after the great the icon is love Barry drops down on this album.the title cut is solid.but overall this disc is pretty lightweight and average.but i ca n't wait for the next cd from this genius .	-1
... I think Barry has lost some of his range and the melodic nature of his voice . Sure the icon is love but I think he 's ridden on his reputation on this one . Sounds like a rushed attempt to cash in on his 'sudden ' fame from exposure on the sex sitcom & quot ; Ally McBeal & quot ; ..like that version of Sly 's & quot ; Thank You.. & quot ; ? I expect better from him . This could have been much better .	-1
I was very disappointed in this CD . The only track I like is & quot ; Never Got off The Ground & quot ; , only because it is the only cut on the CD that even resembles Bluegrass . Please Alison , please give us more & quot ; Everytime you Say Goodbye & quot ; and & quot ; Two Higways & quot ; .	-1
Yeeches ! Yet ANOTHER compilation to MILK the fans ! I love this group , and they deserve better . and if they ca n't put out sometime NEW , or not on Cd yet , then So be it ... but keep releasing the SAME songs ! ( oh , I am sorry there is ONE new Track to cd on this compilation ... THANKS !	-1
This dunn style is played out with this album . I do n't care if it went gold or what . This CD is not garbage , but Hell On Earth was boring too . I recommend buying Tragedy Khadafi 's superb for-the-streets bootleg or even Screwball 's Y2K if you wan na hear some original thug music from QB .	-1
Have n't we heard this album before ? There 's really only so many ways that you can say that you came from the hood , you grew up strapped with guns , you sold drugs , yadda yadda yadda . The Mobb blew up on The Infamous album , ( the only good one in my opinion ) because they set the mood and stage and talked about their life . Then they rehashed it in Hell on Earth . Then they rehashed it again here . Then they rehashed it again on Infamy . Thug rap has served it 's time . I was never a big fan of straight thug rap , but when it was done right , I noticed . The Infamous album for example . Tracks like Thug Muzik , and Murda Muzik showcase their same lyrics . There 's just no stand-out tracks on here . ( With the exception of Quiet Storm , It 's Mine , and Spread Love ) We know you can talk about the streets . It 's been established time and time again . Havoc is a decent producer , but how many times can you use the same drum loop over and over again ? The Mobb needs to expand their audience , lyrics and production wise . And when I say expand , I do n't mean & quot ; sell out & quot ; or & quot ; go pop & quot ; . Look at Nas . Always expanding , always innovating . Look at Kanye West , total innovation . I know the Mobb can do better than this . There are many many other topics that can be addressed . Maybe Amerikaz Nightmare will go in that direction .	-1
If Mobb had released & quot ; Quiet Storm & quot ; and its remix on a maxi-single , few would have bought this album . Even the most hardcore hip hop fan gets tired of hearing about MCs pumping crack , pulling guns , macking women and counting dough.Honestly , I bought this album just so I could sound intelligent when talking about east coast MCs with friends . I 'll bump this for another month or until I get tired of hearing the beats . Then I 'll trade it in for something else worthwhile . It 's time for Mobb to evolve .	-1
A Big dissapointment from Mary . The only good songs were the singles . The filler is just that , a waste of space . I just really did n't feel anything with this album .	-1
I know I 'm probably gon na get blasted for saying this but I just do n't get all the hype about Mary J. Blige . I 'm sorry , but being `` street '' and `` ghetto-fabulous '' do n't equal talent . Her vocal range is limited and on the majority of her songs she sings in one pitch . I put her in the category of a talk-singer . She 's not really singing in the true sense of the word . I do n't think her voice is horrible but its definitely not great either . I think people like her more for her lyrical content than her actual talent . She 's very relateable if you 're into that kind of stuff and I have nothing against Miss Blige as a person . I get the feeling she 's a wonderful human being . I bought her debut album - 411 , which to be fair to Miss Blige was a descent album . But since then I have n't heard anything to make me wan na rush out and buy any of her material . Sorry folks , we 're just gon na have to agree to disagree on her . Mary J Blige is a wonderful person but an average singer .	-1
WIth The Exception of Every Woman in the World I just do n't get The Hype Behind Air Supply ? All The Songs are Real Mushy.Basic Arrangements & amp ; Production.The Vocals were Alright from time to time but Overall I Just Ca n't Get into this Group at all .	-1
Deck is the most talented wu member besides the Gza . Look at this album though . This is not the Deck I know . Track 2 is off the hook but after that the production is garbage . Most of Deck 's lyrics after the first song are average . He could have done a lot better with an album that took 2 and a half years to release . Very very disappointing album . I miss the old Deck .	-1
This album needs the Rza so bad , I ca n't even believe it . I love the Rebel INS but after just one listen , I ca n't listen to this album anymore . I tried to like it , but I could n't ! These other producers need to train under the Rza a lot longer because they are horrible . INS 's skills are suffering on this album when put on these weak tracks . The Rza is the only one that can provide the perfect backdrop and tailor the music to each members needs .	-1
Memphis Bleek is a thing of the past , unless he can stage a monumental comeback , but he has n't been relevant in the rap game since Jay-Z 's professed retirement . He has spent the heaviest parts of his career riding on the gigantic success of Jay-Z , but he has already run out of steam a long time ago . He is a persona touting rapper with over the top gangster imagery and overtones , and his rhyming skills are lacking in breadth and versatility . He can rap good enough for what it 's worth , but his rhymes are simple . It 's always been this way , even on the Coming Of Age LP . It 's a gangsta fest with facile wordplay and commercially bouncy beats dripping with flash which at this point are n't fooling anyone anymore . Beanie and Jay guest star here as the good Roc-A-Fella reps they are , backing their man Memph to the fullest . The hooks are ok , but Bleek spends the whole album discussing the criminal lifestyle , and the criminal lifestyle only . It 's the only subject he has ever touched . After all his genre is gangsta rap , but it 's all one dimensional and one sided . Listen to this one only if you 're a die hard fan , but it 's not phenomenal .	-1
You have heard this guy from the Jay-Z tracks on Hard Knock Life , but those were Jay-Z 's songs . Memphis Bleek is a young star . One song I liked was & quot ; What you think of that & quot ; . Good beat . But the rest of the CD was not so good . It lacked lyrical and musical qualities . I 'm not quite sure why & quot ; Memph Bleek is ... & quot ; was his first single . I did not really like the song , but it was Ok . I gave this CD only two stars because one song does not complete an entire CD . He is a young rapper , and he is learning . Hopefully , his next CD will be better .	-1
this is the worst cd i have in my cd collection men in black the soundtrack is better than this peice of *** ! ! ! !	-1
This album is so wack I rarely play it . Dirt 's first album was far better . This is actually a waste of money .	-1
way Too Many people get Deals today.this is a Bad Joke. & amp ; HOW DARE HE DO A REMAKE OF RICK JAMES 'S COLD BLOODED ? RICK James Is THE MAN.Only GOt Your Money is Worth Listening to.it Only makes sense at How Overrated he is cuz The Whole Wu Tang Clan are Overrated as well.Avoid at all Costs .	-1
I ca n't listen to this all the way through . Infact , half of the songs are pretty unlistenable . Even the best songs are a bit horrible to listen to . ODB added an interesting dimension to the WuTang Clan , but as a solo artist , was just too much . RIP .	-1
... this is a bad album . You ca n't pretend it 's not.I really really do n't know what Wu-Tang/ODB/Elektra Records was thinking when they released `` Nigga Please , '' but ... ... at least with Dirty 's first album , you could enjoy the beats and try to tune out the yelling , screaming , etc . AND on the first CD , there was actually a little bit of RHYMING here and there . Remember RHYMING , Ol ' Dirty ? Apparently not.This CD is nothing but a collection of alright beats ( and often not even that ) , underneath Russell Jones screaming and yelling and ranting and raving . It just does n't hold anyone 's attention anymore.But I ca n't call it a total waste . `` Recognize '' has a sweet beat courtesy of the Neptunes ( who do a lot work on the album , most of it poor ) , `` Cold Blooded '' is mildly enjoyable , and there are a few clever lines in `` Got Your Money . '' Also , the title track is very tolerable , one of RZA 's better new tracks . But on the whole , this album is not worth your money .	-1
I was afraid that Old Dirty was going off the deep end , but I did n't expecty him to go this far off..	-1
I Cant believe i rushed to get this album when it first came out was pretty hyped after the superior debut Return to the 36 chambers.. This album doenst even come close to the production , the wit , the tight but off the wall rhymes that made his first album a pretty good effort.. This is like a slap in the face oh my god ! why is he trying to sing .. his remake of the old Rick James classic Cold Blooded is embarassing.. The only track on this album is Got Your Money avoid this one at all costs get his solo debut if you dont have it ..	-1
EVE IS PRETTY GOOD WITH HER LYRICS.STYLE IS A B PLUS.BEAT WISE , SWIZZ BEATS NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE LAB.TAKE NOTES , ON HOW OTHER PRODUCERS LIKE PRIMO , DR . DRE , ERICK SERMON LAST OVER A DECADE.EVE ON THE OTHER HAND , CAN TAKE ON ANY FEMALE AND A FEW MALE MCS OUT THERE.EVE IS HOT.I JUST DO N'T LIKE THE ALBUM OVER ALL.BUT IF ARE THE TO BUY A WHOLE ALBUM FOR ONE OR TWO SONGS , THEN BE MY GUESS .	-1
Let me just say that I do n't think Eve is all that great . When compared to her contemporaries , she sorely lacks in so many categories . She never had one of the greatest pen her lyrics like Lil ' Kim . She does n't have much of a lyrical arsenal , no matter how fictional , like Foxy ( I Shot Ya Remix , anyone ? ) . Bahamadia , Lauryn Hill , Rah Digga , or Psalm One ? She 's not even in the same stratosphere . So what makes Eve appealing to so many people ( myself not included ) ? My theory is that an average rapper got together with the hottest crew out ( at the time ) and the result is three mediocre discs . What appeals her to most is her content , which is understandable . The concepts for `` Love Is Blind '' and `` Heaven Only Knows '' are as insightful as they are relevant . `` What Y'all Want [ Remix ] is a nice little throw in and `` Got ta Man '' was a nice little single for a while . Outside of those joints , things begin to fall apart.The problem I kept running into was Swiss Beat 's lifeless production coupled with the fact that Eve 's flow is n't all that interesting . Too many of the tracks sound like they were made on Swiss ' casio and Eve is pretty much saying the same thing in 75 % of the songs . For example , `` Philly Philly '' would be a solid song if the hook and production were n't so lame ( her collabo with Beans on his album was way better ) and `` Let 's Talk About '' does n't work at all . Also , `` Stuck Up '' and `` Ai n't Got No DOugh '' are just plain corny and none of the skits add anything to the album whatsoever.Ruff Ryder 's First Lady is a decent album that lacks in places . Despite the holes , it 's still worth looking into if you can find it in the used bin for less than $ 5 . Just do n't go into it expecting to be blown away.Standout Tracks : Heaven Only Knows , Love Is Blind , Scenario 2000 feat . DMX , The Lox , & Drag On , and What Y'all Want [ Remix ]	-1
BLACK ROB HAS GOOD LYRICS I 'LL GIVE HIM THAT.BUT THE BEATS ARE WEAK YOU CA N'T POUND YOUR HEAD TO HIS BEATS CAUSE THEY STINK SO BAD.ALOT OF HIS SONGS HAVE THE SAME BELL SOUND BEAT TO IT.HERE 'S THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS 2,3,9 AND THE REST STINK.HE SHOULD RETIRE FROM HIS LTTLE SHINE FROM WHOA AND LIFE STORY AND BAD BOY.DO N'T BUY THIS ALBUM BADD ENOUGH I REGRET GETTING IT , YOU WILL TO .	-1
Black Rob hit really well with Whoa ! but the rest of this disc is forgetable.also way too many Guests to Show off his skills.There 's Too Much Puffy Vibe going on.there is a Reason why this Album was in the can for so Long it 's Not very Good.Bad-Boy has Been thru and this is it .	-1
I 'll put it you like this : Black Rob can flow but the corny production does a disservice to him as an MC . He 's better lyricist than G-Dookie and Mark Curry-goat . The first single Whoa was cool and Lookin At Us feat Cee-lo was tight . Life Story feat Cheryl Pepsi Riley , Muscle Game feat Mark Curry , Can I Live feat The Lox , You Dont Know Me and I Dare You are all highlights . Unfortunatley that 's all the positives I can think about on this album . Espacio suffers from a corny beat as well as a weak appearance by Lil Kim . Down The Line Joint feat Puffy , Mark Curry , G-Dep and Mase is so wack , I laughed till tears came out my eyes . How do you name such a wack joint after the old Nice & Smooth classic is beyond me . That 's not the only song that makes me laugh . PD World Tour is incredibly cheesy and Spanish Fly feat J-Lo is lame its sad . B.R . feat G-Dep is boring and Jasmine feat Carl Thomas is pretty painful to listen to . I Love You Baby had a chance to be dope till Puffy ruins it with a very dull verse . Thug Story mutilates Slick Rick 's classic joint Children 's Story . No originality there . Zip , zilch , nada . Bottom Line : Black Rob is not a garbage MC but this album is . Plus there is the factor that street dudes and preppy CEO punks dont mix . Black Rob would have had better luck on a label that would have allowed him to be himnself without having to comprimise his character . That is not going to happen when you 're on a record label with a preppy CEO punk who loves commercialism . Plus those doodoo beats killed him . I hope for Black Rob 's reputation that he leaves Sad Boy records or his crediblity as an MC will be a laughing stock.Standout Tracks : WHOA , LIFE STORY , LOOKIN AT US , YOU DONT KNOW ME , CAN I LIVE and I DARE YOU .	-1
What is going on with Bad Boy ? Craig Mack left , B.I.G . is dead , the LOX have defected , so what 's left ? How about a stale rapper who has the CEO 's no-talent girlfriend on his album . The first single Whoah was really good . I like Buckshot 's production and Black Rob shined on that joint . But alas , that 's the only good song on here . The rest of the album is booty . Jennifer Lopez is as annoying as ever and does nothing to save this sinking ship . Bad Boy , your short era has ended . Join your nemesis Deathrow Records.To sum it all up in one word ... caca !	-1
This is the closest thing to mainstream folk Christmas album anyone will get . Although there are backing vocals and an orchestra thrown in for extra holiday glee , this still sticks to a campfire sing-a-long feel . Jewel 's vocals stray close to yodeling territory without getting too uncomfortable.A Holiday Collection remains not as exciting as other season albums , even with a helping hand from a jingled-up version of `` Hands . ''	-1
This album is great , too bad this seller is a fraud and has to deface the preciousness of Tori & this album . It was a huge pain dealing with a refund from this place . I am not even sure if I ever got a full refund ? Nonetheless , DO N'T ORDER FROM THEM . Just get the domestic release and hope someday you will run across the Limited Edition fraudulently listed here .	-1
This review is for CD 1 of this 2-CD Set . The second CD is a compilation of some of Amos ' live recordings . For Toriphiles like me who collect entire concert recordings of her performances , the second CD was redundant and also quite insulting to my sensibilities , considering some of the versions of the songs they put on there were possibly the worst renditions of the songs ever . That said , the first CD contains all new recordings ( at the time , at least ) , and is a proper ` studio ' album in the strictest sense of the word.Why is `` To Venus and Back '' so unlistenable ? Even as a Toriphile , this and `` Strange Little Girls '' hardly get any airplay on my player or my Ipod . I do n't even host this on my Ipod . It just sits on my laptop asking to be added on , but I ca n't bring myself to do it . Its one of these oddities that you either ` get ' or do n't get . I 've been trying for years to possibly bring myself to find something here worth playing , and it still has n't happened . No matter though - the album has its ' own set of cult followers , and I 'm glad they have found something here to love . `` Bliss '' , in my estimation , is the best song here . The opening line itself is worth the price of the album . It has a slow , thumping bassline with a chorus and melody that far surpasses the rest of the compositions here . The same however , can not be said for the rest of the tracks . `` Concertina '' , which many fans consider an excellent single , is baffling . It has a very mediocre sound and chorus , and I really ca n't see myself playing this or even listening to it in concert - its dull and lifeless . The same goes for `` Riot Proof '' , which rates very highly on my list of Tori Songs never to hear again.Still , there are a few gems here that could possibly grow on you with repeated listening . One of these is the ` classic ' `` 1000 Oceans '' . This song has spawned various cover versions , and is certainly beautiful in its ' own way ( though decidedly sub-par when compared to Tori 's own back catalog of singles ) . The other song of note is `` Glory of the ` 80s '' , which was released as a single . Fans drool over the song , but I guess I missed the bus on this one . Its as lifeless yet overblown - not a good combination.The problem is the faux-electronica sound that defines this album . Electronica is a unique genre and its easy to go wrong with it . Not to mention that Tori going the William Orbit way is a concept that should have been handled with great care and tenderness . What we have here instead is one stomping bassline over the other , with very little attention to production or melody . The lack of any cohesive melody on ANY of the songs is what prompts me to award this album a paltry two stars.So yes , this is perhaps the worst Amos album alongwith the hideousness that was `` Strange Little Girls '' . I 've known electronica fans who thought it was garbage , and I 've known Amos loyalists who consider it her big mis-step . Still , seeing as there are enough people out there who write positive things about this CD , it might well be that I am not musically schooled enough to appreciate records such as this one . Be that as it may , I still can not bring myself to listen to this over-produced , messy lump of an album.Two Stars .	-1
Do not order this until you confirm with seller what you are getting . Many sellers are actually selling the Jewel-Case version as opposed to wood one featured ! I got ripped off that way.Music is okay , Bliss is a great song , live album is very good , not Tori 's best work otherwise , kind of slow and laborious .	-1
It 's hard to decide what 's more disappointing about this release - the impersonal and hastily recorded studio disc or the badly mastered and tepid live release . Of course , such insults are slung only with the admission that Tori is one of the brighter stars of today 's arty female rockers -- we should expect a lot more from her.The studio effort has some bright spots , including `` Spring Haze '' and the lush throwback to earlier work `` Concertina . '' Other songs , like lead single `` Bliss '' and creepy keyboard assemblage `` Juarez , '' are acquired tastes rather than instant classics . `` Lust '' is too-drowned in processing and reverb , though the simple `` Josephine '' proves to be charming on repeat . The dense buzz of `` Riot Poof '' and the chanted `` Datura '' miss their mark almost entirely unless you allow them ample time to incubate , and even then they are n't on par with even the most middle of the road songs from her last two discs.It was painfully obvious that Tori rushed the production of this album , if only from the fact that all of the songs on it got better as her supporting tour progressed . This was especially evident when it came to the aforementioned `` Jaurez '' and at-times dull closer `` 1,000 Oceans . '' Amos usually tracks up to thirty-five songs for a twelve song album , but for this one she only wrote twelve . The lack of selection definitely shows.As for the live disc , it 's utterly disposable . Anyone with $ 5 and fifteen minutes of time can secure themselves a bootleg of Tori 's Plugged tour online that would surpass this anemic collection in both setlist and quality ( notably , her appearance on Sessions at West 54th Street does the trick ) . Heavy on her quirkier tunes and light on her classics , the only unqualified high point to be found is the stunning band version of `` Sugar '' - this is its sole release . Similar versions of other B-Sides ( `` Cooling , '' `` Purple People '' ) can be found on her Spark singles , which are worth buying for the other rarities they contain . `` Little Earthquakes '' is the only song that benefits from both rearranging and mixing on this disc , although `` Cornflake Girl '' is a solid romp . With an entire tour to choose from it 's hard to believe that the versions of `` Precious Things '' & `` Waitress '' found here were the best -- she played them every night ! Meanwhile , Under The Pink tracks languish out of context from the somber mood prevalent on their original release . In the face of a sleepy `` Bells For Her '' and a unwarranted `` Girl '' you ca n't help but wonder what happened to the songs that really stand out on her LPs and shined on tour : `` Crucify , '' `` Tear In Your Hand , '' `` Caught A Lite Sneeze , '' and even non-singles like `` Little Amsterdam '' & `` Liquid Diamonds . `` To Venus and Back is a terrible entry point into the Tori Amos catalog , and with years of retrospect it will hopefully be remembered as a brief misstep or an attempt to quickly run out her contract with Atlantic Records . Though her catalog was sorely in need of a live release this one simply does n't portray the vivid and masterful performances that were turned in every night.Though more vital and assured than many other releases from the same year , Venus ca n't help but puzzle new fans and annoy those familiar with Tori 's older work . This is really a release for the Tori 's faithful followers and collectors ; others should download some live MP3 's or just buy another album .	-1
E-40 MAKES ME SICK AND HE MAKES ME LAUGH TO MY STOMACH.I HATE THIS ALBUM I DID N'T EVEN BUY IT I HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.THIS ALBUM IS NEVER WORTH BUYING .	-1
Man , E-40 gots skills and his beats are tight , but on & quot ; Charlie Hustle , & quot ; he does n't come with it like he usually does . All of the cuts on this album lyrically sound the same , and after awhile , it gets irritating hearing E-40 blabber on about a bunch of non-sense ... especially all of that & quot ; flossin ice & quot ; and & quot ; big ballin ' & quot ; garbage . On top of that , & quot ; Big Ballin ' With My Homies & quot ; is one of the many biggest disgraces in hip-hop music and definitely one of the worst songs I 've ever heard . This album ai n't with it and E-40 ai n't with it .	-1
while i like the word usage of E-40 the Raps & amp ; Music are very corny and bland.it seems like he is trying to hard to cross-over.it 's very Predictable .	-1
2 1/2One of the few artists whose consistencies ca n't seen to generate emotionally resonant output for me , this album , like many I have , has all its merit in a few choice songs and otherwise plagued by mechanized intelligence .	-1
As the 1990s drew to a close , so did Stereolab 's ability to sound fresh , vital , and relevant . By this point in their career , the `` groop '' could play their particular brand of space age lounge-pop in their sleep . And indeed , Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night found them going through the motions like never before , and still ranks as the worst record in their incredibly extensive catalogue . Properly speaking , nothing had changed . All of the elements were slotted into their expected places -- every droning Farfisa organ , every vibraphone hit , every `` ba-ba-ba '' vocal tic and harmonized verse by Laetitia Sadier and backup singer Mary Hansen . Abetted by Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire 's aloof and thoroughly boring production , Stereolab effectively turned the music that had once galvanized the college rock underground with early classics like `` Jenny Ondioline '' and `` Ping Pong '' into predictable pop pabulum.Cobra and Phases Group also coincided with the obsolescence ( if not the outright death ) of the ` 90s Exotica movement , led by Mexican easy listening composer Juan Garc & iacute ; a Esquivel , Stereolab 's major influence . ( In a sad and poignant turn of events , the aging Esquivel would die only three years later . ) But if the record justifiably represents Stereolab 's lowest descent into lifelessness , it also stands as the clear dividing line between their early- and late-career successes . Perhaps it took a blatantly autopilot album and the critical backlash that followed it to jolt the group out of their holding pattern . Even after Hansen was killed in a tragic biking accident in 2002 , Stereolab would continue to recharge their batteries and produce the excellent Margarine Eclipse and last year 's fine Chemical Chords , which did n't alter their formula so much as suffuse it with new , vivifying force . We all make mistakes , and the once do-no-wrong Stereolab was n't an exception . It 's what we do about those mistakes that really matters .	-1
Brian Mcknight has talent but this disc does n't reflect his own idenity.the material sounds too much like 2nd tier Babyface & amp ; R.Kelly.personally i do n't think that he is as talented as those guys.his first album is still his best .	-1
I have to admit 6,8,12 is a great song , and some of the others are n't too bad either . But he 's just so fond of himself as evidenced by the vocal style , the arrangements , the artwork , that he repels me more than he attracts .	-1
I received the wrong item . I ordered Method Man RedMan Blackout ! and what I received was Red Man Method Man Black out 2 , the second album . Did n't notice right off until I played it . I did receive the right Autozip download . It sound fantastic . And this is what I thought I was getting . I had this cd before and when I saw that the black out redman and method man was on vinyl I wanted it right away . Imma keep the black out 2. but my heart was set on Black out . first album ... . This has never happened before . I really hope that the shipping department look at the order invoice more closely the next time ... Best regards . Scottie R. Harris .	-1
This is not the same man that gave us Synchronicity or The Dream Of Blue Turtles . Sting seems tired and this record shows it . Songs like Desert Rose or Brand New Day are trully boring and would sound better as background for yuppies meetings . Gordon Sumner , a.k.a . Sting , lost his feeling and passion as composer somewhen between The Soul Cages and Ten Summoner 's Tales . This cd 's just keep going to nowhere with the burocratic & quot ; Sting sound & quot ; of today . Sad , but true .	-1
Well is it the age ? I 'm not sure , but I would guess it 's the CORPORATE STING really emerging here . The songs , although well crafted , all end up like wet noodle soft rock . Let me say I really do like Sting , I love all the Police stuff , and & quot ; Turtles & quot ; is a most excellent solo disc . Now it looks like Sting-a-ding-ding is turning into the pop Kenny G he has been headed for with lame discs like Mercury and now this one . The songs here lack passion and most of the time are delivered very half-heartedly . While huge fans will find some treasure in this chest , I 'll search for some other field of gold . ( gulp , sorry )	-1
This CD is just a bore . The only stand out song is his latest single which he finally released called & quot ; Desert Rose & quot ; which is finally helping the weak sales of this CD.A definite miss , buy the single . I give Sting two stars instead of 1 because he is Sting.GRADE : D	-1
I will not claim to take credit for someone else 's critique ofthis CD but it is so appropriate , it bears repeating ... & quot ; burntoffering & quot ; . I should have taken the time to preview this CD before plunking down my cash . This was a painful listening experience , indeed . To add insult to injury , I am out $ xx . What a shame about me . Melody is supposed to be what its all about , right ? I used to buy Sting 's recordings & quot ; sight unseen & quot ; . Sorry Gordon , never again .	-1
I had high hopes for the newest Sting offering based on hearing & quot ; Desert Rose & quot ; on radio . Having been a big fan of this incredibly talented and previously innovative artist , I assumed & quot ; Desert Rose & quot ; would be the prelude to an intriguing collection of songs ala & quot ; Ten Summoner 's Tales & quot ; . The first four tracks are actually pretty listenable , but Track 5 , & quot ; Perfect Love ... Gone Wrong & quot ; brought me within seconds of attacking the CD with a pair of very sharp scissors to save my CD player the indignity of ever playing it again . I have thought about giving it to my good friend and Sting fan PJ , but I am afraid it might sunder our 20 year friendship . Presently I am saddled with one of the ugliest CD 's I have ever had the misfortune of buying . Basically , I have n't been this disappointed in a prominent musician 's new CD since the warmed-over gruel put forth by those '80 's hair-bands . Why two stars ? Again , & quot ; Desert Rose & quot ; is a wonderful song . Personally , I think Sting should have released a & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; collection with & quot ; Desert Rose & quot ; as the new item on it ... that would have been a lot more palatable to me . Oh , I appreciate the artist 's experimentation with world music ... what galls me is his flagrant , wholesale ripping off of Radio Tarifa-style Middle Eastern music . I thoroughly enjoy that music , but this CD from Sting sounds like a classic & quot ; too successful to care artist wants us to know he has finally discovered what all the fuss is about & quot ; story . Frankly , I could n't hear anything else on the CD after the ugly fifth track . If I want hip-hop I certainly am not going to look to an out of touch pop artist who styles himself as an ego driven jazz virtuoso for it . I can only imagine Dr. Dre must have had a good laugh if he has heard this CD ... . French rap may be a good thing for fans of French rap , but get real , Sting ... this may take audience alienation to a new level . I definitely love to see artists take risks , but using a snot-voiced French rap artist in a very obnoxious song about nothing new under the sun is approaching the height of the absurd . Did the artist really think this track was listenable ? OK , so it has rap in it . Where is the fat backbeat ? Where is the attitude ? Where is the EDGE ? ? ? ? This song is a metaphor for the entire CD ... the grain of a good idea gone terribly wrong , leaving behind a fragmented , irritating and pretty abysmal collection of re-hashed Sting & quot ; I am the only artist that matters & quot ; slop .	-1
I 've been a big fan of Sting for years . I knew the man had an ego , but the lyrics to BRAND NEW DAY left me dumbstruck ! Even so , had the music any validity , I might have been able to overlook the lyric content . What a huge disappointment ! The only track I found at all intriguing was GHOST STORY . This CD is very self-indulgent , and , as others have pointed out - filled with substandard songs . His attempts at various styles ( country , ethnic , etc . ) are embarassing ! Save your money !	-1
what has happen to Sting ? bad enough singing with Puffy and that 's pretty low but this 2nd rate rehash ? The dreams of Blue turtles & amp ; Nothing Like the Sun are brillant.but since then his albums have continued to slide down.the only song i like is Brand New day with Stevie Wonder on Harmonica.this material was done better on Nothing Like The Sun.he has gotten too mellow and predictable.i was hyped with Branford back.but this is another let down from a talent song-writter and Bass Player.i hope Puffy has n't taken away his originality ? perhaps getting back with the Police would n't be a bad idea ? his music has gotten to be too much of formula .	-1
it is great that he found himself back on & quot ; sacred love & quot ; .here he is unsure what to play ... Pop ? dance ? jazz ? ? soul ? rock ? you can surely pass this album by ... even the best song from here ( & quot ; after the rain has fallen & quot ; ) is not that good to buy whole album.go and get SACRED LOVE !	-1
Poor Sting , he 's always getting dumped on in the music press these days for being pretentious and uncool . Well , music critics are some of the most useless and pretentious people ever , so screw 'em . It 's about the music , ya dummies , and I 'll always love Sting 's music , especially his older stuff.But sadly , most of this album verges on being `` adult contemporary . '' Maybe that 's appealing to some , but it 's far from my cup of tea . I probably wo n't ever put this one on again , but I 'll always go back to albums like DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES and . . . NOTHING LIKE THE SUN along with nearly everything the Police put out .	-1
Hard as it is to believe , Sting was , in fact , cool once . Though even aging dinosaurs like me hardly remember it . This bizarre electronica/world beat embarrassment makes FIELDS OF GOLD seem like genius . Ba Bye .	-1
No doubt there are many other reviews that have praised this album with 5 stars ... .but make no mistake , Something to Write Home About is nothing to write home about . Here , you will find all of the emo cliche 's known to man . The octave chords are present throughout . So are the whiny , high pitched vocals . The whispering to Shouting dynamics are here too . And I am sure there are more which I do n't care to talk about . The worst is probably the lyrics , which are drowned in a sea of banal sentimentality.However , this album is n't entirely without merit . To their credit , the Get Up Kids have crafted several catchy numbers . Even though I did n't like the songs , I found myself humming songs like & quot ; Holiday & quot ; and & quot ; Valentine & quot ; . ( Then again , OOps I did it again is a catchy song as well ) In addition , the band sounds very energetic , and full of youthful exuberance . The slower numbers , however are some of the sappiest emo you 'll ever hear.Ultimately , Emo kids will probably love this album . But if you 're not a fan of emo music , this album wo n't convert you .	-1
I love ya Dolly , but this music is the WHACK , or it is to this city boy ! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love !	-1

After all the hype , I expected so much more , especially since Busta Rymes was working with her on this project ( I really like him ) . I know this album was already 2+ years old when I bought it , but c'mon , a good album only gets better with time . In my opinion , the lyrics and the beats were missing something . Nothing stood out on this CD . I was really disappointed with this album and would like to get my money back .	-1
In this pathetic excuse of a cd and this band is nothing more than a public enemy/RATM ( Which I Do n't like either except their first album ) , Rip-Off without the honest truth of the worldIf this band is against america , then play someplace elseDull and uninspired.Nu Metal is Garbage	-1
Look , I 'll be honest : nu-metal ai n't my thing . I am definitely not the target audience for this album . I did n't expect to like it ; the reason why I 'm reviewing it is that it 's better than I expected , thus worth some discussion . Fans of the band should probably not read this , but if you 're someone like me who looked up Toxicity basically out of idle curiosity , maybe you 'll get something out of my opinion.Firstly , this does n't really sound like a metal album . There 's a lot of shouting , but the music is not really heavy . The sound has more in common with hardcore punk -- lots of primitive , fast guitar rhythms ( I would n't call them `` riffs , '' they do n't have a lot of individual character ) with frenzied vocals , plus flashy rebellious politics . `` Prison Song '' could go on aDead Kennedysalbum . Musically , that song is n't what I 'd call `` good , '' but the presentation is so hilariously over-the-top that it becomes a lot of fun . They cram it as full as possible -- not only with political slogans , but also with helpful facts for their listeners , delivered in a breathless , breakneck screech , spitting out the words in a hurry to get to the next slogan/fact . There 's also a gratuitous , funny diss of Hollywood.So that 's one track that I enjoyed , for reasons having nothing to do with its musical content . But there are a couple of songs that are actually well-written musically . The best , in my opinion , is the title track , which has a neat guitar line , less aggressive than most of the album , but with some disquieting suggestion in the tone . Also good is the last track , `` Aerials , '' which has the album 's best heavy riff , pretty much the only one that stands out . Both songs rely less on yelling , and feature a more interesting , theatrical delivery from frontmanSerj Tankian . I also quite like the instrumental hidden track , the most melodic piece of music on the album.Elsewhere on the album , it 's possible to find the occasional decent punk thrash . `` Bounce '' is probably the best , accompanied by a humorously nonsensical lyric , delivered with the usual frenetic energy . There are also a few catchy vocal bits , like the `` you can see America '' bridge in `` Deer Dance . `` The rest , though ... oh , man . Teenage angst has been a marketable commodity for many years . But in the 90s , such angst kings asNine Inch NailsorSmashing Pumpkinsat least tried to put a poetic veneer on their adolescent rage , to make their complaining sound more noble by expressing it with metaphors and allegories . It was n't that subtle , but at least they tried . Toxicity , however , has a song that calls some nameless figure of authority a `` parasite , '' wallows in self-deprecation with the line , `` my tapeworm tells me what to do , '' and finally paints a portrait of alienation with the line , `` sitting in my room . '' It 's such a blatant fit for the angsty youth of the turn of the millennium -- the perfect song to play during that brief sulk between dinner and TV.Further on , `` Deer Dance '' states that `` they like to push the weak around , '' where `` they '' is again nameless authority . Then `` X '' adds some anti-humanity rage with the line , `` we do n't need to multiply '' ( this demonstratively misanthropic sentiment was in fashion among the angsty youth of 2001 ) , `` Chop Suey '' preens about `` my self-righteous suicide , '' and `` Atwa '' proclaims , `` all the world I 've seen before me , passing by , '' just before erupting into the tantrum , `` You do n't care about how I feel ! I do n't feel it anymore ! `` `` Science '' condemns science for having `` failed our Mother Earth . '' Okay , so faith is good , fine , but the spirituality that the song offers instead is the safe , vague , pandering kind , where `` spirit moves through all things '' and that 's it . And , finally , `` Psycho '' is the moving story of a drug-addicted groupie , who gets patronized with the very sensible advice : `` So you want to see the show , but you really do n't have to be a ho . '' The funniest part is that he puts so much pathos into that goofy line . It 's probably meant to be ironic ( I hope ) , but that does n't make it good.So , dear hypothetical casual listener who is wracked with indecision about whether to spend money on Toxicity : I would have to advise you against it . It does contain a couple of good songs , which you might consider buying on MP3 if you 're into the whole angry guitar punk thing . However , the good parts are nowhere near enough to justify buying the CD .	-1
System of a Down 's Toxicity has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard in the last five years.I bought it on a whim back in April of 2002 as everyone was telling me this album was amazing to see what the fuss what about of these guys.The songs like Chop Suey , the title cut , Ariels , Prison Song and the rest are all the same nu-metal poor me , I hate my life garbage which was immortalized by lame groups like Linkin Park , Korn and especially Limp Bizkit.The stupid singer and the guitarist are whining and screaming like 2-year olds that did n't get what they wanted.If you like metal , I recommend you get some good old school metal instead , like Iron Maiden , Black Sabbath , AC/DC , Motorhead , Judas Priest and the one and only Van Halen .	-1
Gave this CD a whirl after hearing so many people rave about it and I still ca n't find why it 's a good CD at all . I 'll give credit to the song & quot ; Aerials & quot ; because it 's just awesome and different ; however , the rest of the CD did n't ever seem to lyrically grab me and I got tired of the leader singer 's same vocal pattern on every single song . I thought this CD would yield yet another rock band for me to like but unfortunately it seems too monotonous in structure and almost disjointed at points . I hope this band does some more fine tuning and gives more variety in singing style but also in the way they produce songs that can at least be deciphered somewhat on the first listen , not unintelligible until the fifth or sixth listen .	-1
for whatever reasons , my tastes in music keep changing in ways that i no longer listen to most of the bands i used to . system would be one of those bands . i used to like their first effort quite a bit ... so i bought this without hesitation . at first , i guess i liked it a lot . but now , i realize that it did n't stand the test of time . i saw them live twice , and i concluded that daron malakian just annoys the hell out of me and really needs to shut up and play the solo from 'soil ' recognizably . i 'm quite sick of system of a down now . maybe it 's because i keep getting into older , more respectable bands . maybe it 's because as i delve deeper into the world of music i see where the timeless classics are . system wo n't be one of those bands . though they 'll probably be up there in the numbers though when VH1 does a top 100 nu metal bands.from what i 've gathered , system of a down borrows heavily from dead kennedys and faith no more and uses the 'influence ' ( or whatever you want to call it ) , and makes something trendy that lots of little kids are into these days ( nu-metal , or 'metal ' that the general public can bob their head to ) . they do it well . but the trouble with trendy music is that it 's not challenging at all . when i listen to this album , i do n't hear anything 'new ' or 'different ' or 'thought provoking ' or 'wacky/creative ' , i just hear something i know i 've heard before and it 's not as good . it 's like pop music , but with more distortion . lacksidaisical , happy go lucky , 'catchy ' , danceable/moshable , non threatening in any way.but a couple million teenagers that have n't really lived life because they 're so young ca n't be wrong , can they ? they know what 's up , right ? they KNOW 'good ' music when they hear it ... sure ... .if you would like to hear something a little more provocative and heartfelt check out the Dead Kennedys . it 's not as 'heavy ' ( cuz it 's punk you knave ) , but it 's definately a more enriching listening experience .	-1
Like all nu metal , this album is weak and stupid . The lyrics are dumb , and the stupid singer is yellin ' like some sort of a maniac . There are a couple of okay songs that save this from being a one star album , but a word of warning to metal newbies : this is not real metal . Go get some good old school metal instead , like Iron Maiden or Ozzy Osbourne .	-1
wow this cd is so heavy and brutal , the guys from cannibal corpse and slayer had to retire . i mean the lyrics are so insane the riffs so intenseafer listening to this im afraid to listen to it again cuz its so heavy ! ! ! pantera slayer and cannibal corpse sucsk !	-1
There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time . This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs .	-1
The music critics that hail Serj Tankian as a great thinker and poet must have a brain about the size of a peanut . This is supposed to be poetic and socially-conscious ? Well , sure the system is n't perfect , but if they hate it so much , they are more than free to go back to whatever third-world pit they came from . All they 're doing is making absolutely awful & quot ; music & quot ; with no orchestration , minimal talent , and stupid lyrics . Okay , so there are three or four songs that are listenable . The rest is just noise . Nothing more , nothing that a fifth-grader could n't do . This is the epitome of why nu-metal is a gargantuan load of defecation . It 's music by drug fiends , for drug fiends , in a similar vein as rap is . The American music industry is all too willing to shove garbage like this down people 's throats , but they never give any kind of attention to talented bands , even American artists like Iced Earth . No , we have to listen to three idiots yelling and screaming over shambled noise about why they hate the government and why their lives are a waste . And there are people out there who find this to be good music . That 's what I call closed-mindedness and poor taste . I 'm all for people 's choice in music , but I honestly do n't understand what one can find entertaining about this horse dung .	-1
DO N'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ! This album is such a letdown after the first . Even their b-sides are better than this ! Ugh ! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus , and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way , so they make a horrible album . This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement . Bad stuff . Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band .	-1
this is a very critical album . the songs like forest `` why ca n't you see that you are my child ? '' yeah that 's quite a good question ... chop suey ! is one of the greatest songs ever !	-1
. . . musically at least . Sometimes I just ca n't get behind a group or album that has merit because something stupid or irritating sticks out like a sore thumb . Thus I will never give Travis , Mr. Big , Mr. Mister or Uncle Kracker a chance because I do n't want such stupid band names in my collection . I almost rejected Korn outright because of their lame name . Gee , might as well call your band & quot ; Carrots & quot ; or & quot ; Broccholi. & quot ; SOAD can rock , no question . Some of their earlier stuff is good , well mostly the insane-sounding & quot ; Sugar & quot ; is great . But this album has such gratingly , embarrassingly bad lyrics I have to turn it off. & quot ; Life is a waterfall/ We drink from the river/ Then turn around and build up the wall ? & quot ; . . . & quot ; Always wan na win but you never wan na lose ? & quot ; - DUH ! ! ! ! Sorry , this music is for pinheads .	-1
Well I do like the music for the most part , it 's well thought out in places . However what drives me nuts about this cd is that I do n't think the band as a whole can think of more than 5 words per song . I mean come on , I mean come on , I mean come on I mean come on . See , that drove you nuts and so will this cd after a few listens . They constantly say the same thing over and over again . A note to System boys , PLEASE WRITE MORE LYRICS WITH YOUR SONGS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . The music rocks and the production is very good , just write some more meaningful lyrics please ! ! 2 Stars may be a bit tough I 'll admit , but these guys have something here and they should really try and explore it a bit more on the lyrics side of things as it would truly be awesome then . I 'm sure they could tweak it a bit without losing the humor that really is System 's secret weapon .	-1
Yes , System of a Down have made some great songs here on Toxicity , but they have also put out some garbage ones that make you wonder why they even consider these half way decent . The good songs are ones that you still here on the radio quite a bit so by now most people are probably tired of those songs anyway . Overall , the bad stuff heavily outways the good so unless you can get it for cheap I would stay clear .	-1
Despicable lyrics promoting drugs and denigrating police destroy otherwise noteworthy and engaging rock music .	-1
This is the sellout album from dr. dre , remember backin the days of NWA and Death Row he used to be so good and anti-commercial pop , but now he 's with pop rap stars themselvesthis album is a mess , poor rapping , good beats are n't enough to save this wreck , Dr. Dre you may have gain respectfor the 106 & amp ; Park/TRL Crowd , but you have lost your original 101 proof and respect of 110 % percent hardcore gangsta rap and fansand ever since he supported the R.I.A.A And sued napsterDr . Dre has turned into the greediest sellouts since metallica.Take a look at their former co-hortsSpice 1 , Kurupt , Scarface , never sold out of their fansthey play at small clubs and give good music to true fansunlike going multiplatinum ( with trash ) to poser fanslike dr. dre has didDre is nothing with the late tupac shakurwho 's probably rolling at his grave sitein north carolina with his ashesDre is nothing without Eazy E And Tupac Shakurnot even close	-1
being a rapper myself , this cd is a piece of crap . if u listen close the lyrics and some of the old westside style beats are not even average . dr dre shouldnt of had so many guests ( half of them cant rap ) . it shoulda just been him , snoop , nate , eminem , knockturnal and hittman . this is one of the worst albums i have ever heard . the lyrics are the weakest parts of the album . its a 1 outta 5. dont buy it . download the 6 good songs out of 23 off of kazaa or somethin .	-1
Hello everyoneUnfortunatly alot of you people will not like the review i am about to write and i am sure i will get plentty of NO this review did n't help votes but hey , what needs to be said , needs to be said.I realy cant understand why people still like dre , he has done nothing but sell out from day 1 and continued to go from there.i would n't mind this been the case if dre would admit he is not gangsta at all and would stop acting like he is because this just makes people hate him more.. ..He needs to stop representing compton because most people in compton cant stand dre and he 's not representing compton very well anywayI first bought this album to see if it has any good hitting songs on it which i can say there are good beats on here and like most people i did like the album `` f**k you '' is a great song which you cant help but boop your head to , this album did well for dre and his new aftermath records which up until this album looked like it was going under , also with help from eminem , dre 's record lable managed to stay a-float and now seems to be shining brighthere 's where the review turns abit nasty ... .The first song on the album is called watchers which dre tells his story about his career and in one part says `` eazy im still cool with you '' now what type of s**t is that ... .any old school fan of the 90 's rap music will hate dre saying this due to dre 's constant barrage of attacks towards eazy or as dre called him `` sleazy E '' Snoop dog even calls eazy `` an AIDs pu**y having a** muthaf**ka ... '' and now you guys are kissing his a** again ... . leave it out guysdre had plentty of enemys and it seems that once they die dre makes out as if they where his buddys and seems to do shout outs to them all the time ... .. ie : UP IN SMOKE TOUR R.I.P which is about half way through the tour a picture of eazy comes up and tupac but yet eazy and tupac hated dre before they dyed so i hardly think there gon na of changed there mind now ! ? i can see the good side of it and it is paying respect to the dead legends but look at it this way . if someone was ripping you apart infront of every1 and you hated them so much you wanted them dead , would you like them suddenly say `` hey im cool with you now '' once youv dyed ... .. it 's taking the pi** abit ! i would only recomend this album to true dre fans and the album is new/but trys to keep it old skool gangsta which dre does seem to do exremly well in this album , with plentty of other artists joining him on a number of songs from snoop dog to eminem and xcibit and plenty morethe album is worth picking up but some may be offended by the topics i have brought up in my review about eazy e , especialy if your a eazy e fan like my self , you may want to give this one a miss guys.thank you for taking the time to read my review . please feel free to leave comments good or bad and please vote fairly . thank you	-1
Dr. Dre 's second solo album really fails to impress . Dre relied on too many ghost producers and new , inexperienced rappers to do most of his work on this album . This has got to be the most over-rated album for 1999-2000 . Kurupt 's The Street 's Is A Mutha was a classic and a WAY better album . Yet it only sold about an eighth as much as this did . The Chronic was an undisputed classic , and though it would be unfair to compare Dre nowadays to the way he was then , he could 've done much better than this . There are over twenty songs on this album , and only about three to five of them are really good . Hittman was an impressive guest , and the additions of Snoop Dogg and Kurupt were also smart moves . Where was RBX , Warren G , The D.O.C. , Daz Dillinger , The Lady Of Rage ? Dre & quot ; Forgot about them & quot ; I guess . Speaking of which & quot ; Forgot About Dre & quot ; featuring Eminem is a terrible song , it 's totally catered for the radio , and MTV teenyboppers , yuck . & quot ; Big Ego 's & quot ; featuring Hittman is a nice song , and & quot ; B*tch N*ggaz & quot ; featuring Snoop and Hittman is good , Hittman actually disses CJ Mac here and does a pretty good job . & quot ; Explosive & quot ; was decent , Nate Dogg and Kurupt saved the track , Dre did n't even rap on it . & quot ; Let 's Get High & quot ; with Kurupt was okay because Kurupt saved it again , and & quot ; Still Dre & quot ; with Snoop was a good track . & quot ; Housewife & quot ; was good because it 's a Kurupt track and Dre remixed it and even this version ( different from the one on Kurupt 's album ) is only good . Overall four or five honestly good songs and the rest was pure filler . Overall if Dre wants to improve he should try actually TAKING PART in the making of his album . But the beats were not good at all on this album . Dre 's rapping was average . The only plus was having Nate Dogg , Kurupt , Snoop and Hittman on the album .	-1
The Chronic 2001 is one of the worst dr. dre albums ever produced , this is another reason why dr. dre has n't been the same since he left death row , the production is not as good as it was in the chronic from 1992 , although there are a few good songs , but the rest is just godawful , he started paving way for feminem ( aka the most overrated rapper of all time ) and other stuff to come.It was the major downfall of his career . ( Notice the napster thing ) Sorry Dr. Dre you are no longer my favorite producer of all time , in fact you been no longer since 1996Just Blaze takes that spot now.Dr . Dre has sold out and forgot about his long time fansIf you want a real dr. dre album , pick up the chronic .	-1
Everybody who keeps talking about & quot ; this CD is an excellent follow up & quot ; to & quot ; The Chronic & quot ; and & quot ; Dre is back & quot ; needs to shut up with all that bull cuzz this CD sucks . This CD sounds like a weak compilation or soundtrack , not an album . To tell you the truth , I 'd rather listen to some East Coast and Dirty South stuff like DMX , Eve , Juvenile , Lil ' Wayne , or Hot Boys , not Dre and his West Coast buddies . This CD is all hype and bull ! Plus , the & quot ; Forget About Dre & quot ; is the worst attempt at his conforming to Hip-Hop 's status quo of bounce Hip-Hop ! While Eminem is cool , Dre 's Eminem-penned flow is all offbeat and pretentious . This CD sucks ! FFF-	-1
This album has a few half decent tracks - `` Who Wears These Shoes ' , 'Slow Down Georgie ' , `` Breaking Hearts '' , `` Passengers '' but the overall feel is pretty plastic and detached . He 's just not putting much emotion into this one . Not really any bad or annoying songs , but this was the first album where the music sounds like it was done on a machine ( actually I think it was ) .Update : the remastered version of this goes a long way towards making the music sound much better . The first CD issue of this really squeezed the life out of the recording .	-1
Alright , Breaking Hearts may sound great in comparison to Leather Jackets or Ice on Fire . But it 's still a rather lifeless effort . Like Too Low For Zero , this one suffers from complacency ; it 's representative of industry product rather that pop/rock magic . Even Sad Songs ( Say So Much ) , the obvious hit , is a bit too comfortable for me , lacking the glitz , warmth and buzz of Elton 's crucial 70 's work . I 'll take Bennie and the Jets , Tiny Dancer , Pinky , Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters over any of the songs on this album .	-1
From the objective reviewer ... '' Sad Songs '' is the only stand out track with a couple of decent songs ... not enough to warrant a better rating .	-1
2 1/2Even with the momentous influence behind it , this minimalist post-punk is one of those albums that simply can not stand up to any esteemed reputation in my ears , with hardly any of the repetitious detachment seeping into internal resonance , coming across as tautly sterile instead .	-1
I wonder what was going through BT 's head when he made this horrible album . His first two albums IMA and ESCM were classics but Movement in Still Life is just the worst techno albums I have heard this year and as well as one of the worst albums in general this year . I get the impression on this cd that Brian was attempting to make that big breakthrough like Moby did with Play . Although Movement in Still Life is different to Play , the album lacks any charm and beauty and comes off rather derivative . The only songs I like on this cd is Mercury and Solace and Dreaming which is why I gave this cd two stars instead of one .	-1
I fell in love with his & quot ; ESCM & quot ; album which was truly a masterpeace , even his first album was good , but this is far from trance music . Here we have fillers and songs that are just too far away from trance as possible like & quot ; Madskillz & quot ; and & quot ; Never gon na come back down & quot ; Only a few songs are good actually & quot ; Dreaming & quot ; & quot ; Goodspeed & quot ; and & quot ; Mercury and solance & quot ; , those are also following the old style of enjoyable quality trance . I do n't know why he decided to go commercial and change something succesful to the worse . This album only get 's 2 stars and that 's because it 's not what i want to hear when i check for dream dance in the store .	-1
I know that there 's already a million other people saying & quot ; Buy the import & quot ; , but it bears repeating . The original UK version is a very well-designed trance album that covers a lot of ground and has some remarkable singles , all segued together well . This US version , though , feels like a group of 50-something record executives sat around and stripped the album to get on radio and soda commercials.I ca n't outright pan the album , because it does have & quot ; Godspeed & quot ; and & quot ; Dreaming & quot ; . But please , please , please buy the import , not this imitation trance album .	-1
Let 's face it people , Lil Wayne as a rapper , is sorry . He has no skills . Sure he can churn out a nice verse or line every now and then but what professional rapper ca n't ? He does have a nice lil flow but his voice is messed up and he does too much whispering . But he is captivating sometimes and is also fun to listen to with his deep southern drawl . Another amazing feat is that he only curses on one song ( the guests curse ) which is really something considering the content of today 's music.The Beats provided by Mannie Fresh are tight as always and is probably the only reason CashMoney was even noticed . Do n't be mistaken , Mannie 's beats bang and are nowhere near simplistic . Their rhyming capability can range from horrible ... to manageable.The title track is a classic song , I ca n't front . It is still tight today and I listen to it on the regular . The beat is ... tight and Wayne comes unusually tight on this song . Kisha is a very tight song about the Hot Boyz trying to `` get '' with this girl named ( duh ) Kisha . Beat is nice and mellow and really hits well if you are driving at night . High Beamin is a nice laid back song featuring B.G . Wayne comes with another nice verse and it is perfect for cruisin . ... The World is heartfelt and is an average track . Drop It like Its Hot is fast paced song perfect to get the guls booty dancing . Not Like Me is arguably the best song on the album it has a sorta jamaican mixed with egyptian beat and is very pimpish and the guy singing the chorus is butter.If so many songs are tight why such a low rating you ask ? Well , Young Playa is in one word pitiful . Loud Pipes and Watcha Gon Do are just plain out wack . Remember Me is horrendous and I hope I never remember this song and would be beneficial if I never heard it again in my life . Enemy Turf is Horrid . The rest of the songs arent even worth mentioning , and to top it off most of their lyrics are lame and played . I 'm not hating , that 's just how it is.Basically this cd DOES have some tight songs on it , BUT the majority of the album is wack . If you like CashMoney you MIGHT like this . If you hate CashMoney this will not change your opinion .	-1
This CD is garbage ! To hell with Lil Wayne . That monkey deserves to be beaten to death by real rappers .	-1
Come on now . You know Lil Wayne 's flow evolved and started to sound a lot better with his second release , Lights Out . This album is when he still had that weebledy wobbledy flow he use to have ( you know that 's exactly how he use to rap . Dont act ! ) . The album 's only good tracks are Tha Block Is Hot , Kisha , F*** Tha World , Lights Off and You Want War . Hot garbage like Loud Pipes , Respect Us , Drop It Like It 's Hot ( his cheesy version of Juvenile 's Back That Azz Up ) , High Beamin and Enemy Turf should have been left in the studio trash can where they belong . The rest of this album is so bad I wont discuss it . Bottom Line : Lil Wayne 's Tha Block Is Hot is the worst Cash Money release of 1999 . Lil Wayne 's flow wasnt the only problem of the album , Mannie Fresh 's beats were terrible and the guest appearances didnt help matters either . If you want Wayne at his best start with Lights Out and work your way up to Carter 2 . This album was buttpuke . I was in high school when it came out , and I can recall people who were not used to giving away anything for free was going this album away free ! That should tell you something .	-1
Man this cd aint worth yo 14 dollas people . This cd was supposed to go hard , but this is the worst Ca $ h Money cd yet . Lil Wayne was tight on everybody elses cd 's except on his . This cd aint worth ya'lls money . The only tight songs on here , Tha Block Is Hot and Keisha . That is all . Peace out .	-1
Tash ' debut album Rap Life is plain out horrible . The production on the album is incredibly wack and is the album 's biggest weakpoint . Tash 's rapping on the other hand is superb and he comes up with sick one-liners that make you hit the rewind button . GZ is GZ with Kurupt is a classic song . The Game featuiring Carl Thomas is also a great track that utilizes a slinky laid back beat and has Tash ripping the mic . Smokefest 1999 featuring Outkast and B-Real is yet another one of the standouts . The beat is thick like the smoke they are inhaling and lazy sounding on this song . Uh lets see couple other good tracks here and there but none worth mentioning . Also the skits are more than just stupid . The album 's production is the main flaw , and even Tash 's unstoppable flow and potent lyrics ca n't save it . My advice : listen to the Liks albums and pass on this trash , its not worth it .	-1
This is by far my least favourite Rage Against The Machine album . The self-title one was really alive and full of energy . Evil Empire does n't appear as good at first , although if you give it a chance it is as good . This , on the other hand , is of a much lower quality . There are some great riffs , the best including Maria , Born Of A Broken Man and Testify . Geurrilla Radio , Sleep Now in the Fire and Born As Ghosts are also pretty cool . The fact still remains however that they are going to need to write an album that is up to the standard of the other two if thier talent is going to be continued to be recognised . The only really good thing that I have to say about this album is that it does show progression , which is always good . However , if you are new to Rage then get the first album ( called Rage Against the Machine ) and then Evil Empire . Do n't bother shelling out money on this one .	-1
Rage sorta has a beastie boys sound to em , loud and trashy , and I only got this cd for the song & quot ; Guerrilla Radio & quot ; which is da bomb ! I did n't really think too much about the rest though .	-1
Rage 's fire was evidently dying when they released the Battle of Los Angeles . Instead of the undeniable power one would feel while listening to their first two albums has diminished , and Rage seemed no longer potent as a band than they did in 1993.There are a few good songs here , like `` Testify , '' `` Calm Like a Bomb , '' and `` Born of a Broken Man , '' but many of the songs sound like as if Rage was running out of ideas for riffs and songs , and de la Rocha 's lyrics no longer were inspired by any new ideas , and most of them sound like rehashed lyrics from their 2 previous songs . I 'd recommend their self titled album and Evil Empire over this one any day of the week .	-1
Like every other Rage album , but weak . And weak is not something Rage should have been even for a moment . And Morello becomes less of a guitarist all the time .	-1
Like many , if not most , of the people who bought this CD , I was hoping for something like her absolutely brilliant first album . It was disappointing to find that she 'd hit the usual musician 's sophmore slump , producting an album that contains none of the bluesy , hard-edged beauty of her previous effort . I 've already given the CD away , as I had no desire to hear it again.She does have an awesome track on the 'Plesantville ' sound track , though !	-1
depressing , dependent songs . it is that reason that i leaned away from jewel ( besides the fact that her voice got very cry-baby ) , and so i will lean away from Fiona . a far cry from a terrific tidal wave , a weak release . so get away from it 'fast as you can '	-1
Fiona 's young seductive look , deep voice and piano bar tunes may have bought her fame with Tidal , but in truth this album is just a repeat.Sure we get some new sounds , but they are n't good enough to make this effort stand out , and if it were n't for her age and striking looks , her last effort would have never made it.Criticism aside , Fiona writes good lryic , it 's just her unfiminate voice , limited vocal range and limited style range that hurt her . Take a song like the first single & quot ; Fast As You Can & quot ; , on first couple of listens the song sounds fresh , after a few you notice the the song shifts between two very different patterns , but we still get repitition as the whole song kind of loops , this same pattern can be found in all the other songs , some brilliant lryic writing prevents this album from being an entire flop .	-1
Along withTori Amos , Fiona Apple repopularised the piano as a rock instrument in the 1990s amidst a stream of annoying grunge and techno . Influenced by long-forgotten 1970s albums likeTurn of the Cards , Tori 's first two albums were exceptionally personal and melodic works that for me as a first- and second-year student of Melbourne University , became beacons of hope in a musical landscape that seemed to be deteriorating all the time.When she first emerged in 1996 withTidal , I thought ( oddly ) Fiona Apple was from my native Australia and she seemed interesting enough that I bought `` When The Pawn '' almost as soon as it came out despite not being pleased with the new direction she seemed to be taking . With hindsight , I feel at present that my judgement has been vindicated . Just as Tori tried some quite silly experiments onher third album , on `` When the Pawn '' Apple is trying to be a `` twisted '' rocker . In the process , both her voice and piano lose out . What is undoubtedly meant to be eerie soundscapes on most tracks on `` When the Pawn '' tend to come off as half-hearted , notably on the opening two tracks . In other parts of the album , Apple simply comes off as tuneless.With the exception of `` Fast As You Can '' , which really does pull off the trick of being utterly creepy , none of `` When The Pawn '' 's songs have a really memorable line or lyric : instead , they sound likeAlanis Morrisettetrying to be an art-rock singer . The lyrics , too , tend to be too much of the angsty , Melissa Etheridge-style `` wronged lover '' school to really be effective : there is not nearly enough personal reflection or serious storytelling.All in all , if you want to see a record that is truly `` pretentious '' whilst not achieving much , you 've come to the right place . Stick with Tori 's first two albums if you want some really genuine piano rock , though .	-1
the way she has been written about i thought she might be talented as Tori Amos ? wrong.she is more closer to a bargin basement version of Jewel.this cd showcases nothing.weak vocals , lyrics & amp ; run of the mill music .	-1
I loved her first record . I thought it showed not only great compositional skill , but strong production values in the songs she opted to put on it . They all seemed to fit and they were n't anywhere near as pretentious as this material is . Is she still a great songwriter ? I have to assume she is , but the songs are n't that strong ... it just shows a good sense of musicality and theory . No JAMS ... no listenable angst or heart that does n't drive me nuts with its sing-songy abstinence.I expected more from her second record , considering how long I 'd been waiting for it.A fan waiting for the next one .	-1
Sadly , Chris Wallace was killed in a hail of gunfire . Releasing a half @ $ $ ed album that tarnishes his reputation is not going to bring him back , and only compounds the tragedy.Frankly , this album is full of half made tracks that never should have been heard ( with a few exceptions . ) And if you ever want to see an opportunist , look at Puffy . He used his & quot ; friend 's & quot ; death as a spring board to his own superstardom . This is the quintessential sell out in action . Biggie 's body was n't cold before he released several & quot ; tributes & quot ; which give people the wrong impression of Biggie.One bright spot on this bleak album is & quot ; Dead Wrong. & quot ; That song is a pretty good intense song.The most tasteless track is & quot ; Who Shot Ya. & quot ; Do we really need a new Tupac diss AFTER hes already died ? Why did Puffy decide to propell this rivalry after it had cost both Tupac 's and Biggie 's death ? Money.Buy & quot ; Ready to Die , & quot ; or & quot ; Life After Death & quot ; instead.I 'd say & quot ; RIP Chris Wallace & quot ; here , but after this disgrace , I do n't see how thats possible .	-1
THIS ALBUM IS OK.LIFE AFTER DEATH WAS WAY BETTER.THESE R THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS 3,4,6,14.DO N'T BUY THIS GET SOME SINGLES .	-1
Ok I know the man is gone from us and we usually rate people who died or passed away with a little more remorse . Not me ! Biggie would n't want it that way . ( I said that like I knew him ) This is just an album Puffy or P ... ..whateva put out to let us remember Big . This was the worst album since Ready to Die and that was n't a bad album.This album to me was just a filler of a legacy of one of the best rappers of the game . Biggie did n't need this album . It 's been 6 years and I am still on the Life After Death CD . That is the best double disc Cd I have ever heard.With that said if you are looking a a leagcy cd from Biggie ... .this is n't it . If you do n't already got Life After Death ... ..then go get that . This album just does n't do it for a Biggie fan like myself.P.S . Do n't band some of the songs though ... ..I thought the song with Cash Money was pretty good . Peace ! !	-1
I cant believe poop diddy would exploit and profit off of his so called friend by releasing this garbage.Bad boy simply put this cd out just to make more money off of biggie fans.There are too many people featured and biggie doesnt even rap on some songs.Alot of the lyrical content is simply sleazy and filthy.The worst part about it is that poop diddy actually sings on most of this cd because he has an over inflated ego.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
I do n't think people are even talking about this album anymore because it was such an injustice to Biggie 's legacy . Instead of a third Biggie effort or even a tribute to Biggie , Born Again is a overhyped and inconsistent album thrown together by Puff and company just to make some quick bucks.But first , the good news . The updated `` Come On '' featuring Sadat X has a better beat and Sadat 's rhymes are better than on the original . And even though Biggie did n't really rhyme with Beanie Sigel , Black Rob and Ice Cube on `` If I Should Die Before I Wake '' , the beat is so murderous and the dudes rhyme so well that you start to wonder what if they really did record together.Then , there are the halfway decent songs like `` Notorious B.I.G . '' ( what a clever title , huh ? ) . It is here where Jadakiss got the hook from for The Lox 's `` All For the Love '' . And though `` Dead Wrong '' has some dope lyrics ( they had to cut out the part where he said , `` I 'm wrong/Jehovah said I 'm barred from the pearly gates/F__ it , I did n't wan na go to heaven anyway '' ) and Eminem rips it as well , they used the same played-out beat used in Rakim 's `` Mahogany '' .But the album has so many shortcomings that it 's sickening . There are some rappers that you know Biggie would n't have rapped with like Missy ( `` Let Me Get Down '' ) , and the Hot Boys on the album 's lowest point , `` Hope You N 's Sleep '' . Mannie Fresh 's beat mixed with Biggie 's unpolished rhymes is worse than having Biggie 's vocals over Juvenile 's `` Ha '' beat from his bootleg album , Reborn . And Mark Curry 's verse saves `` Dangerous MC 's '' . Moreover , the song titles are repetitive and uncreative ( `` Notorious B.I.G . `` , `` Biggie '' ) .It gets worse . The masterminds must have run out of Biggie 's lyrics to use , so they run and dig into some of his lyrics from songs that EVERYONE has heard before . The chorus to `` Biggie '' is from the Heavy D/2Pac/Untouchables collabo `` Let 's Get It On '' ; `` Big Booty Hoes '' jacks Luke and Biggie 's `` Bust a Nut '' ; and `` Tonight '' and `` I Really Wan na Show You '' uses verses from `` Long Kiss Goodnight '' and `` Everyday Struggle '' , respectively . Who are these people trying to fool ? Even DJ Premier makes a misstep here . Though his beat to `` Rap Phenomenon '' is dope , and Redman 's line , `` I 'm concurrent in your hood like a teenage mom , '' is hilarious , BIG 's verses are taken from Tracey Lee 's `` Keep Your Hands High '' . And BIG 's outtakes on `` Can I Get Witcha '' are called outtakes for a reason . They were lazy freestyles that should have been left in the archives . But the worst moments are putting on the shortened version of the ancient song `` Who Shot Ya '' , and in `` I Really Wan na Show You '' , K-Ci 's singing/yelling is HORRIBLE . To further [ degrade ] the album 's quality , Biggie 's moms complains in the outro how hip-hop killed Biggie . That is mad debatable.Why dig through those songs when it would be just easier to Puff and them to admit that they do n't have enough Biggie lyrics to make an album ? Then they could have shelved this whole project . Forgive them , B.I.G. , for messing up your third album .	-1
In theory , this would actually be a good album ; compiling unreleased material form the man , myth and legend himself , the Notorious B.I.G . But the majority of it is just rehashes of previously relased stuff , though Rap Phenomenom is a tight song . There are some good spots though ; putting Who Shot Ya ? , the B-side of the & quot ; Big Poppa & quot ; single on the album was a GREAT move . But if this is really supposed to be rare B.I.G stuff , where 's & quot ; Party And Bulls**t & quot ; , his first hit that was on the Who 's The Man Soundtrack ?	-1
OK , so i 'm a big 2Pac fan , but i have NUTHIN at all against Biggie . I 've never been a real fan of him and have n't really heard much of his stuff . But , i have heard enough to know that he was a great rapper , much better than this CD 'makes him out ' to be . The songs are so unmoving ! I ca n't see how a commercial , hardcore , whatever kind of rap fan , could see much in this album . Just look at both the number of people featured on the album ( despite who they are ) and who executive producer is and you can guess what i mean . ( No offence to Puffy , i know how much Biggie meant to him ) . I find it hard to understand though how , like them or not , some of the best rappers today are featured , including Jay-Z , Meth , Red , Nas and Eminem , and still the songs are so weak ! ( I know that people will disagree ) . If Biggie woz around today i know that this would have been MUCH better . I 'd of given this album one star but i know how great Biggie was , and no matter how good or bad this is as he was n't around to produce it . Nuthin under his name deserves a one star rating ! However , the outro featuring Biggie 's mom is really moving . It says it all about the REAL Christopher Wallace.Bottom line , this is n't Biggie , face it , itz a completely different style . If you luv Biggie 's stuff i do n't think you 'll feel the same way about this . R.I.P Biggie . We know what a great MC you really were . *Peace* .	-1
Biggie is one of the greatest east coast rappers to ever come out and his 2 previous albums , Ready to Die and Life After Death , were just 2 timeless classics that will never be forgotten . However , when Born Again came out , it was a whole different story.This album is truly one of the worst rap albums ever put out and it 's not Biggie 's fault , as many have quoted , but because Poof Diddy was selfish and just wanted to make more money off Biggie . I 'm going to keep this short and simple : most of the songs are just complete trash , there are only one or two tracks that are actually worth listening.1 . Notorious B.I.G.- 3 , not too shabby but not too great , it would have been MUCH better if Lil ' Kim and Poof Diddy were left out2 . Dead Wrong- 5 , great track however I do n't think Biggie would have made a track with Eminem3 . Hope You Niggas Sleep- 3 and a half , Biggie 's verse is tight but when the Hot Boys and Big Timer joins in , it just ruins everything . The Hot Boys and Big Timer are two of the most stupid rappers ever to be put out4 . Dangerous MC's- 2 , one of the worst songs on the album . The lyrics do n't even go with the tune on this and the beat is completely out of time . Every rapper , even Biggie , do n't shine on this track . Skip5 . Biggie- 4 , an alright track with Junior M.A.F.I.A . The beat is average6 . Niggas- 2 , another horrible track . Do I need to say more ? 7 . Big Booty Hoes- 2 , uugggh , truly a track that belongs at the junkyard8 . Would You Die for Me- 1 , f*ck i hate this track . This is the worst track ever to come out . I hate Lil ' Kim so much , she totally ruins this track . The track is just horrible and the lyrics are stupid9 . Come On- 2 , *yawn*10 . Rap Phenomenon- 4 , another alright track . Method and Redman shine out here and Biggie completes another great lyric page11 . Let Me Get Down- 2 , complete utter trash12 . Tonight- 3 , this is alright . Would have been better if Joe Hooker was left out13 . If I Should Die Before I Wake- 5 , this is by far the best song on the album . The beat is dark and gritty but incredible , Biggie uses his verse from Big L 's track 'DEADLY COMBINATION'14 . Who Shot Ya- 5 , timeless classic , I love this track to bits . The dark piano piece is one of the best I 've heard15 . Can I Get Wit Cha- 2 , no16 . I Really Want to Show You- 4 , I can get down with this17 . Outro- 1 , one of the stupidest outros I 've heard . We can find out about Biggie 's life on the netAs you can see , this is the worst album to be put out by Biggie or Bad Boy . Bad Boy Records was a disgrace , their only true classics were READY TO DIE and LIFE AFTER DEATH . Do not , and I mean DO NOT , get this album . It is not worth your money . ... Biggie was a classic , this album just shows that Poof was n't keeping it true to his homeboy . ...	-1
I would like to say that this album is incredible , but I ca n't . This album was a BIG waste of time and production . Puffy took sampling too far on this album . Only three songs I liked , & quot ; Dead Wrong & quot ; , & quot ; Dangerous MC 's & quot ; , and & quot ; Rap Phenomenom & quot ; . Puff CAN NOT rap , Kim is too full of herself , and that & quot ; Notorious & quot ; is so wack , AND the remix . This album would make BIG turn over in his grave . Peace to the Wu-Tang Clan ( The ILLEST MC 's of all time ! ) , and the Bronx . ( I 'm so disgusted ! )	-1
puffy trying to cash in quick unloads this mess.the genius of B.I.G is smeared a bit by this unwanted material.it sounds dated and out of place with some of the duets.not on par with what the man was trying to do in the long run .	-1
This is no Biggie I 'm used to listening to . This album is plan wack . This best song on this cd is & quot ; Dead Wrong & quot ; ( feat . Eminem ) . The rest of it is terrible . I think Puffy made this so he could get some money from it , since his album did n't do sh @ t on the charts . Please do n't waste your money . Go get Eminem 's & quot ; The Marshall Mathers Lp & quot ; or Dr. Dre 's cd before you get this junk , but , if you like Biggie that much , then buy it . I warned you . By the way , why do people keep saying that Biggie is the best rapper of all time ? He only made 2 albums , well , 3 if you count this album . You 'd have to make more than 2 or 3 albums to call youself the best .	-1
Puffy is the most reprehensible person to ever disgrace hip hop and this posthumous `` album '' is proof . Instead of letting Biggie 's memory rest with the excellent Life After Death , he decides to pull this dead rabbit out of his hat and destroys the memory of Brooklyn 's Finest . Notorius B.I.G . feat Lil Kim and Puffy was a terrible first single and made me stay away from this album for a while ( I didnt pick it up till 2000 ) . Hope You N****s Sleep feat The Hot Boys and Big Tymers is a complete mismatch . Biggie over a Mannie Fresh beat ( which wasnt a bad beat by the way ) goes together like a size 20 foot in a size 6 shoe . Dead Wrong feat Eminem was and still is a banger even though I doubt Biggie would have made a song with Em . N****s , Dangerous MC 'S ( feat Mark Curry , Snoop Dogg & Busta Rhymes ) , Let Me Get Down ( feat Missy Elliot , G-Dep and Craig Mack ) and I Really Want To Show You ( feat Nas , K-Ci and Jo-Jo ) are lethally dull . Rap Phenomenon feat Redman and Method Man rehashes the same beat from Tracy Lee 's Keep Your Hands High ( also feat the same verse from Biggie ) but the track actually works and is one of the better songs on the album . Come On feat Sadat X is a classic joint by itself Nuff said ! If I Should Die Before I Wake ( feat Ice Cube , Beanie Sigel and Black Rob ) is tight also . Biggie feat Junior Mafia is a painfully bad and tracks like Big Booty Hoes ( feat Too Short ) , Would You Die For Me ( feat ludicrous performance by Lil Kim and Puffy ) and Can I Get Witcha ( feat Lil Cease ) are only good for cheap laughs and nothing else . Dishonorable mentions : Who Shot Ya ( the song was a classic that should have never been shortened ) and Tonight ( feat Mobb Deep ) . Bottom Line : Born Again is a disgrace to an Mc who is definitely capable of much better work . These verses were not Biggie 's best verses and we all know that he would have not worked with the majority of these artists on this album ( The Hot Boys and Missy especially ) ! This album was made to fatten Puffy 's pockets at the expense of destroying Biggie 's memory and as you can see it worked because this album went platinum . F*** You Puffy you acne-faced freak ! Rest In Peace BIGGIE ! ! !	-1
this cd aint all that if you a tru biggie fan then you go ahead and do your thing and you buy your cd . but if you int then i suggest you go buy that ish used from Wherehouse music . Ya feel me ? the best song on there are dead wrond and whould you die for me and those get pretty boring and played out after a while if you play them enuff .	-1
one of hip-hops greatest by . Puff let the man R.I.P . You had to go and mess something good up . This album has a couple of aight tracks on it . But I feel some of the people on the album would have never even appeared on the same stage as biggy if he were alive . So will somebody please tell me why they are on his post-deaf album . I did n't buy the album because he was dead but I bought it because I am a fan . this album is a disgrace to a legacy . Puff I hope you are at his grave aplogizing for insulting on of hip-hops finnest . this joint should have never been droped . and if I had a chance to get my money back I would . quess i will have to listen to some of his old albums till I get this one out of my mine because it pisses me off to listen to it.p.s . yo puff tell jennifer to come get up with a real man . ha hastay up yall one	-1
DO N'T GET ME WRONG , I LOVE ANGELA BOFILL 'S TALENT . BUT , THIS RECORDING WAS NOT HER BEST . CLIVE DAVIS WAS PUSHING HER OUTSIDE OF HER QUIET STORM GENRE ONTO THE 80s POP MUSIC MAINSTREAM FARE . THE END RESULT IS THIS LARGELY FORGETTABLE MISTAKE . FOR BOFILL AT HER BEST , GET & quot ; ANGIE & quot ; , & quot ; ANGEL OF THE NIGHT & quot ; , ARISTA 'S & quot ; DEFINITIVE COLLECTION & quot ; , & quot ; I WANT TO LOVE SOMEBODY & quot ; AND HER MOST RECENT EFFORT , & quot ; LOVE IN SLOW MOTION & quot ; .	-1
This album was horrible . If it was n't for the & quot ; Anything & quot ; track by Jay-Z this album probably would n't have sold .	-1
Mac Man was a Tight cut.the Problem with Beanie Sigel 's Album is that it 's his in Name Only.Jay Z takes over and the whole vibe feels Like He wanted to Put another Album Out but could n't so he did it thru Sigel.Roc A Fella has Only One Bread Winner that is Jay.and The Source has Got to Be Jivin ' this is NoWhere Near Ice Cube 's Amerikkka 's Most Wanted ? Cube for One Thing Would Never RIde on Somebody that He Could Blow Away.and Old Ice Cube would Make a Meal out Of Jay Z on a Full Belly already.that Means Sigel would n't have half a chance .	-1
I was very disappointed with this one there only three good song 's on it . The beat 's were wack , and the lyric 's did n't move me like Roc-A-Fella artist usually do . If your looking for the Jay-Z style on this album forget it . Listen to this one before you buy it .	-1
I was highly anticipating this album for a long time . This mc sounded very promising . Well , the production group of this album can be blamed for the downfall . Beanie 's lyrics are tight , but the music does n't sound good at all . These tracks are almost unbearable to listen to . They have almost no playback value . The song , Mac Man , was a good try , but failed . The best song is the first , title track . I was very disappointed by what I have heard . He 's a tight mc , however , the only thing giving this album those 2 stars .	-1
I like this album . No man , I LOVE THIS ALBUM ! I got to Wild Out , This Album is Banging all across North Trenton to West Philly , to Orange Newark , and to the Back of Liberian Yonkers . A Section like North Trenton . We listen to this music and not to diss my man Jadakiss but you should n't point fingers , thats why 50 Got you . What goes around comes around . But I stay on your side , and not because i 'm from Yonkers and live in North Trenton . Nah dog , I got respect for you . They making money , wheather they got your flow or not . At least they did n't steel your beats and Rhymes , that 's the most important part . Both of you are raw so I do n't have to point fingers to who 's annoying . Oh NO ! 1 . Truth - ( THIS IS MY SONG ON THIS ALBUM ) 2. Who Want What - ( With Memphis Bleek ) ( YEAH , THIS SECOND SONG IS RAW ) 3 . Raw & Uncut - ( With Jay-Z . This Song Is Raw , Reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr ) 4 . Mac Man - ( Freestyle Song ) 5 . Playa - ( With Amil ) ( Is yall Players ) 6 . Everybody Wan na Be a Star - ( Who Can Dance to this Song ) 7 . Remember Them Days - ( With Eve ) ( Blasting all Across North Trenton and Newark , and Yonkers ) 8 . Stop , Chill - ( This my Song ) 9 . Mac and Brad - ( With Scarface ) ( GOOD COLLABORATION ) 10 . What a Thug About - ( Heard this Song a lot of times , I like the Instrumental ) 11 . What Your Life Like ( This MY SONG RIGHT HERE , The Flow Comes from A Different World ) 12 . Ride 4 My - ( Big Pun **** ) 13 . Die [ * ] ( THIS IS THE SONG RIGHT HERE ) 14 . Anything ( A deleted song that Jay-Z made for himself , but would thought will be good for Beanie Sigels album ) ( But if Jay-Z does release a Deleted Song album or Mixtape then THIS IS THE SONG RIGHT HERE ON THIS ENTIRE ALBUM ) Beanie Sigel -- Dwayne Grant -- 1974 -- Phillidelphia , Pensivaniya	-1
I 'm not filling this one at all . It 's maybe one or two tracks that 's worth the effort of searching for , but the rest are commercialized and wack . I still give him the respect of being a pioneer of his style and one of the greatest lyricist . Maybe he used the tracks that did n't make the & quot ; I am & quot ; CD . It was a supprise to see him release 2 CD 's 5 months apart.I 'm hurt Nas ! oNe	-1
THIS ALBUM IS N'T WORTH 1,000 WORDS TO ME.MY COUSIN COREY AND I LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM ON OUR WAY TO SALISBURY ONE NIGHT AND WE BOTH TRIED TO PRETEND WE LIKE IT.BOTH OF US BIG NASTY NAS FANS WERE DISSAPOINTED.I KNEW FROM THEN ON THAT THE HUNGRY KID WHO MADE ILLMATIC WAS DEAD AND GONE .	-1
I agree with everyone 's comments that this was Nas 's worst album . Instead of enjoying the acclaim he received from 1999 's I Am album , he waited only a few months to release Nastradamus that year . Simply put , this album is so bad that it 's not even worth reviewing , but I 'll give my opinion anyway.Most of the songs are n't bad because of totally weak material , but because the production is weak and Nas just does n't bring his clever wit and wise words like he used to , even on his bad days . Case in point : DJ Premier 's `` Come Get Me '' sounds like every other song this DJ produced , with the chorus full of scratches and a pounding uptempo beat while Nas tries to find his voice . Havoc 's `` Shoot 'Em Up '' sounds like Nas jacked a Christmas carol . And whoever produced `` Big Girl '' should have been dismissed because Nas is speed-rapping over a ballad . That 's the worst track on the album -- I take that back , `` You Owe Me '' featuring Ginuwine is the worst.This album gets two stars , one for `` New World '' with its Y2K scare message ( but I do n't like that Toto sample they used ) , and another for `` Project Windows '' , which was supposed to be on I Am in a different format . The rest of the songs do n't even need to be mentioned , and in fact I 'm sick of even thinking about this album . I 'd even listen to It Was Written or The Firm album instead of this . Buy this only to complete your Nas collection .	-1
What was Nas thinkin when he made this cd his second in 1 year.That was a stupid thing to do . Come get me is the best song by far . After that not much . Do n't get it unless ur an absolute Nas fanatic and need to have everything he puts out . My friend burned it for me thank god i didnt waste my 13 bucks on it .	-1
This is the worst and hopefully the last whack Nas album ; lucky for him he redeemed himself on Stllmatic .	-1
In retrospect , this album is O.K . But at the time it came out , it might of been the worst CD I ever heard with such high expectations . At this time , two of my favorite MC 's ( Nas and Jay-Z ) had completely lost their minds and direction with this music sh** . I loved his first two albums , but & quot ; I Am & quot ; in my opinion was too much of a mixed bag of songs and then this ! Honestly , Nas might as well of had a cheerleader outfit on yelling & quot ; Go Ginuwine Go & quot ; on the second single . Thankfully , hot guest spots on The Wu and Capone-N-Noreaga helped restore some of my faith in him . By now , you know Nas has come full circle and is on top of his game again . But at the time , I almost stopped being a Nas fan . Thank you Jay-Z for bringing Nasty Nas back .	-1
didnt care for this one has to be the worst one to me . only a few tracks i was feeling . but i say get it anyway	-1
Nas ' latest opus is very disappointing to the ears . Do n't get me wrong , Nas is a great MC , but on this album he showed lack of skill he once posesed on the first two albums . Nas must take it back to the streets with the next album , because you can hear his sytle for the worst .	-1
nas has continued to sink.after each passing disc his work gets weaker & amp ; weaker.he was once said to be the heir apparent to rakim ? that was when his rhymes & amp ; skills were on point and not rushed like now.he came back to soon on this disc.he should take more time before rushing 2nd & amp ; 3rd tier music out .	-1
I do n't know and do n't care why everybody keeps saying & quot ; This CD does n't come close to the sensation of 'ILLMATIC , ' etc . This is the year 2000 , not 1994 ! I think that Nas was going in the right direction with his & quot ; I Am ... & quot ; CD , but this CD seems like it was rushed and the tracks by Dame Grease are & quot ; WEAK. & quot ; DJ Premier does n't make matters better with his BS & quot ; Come Get Me & quot ; which sounds like a 1985 Eric B and Rakim track . Hello ? This is 2000 , not 1985 ! Thankfully , Timbaland and Ginuwine saved this platinum CD with & quot ; You Owe Me & quot ; and it better be his next video and single b'cuzz it 's & quot ; off the hook & quot ; and y'all are stuck in the mid 80 's ! My favorite songs are & quot ; You Owe Me & quot ; ( Obviously ) , & quot ; Life We Chose , & quot ; & quot ; Some of Us Have Angels , & quot ; and & quot ; Quiet Ni__as & quot ; are the bomb . & quot ; New World & quot ; has some great lyrics and a nice Will Smith track , but this is not a Will Smith CD ! & quot ; Big Girl & quot ; is a wannabe & quot ; Flesh N Bone/Bone Thugs N Harmony track ... why is it on this CD ? & quot ; God Loves Us & quot ; displays Dame Grease 's messed up tracks to the fullest ! & quot ; Family & quot ; is weak as hell to b'cuzz there is no chemistry between Nas and Prodigy , but where 's Havoc 's verse and why did n't havoc produced this track ? & quot ; Last Words & quot ; is an & quot ; OK & quot ; track , but Nashwan ( or whatever his name is ) should n't be on here , AZ should ! By the way , where is AZ ? Anyway , & quot ; The Prediction & quot ; and & quot ; The Outcome & quot ; are illogical and pretentious ... why is this so-called poetess on this CD ? & quot ; NaStradamus & quot ; uses the same sample that EPMD used in 1988 , but Nas ' song sounds too pop and tired . & quot ; Shoot 'em Up & quot ; is not all that , but it 's a satisfactory havoc-produced track , way below his average stuff . & quot ; Project Windows & quot ; is bull ... why is it on here ? I think he should 've promoted the & quot ; I Am ... & quot ; CD until april of 2000 , then released a very creative & quot ; NaStradamus & quot ; DJ Quik-produced , Dr. Dre-produced , L.E.S.-Produced , Timbalnd-Produced CD the summer of 2000 and it would 've been the bomb ... selling over three million , but he messed everything up with this trash ! Next time , use more L.E.S. , Timbaland , and Nashiem Myrick/Carlos Braody , chose better DJ Premier tracks ( only one or two as he 's starting to become another Rza with his bull tracks ) , hook back up with Dr. Dre , let DJ Quik produce eight tracks , and get rid of Dame Grease b'cuzz he helped mess this CD up !	-1
Okay Illmatic was the lick , I Am was bumpin , It Was Writen was slippin and now Nastradamus is the worst of them all . Straight doodie . Nas has turned pop and in this utterly pitiful attemt to make another album and the worst song of the all is 'Owe Me ' wit lyrics like & quot ; owe me like you owe your taxes owe m like you owe your rent & quot ; I feel that he owes me for having to listen to this garbage . The hook to track # 3 should say Nas the Esco to Escobar now he is Nastradumbazz !	-1
This album ranges from awful to boring . You can tell uninspired work when you hear it and this album was as uninspired as they come . Now , I love Nas and its hard to deny his immessurable contribution to hip hop but this album was booty simple and plain . The Good : Project Windows with Ronald Isley is dope but Ronald Isely could have given a better performance . New World has a corny beat but lyrically it 's above average . The same thing could be said about Life We Chose . Last Words is Nashawns best performance ever is also a standout . The Bad : His first single Nastradamus is bland and corny . I found myself nodding off to uninspired garbage like Some Of Us Have Angels and God Loves Us . The DJ Premier produced Come Get Me has a dope beat but Nas tries too hard to keep up with the beat.The Ugly : Family featuring Prodigy is hot garbage plus you know its a problem when both Nas and Prodigy bust some suspect verses ( especially back then ) on a track . Quiet N****s with The Bravehearts is pure rubbish plus anything with Bravehearts on it is bound for wackness . Shoot Em Up sounds like a Christmas carole on acid and Big Girl could have easily been the worst track on the album until you hear Nas 's second single You Owe Me with Ginuwine . Big Girl is pretty much Nas 's attempt to rap fast ( and he fails miserably ) over a sissy love ballad sounding beat . You Owe Me was an awful second single with Nas busting the most dookiest rhymes of his respectable rap career over the worst beat that Timbaland has ever produced ( that beat sounds like a disco rehash ) ! Bottom Line : Nas 's Nastradamus is not only Nas 's worst album , its one of the worst rap releases of 1999 . Nas 's heart was not in this album and when you heart is not in it , you will make suspect music . Nas not only went through the motions on this album , he revolutionized the term `` going through the motions '' . Nas is still a great MC and he is entitled to one mistake and boy was this album a mistake . Anybody who tells you different is a Nas fan to an unhealthy degree and a prime example of this is the top 1000 reviewer who says there are no wack songs on here . If you believe that then why give this album 3 stars ? Exactly . Now you have all the proof you need that top 500 and 1000 reviewers are nuts !	-1
This CD is just booty , plain and simple .	-1
Nas just went commercial on this weak piece of trash . It was sad to see a Pure top of the game MC turn into garbage . Nasty Nas was the Nas we do and still respect ; Escobar was his 50 % Ill , 50 % hollywood form that was so-so . Nastradamus is his P Diddy clone that made him pure garbage , and I 'm glad he was n't Nastradamus or Escobar on Stillmatic , or I would n't buy that one either . Well this album is a shame , and a 100 % discrace to hip hop . I guess when Jay-Z told the truth about him , I guess Nas did what we wanted him to do , go back to his Ill skills and battle back . Anyway , do not get this , cuz Nas changed his flow , and out all his energy to good waste .	-1
Positive : Nas is a great rapper who usually has pretty tight lyrics . There were some pretty good tracks on his last attempt : I am . There are 5 tracks on this record that I find worthy of listening to . & quot ; Quiet Ni**as & quot ; is my favorite track cause it 's something I agree with Nas about . A few songs have good rapping but nothing else.Negative : Beats sometimes lacking . Choruses seriously lacking . & quot ; Life We Chose & quot ; sounds like Nas is n't quite with the beat . & quot ; Nastradamus & quot ; is so & quot ; Made-For-MTV & quot ; that 's it hurts . It surprises me how pretty good rappers continue to try to attract Backstreet Boy fans by & quot ; selling out & quot ; . The track & quot ; Big Girl & quot ; is so bad/comical it could be on Adam Sandler 's next CD . The beat for & quot ; New World & quot ; is another comical experience for the true hip-hop fan . I heard he made this 7 months after & quot ; I am & quot ; . He should have waited a little longer . The bad by far outweighs the good on this album and Nas has older albums that top this with only the intro .	-1
First let me begin by saying that nas is a poet and he 's words are the truth and im a huge fan of this nugga but nastradamus ? Was awfull even wid some good production he still had wack songs and lirycs ... Almost ruin his career and his cred as a street mc wid songs like you owe me ? Sounds like somethin 50 cent would do or some commercial rapper but not the nas i kno and apreciate as an true mc ... Well for good nas albums ? get illmatic , it was writtin , lost tapes and even stillmatic . But his other albums are all garbage.Still nas can pretty much destroy these new up & coming `` rappers '' any day when he wants too .	-1
yo no doubt nas got skillz but he sould have kept this one to his self . i got all of your cds but this one i will probaly give away . except for a couple of tracks its wack .	-1
When an mc drops a classic album people expect them totop that with their next release . ( see Snoop , Nas , Wu Tang , Warren G and others ) NOOOOOOOOOOO ! Thats the last thing you wan na do because you will almost always be disapointed . So before listening to this cd block out all memories of previous releases . On to the review . Raekwon can rhyme with the best of them and you will almost never know what he is talking about until the 45th listen and then youll be like & quot ; Oh thats what he meant & quot ; and makes his songs even better . But I must say the production on this joint was pure wackness . RZA produced NO songs . Thats right zero , zilch , nada and it shows . Plus their are no appearances by the Ironman either and the only other Wu members that make a trip to the studio are Masta Killa and Method Man . Now that wouldnt be a big problem except that the album is 21 songs and you may get tired of his voice for three verses on almost all the songs . but it does have some good songs though like Yae Yo , 100 rounds , F. Them , Live From New York , and Sneakers . But the rest of the album seems uninspired because of the production . But if you listen and study every song you can find some hidden lyrical gems . Overall a 4 on the lyrics and a 1 on the production .	-1
what happened to & quot ; we more rugged than raw & quot ; wu-tang is my favorite hip-hop group , but i have been dissapointed in the last few releases.they are n't nearly as good as 36 chambers.all the people that gave this cd 5 stars dont know nothing about wu.they probably got the cd cause they seen the commercial on MTV or something.there were only 2 good reviews out of the 32.3 now .	-1
Didnt sell , wonder why ! Sells tell a lot about a album	-1
This album sucked super @ $ $ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Again ... ... ... WTF ? Power , Sneakers , and Live from NY was tight . Everything , and I do mean everything was TRASH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The mighty chef even jocked ( yes I said jocked ) production credits off of Swizz Beats . Again ... ... ..WTF ? This project is supreme clientele demostration of a sophomore jinx , FO REAL ! ! ! ! ! To be honest , I have n't taken Wu-Tang seriously since this bullish . The album STILL SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Again ... ... ... ... WTF ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Peace ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I admit to have been a fan of the R & amp ; B genre since about 1991 . I was born in 1986 , so this music is something that is important to me . Black music is my music ( although I am not really black ; but I 'm not white either ) and I would do just about anything for it . I feel today that black music is overly-represented by Hip Hop and Rap , and R & amp ; B at times seems to have lost its way at it tries to find relevance in society today.I appreciated the efforts of many R & amp ; B and Soul artists to try and bring back some of the elements of old that were key to the success of Marvin Gaye , Smokey Robinson , Al Green , Stevie Wonder and all the other key innovators of soul and funk . Soul is increasingly becoming more important to me than straight up R & amp ; B and I applaud the work of many Neo-Soulsters.So why do I give D'Angelo such a low rating . It is mainly on particularly irritating use of the multiple voice style pioneered by Marvin Gaye and then Stevie Wonder . While this is very cool normally , it is overly used on this album and becomes very irritating . The album is so off the wall it is not listenable in my opinion . Two stars for the effort though , perhaps brown sugar was better ; I have not been able to find a copy at any of the shops in the city I live in .	-1
I wish I could get my money back , but this is n't Nordstorms..	-1
The songs do n't really begin or end , they sort of drift into the room and drift out . The vocals are extremely undermixed . Too much bass and drums . Too many slow songs , no energy , all pothead music , people just too stoned to do anything and laying around staring at the TV type music . Unmotivated , unmotivating , dull , sleepy . Listless . The rap bit in the second song is annoying but fortunately it 's undermixed , like all the rest of the vocals , so you can barely hear it . And this goes on for almost AN HOUR AND A HALF.Some advice for D'Angelo : ( 1 ) CD 's usually have songs on them , try to write some next time . ( 2 ) Stop smoking so much pot , it 's affecting your music in a bad way . ( 3 ) Mix down the bass and drums , or if not , try to get them to play on the beat . ( 4 ) BUY A SHIRT ALREADY , OK ! ?	-1
With all this talk of critics calling D'Angelo a genius , I wasexpecting & quot ; Voodoo & quot ; to be one of the year 's best.A blend of fearless funk and top-drawer lyrics.And what did I get ? Anoverlong , boring , and quawky sounding album.D'Angelo 's falsettois beginning to sound like a cat yawning , in other words ' he needs a new singing style.Now I have to say that & quot ; Chicken Grease & quot ; and & quot ; The Root & quot ; may be good , but other than that & quot ; Voodoo & quot ; isbasically just one , long , redundant 78-minute track .	-1
heres a man with all the talent in the world , yet he disappears for FIVE years and all he comes up with is this poorly written , produced and performed mess . What does that tell you ? this album is unlistenable . its NOT & quot ; brown sugar & quot ; . not even close . the songs are all the same , they 're all dull , they 're all too long , they all feature d'angelo mumbling all over them . not an enjoyable listening experience.BUY BROWN SUGAR AND STEER CLEAR OF VOODOO .	-1
Sorry , D ' , ya slippin ' , dog . You took 5 years off to find another label and then you resurface with this half-assed set . Let me get straight to the particulars : Had the 'UNTITLED ' video not been done buck-naked , I wonder how many sales the album woulda REALLY gotten ? My bet is it woulda been a complete disappointment . Here 's a great example of `` working it '' in ya video to get ya album sales up.D ' fell in love with that `` half-speak '' mumble voice and decided to do a WHOLE album that way . Why ? On 'BROWN SUGAR ' he mixed it up brilliantly , going from falsetto to tenor and back again much to delight of this neo-soul connoisseur . I got tired of him sounding like he was singing in some weed-induced stupor cuz it `` sounded real '' at the time.His teaming up with Meth and Red coulda been easily left off . Why ? Most cats do a remix with the rap heavies AFTER the single did some work on the charts . 'UNTITLED ' and 'DEVIL 'S PIE ' are the only joints I vibe to . There are some average cuts , but they do n't inspire me at all beyond the SKIP button . The rest of the songs are incoherent marblings of a cat fascinated with being accepted within the same vein as Prince . In fact , even in his liner notes he states he coulda done 'SUGAR ' in a different key and no one would know the difference . Hmmm ? Funny , that 's the EXACT same thing Prince said after he was criticized for doing 'AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY ' which was a far cry from the tone and feel of 'PURPLE RAIN ' . Prince said he coulda easily done the 'LET 'S GO CRAZY ' guitar solo in another key and no one know the difference . D ' , instead of trying to BE Prince , concentrate on EVOLVING into YOU.While D ' was slipping ... err ... sleeping , Musiq and Bilal have been taking care of the family `` neo sowe bidnis , '' so I 'm not trippin ' . Do n't get me wrong , D ' is as talented as they come , I just hope he bounces back . But as for now , the godfather of neo-soul has let his fam down .	-1
It 's not a bad cd , but i wish he would project his voice more . It just sounded like gibberish all the way through the cd . I like R & amp ; B artists that when you hear them , you have to stop and go & quot ; Whoa , who was that ? & quot ; whereas I could hear him on a closed elevator in the dead of night and would n't pay much attention .	-1
Life after No Limit was n't very kind to Mystikal , and even with the Neptunes production this album is n't great . The singles , `` Shake Ya A*s '' and `` Danger '' are fun , good rap songs , but as a whole the album is n't awesome . He does n't have as much to say , and he spends most of his time bragging about nothing or yelling at nobody in particular . This was entertaining for a few albums , but without the No Limit squad , Mystikal has proven pretty one dimensional . A lot of the songs are similar , and only a few guest appearances lighten up the album . Da Brat and Petey Pablo lend an OK rhyme on `` Come and see about me '' and the best track is obviously `` Neck Uv Da Woodz '' , where OutKast pretty much does the entire song . Without C-Murder and Master P and the rest of no limit , Mystikal is lonely , even though this was his most commercial success . People wanting to own some Mystikal ought to buy `` Mind of Mystikal '' or one of his No Limit releases .	-1
STRAIGHT UP , THIS ALBUM SUCKS , THE LYRICS IS WACK AND SO IS THE BEATS . MYSTICAL NEXT TIME DO BETER .	-1
This is definitely rock bottom for rap . Ever since 2Pac died , it seems that more and more untalented writers have become huge rap stars . What is so amazing about a terrible bass line and some guy who should be working at McDonald 's screaming & quot ; DANGER ! & quot ; and then going off into complete gibberish . Man , I miss people like 2Pac who are extremely talented writers , and could actually be understood ! Do yourself a favor , do n't get this CD .	-1
I really want to give this CD a better rating because I like Mystikal , but I got ta be honest . This CD is terrible . The only great song is Danger . Everything else sounds the same . I recommend Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous because they are better than Let 's Get Ready . Sorry Mystikal ! But next time try harder ! !	-1
And that 's broken record ! The last CD Mystikal did before dis ( Ghetto Fabulous ) was off tha chains ! This one ai n't ! For instance , the first track is pretty much like the 7th one except it 's like a clean remix . He does n't yell as much which he 's known for . If it was produced from no limit then maybe it would rise a lil higher to impressive . Now he has his greatest hits oot while serving time .	-1
Man stuff like this just makes me mad . This Funk Flex and Big Kap record is just simply a garbage album . Do n't be misleaded like I was ... ... ..Good Artists/ weak tracks is this lp 's story . I bought the album because I had never heard the Tupac/Biggie freestyle . Needless to say that that was one of few and far between gems . Some of the tracks on here are salvageable such as Snoop 's Real G 's , If I get Locked Up by Eminem & amp ; Dre , and Ill Bomb by LL Cool J . The rest of the tracks are basically garbage poo poo tracks that should n't have left the studio floor . This star studded cast just gave Funk Flex some horrible tracks or was it the other way around ? It does n't matter either way you put it its still trash . Im gon na quit wasting my time reviewing the album because I hope you wo n't waste your valuable time listening to this horrendous display of anything . I hope you do n't buy this on purpose . To all the people who said this was hot , nice , good or whatever dont kid yourself ! Do n't make eye contact with this one .	-1
I was very dissapointed with this release I never thought Id see the day when Flex went commercial but it happened and it happened in the worst way this album is the absolute worst commercial garbage I have ever heard sure if your a commercial MTV radio rap listener this is a five star album But this is what id expect from some one like DJ Clue not Funk Flex . The only good track is the Biggie Tupac freestyle . Flex really let the underground heads down on this one because after listening to mixtapes 1,2 and 3 which are all clasics numerous times I have to say that this album is the most unlistenable piece of trash that I have come across in quite some time . Where you at Flex have those clothing endorsements and corporate sponsorships gone to your head GET IT TOGETHER MAN ! ! ! ! ! ! WE NEED YOU ! ! ! ! ! ! Peace to all of the real reviewers who are not afraid to speak their minds when an album truly sucks	-1
I love Hip-Hop okay . Call me a Hip-Hop fanatic . Thats the reason why I dispise to hear and see my fellow hip-hop fans giving there money away to useless , ignorant , redundant clicks like Cash Money Records . Do you realize how simple these four clowns are . These so called artists will be short lived and Juvenile is definately no exception . This is music your kids will be laughing at you for listening to when they 're old enough to make an informed decision . Please people , for every album these clowns put out , put that money in a money market account . In one month you should have , let 's see ; Sixty Bones . Fifteen dollars a week . Not Fifteen dollars for the weak ! Save your money .	-1
I have to agree with that opinion of him cuase he 's a hater.But I have to also admit this cd sucks.If you are late to the whole bling era like I was , DO NOT COPP this cd ! Get BG 's Chopper city in the Ghetto . That was at least 601 degreez.I 'm sorry . I 'm a hardcore hotboys fan , but I will never think Juve is a good rapper . EVER ! I will continue to copp his cds for collectors sake .	-1
Cash Money makes the No-Limit crew look like there 's hope.Juvenile is one of the wackiest rappers ever.the whole Cash Money crew must have been influenced by Uncle Luke & amp ; the 2 Live crew.if making Loot is what you all about then cool but this is some of the worst music ever put out .	-1
Damn that 's funny . This cd is garbage . There is only two tight songs on the whole album .	-1
Ever heard of phony rappers ? Well heres your example Juvenile and the Cash Money Millionaires . Their beats are all the same , the lyrics mean nothing and they are fake fake fake . You want real hip hop try Talib Kweli , because this is WHACK .	-1
This isnt Juve 's best work sorry to say it but he really let me down . Million and one things and I got that fire and catch your cut are the best songs on the cd to tell you the truth . i was expecting better from Juvenile . Only if you are a TRUE CMR fan then i suggest buying Tha G-Code as a used cd from Wharehouse Music or borrow your friends .	-1
who in there right mind would give Tommy Lee a contract ? this is a bad joke all the way thru.all the guests add nothing to this ugly mess.a waste of time and CD space.this is n't fresh.if you want to hear it done right pick up Run Dmc 's King Of Rock .	-1
Before Tommy Lee jumped on the post grunge sensitive rock bandwagon of today with & quot ; Never A Dull Moment & quot ; , he released this album of his new & quot ; band & quot ; after he quit Motley Crue in 1999 when rap-metal/nu-metal was the & quot ; happenin ' thang & quot ; ( or something among those lines ) . Methods of Mayhem consists of Lee playing a variety of instruments and attempting to rap ( hearing him talk like a thug in interviews ticks me off so bad , he couls talk like a normal person any other time , now he 's just trying to cash in on whatever fad is in , and that really gets to me considering this is the guy who made me want to drum ) along with numerous guest spots from Lil ' Kim , Kid Rock , Fred Durst , and anyone else whose spotlight has since dimmed . The songs are repetitive , dull , boring , and honestly stupid and do n't offer any kind of substance or showcase any of the talent that we all know Lee really possesses . All in all , Methods of Mayhem is undoubtadly one of the worst albums I have ever had the displeasure of hearing , and this just goes to show you that no matter what may be & quot ; in & quot ; at the time , you should n't quit your day job .	-1
Let me just say this plain and simple this cd sound like a bunch of garbage that was put together in a week . Tommy Lee 's famous so he can get all these guests to appear no problem . I dont even care that hes hoppin on tha bandwagon , the album just doesnt have any continuity to it . New Skin is a cool song and i made the mistake of buying it after hearing that song . Tilo doesnt even get a chance to show his talent ( I dont know if he has any ) Overall I 'd say there are 2 or 3 decent songs on the album . It just sounds like someone trying too hard when theyre not even into it .	-1
Around the time when this album dropped , Ruff Ryders were getting a lot of recognition with everything they were doing . There was a Ruff Ryders Compilation LP , and Eve just dropped her debut , in which both were solid . With DMX dropping his third LP `` ... And Then There Was X '' , really did n't put too much of an impact on listeners as his first two album did . Possibly because of two things : 1 . His repetitive flow ; and 2 . The trademark ad-libs that he made in the background ( his barking being the most common ) was all over the album , and were starting to get a little old . So this whole album was very similar of his frist two albums , in which both dropped a year earlier.When he dropped `` What 's My Name '' as the lead single , I believed fans were anticipating a rowdy and loud DMX , that they were used to hearing . The fact is that they did get what they were looking for . The problem was , that it was all stale and unappealing , as well as the production . Most of the problems existed in the beginning of the CD , mainly with `` One More Road To Cross '' & `` Fame '' . The dissapointments go further down in the CD with more skippable tracks , even with the bonus track where X and a female name Dyme tag-team verses full of sex talk on the song `` Good Girls and Bad Guys '' .But this CD is n't all bad though . Aside from it 's lead single there were some good tracks . `` X Is Commin ' For Ya '' is a dope track . Before it became overrated , `` Party Up '' was another good track . `` D-X-L '' with The Lox and Drag-On was another great track . `` Angel '' with Regina Bell as well as the third single `` What These ****** Want '' with Sisqo are both solid tracks that were better than the skippable ones . Thats all of the good tracks I can think of.This CD as a whole is n't really too special . If you 're already a DMX fan , you probably have this album . I just feel that he could have came a little better that what we all expected from him . This album does n't suck , but it does has it 's moments throughout the CD . I have all of X 's albums with the exception of his recent `` Year Of The Dog Again '' , and I find this to be his worst LP . Yes , even `` Grand Champ '' was better than this album . If you 're new to DMX , start with his first two albums to get a better level of how he sounds at his best . This album is easily forgettable.Lyrics : CProduction : C-Guest Appearances : CMusical Vibes : COverall : CMy favorite tracks : Party Up , What These ******* Want , X Is Commin For Ya , D-X-L ( Hard White ) , AngelPeace !	-1
I really do n't buy DMX 's religious beliefs , especially whenthey are mixed with lyrics that are the same as Eminem . Between songs , he says verses and prayers from the bible that keep him an honest man , all the while rapping about prostitutes and his & quot ; ca n't touchthis & quot ; attitude ( What 's My Name ? , among others ) ...	-1
This is bullcrap and it is mostly the production . Swizz Beats and his Ruff Ryder production team is just no good . The beats are WACK . Maybe a couple nice tracks but overall the album is forgettable and whoever said this album was more than three stars is smokin something serious . DMX could be great because he has a lot of personality and pours emotion into his songs , but with Swizz Beats ... ... ..It 's sad to say that will never happen . Party Up with its mad exposure is so played out it makes you wan na jump off of a cliff . Unlistenable . other ok songs include One More Road To Cross , DXL , What 's My Name and uh nothing else . Please save your money and bypass this horrendous display of production . DMX is an above average rapper though .	-1
This is the album where x man showed his weakness/commercialism . He was slightly commercial on the prior realeases but hit the epitome of it on this album . It shows when he did the song with the kat from dru hill . DMX released the prior two albums so quick and they were hot . Then he ran out of things to say and the albums sounded the same but even more commercial . I gave up on full albums with X starting with this album and only deal with him on a song by song basis .	-1
This album is not good at all so do not buy it . It only gets 2 because of production and 2 or 3 good songs .	-1
If you claim to like hip hop , please by the following albums before you buy this one :1 ) Illmatic 2 ) Ready to Die 3 ) 36 Chambers 4 ) Full Clip : A decade of gangstarrThese are what hip hop is all about .	-1
how in the world did dmx ever get a deal ? this dude ca n't rap at all.all that barking and wack music is embarassing to the rap world.this disc is weak.i ca n't believe that people actually buy this junk.a friend of mine said you have to hear this for a laugh.and it was a bad joke .	-1
I am a DMX fan , but I want to be honest with you . This is only an ok recording . The whole way through it sounds like it was rushed through production . It just does n't sound complete . It also has to much of a pop , mainstream feel . I mean I think it was meant to click with the TRL fans or something . I think DMX is just trying to ride out his success with less than average music.If you are a DMX fan , I would suggest this cd because its got his famous style . If your not a real big DMX fan I would suggest that you get the new 2pac instead if your looking for some good rap music .	-1
After buying and listening to And Then There Was X , I quickly decided to never buy another DMX album again ! ! This release is a slap in the face to the entire culture of Hip Hop . It purely exemplifies why Hip Hop is in the decaying and stagnant state it 's in now . The only reason I was able to rate this album with one star is because of the only two good songs contained on it , What 's My Name and What These B**ches Want . Other than those two songs , the listener will be in for a disappointing journey over X 's preaching and singing . His best work came clearly on his initial release , It 's Dark and Hell Is Hot . Since then , he has grown substantially worse from album to album . This is , without a doubt , his worst offering to date . And Then There Was X can not compete with satisfying Hip Hop releases such as The Life and Times of S. Carter . The production on this album was lukewarm at it 's height , but basically terrible . Swizz Beats is displaying that his work is also declining in substance . The best track , as far as production is concerned , is What These B**ches Want , which was produced by Nokio from the R & amp ; B group Dru Hill . With the release of And Then There Was X and The Opposite of H2O by Drag-On , the Ruff Ryder camp is proving that it can not live up to it 's early-life hype . I would not recommend this album to anyone .	-1
& quot ; It 's Dark And Hell Is Hot & quot ; was a very good album , if not classic . But ever since then , it seems as if Dark Man X has been going downhill , as evidenced by & quot ; And Then There Was X. & quot ; You have to give it to him for at least one thing on this album though , he did use a variety of producers ( Swizz , P. Killer Trackz , Grease , Irv Gotti , & amp ; others ) , instead of the usual Swizz throughout the whole album . That formula has gotten old and very played out . The problem with this , however , is the variety does n't necessarily equal better quality.The album kicks off nicely with the Swizz-produced & quot ; One More Road To Cross. & quot ; The first single , & quot ; What 's My Name , & quot ; is a booming track . But the album 's standout has to be the ever-popular & quot ; Party Up ( Up In Here ) . & quot ; This is one of the best Swizz tracks I 've heard in a LONG while ( probably since & quot ; It 's Dark ... & quot ; ) .The rest of the album is chock-full of mediocrity . On & quot ; What these B**ches Want & quot ; ( featuring Sisqo ) , Mr. Simmons reads off a list of women who he 's supposedly slept with , as if we 're supposed to be impressed . & quot ; Make A Move & quot ; is an all-out wack track with some pretty laughable lyrics . Same thing with & quot ; More 2 A Song , & quot ; on which X spits & quot ; The game is a lot bigger than you think you know . And if you think you know , then I do n't think you know. & quot ; Creative stuff ( sense the sarcasm ) .The album 's token religious track , & quot ; Angel , & quot ; fails to hit with the same power tracks such as & quot ; The Convo & quot ; and & quot ; Ready To Meet Him & quot ; hit with on his last albums . And he ends the album with a bonus track ( & quot ; Good Girls , Bad Guys & quot ; ) which would 've been better just left off the album.Overall , this is your prototypical album with 2 or 3 bangers and about 10 fillers , with a few totally wack tracks mixed in . Not too appealing . If you must have & quot ; And Then There Was X , & quot ; pick it up at the used CD shop and save yourself a few bucks .	-1
Sheesh . If I wanted to hear barking and growling on my music , i 'd stick a microphone in front of my Rottweiler Petey . And it 'd be a lot more entertaining.I 'm already sick of this CD thanks to radio overkill . Just hearing the tracks on this nonsense make me reach for my Tribe or Wu albums .	-1
Positives : DMX still brings it hardcore on a few tracks and you can see why his previous albums were so popular . His voice is cool and I like the intensity he puts into his rap.Negatives : He has all the same faults as Ja Rule or maybe it 's the other way around . Too commercial now , and his spectrum of topics is very limited . I guess he tried to freshen his style up a little , but I like the grimy underground music X used to put out and this album only briefly visits that part . & quot ; Party Up & quot ; is undoubtedly the worst track on the album but it 's the video he put on TV first . The rapping in most of these songs is still pretty decent but the choruses are just bad . What 's next ? Singing kids ? We should have let him stay underground .	-1
This is a VERY dissapointing album from Jay-z ... Volume 2 was a good record..this is very wack . He have recovered ever since . He hasnt made a good album since Volume 2 .	-1
The only reason I got the CD is because of & quot ; Big Pimpin & quot ; and & quot ; Those Things That You Do & quot ; ft.Mariah Carey . And those are the only 2 good songs on the CD .	-1
question : can jay-z still take it to the streets to like he used to ? answer : not on this lp ! big pimpin watch me and snoopy track are the only good songs onthe cd . the rest with the exception of s.carter is trash . not as good beats from jay hovah and his rocafella crew as i expected.texas boyz ugk hold it down on the track big pimpin . juvenile 's funky chorus on snoopy track and dr. dre 's clever rhymes on watch me r what make the cd not jay-z 's lame rhymes . i used to consider him one of the greatest mc 's ever but fame 's gotten to his head . only the guests on this cd can save him . roc la familia i can already tell is n't gon na be much betta . do n't waste ur money on this unless u want some lame rhymes with even lamer beats .	-1
The constant blasphemy has to stop . Repent while you still have time	-1
I 'm reading some of the recent reviews and most of them are 5 star reviews . I wonder if they ever sat down and listened to the album or are they aware if Jay-Z is capable of much more.Anyway Jay-Z 's fourth album Vol.3 : Life And Times Of Shawn Carter is a semi-decent album at best . In 1999 , Jay-Z was possibly enjoying the mainstream status of his career , to the point that he has been lacking on the microphone . He has n't improved since Vol.2 : Hard Knock Life . His rhymes seemed to be slapped together , as shown in the second track `` So Ghetto '' with rhymes like `` Jigga man , Volume 3/I 'm back looking like me/stop the presses/ladies drop your dresses . '' Some tracks just fall flat on the ground like the Mariah Carey assisted `` Things That You Do '' , and and the weak hook on `` S. Carter '' . Awkward moments are on this album like Dr. Dre appearing on the song `` Watch Me '' as Jigga does n't shine lyrically on the track . `` Come And Get Me '' could have been shortened and condenced to three verses , since I 've ever heard Jigga do a solo song lasting longer than 4 and a half minutes . Amil , Beanie Sigel , and Memphis Bleek colab with Jay for `` Pop 4 Roc '' and that fails causing me to loose my attention towards it.Now there are some good songs on this album though . The first single `` Do It Again ( Put Ya Hands Up ) '' was probably a club banger back in late '99/early 2000 with the help of Beanie Sigel . `` It 's Hot ( Some Like It Hot ) '' Jay turns to his lyrical side and it works somewhat on the better side on this track with rhymes like `` I 'm about a dollar , what the f*** is 50 Cents '' ( a response to 50 's `` How To Rob '' ) . UGK hooks up with Jay on the hit single `` Big Pimpin '' that is one of the standout tracks ( If you remember when it was on the radio/television , Jay had an extra verse , that is not on the album ) . Mostly the production on this CD saves it from being a failure . `` Snoop Track '' featuring Juvenile is one of those tracks that carries a good beat.The bonus tracks `` Jigga My N**** '' appeared on the Ruff Ryders first comp album and `` Girls Best Friend '' appeared on the Blue Streak Sndtrk . A couple of bonus songs that are better than the ones on the album.As I said before Jay-Z is capable of doing much better . Many Jigga fans want to hear the same man that was on Reasonable Doubt , and this album is far from what that is . The production saves this from being a complete failure in my opinion . Luckly Jigga stepped his rhymes back up on future albums . If you want to hear more Jay-Z or you have never bought this album and are curious , I recommend this to you . Otherwise pick up other Jigga albums.Lyrics : D+Production : B-Guest Appearances : CMusical Vibes : C-Favorite Tracks : Do It Again ( Put Yo Hands Up ) , It 's Hot ( Some Like It Hot ) , Snoopy Track , Big Pimpin ' , Jigga My N**** , Girls Best Friend	-1
JAY-Z IS A PHONY.HE COPIES MAKAVELI IN MUSIC VIDEOS , QUOTES , ECT.THE ON LY GOOD THING IN THIS ALBUM IS THE TRACK FEATURING DRE , THAT CUT IS ILL .	-1
THE JIGGA MAN JAY-Z IS BACK ON THE BLOCK WITH A NEW ALBUM.SORRY TO SAY , BUT , THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.THIS ALBUM IS NOT HITTING.JIGGA 'S FLO IS TIGHT AS USUAL , BUT BEAT 'S ARE CORNY.SUBJECT MATTER IS THE SAME NOTHING CHANGED.OF COARSE JIGGA IS GOING TO SELL , BUT NOT BECAUSE THE ALBUM IS HOT , IT 'S BECAUSE IT 'S JIGGA.SO , THIS ONE FAILS , BUT I MIGHT BE ONE IN A MILLION	-1
do n't buy this cd you Need To buy that new bone thugs Thats cd is of the hook .	-1
I love Jay Z so I was really excited when this was released . To my dismay , this was one of the worst rap albums I had ever heard . So many horrible songs like So Ghetto , and Do it Again I found myself pressing the skip button after every 30 seconds . Old recycled lyrics , over produced beats , boring flow . You can do better than this ! I think he just put this album out because he knew anything made by Jay Z was going to sell ... . a lot . So he just put this album out to make some extra money like The Blueprint 2.1 . Do n't buy this or any other of his horrible albums . Buy the good ones . That makes sense , does it not ?	-1
I cant even begin to descibe to you how much this cd sucks.Same repetitive beats on all the songs and the only song worthy listening to is big pimping.The lyrics are all pointless and stupid as can be expected fom this clown.Do yourself a favor and download big pimping because thats the only good song on the album.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
This album was terrible in comparison to the critically acclaimed classic HARD KNOCK LIFE . The intro of the album makes you think that Jay-Z is going back to the streets a second time , but in fact Jay-Z 's just going to the mirror on this one . I mean true he has Primo and Timberland on this album , but that still does n't save this album . This Jay-Z album packs half-hearted songs that were rushed just to keep his place on top . If he wanted to do that , I 'm pretty sure he could 've used some unreleased tracks from HARD KNOCK LIFE to do this album ... I ca n't see how this album even went 3x platinum , but this was the foreshadow of what was to come from Jay-Z .	-1
After the massive sucess of the hugely underrated Hard Knock Life Vol.2 , Jay-Z was decoming the new mainstream darling of hip hop , and deservedly so . I preordered Vol.3 a month in advance , expecting to hear some more classic Jigga bravado . Instead I heard , to summarize , absolute junk . I ca n't believe how bad this album is ; Big Pimpin with UGK is great , but the rest of it is total trash ! Avoid this like the plague !	-1
I do n't like Jay Z and do n't think I ever will . He portrays himself as some kind of a thug with lots of money , but in all honesty , his lyrical skills are not even close to impressive , his beats are annoying , and nothing seems to matter much to him but his own fame and success . Not one track is good on this album ( and no , I hate & quot ; Big Pimpin & quot ; ... it 's one of hip-hop 's biggest disgraces ) and getting special guests as Juvenile just makes the album even worse than it already is . Jay Z does n't get any props from me and never will ... he is just one of the many & quot ; same-o-lame-o & quot ; MTV studio gangsta commercial rappers that I 've grown to hate . All I can do is hope that this is the end of his rapping days ... but I already know that wo n't happen for awhile .	-1
Well there is not much to say about an album that was pretty weak . Jay-Z was riding extremely high after the platinum In My Lifetime Volume 1 , and the multi-platinum Hard Knock Life . After these extremely hott bangers , anything with Shawn Carter 's name on it would have sold so it did n't really matter what was on there . Being the avid Jay-Z fan that I am , not even I could withstand this album . The first two singles that got massive radio play were very weak tracks , those being & quot ; So Ghetto & quot ; and & quot ; Do it Again & quot ; . Do it Again sounds so overproduced that it is extremely unpleasant . The lyrics sounded like they were recycled from one of Jay 's notebooks that he found in the garbage . Nothing much happens from here on in except for & quot ; Dope Man & quot ; which is a stellar track that goes extremely well with the newscast during the song . Save for & quot ; Big Pimpin & quot ; which is the best song on the track where Jigga saves his best verse and best beat . Definitly the best song on the album , but not enough to save this weak album . But everyone is allowed to have one weak album when you 've had as many successful ones as Jigga has had .	-1
I 'm glad I listend to this album first by friend . Jay-Z IS THE MOST OVERRATED RAPPER OF ALL TIME ALONE WITH BIGGIE , LIL WAYNE , AND EMINEM ! This album sucked ! The beats were boring , his lyrics are wack ! All he raps about is MONEY , CARS , HOES , DIAMONDS , etc . All Jay songs have a catchy hook with some known sample and thats why he sells , that song Big Pimpin ' sucks . The only Jay album that was good was `` Reasonable Doubt '' everything is else pure garbage . When Mtv named him the greatest emcee , lol ... . that really proved my point a decade ago Mainstream hip hop has died .	-1
Sorry , but this album is n't worth more than 2 stars . It 's not a bad album , well , not TOO bad of an album , so it deserves at LEAST 2 stars . If you 're a Jay-Z fan , I guess it 's a must . Otherwise , leave it be .	-1
This album is an example of some of the garbage u have to put up with in the mainstream . It gets off to a good start though with the intro . Jay Z says how no Emcees can touch him and the beat is good . Then some guy mentions how people are gon na miss Jay Z when he 's left the rap game . Next up is So Ghetto . It 's a good beat by Primo . Jay Z drops some brilliant lyrics . I do n't know why so many hate on him . I know he can brag a bit but he does it with so much wittyness that it 's good . Next up is Do It Again . It 's not a bad track . I aint the biggest Bienie Sigel fan but he drops a good verse here . Once again Jay Z does some more bragging more like a battle rap this time . Amil should n't be on this album though , she is so whack . Next up is the outstanding track Dope Man . At last Jay Z is going into some deep subject matter . He does n't do this consistently enough though . He brags too much and it lets him down . Here he 's at a trial for givin the people hip hop and he takes the stand and defends what he does . It has a dark beat as well I do n't know who produced it though . Things That U Do is a good track . The beat aint all that but Jay Z talks about how he made it in the game . Then there 's It 's Hot produced by Timbaland . More braggin by Jay Z . It 's ok but nothing special . The album falls badly after this track . Big Pimpin , Pop 4 Rock , Snoopy Track , Dat B are all examples of mainstream trash . No relevant subject matter what so ever . Just poor guest appearances and bling bling nonsense . Only on track 13 do things get better again . On Come And Get Me he 's speakin to those who wan na hate on him and talks about how he 's made people relate to his struggle . NYMP is good too he 's talkin about things with more realism , like how he used to have to hustle . Anything is the second best track on the album . He talks about things like being a father figure to kids and other meaningful stuff . It 's also got a sample from Oliver Twist . The last 2 tracks are just more mainstream trash.Overall the album starts of well but then fades badly after that n jus seems all over the place . Jay Z needs to explore subject matter more if he 's gon na drop good albums , get rid of the Rocafella lot and good production . Steer clear of this one .	-1
If you would turn back the clock to 1996 , Jay-Z dropped his debut album & quot ; Reasonable Doubt & quot ; , the best alum from Jigga , period . Volume 1 did'nt come long after that . Despite the fact that Vol . 1 was gold , it was a another masterpiece . I do n't know what happened to him when he dropped Vol . 2 . That was the most overrated album of all time . About three tracks were excellent , the rest was mediocre . But words can not explain Vol . 3 . The album did not live up to & quot ; Reasonable Doubt & quot ; at all . And the sad part about this album is that I only felt one song , which was & quot ; So Ghetto & quot ; . I feel what Jay-Z does on underground beats . It 's reminds me of & quot ; A Million and One Questions ( Remix ) & quot ; , that will forever be my favorite track fron him . I lost faith in Jay-Z when he made this so-called album . Him and everyone else is so commercial now . This will eventually lead to an ultimate change in Hip-Hop which wo n't be pretty . Thank God for the Wu-Tang Clan . They 'll never disappoint me like Jay-Z and the rest .	-1
no wonder jay z & amp ; mariah carey are buddys they both write the same topics over & amp ; over again.all jay z writes about is diamonds , cars , & amp ; money ever heard of race ? class ? how long does it take for him to come up with lyrics ? and his rapping is a joke as well.but it makes sense since he discovered foxy brown ? let me guess vol 4,5,6,7,8,9 , will have money & amp ; diamonds as well ? what a great mind that jay z ? not !	-1
I 'm a huge fan of Jay-Z and I got all Jay-Z 's CD 's and the only reason I bought this CD is I like & quot ; Do It Again , & quot ; Anything , & quot ; & quot ; Is That Yo B**** & quot ; featuring Twista and Missy Elliott , and & quot ; Things That U Do , & quot ; but & quot ; Anything & quot ; and get this , & quot ; Is That Yo B**** & quot ; were omitted from this CD ... why ? Those songs would 've maybe saved this weak CD , but they still omitted them ! They had the nerve to put & quot ; PLUS HIDDEN BONUS TRACKS & quot ; on the back cover , but what it does n't tell you is that the two hidden tracks , Jigga My N**** and Girl 's Best Friend are on the same track as the horrible Hova Song Outro so you will have to listen to the Hova Song Outro , then wait about one minute for & quot ; Jigga My N**** & quot ; to come on ! What were they thinking ? Do n't let the stellar producers and artists fool you , i.e. , Dr. Dre , Mariah Carey , Juvenile , Timbaland ... they could n't even save this album !	-1
Jay-Z is just like Puff Daddy ! He got no real talent ! Do n't buy this , please ! I 'm begging you !	-1
What 's up wit & quot ; Vol . 3 & quot ; . & quot ; Vol . 2 & quot ; was OK but I love & quot ; Vol . 1 & quot ; , & quot ; The Dynasty & quot ; , and & quot ; Reasonable Doubt & quot ; but this record was below Jay-Z 's level . He 's a great rapper but this was definately not a great album.The & quot ; Hova Song & quot ; intro was good and I liked & quot ; So Ghetto & quot ; and & quot ; Do It Again & quot ; but & quot ; Dope Man & quot ; was just a filler track . I like & quot ; Things That You Do & quot ; with Mariah Carey but & quot ; It 's Hot & quot ; , & quot ; Snoopy Track & quot ; , & quot ; S. Carter & quot ; , & quot ; Pop 4 Roc & quot ; , and & quot ; Watch Me & quot ; were more filler tracks . & quot ; Big Pimpin & quot ; with UGK was great and so was & quot ; There 's Been A Murder & quot ; but & quot ; Come And Get Me & quot ; , & quot ; Nymp & quot ; , and the & quot ; Hova Song & quot ; outro were more fillers . The bonus tracks & quot ; Anything & quot ; and & quot ; Jigga My Nigga & quot ; were great though.I would buy the other Jay-Z albums but leave & quot ; Vol . 3 & quot ; alone .	-1
whats with all of these irish sounding whistles that east cost rappers have in their music ? its ANNOYING ! .i bought this cd because of big pimpin , and i thought hey papi was gon na be on here.other then that and maybe the song call theres been a murder this album is kinda so so.jay-z 's rap skill is good but i ca n't get into his above average flow.it seems like he 's just talking in rhymes and not actually flowing.every jay-z album i heard there was always just a hand full of trax i like.this album is no exception.fans from his pre in my life time days have long abandoned him.but he has picked up fans from his post reasonable doubt days.whom basicaly just jumped the band wagon.and they jumped rather late i might add .	-1
I bought Jay-Z 's `` Vol . 3 '' in January 2001 , and after awhile I was utterly speechless on how PLAIN this album was ! Three things wrong : He does n't change the speed of his raps in any of the songs , and it seems as if all of his raps are on the same thing , and he has no interludes or skits to try and mix up the album up a bit ! I think Jay-Z just was n't at his best with this album.Do n't get me wrong , I liked such Jay-Z songs such as `` Can I Get A ... '' , `` Anything '' , and `` I Just Wan na Love U ( Give It 2 Me ) '' . If you buy a Jay-Z album , I suggest buying `` Vol . 2 : Hard Knock Life '' !	-1
He said Jay-Z was dead on the song There 's Been A Murder , but he had me fooled with the redundant subject matter throughout the album . All the talk of murder , clothes , cars and women have become played and it 's time to move on to something else . I bought this thinking that I would hear something different . The only jams worth checking for are So Ghetto , Dopeman , There 's Been A Murder , and NYMP . I used to dig Big Pimpin , when I first bought the album , but the radio stations and video networks have made me hate it because they have played it to no end . After peeping all of his other albums , this album is a major disappointment . If Jay-Z was dead , then he has been resurrected on this album .	-1
But this is a far cry from the simple , creative group that made two classic albums before hitting it big . I guess the pressure to excel and the rigors of touring all caught up with the band . The single 'How Much I Feel ' is a good song , actually , a great song , but certainly firmly in the middle of the road , adult oriented radio category . The rest of the album falls between semi-creative jazz-rock songs and tres-cheesy R & B fluff . Lyrically , the optimism and earnestness has been replaced with cynicism ( Art Beware ) , despair ( title track ) , substance abuse issues ( Apothecary ) , boredom ( all of the above ) . The multilayered , classical music approach has been replaced with a mature , stripped down , jazzy , sequenced feel . This can be creatively done , as in the excellent title track , or by-the-book ( If Heaven Could Find Me ) . Art Beware and Apethecary segue into each other , and are nicely arranged and well written , if a little toned down from previous records . Songs like `` Heaven Could Find Me '' , `` Dancin By Myself '' , `` Not As You Were '' tread too much into the Disco Era . `` Angola '' has a kind of annoying verse , but the bridge is actually as good as anything on this record ( do you remember when , old wall street fell ) , before returning to the verse , now more annoying than ever . I mean , I like the lyrical intent but the song sounds like a stage musical . Heart To Heart and Ready For Camarillo are not terrible , but pretty bland and depressed feeling . Overall , the most morose album from this group . Their next album , 180 , was slightly better . If you only know the band for their two top 10 hits , buy the compilation first .	-1
It 's a matter of idiom . Just like Carly Simon on her `` Torchy '' GAS album , this is clearly a well-known formula : an arrangement master as a guest , some GAS songs easily picked ( not rare ) , and then - abracaddabra - a new hit CD which does not add anything to American song treasury . Skip it . In 2010 , all you 'll remember will be Lena Horne 's `` Stormy Weather '' , or Ella Fitzgerald 's `` You 're My Thrill '' or Billie Holiday 's `` You 've Changed '' - all originals from decades ago which you can buy NOW and HERE at one click on your mouse . Frankly , sorry .	-1
Joni Mitchell was great in the past , but on Both Side 's Now she proved to be a has been . Does anyone notice the similarity to Marianne Faithfull in her vocals ? ? On Both Side 's Now , Joni trudges through jazz standards and murder 's Etta James , & quot ; At Last & quot ; in the process . Joni Mitchell should have ended her career on a high note rather than killing her legendary status by releasing garbage such as this .	-1
You can hate my reviews or love them ... I really do n't give a damn . All of these reviews I write , I write for you ... because I hate to see you people spending money when I know you 're eventually gon na regret it . I know it 's not my decision to make , but I 'm left with no choice but to put my two-cents in ... and I seriously think that I am the most honest reviewer AMAZON.com has . The Lox did n't change anything ... they 're still boring , lame , and yes , they still suck . Even leaving Bad Boy could n't change that . Why do n't you think AMAZON.com has samples for you to hear ... cause even they know the CD is garbage . These guys just are n't the streets , no matter how much they talk about how they 'got the streets locked ' ... man , whatever . Only one cut stands out on here ... and that 's & quot ; Recognize. & quot ; The Lox actually impressed me with a good message for once , and it 's followed by a tight beat from DJ Premier . Besides that , everything on here is a waste of time and a waste of money , just like all of the other Ruff Ryder crap .	-1
The Lox were wack with Puffy and now they are wack with Ruff Ryders.both are Lame.Puffy & amp ; his Bad Boy crew Recycle any and everything.Ruff Ryders & amp ; Swizz beatz are Lame.every alum release by them all sound the same.the raps are wack & amp ; the music sounds like a Poor mans Casio.the only cut that works comes from a outside Producer Ryde or dye by Timberland.who is very overrated.yes he has beats but what else ? do n't be surprised when Ruff Ryders play out that you see The Lox going to Cash Money or whoever is hot .	-1
Mediocre outtakes . No & # 34 ; Fire & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Love Rollercoaster & # 34 ; . Sounds like it was recorded through a pair of sweat socks . Leroy 's memory deserves better .	-1
As a singles band I would rate Travis however as an album band they are boring whinning Scots and should be left to the Scottish Highlands . Every song pretty much sounds the same , an annoying singer , a couple of acoustic guitars , percussion and the odd other instrument . The music is downtempo and uninteresting , not much originality either . I recon you would get the same effect sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar , and then you would probably sing to better songs . The music is too imposing and depressingly bad to sleep to and too boring to play around company , so what do you do with it ? Throw this album in the fire , at least it might impress those around you .	-1
but now it 's just kinda lame . Their sound ( to me ) gets old and becomes a little too weak fro my tastes . Not as complicated as some of the other bands that are putting out stuff nowadays . I put them in the same catagory as Semisonic . Just OK . Better than cookie cutter bands , but not really up to par to be included in a collection of good music .	-1
Clean , crisp bouncy pop tending toward the cutesy , fans of twee pop will probably enjoy it . I found it somewhat grating . Not recommended for hard rockers .	-1
As a friend commented when hearing this album 'Is that the Verve ' . Travis is yet another band that sounds like another band . This album is so lifeless and dull , it makes me wonder why record companies are pushing bands like this when there are so many good bands out there that are itching to get a recording deal . 'Driftwood ' and 'Why does it always rain on me ' sound ok but need some magic pumped into them . The world needs more happy cheerful music , not this stuff that makes you wonder what is happening to music . An unwise purchase on my behalf .	-1
I could find no other word to describe this album.I love Tracy Chapman . I have most of her CDs . Her debut being her best album and one of the few albums I have from the 80 's that still sounds fresh . And New Beginning was an amazing work with a blues touch that Tracy sounded comfortable with . And her newest release `` Let it Rain '' is definitely her most beautiful sounding album ( in fact I 'm listening to it now ) .But this one is I guess anti-climatic ( maybe because it was after the big success she had with `` Give me one Reason '' ) . I really did n't hear a standout track . Nothing really grabbed my attention as if saying , `` Stop what you 're doing ! Your mind and ears are mine ! '' All of her albums are solid and full of talent but this album just seems so ... ehh ( sigh ) compared to New Beginning and lackluster next to Let it Rain . If you 're new to Tracy start with her Grammy winning debut `` Tracy Chapman '' .	-1
Tracy Chapman can certainly sing in a unique , emotional way . No doubt about that.The trouble is , with the album Telling Stories , that she has nothing new to contribute . She has become more joyful , less worrying , and maybe that 's why her music does n't really work out anymore . It does n't catch . It bores.Pity.Buy her beautiful - but sad - debut album instead of Telling Stories . 'Cause Tracy Chapman has no stories to tell anymore .	-1
The people impressed with this must not have heard New Beginnings , her last cd . This new one is so monotone and go nowhere it 's a mystery as to what the heck happened . New Beginnings is one of my favorite cd 's , and Telling Stories would be my least favorite if it were n't for the title track . This cd has no zip , zing , or pizzazz . Would someone please wake her up ?	-1
Alas , the original Amazon review is correct . This album is well produced but also very kitch . Beethoven in ambient soup is almost as bad as & quot ; Smoke on the water & quot ; sung by Pat Boone . I think that Orbit could have made a much better album by reinterpreting ( open ) jazz standards . I believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that are perfect and complete in themselves . So I can only explain this CD as a cash-in operation after the successful Madonna album.My humble advice is , to those who like easy-listening classical music : buy the originals ( classical CDs are often sold at a bargain price ) , since they provide a much pleasant , authentic listening experience . To those who are curious about ambient , buy any CD of the Orb , or Boards of Canada , or Plaid , or even the classic Eno .	-1
i heard spit these bars and die for me and decided to buy the album because i really liked those songs . it was hard for me to listen to it all the way but i kept it might get a little better . this is one of the worst albums ever . the only other good song is here we go with eve ( the song would not have been that great if not for her ) .also the album stayed way over its welcome with 19 songs ( including the skits which were stupid yet still painfully long ) ( when i first looked on the back of the cd i thought there were only nine songs but i didnt see the bottom , just remember that if you buy this horrible album not worth your hard earned money ) i must say though spit these bars was a great song along with here we go with eve ( die for me was only alright and dmx sounds horrible ) without those songs this album would have been -1/5 . I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT HIS NEXT ALBUM WILL BE GOOD FOR HE HAS POTENTIAL AND WILL HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AND SMARTER BY THEN	-1
I mean the song ... but the hype no I got this and I dont even play it I like that other song spit these bars but thats it 2 songs 2 stars .	-1
I was a drag-on fan until I heard this album . A lot of people here at my college agree with me . When it came out a lot of people had it because he had two sweet video 's but thats the only 2 song 's on the album . I tried to feel this album but this album was some junk . I dont know about Ruff ryders Volume 2 because Swiss is doing that too . He also did the lox album and it was SOSO .	-1
3 Doors Down is nothing new . Their first single & quot ; Kryptonite & quot ; sounds like anything else . The voice is like anything else ... ..etc , etc , etc.Just see their video on VH-1 or MTV and you will see nothing new here , except for the video which pushes into a new direction.This CD is just average with nothing new to talk about .	-1
Yeah , & quot ; Kryptonite & quot ; is a catchy song . But that 's about it for this album . The rest is disposable , cliched alt-rock that does n't have any hooks to it . The playing is good , but all the songs seem to follow a formula . If it 's your thing , you might like it , but I prefer better songs . ( Although , give them credit for actually writing and playing , as a reviewer who liked the album did bellow ) .	-1
This album proves the theory that if given the right breaks , any band that can put music together can get a record deal.Three Doors Down impressed the hell out of me with & quot ; Kryptonite & quot ; , and & quot ; Loser & quot ; is a decent song as well . I decided to give the album a whirl.. let me tell you that almost every other song on the album is one in the same . Weak , repetative guitar licks , backed by weak , often pitiful lyrics.This album has no appeal whatsoever , and nothing to offer except what the radio plays . It almost seems as if Three Doors Down recorded the two radio hits first , then scrapped the rest of the album together in a day or two . Unless these guys change something drastic for the next album , we 'll never hear from Three Doors Down again .	-1
dont pay attention to the star rating of this cd because i have never listened to it . I am posting this comment to make sure that everyone knows that Jay-Z and DMX are NOT on this record label , whcih i have seen mentioned in the review section for this cd . Once again this cd may be good , and it may not be , i have NEVER listened to it , I just wanted to warn people that they would not be hearing much jay-z and dmx .	-1
i just wan na say that some one iz a dum @ $ $ jay z and dmx aint on murder inc they actually good you cant be good if your on murder inc dmx is on ruff ryders and def jam and jay z is on roc a fella and def jam get it right	-1
No one cares about Murder Inc. anymore . They are finished in the rap world . Whatever happened to Charli Baltimore 's album . She got benched again . And all of Ja Rule 's albums have been wack except for his radio singles but he is not consistent . R.I.P . Ja Rule and the fake Gotti brothers . haa haaa . Murder Inc. was extorted by `` Supreme '' . Haaa	-1
dull , tuneless , pointless . this album is just so empty and without rhythm or anything that grabs you . the songs are just plain bad , poorly produced and performed . possibly one of the worst albums i have ever listened to.check out amels singing in 1995s groove theory album . thats a classic album full of unbelievably addictive grooves and soulful singing , this album ( without her old groove theory producer ) is about as opposite as you can get .	-1
there 's nothing new that has n't been done already.the beats have been done before a thousand times.this disc is 2nd rate Badu & amp ; Bliege.Amel has a good voice but this Material is Lacking anything New .	-1
This is for all you that have only been listening to rap for a couple of years . Do not judge Ice Cube 's abilities on his past couple albums . To appreciate him , go back to albums like & quot ; Death Certificate & quot ; , & quot ; Predator & quot ; and & quot ; AMW & quot ; . I respect Ice Cube as an actor and as an artist , but his last couple attempts at gaining the stature he once had have come empty handed . This album is tired .	-1
Ice Cube is a Rap Legend Period.but his recordings after 92 have just gotten worse & amp ; worse.I 'm tired of Hearing Cube just getting by with 2nd Rate Tracks.you get a song hear & amp ; their that sounds Familiar to his Peak but other than that it 's Melted ICE.He Lost his edge .	-1
This album has a few good songs . What happen to Ice Cube ? Has the things he was so against , taken his soul . This is whole lot better than the WaR Disc but what does that say about this as a double disc- It SUCKS . Where 's the old CUbe , Where 's K-DEE ? F @ ck Mr. short Khop . I weep for this OnE , it 's so studio , it is riddiculous . Weak for Ice Cube , listen to Amerikkka 's Most , Death Certificate and Westside Connection album to regain your skills . ONE	-1
The fact that Groove Armada have chosen to include their most successful single , & quot ; At The River & quot ; , on this release , when it was actually on their previous album , speaks volumes . What 's truly disappointing , though , is that nothing on & quot ; Vertigo & quot ; tops it , and & quot ; Northern Star & quot ; has been rereleased with & quot ; At The River & quot ; excised : a shameful historical revision . Other groups are already being touted as the 'successors ' to Groove Armada , so buy the single and consign the album to history .	-1
and for me it was a disapointment . The think thats sets Ronny apart from the rest of the field is his street-flavoured , hip hop fusion jazz thing . This album lacks that this ingredient , and if this does n't bother you , than I think you will love this CD . Only cut I really like is 5/8 .	-1
I wrote a review before , and i take back what i said about this cd , Resurection is a great album , after i started listening to it i changed my mind , all the songs are off the hook , and the lyrical flow of all the member , krazy , lazy , bizzy , wish and flesh are the bomb . 2 glocks is the best song off the album , and change the world is awsome to . I have the Bone thugs n harmony Vo.2 DVD , and it shows them in the studuio makeing this album , and it looks like they worked really hard on it , it wasent there come back or anything but it was a really well done cd , so bone thugs n harmony ... .KEEP IT UNDERGROUND , AND THUGUSH RUGISH	-1
Once Upon a TIme Bone THugs-N- Harmony had something fresh going on.but after a while Like Everything else in The Biz their Style was Ripped by COuntless others & amp ; they themselves are Playing the Formula Game here.I Guess After Working With MAriah Has Mellowed them down ? The Music Is Pretty Flat & amp ; Formula Felt.While I still Respect their Flow it seems more Business than any New Ideas Going into this .	-1
I used to be Bone 's biggest fan , but I stopped liking them after they made & quot ; Art of War & quot ; ( an ok album ) . Ok , how many times can you rap about Cleveland and St.Clair ? We know thery 're from Cleveland , they do n't need to keep saying the same thing over and over and over again . My advice to Bone is , to start rapping about different topics , I 'm tired of hearing about cops , Cleveland and St. Clair . And for pete sake , slow down the rapping , I ca n't even understand what thery 're saying . The reason why I gave this two stars is because , I did like the songs & quot ; Ecstasy & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Resurrection ( Paper , Paper ) & quot ; If you like Bone then buy this album , but in opinion , & quot ; E.1999 Eternal & quot ; was the best album they ever did . Peace Out ...	-1
Please dont waste your cash on this go buy Creepin on a comeup I dont know what happened to these cats , but i guess they decided they wanted more play on MTV or sumthin . Oh yeah if you get a chance you can see them in concert w/christina aguillera and destinys child ! now you tell me if thats selling out !	-1
Was this album a dissapointment ! ! I love Toni Braxton 's voice and I especially liked her first album and the second one ( although not as much as the first one ) but this one is a bore . The only good songs are : He was n't man enough for me , Spanish Guitar and Never One for a Ring . The rest is just plain terrible . I hope her next offering is better . Do n't waste your money on this one . With that voice , she can do a lot better .	-1
Sadly for Miss Braxton THE HEAT was the record that aimed her career downhill , after four years in hiatus , Braxton returned with the weakess album she has crafted , although the collection includes the perfectly done HE WAS N'T MAN ENOUGH FOR ME , her most top 40 track , the rest of the album is pure filler , MAYBE is average R & B track that had to be remixed even for Urban Outlets , SPANISH GUITAR is UN-BREAK MY HEART pt . II , that does not hold the brilliant masterpiece that the later was , JUST BE A MAN ABOUT IT , feat . Dr Dre , where ? , he only speak in the beginning less than a second , maybe in the video , this is Toni 's weakest released singles , a bad joint . GIM ME SOME , this is one of the worst songs ever done , THE HEAT the main title track , dough , is extremely absurd and boring , the HEAT failed to achieve any other successful track beside HE WAS N'T MAN ENOUGH , and coming from selling 8 million for each previous album she recorded , to sell only 2 million with THE HEAT , is a huge drop , with good reason this was the RECORD that ruin and ended her succesful career , so sad cos SECRETS is the perfect sugestive album , a masterpiece . Skip this .	-1
Toni Braxton has always had one of the more distinctively fine voices in pop/R & B circles -- it 's always been a matter of finding just the right material for her to wrap it around . Unfortunately , the majority of the songs found on THE HEAT do not fit into the category of `` the right material '' . Though a master balladeer , Braxton came loaded to bear with no doubt the worst batch of slow jams she 's foisted on us yet . It 's totally unfortunate that she scored so big with the now unlistenable 'Un-Break My Heart ' from her last album because she 's called on uber-hack Diane Warren not only for an even more inferior retread of that song ( 'Spanish Guitar ' ) , but also included another Warren weepie , 'I 'm Still Breathing ' , that makes one wish they were n't after hearing the typically insipid lyrics . The rest of the ballads fall along those same lines , with the only standout being 'Just Be A Man About It ' . Conversely , the uptempo fare here is like an oasis in a creatively dry desert -- 'He Was n't Man Enough ' and ' Gim me Some ' show that Braxton can at least hold her own with the likes of Rodney Jerkins and sound completely within her element doing so . But three great tracks do hardly a good album make -- this is simply a subpar effort from someone capable of far more .	-1
After waiting almost four years after the dynamite Secrets CD this was what we got . I am dissapointed with Toni 's new CD . I was yearning for the awesoe bass hooks that were present on her debut and Secret albums . Unfortunately none of it was present . I knew that this album was going to be different from those two but what a boring new sound . The Heat is rather hookless , moody , slow and monotonous . There is nothing innovative , Nothing ! Just watered down hookless elevator R & amp ; B that would have been OK as B-Sides . What happened to the spark of Secret or her debut album.I really wanted to like this CD considering how great her previous two were but unfortunately while I did not expect this album to be as good as the others , The Heat fell far short of what I had expected . I , m sorry but I ca n't help but feel let down by this CD.On a positive note You , ve been wrong is nice , so is Just Be A Man About It.Go ahead and get this album but I would to say though is that for those who loved Secrets and her debut you might be in for a dissapointment . I do pop this CD into my CD player once in a while .	-1
This is a half-way decent album . It is not as good as her first two but it does have its decent moments . I give Toni Braxton credit for being able to project more powerful and genuine emotion than most of her contemporary R & B counterparts . She is able to paint really beautiful yet tragic and moving pictures with her voice . She is also one of the sexiest vocalist that I have ever heard . The only problem is that her style can become tiresome when not supported by good material . The first three songs on this cd are pretty good . I especially like the title track . Songs do n't get much sexier or classier than 'Heat ' . 'Just be a man about it ' is also a pretty good track and is the one that is probably most familiar to those who do n't already own this cd . The other song that really stands out to me on this cd is 'Fairy Tale ' . I do n't think that I have ever heard a better example of romantic tragedy that is anywhere near this beautiful . True it has Babyface 's pronounced and highly visible signature all over it , and I do n't think that his composition/production style is generally much more than routine by-the-numbers R & B much of the time , but the union between he and Ms. Braxton works wonderfully on this track . Do n't get me wrong , Babyface has some written some great songs especially for other artists . I think that the `` Waiting to Exhale '' soundtrack and `` Secrets '' which he heavily guided are both really strong works and 'Love makes things happen ' and 'Roni ' for example are two of the MANY great slow jams that he was responsible for in the late 80 's and early 90 's , it 's just that whenever I hear much of his work from beyond that period especially , I ca n't help but feel like I 'm being hit with some totally predictable , routine , formulaic product . But , the bulk of the album is at least pleasant for the most part . The material here is not exactly stellar , but Toni injects so much genuine emotion into it , that giving it a few spins could prove to be worth your time .	-1
Luckily , I did n't buy this album , I was forced to hear it while my guy was playing it in his car . In my opinion , Toni Braxton has n't been dope since her very first album . After that point , she started to slowly fall into a Celine Dion-esque rut of having a great voice but wasting it on sappy C-level written ballads . This album , The Heat , was the dumps.Most of this album contains jams that you 'll listen to one day but will forget about in a year or two ( do you know anyone still playing `` He Was n't Man Enough '' ) ? Also , the songwriting is less than stellar . In one hand she wants to be played like a `` Spanish Guitar '' , whatever that means . Then she tries to redeems herself with the provocative title track , but falls when she ends the song asking , `` Anyone want some ice cream ? '' Toni 's lyrics has always been a little corny ( remember `` Un-break My Heart '' from Secrets ) , but on this album she 's at her worst.But with most bad albums , there 's always two songs that save the day . This time , those songs are `` Just Be a Man About It '' ( featuring Dr. Dre , but he 's only speaking , so that should n't count as a guest appearance , but a good marketing scheme , though ) and `` You 've Been Wrong '' . But if you bought this album thinking it was her best work , you 've been wrong . For vintage Toni Braxton , get her first album and maybe even Secrets , because this album needs to be re-Heated .	-1
Toni Braxtons latest effort & quot ; The Heat & quot ; is her weakest album to date.The only standout song is the first single & quot ; He Was n't Man Enough & quot ; which I think is still a weak song to say the least , from earlier efforts.The rest of the songs are just a mish mash of R & amp ; B & quot ; I have heard this before & quot ; ballads , and mid-tempo songs that have no standout potential.Always Braxton is in fine vocal form , but whatever she does she ca n't turn this piece of coal into a diamond.Unfortunately I think because she lent a writing hand to 75 % of this CD , and in my own opinion I do n't think Braxton is a songwriter.She should do like Janet Jackson does and have Terry Lewis & amp ; Jimmy Jam do their job , and if the artist has some input then fine.Braxton is a singer , and what a beautiful voice she has , but she is not a songwriter which drops this album to just a average run of the mill piece of dribble.A disappointment .	-1
The overall concept behind & quot ; The Heat , & quot ; Toni Braxton 's third album , can be found in the album 's first ten seconds . After a four-year absence from recording , the first word out of Toni 's mouth is & quot ; Darkchild , & quot ; nickname for trendy producer-of-the-moment Rodney Jerkins . True , her own name is said directly after , but the message is clear : trend first , artist later.Playing Catch-Up with the current crop of navel-baring , radio-ruling teenage divas may be to Toni 's commercial credit , but the actual music that 's involved in such a move also leaves an artistic debit . Of course , seeing as how Babyface wrote and produced most of her previous hits , it may be argued that it was never clear how much of Toni Braxton 's music was her own artistic vision . But Babyface 's acoustic , Eric-Clapton-with-a-drum-machine musings were certainly a better compliment to Toni 's sultry voice than the by-the-numbers R & amp ; B she 's subjected to here. & quot ; He Was n't Man Enough , & quot ; the album 's opener , contains all of the elements of a Rodney Jerkins Hit Single : chunky groove , synthesized harp , and a lyric that 's probably meant as modern feminism but instead just sounds bitchy . As radio fodder goes , though , it 's acceptable : as repetitive as it may be , at least it 's still built around a hook , whereas most of & quot ; The Heat & quot ; focuses on The Beat . That would n't be so bad if modern R & amp ; B had n't gotten so erratic ; nowadays kick drums are often doubled-up and snares are assigned to odd , half-measure counts . But Toni willingly obliges such whims on & quot ; Gim me Some , & quot ; a song that could have easily become the soundtrack to cruising around in an open convertible on a hot Summer night in 2000 ... alas , its jerky rhythms make it nearly impossible to find the groove and join in . Equally trendy is making the ballads as slow as possible , and as a result , & quot ; Never Just for a Ring & quot ; plods along so slowly it almost flatlines.Unfortunately , this is n't to say the album 's production is disguising any great writing . Even a major songwriting talent like Diane Warren , the brains behind Toni 's megahit & quot ; Unbreak My Heart , & quot ; is recruited here merely to repeat herself . Her contribution this time around , `` Spanish Guitar , '' is pointed out on the album 's cover sticker , just in case the song itself is n't enough to impress you ; however , the songs are so musically similar , the average listener probably could have figured it out . But an innovation of the cheapest kind is still managed : the lyrics , which have Toni pining for a troubador , provide a window of opportunity to include a flemenco guitar solo and a bridge both spoken and sung by a Latin male ... another trend conquered.Marring both composition and production simultaneously is & quot ; Maybe , & quot ; a song that suggests & quot ; ballad & quot ; with its strings and fingersnap-laden rhythms ... but Toni 's rapid-fire vocal delivery suggests something else altogether , and the result is chaos . The first-verse lyrics are unintelligible without the lyric book , but second-verse lyrics like & quot ; had me weak between the sheets/will he say I was a real big freak ? & quot ; make you grateful for small favors like incomprehension . & quot ; The Art of Love & quot ; even goes so far as to not be written at all : instead of lyrics Toni whispers a few come-ons , and instead of melody we 're given a sleepy , repeated keyboard loop , providing a new genre altogether : R & amp ; B for Elevators.Most disappointing of all , however , is the fact that Toni 's vocals do n't rescue the material ; her slow purrs and Babyface-inspired yelps ( & quot ; whoo ! & quot ; ) have become so predictable they 're trite . And while a drowsy vocal style was always her trademark , an increasing lack of diction is just too much ; on the first verse of & quot ; Just Be a Man About It & quot ; she sounds like Cher on sleeping pills.A couple of decent songs did manage to sneak in , however : the title track does manage a catchy hook and a surprisingly jazz progression , and & quot ; Fairy Tale & quot ; is another one of Babyface 's classy , drop-dead gorgeous acoustic affairs ... too bad it 's the only moment he 's allowed . True , this record will surely ignite radio and MTV ... there has n't been so shameless an artistic sell-out since Whitney Houston 's & quot ; My Love is Your Love. & quot ; But from a mature and musical standpoint , the only way `` The Heat '' will start a fire is if someone decides to burn some trash .	-1
Toni Braxton emerged with her first CD , Toni Braxton , in the early 90 's . Her deep , throbbing voice immediately set her apart and with production and collaboration from babyface the album became a smash . With her second CD , secrets , Toni officially became a diva . The jazz influenced , calm vibe of the CD allowed braxton 's voice to shine . It & # 65533 ; s only in hindsight that what Braxton did with secrets seems so incredible . On just her second CD she transformed from a young star into a sexy woman , something infinitely more popular and talented divas , ( Whitney , Mariah ) could n't do as quickly or successfully . However , in 1997 , Ms. Braxton went bankrupt . The heat is her first album since secrets and was perceived as a comeback . However , on this album , all the quite , sexy intrigue of secrets has been replaced by sleaze . Ms. Braxton , perhaps because of her 4 year absence from pop music , seems content to join the legions of finger- waving destiny 's child wannna- be 's . The album opens with He was n't man enough for me . With no crap lyrics and catchy , keyboard sounding background music , the song sounds like many other songs that Rodney Jenkins has produced or written . However , it is interesting seeing Toni wrap her voice around the song and adopt the feisty attitude of the lyrics . She sounds nothing like beyonce , which is refreshing , but then again she definitely does n't sound better . The song does n't give toni 's voice enough room to belt , and by the end of the song she sounds lost . The heat is a sad attempt at a sexy song and sounds limp compared to past Toni hits like your making me high . Toni & # 65533 ; s voice sounds static and the beat sounds sedate . On just be a man about it , backed by a calm , slow undigitized beat Toni plays the betrayed girlfriend . Her voice throbs with hurt and attitude amidst pointless spoken interludes by , of all people , Dr. Dre . However , Toni & # 65533 ; s unconfined vocals make this by far the best song on the album . However , Toni quickly gets lost again . On gim me some , Toni again finds herself backed by generic jenkinsesque music ( although the songs is not actually produced by Jenkins ) and when on the second verse Toni whispers & # 65533 ; say my name say my name & # 65533 ; its clear who she & # 65533 ; s imitating . The beat again cripples Toni , and she doesn & # 65533 ; t have room to belt or moan sensually , the two things she & # 65533 ; s best at . Even a sexy and fun rap by left eye can & # 65533 ; t save the song . However , the biggest disappointment here is the ballads , and there & # 65533 ; s plenty of them . On secrets , Toni ripped roared through babyface and Diane warren ballads with true grit and power , turning the stripped down , calm music into something special with her voice . However , here Toni sounds scared or simply unable to make her voice shine and the ballads , again by Diane warren and babyface , end up sounding like the generic pieces of fluff that they really are . Spanish guitar , I & # 65533 ; m still breathing and speaking in tongues end up sounding boring and inexcusably similar . The art of love is a sensual piece of nothing . The song has no singing in it and the only vocals is Toni moaning . She also had a song like this on secrets . Its hard to criticize or praise the song since there & # 65533 ; s little musical about it , especially here , since Toni sounds so uninspired . By the end , Toni seems to have given up , and she can & # 65533 ; t summon even an ounce of attitude or vocal prowess for the last three songs , maybe , you & # 65533 ; ve been wrong and never just for a ring . These songs aren & # 65533 ; t fast enough to be called uptempo songs , but aren & # 65533 ; t slow enough to be called ballads . In the end , on this album Toni sounds scared because of her absence instead of excited by her comeback . So yes Toni is back , but its not quite as exciting as it seemed .	-1
When Toni Braxton First came out it Looked Like She was Gon na Be a Force.Problem on the First Album is The same with this one & amp ; The 2nd disc.Too Much Formula.A Couple Good Uptempo Songs & amp ; The Rest is Sappy.Her Music does n't go with her Image.it Should n't take 4 years for this.Dark Child Rodney Jerkins does Her Justice on He Was n't Man Enough .	-1
i think this album only goes to show that the days of babyface producin are over , the songs on this album are verry weak u only have to compare the ballads to the ballads on her first album to agree ... he wasnt man enough by jerkins bein the sole excellent exception .. and plz soemone must stop diane warren from writin soem of the worst lyrics ever .	-1
good steady soul . smooth and well sung . but nothing spectacular . her singles are quite nice but I did n't think that they were that great . In the end it seems like Toni gets a bit worse with each album which is disappointing	-1
Toni Braxton has her own special brand of schlock R & amp ; B , not that it 's good , mind you , but it does sound a little different from the undifferentiated legions of wan na be divas out there . It 's sort of like slowed down fast music , with crackley vocals . The Spanish guitar in ` Spanish Guitar ' was good , although the song is marred by the presence of , well , Toni Braxton .	-1
Uncle Kracker 's got an identity crisis . Hardcore rapper or smooth-talkin pop singer ? His friend/mentor/producer/songwritin buddy Kid Rock has the same problem , but balances it a little better.Most of Kracker 's CD comes off sounding forced . The `` Intro , '' for example , is a pain to listen to ( fortunately , it 's not very long ) . And songs such as `` Whiskey and Water '' and `` Who 's Your Uncle '' try to play Kracker as a tough-talker ... which the rest of the album denies.I really do n't care if he 's tough or not . He 's not that good of a rapper . He 's much better at the pop ballads , such as `` Better Days '' or `` You Ca n't Take Me . '' `` Yeah Yeah Yeah '' is downright infectious , while the hit single `` Follow Me '' is cheasy but incredibly enjoyable.Yeah , a handful of songs saves Kracker 's CD from downright awfulness . I 'm not dissing the man 's talent -- he 's got some , I can tell . ( In fact , I 'm willing to bet he has quite a lot ) . However , this CD does n't express it well enough . It 's a shame , really . `` Double Wide '' promises , but does n't deliver . Still , maybe it 's your cup of tea ; you can always try it out , then tell me I 'm wrong . ( ... )	-1
I heard about some of the reviews saying how good this is . It is n't . Follow Me is scaringly overplayed and overrated , and if you have n't noticed , talks about affair , which is nothing more than the scene has heard before.. Think about it with your mind then there 's no explanation needed.Double Wide the album as a whole , is too much like Kid Rock 's Devil WIthout A Cause . Not that I do n't like that album , but I want something original . No rap rock needed . This wo n't beat how dissapointed I was with Papa Roach but is pretty close.Do something nobody was thinking would ever be made , or , make your style sound better , than its a higher rating . No Kracker please .	-1
Browse through a decent number of reviews and you 'll find lots of folks ... even those who gave this good star ratings ... talking about how Richard Carpenter has overdubbed new piano parts at times ( `` Sing '' in particular is cited ) and the CD has been extensively re-mixed . The monkeying is probably most noticeable in the extra reverb added to Karen 's voice and the way the drums are pushed forward in the mix more than the originals.If you do n't release the 45RPM version ... without re-mixing it , adding extra parts , taking away other parts to `` modernize '' it..then you have NOT released the singles . These changes are not `` remastering '' ... they are re-recording . If Richard desires to do that , it should be released as `` The Carpenters ' Greatest Songs ... Re-interpreted ! '' or something similar . Those who want to hear that could still buy it..and those seeking the songs they remember AS they remember them would be spared the deception.BOTTOM LINE : Do n't buy into the revisionist history . Stick with the `` 1969-1973 '' version instead . ( ASIN B00000HY5F )	-1
Trina has an interesting voice , but these are terribly uninteresting trashy tunes filled with wild cursing and crudity with no real thought or creativity . These is a really sickening segment where Trina 's on the phone with some ignorant ghetto girl profanely rambling as if she had never seen the inside of a school house . How anyone can find trash like this entertaining is just beyond me ! I guess it 's time for the Geritol and rocking chair for me ! ( But hey , at least it 's better than Khia 's & quot ; Thug Misses & quot ; ) .	-1
this is n't rap . this is anything but rap . i bought this cd like a month or 2 ago and i still think that theres only 2 or 3 good songs on it . i would advise no one to pick this album up because it shows no talent and its worse than pain is love by ja rule	-1
One of the other reviewers said it perfectly , Sex sells . Sex does indeed sell , but only for females like Eve , Lil ' Kim , Foxy Brown who all are perfect sex symbols . But the difference between them and Trina is that they atleast know other subject matter . Trina is horrible , she doesnt know anything except giving her body to every man she sees . She doesnt concern herself with the true issues of hip-hop . Its ok to promote sex on ur album but atleast try to be serious sometimes . This album is a joke and will never be taken seriously because this chick just plain [ is bad ] . She has no right to call herself the Baddest B**** , she really needs to think about this more , but its plain to see that she really didnt think about it because her next album is [ is bad ] .	-1
I remember when I first heard heard Trina I couldnt help but wonder what was people 's fascination with her ? So what she makes raunchy records , the girl couldnt rap her way out of a flavored condom plus she sounds like a hood version of Edith from All In The Family . From where I from Trina is the most overrated female ever . This album is concrete proof of that statement . The first single The Baddest B**** is so cheesy it makes you wonder how this song became a hit . Pull Over , Off The Chain Wit it , Off Glass and I Dont Need You are extra cheesy to the point you might get constipated from the first listen . Other disposables : The Big Lick ( Blah ) , Aint S*** ( a female version Of Dr. Dre 's B***es Aint S*** . How original ) , I 'll Always ( super stale plus she should be sued for screwing up Ronald Isley 's Voyage To Atlantis ) , Watch Yo Back and the rest of this album.Bottom Line : Trina 's Da Baddest B**** is the worst female rap album next to the Notorious K.I.M . and Thug Misses . The beats suck , her lyrics sound like they were conceived in the mind of a tweenager and her voice is as painful as scratching a chalkboard with your fingernails . Lyrics like /Sisqo made that song/ when he seen me in a thong th th th thong show you that she puts the corn in corny ! Da Baddest B**** more like Da Saddest B**** !	-1
Man , I 've heard better beats coming from my plumbing pipes at three in the morning than this low-budget underproduced piece of trash . And what the heck is up with these so-hardcore lyrics here ? You 're the & quot ; baddest b*tch & quot ; ? That 's really nice , a real nice thing to aim for . NEXT !	-1
I 'm going to go out on a limb and say Trina was in the bottom 10 % of her high school class just based off the title of this CD . Where do I start with how grammatically poor , `` Da Baddest Bitch '' is ? I 'll give you five seconds to figure out what her schtick is . Give up ? She portrays herself as the baddest prostitute in the game and people just eat it up like apple jacks ( or apple dapples , which are more cereal for cheaper ) . This cd really depresses me . This girl is so misguided . She 'll rap about being a boy toy for a couple albums , buy her a $ 3 million home in Cali and be at the state unemployment office by '08 . This is da dumbest record out there right now , please do n't buy it.Sheena Easton already owns the hot chick game and has for 19 years . When she released , `` Sugar Walls '' , it was over . I look for her to put out a rap album just to shove it in Trina 's face . She 'll rap over the `` Strut '' backing track and call her album , `` Da real baddest bitch 19 years runnin , so Trina , would ya likes a slice of dis ? '' . The industry will get back to where it was when Sheena , Bonnie Tyler and Juice Newton gave black women something to be proud of . Go Sheena .	-1
This Disc is Wack.Now First Of all I Respect Dallas Austin he has done Some Great Work Over the Years but aside from Boyz11Men he has Has n't fared well with Kids and this is no Exception.ABC was Lame & amp ; Sammie is No Different.WHO Wrote about A Michael Jackson COmparrison ? Michael would n't Have Made it if He sung as flat as Sammie.Folks Had Different Standards back in the day as Opposed to now.To Much Nowadays is accepted as the Next Big Thang.Sammie is n't even a 2nd tier Tevin Campbell.Tevin was Better as a Kid Artist.The Music Here is so Generic.Sammie Vocally is more closer to RayJ.than MJ .	-1
God , him and Aaron Carter ! They both have horrible girl voices and no one likes them . I heard a song by Sammie at a friends house and it was horrible . Do n't buy this . You wo n't regret not buying this .	-1
Even though I was n't a big Clue fan back in his mix tape days , he still dropped the raw joints on the street before anyone else could here them . I knew this kat had connection because of different artist he premiered on his tapes and that these artist would take him far in the hip hop game . My only dislike back when was the fact that he screamed his irritating voice over some of the best songs . Now that he has his fame ... ... someone misinformed him of his producing skills . The Professional pt.1 was his first mistake but had some hot joints for the radio . This one is a nightmare ! ! All the beats sound the same or formed over the hesitated beat . And what 's even worse , he got his lame , bling-bling , champagne sippin Rocafella crew all over this CD . Jay-Z was a favorite underground MC of mine way back when , but now ... ... ... .please . Bleek and Sigeal are 2 of the most fake thugs in the industry . A thug is someone society is scared of , these 2 my mom could beat down with a switch . And someone please tell Foxy Brown it was over after the `` Firm '' went under . The only reason these artist are title & quot ; HOT & quot ; is because of video . Man-oh-Man where would 90 % of artist out today be without Video TV . It 's scary , because music fans are gullible to what radio and Video TV says is hot or maybe it 's just me wanting `` SOMETHING DIFFERENT '' to listen to . Someone else wrote that the MC 's was n't holding up to Clue 's production , to me it 's reversed . Clue gathered a lot tight MC 's with very different styles and tried to produce them over his stale beats . Good points to this CD are : Mary J. Blidge taking me back and `` Cream 2001 '' by Raekwon & amp ; Ghostface Killah . Clue ? Needs to get a clue and leave production to those who got'em where he is today and just release mix tapes . I STILL SAY TONY TOUCH IS THE BEST MIX TAPE DJ ON THE PLANET ... ... ... ... get a clue ! ! : - ) lol ... ONe	-1
DJ.CLUE has no clue of what is is doing . First off he is wack , no doubt about it , this is true . Second I think he could learn a thing or two from Tony Touch . He is real . I do n't understand want the music world is going though right now but someone needs to get it together quick , fast and in a hurry because people ca n't keep listing to mess like this . If DJ Clue was in Iraq and he put out this kind of c.d he would have his hands cut off . To be honest he needs them to be cut off right now . Yes DJ Clue has made it into my wack list along with others .	-1
Wow ... Clue REALLY changed his style from the last professional huh ? ! Man , that 's just ker-a-z . The last album was better but i guess this one wuz & quot ; AAIGHT & quot ; ..not exactly somethin you 'd wan na waste your money on though..i just peeped the trax offa amazon and just listened to a few seconds of it but uhh ... a few seconds still makes a difference..yea..i 'm really feelin that & quot ; Change the game & quot ; single with Jay-z.That single is HYPED..sounds like the only tight songs on this cd are THAT ( change the game ) , What the beat , the best of Queenz , and maybe even..the Trick Daddy song if i can get a listen but uhh..that 's about it..just FOUR songs..but hey..different strokes fo ' different folkz right ? I would n't reccomend this but u can peep it if u want.Peace .	-1
Stevie is really a wonder . Along with Marvin Gaye , Curtis Mayfield , Sly , James Brown and possibly Al Green , Stevie brought soul music to another level . From inside his mind , Stevie Wonder conjured images of beauty , pain , loss and so on , in mesmerising arrangements.He must 've been a busy man in 1970s , simply by the amount of classics that he brought out . Fulfillingness ' First Finale possesses a light , uplifting touch , though it 's certainly not candy floss ! Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away is a quality song , as if asking a question of belief . Like when people doubt religion , 'where is your God ? That 's what my friends ask me'.There 's that instantly recognisable Stevie Wonder sound on Boogie On Reggae Woman . It 's difficult to classify these songs . Another one of these get down and do it songs is You Have n't Done Nothin ' . Yes , I know there 's a political and racial subtext to a lot of his songs.Please Do n't Go must 've been some sort of hit . I 'm sure I 've heard it all round the place . It 's a great , structured , song with a snappy melody.It 's quite easy for me to say that Stevie Wonder sees better than most people I know . Another example of greatness of mind .	-1
RUFF RYDERS HAVE OFFICIALY BURNT OUT . THE FIRST VOLUME WAS FRESH . DMXS FIRST CD WAS DOPE . SINCE THEN WHAT HAVE THEY DONE ? ? THE LOX BRICKED , EVE WAS AVERAGE , DMX LAST TWO WERE UNORIGINAL , DRAG-ON HAD TWO LISTENABLE SONGS ON IT.. THE NEW VOLUME 2 IS PATHETIC AND I THINK I KNOW WHY ? ? SWIZZ BEATZ..THE IN HOUSE DJ HASNT LEARNED ANYTHING NEW . ALL THE BEATS SOUND THE SAME.. UNORIGINAL AND NOT HOT ! ! ! ALL THE OTHER PRODUCERS ON THE ALBUM SIMPLY ARE SWIZZ CLONES ... ALL THESE SONGS SOUND LIKE LEFTOVERS FROM THE GARBAGE ALBUMS THEY RELEASED . SORRY BUT IM JUST BEING HONEST.. YEAH I WANTED THIS CD TO BE HOT AS WELL ... BUT ITS NOT ... IVE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE IN RUFF RYDERS .	-1
as Much as I Dig old Snoop & amp ; Scarface they add nothing to this Same old Tired Beat.Swizz-Beatz is one of The Lamest So-Called Producers Ever.His Music Sounds all The Same & amp ; Cheap.DJ QUIK He Ain't.He Needs To Listen to A Real Groove-Oriented Player LIke MR.Quik.The Raps Are Boring. & amp ; as for The Lox ? Well even though Puffy is one of The Biggest Jokes in Rap at Least He Unloaded those Guys.it does n't take a Genius To hear they ca n't flow.Swizz & amp ; Timberland are One Beat Pony's.change The Beat & amp ; Flow .	-1
Well , what do I got to say 'bout this cd ? First of all , I want to say I do n't give it one star but two is only because of the first track & quot ; WW3 & quot ; with Snoop Dogg etc . ... That 's the only good song on the whole album ! This is really a wack album and a weak attempt from Swizz Beatz cause the beats do n't sound right at all ( exept for the first one ) but there are songs like & quot ; Twisted Heat & quot ; wich could have been a LOT better if the beat was listenable cause damn ... . Just like on & quot ; Ryde or Die vol.I & quot ; I like Drag-On the best , I think he 's got a great future in the game but I think he should leave Ruff Ryders 'cause Swizz is gettin ' kind of slow and he ca n't provide Drag with the beats he deserves ... DMX ' track is n't BAD eather however I do n't think he tried his best ! As the matter of fact , I do n't think any of the Ruff Ryders tried their best ! It 's like an other reviewer said , they just take their songs wich are n't good enough to put them on their solo albums and of thos & quot ; bad & quot ; songs they make a compilation , & quot ; Ryde or Die & quot ; named ... If you want my advice 'bout this album , do n't buy it ...	-1
When the first Ruff Ryders came out I could say I was bumpin it back to back but this one showed that they should have stopped while they were still ahead . What kills this one ? 1 . Swizz Beatz producing every track . 2 . Weak guest appearances 3 . Asinine skits ( i.e Im a H O E and F @ @ @ Da Haters ) .4 . Repetitive material . 5 . Wack newcomers to their roster . The Good : WW III feat Yung Wun , Snoop Dogg , Scarface and Jadakiss is the best song on this album . Styles P rips his solo joint Holiday in half and I hate to say it but Eve 's Got It All featuring Jadakiss is alright . That 's it.The Bad : 2 Tears In A Bucket would have been great without Sheek 's weak verse and that cruddy beat but Red And Meth 's verses were straight . Larsiny featuring Yung Wun 's Ryde Or Die Boyz is a straight filler and Larsiny 's punchlines could be seen a mile away ( Im not joking ) . Twista makes a decent performance on Twisted Heat but Drag-on 's lame verses and the awkward sounding beat make the song impossible to be enjoyed . Speaking of Drag-on he drops a fillerific joint called Weed , Hoes Dough that makes you wonder why he was even signed in the first place and you can tell no effort went into that hook and song at all . The Ugly : Fright Night featuring Busta Rhymes and Swizz Cheekz is HOT GARBAGE ! ! ! That has to be the most ludicrous hook since 30 Rocks by Eightball & MJG featuring Puffy . Jadakiss solo joint stinks because of an awful beat that sounds like hammered dookie . Not only does that joint reek but The Lox joint Go Head is also a forgettable track . Dishonorable mentions : Stomp featuring Trick Daddy and Yung Wun ( ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , DMX 's The Great and Parle 's Its Going Down.Bottom Line : The Ruff Ryders series went down the tubes a little too quick . The second installment ? That sucks ! The thing thats even more sad is that the next to series got even worser than this one . Do yourself a favor . Stay away from this series as if it was a Deathrow Records release because its only going to get worse after vol . 4 .	-1
I was really disappointed by this album . It took forever to come out and finally when it did , only & quot ; Sippin on some Syrup & quot ; and & quot ; Who Runnit & quot ; make me want to put this cd back in my stereo . Three 6 is by far the hardest rap group in the game today and thats what makes them great , they do n't care about offending people and they have stayed underground . BUT , judging by some of the tracks on this album , it looks like they spent about an hour to slap this thing together because they lyrics are sloppy , the beats are old and recycled ... it just does n't work for them on this cd . Songs about throwing bows , elbowing people in the club , scandelous hoes , throwing up gang signs gets real old real fast on this album . However , I will say this : & quot ; Who Runnit & quot ; is the greatest song they have ever done and its almost worth the 12 bucks to get it just for that . The worst part about it is that & quot ; Who Runnit & quot ; was already release on the & quot ; Hypnotize Camp Posse & quot ; album too ... which dropped before this so I 'm guessing DJ Paul and Juicy J just were like & quot ; Oh crap , this album sucks ... better put Who Runnit on there to make it a little better. & quot ; If you love triple 6 make sure you have & quot ; Chapter 2 : World Domination & quot ; because that cd is awesome , every track is sweet . This one is just sloppy and I would recommend nobody to waste their money on it .	-1
A while back , a friend of mine played this CD for me.I sure have to say that I never heard anything this filthy in a while ! I 'm never shocked by anything and my mouth was dropping by all the downright sordid langauge and references to rough , ( Satanic ? ) sex and violence.And then there 's many vague nods to Satanism.It 's funny because this album went platinum so you 'd think that politicans and community activists would be carrying signs and detesting this album but NOOOO , not a peep was said.As for the quality of the songs , that 's still in the air.The 808-powered , slowed down , sinsiter bass beats are same-sounding.And the MCs sound high ( they probably are ! ) as they slur over the tracks in a thick Memphis drawl.But `` Sippin ' On Some Syrup '' ( an anthem praising ectascy and an drugged up 'beverage ' called syrup ) and the straight-up-nasty ( ! ) `` Tonuge Ring '' are purely guitar pleasures.You might be nodding your heads and shaking it at the same time ! Plus songs such as `` Weak Ass B- '' , '' F- All Y'All '' sound so ignorant and twisted that you sorta enjoy them ... I 'm still shocked that such a profane album made it without a fuss while more coperate artists released supposedly `` vulgar '' lyrics ( i.e . Eminem ) .This is an average , raw dirty-south hip hop album that wo n't leave an impact but will keep you asking yourselves , '' They just did n't say that , did they ? `` .No wonder one of the members ( lone female Gangsta Boo ) left the group to become a born-again Christian after this ' records release.All this nasty content would make me want to repent too ! LOL	-1
i love three 6 but dis is dey worst albumprolly da only tight junts on here is sippin on some sizzurp & im so hiotha den dat dont pick up dis shyt	-1
Three 6 Mafia has a terrible habit of showing gullibleness by using bad lyric placement , horrible usage of profanity , and a bunch of other things . I 'm really glad my mom does n't let me buy rap CDs because I think this , along with others , is a very huge monotonous piece of trash . If I even hear this band use the GD word , I will go ballistic , and so much damage will be done . This CD will be in pieces , along with Lostprophets disc , Weapons . I am just warning everyone to NEVER show me this band . I think this shows and example that even older rap SUCKS , and this cam out when rap was n't as bad as it is now . The fourth track is actually one of the stupidest songs I have ever heard in my life , because the beginning sounds like they are at a stupid preschool show concert and rapping like 2 chainz . I am warning you to NEVER buy this album in the remaining timeline of this universe .	-1
I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE BUYING THIS RECORDING ; COULD N'T WAIT . PUT IT ON IN THE CAR , AND ... NOTHING . IT SOUNDS LIKE STEVE EARLE , BUT IT IS N'T . IT IS JUST VERY FLAT . THERE IS NOTHING THAT STANDS OUT , NOTHING SPECIAL ON THIS RELEASE TO BRING ME BACK , AS THERE HAVE BEEN ON HIS LAST SEVERAL RELEASES . I LISTENED TO THIS CD MANY TIMES , HOPING THAT SOMETHING WOULD GRAB MY EAR . TO MANY RABID FANS , AN ARTIST CAN NOT MAKE A BAD RECORDING , BUT IN MR. EARLE 'S CASE , THIS IS ONE . THERE 'S SOMETHING MISSING , STEVE 'S ECLECTIC VISION PERHAPS .	-1
I was in the store one Tuesday looking for a new album to buy , and I came across Yeeeah Baby . I do n't know why , but I had a feeling I should n't buy it . I ended up buying it , and after listening to it , I wished I 'd listened to that feeling.The first three songs , `` Watch Those , '' `` Off Wit His Head , '' and `` It 's So Hard '' are pretty good ( in fact , `` Watch Those '' has one of the catchiest choruses you 've ever heard ) . But that 's about it . The rest of the album falls very short of what we know Big Pun is capable of . Songs like `` Laughing At You '' , `` We Do n't Care '' and `` My D___ '' should have immediately been thrown in the garbage . And if you 're ever having trouble falling asleep , try putting on `` N S**t '' or `` Wrong Ones . '' It 'll work wonders.Many parts of this album are so violent it 's ridiculous . The best example , `` Leather Face , '' would make Eminem ask , `` Are you some kind of psycho ? '' Also , the guest rappers do nothing to save this album . People like Prospect and SunKiss could be mistaken for any member of The Firm . And then there 's the `` new '' female MC , Remi Martin , who is to Terror Squad what Lil ' Kim was to Junior M.A.F.I.A . But that 's not necessarily a good thing . You 'll find that out when you hear her song `` Ms. Martin '' ( I thought this was Big Pun 's album ) . The only guest spot that almost works is M.O.P . on `` New York Giants . '' The problem with that song is that it 's too loud . Sure , it 's the M.O.P . we all know and love , but all that loud scream-rapping does n't sound right coming from Big Pun 's mouth.Posthumous albums are never widely accepted by many people , especially when one hears the quality of the songs . This album only has a few good songs , so there were three better choices here : make an EP , spread the songs across different soundtracks , or just forget about the songs altogether . But for some reason , people think these albums will resurrect the artist . Some people may say I 'm not being fair because Big Pun is n't around any more , but let 's be honest . If an artist releases a bad album and then dies , regardless of how he/she dies , that does n't somehow make the album good . In fact , that 's almost saying the artist was n't important until he/she died . Otherwise , where were you when they were alive ? All in all , I 'm not saying we should forget about Big Pun ... I 'm saying we should forget about this album .	-1
There are 3 classics on here , & they are Its So Hard , 100 % & Ms. Martin , peace ! ! !	-1
Boy if I was him I 'd fall off of the face of the earth . Heca n't rap ... from what I 've heard . And I 've heard both albums ... so , that 's kinda bad . I do n't believe there is any good songs on this cd ... and there were 3 on the other one ... will he just get worse and worse ? ...	-1
Big Pun was a Cool Brother but his Work was Often Lacking.the Music & amp ; Lyrics here just are Typical Industry Fair.We Do n't Care is a Tight cut as is My Turn.but on a Whole it 's nothing worth Getting.it 's Sad cuz He had some Talent.but this is n't the way it should have Ended .	-1
Do I really need to state the obvious ? Probably not , but I 'll do it anyway . Pun is capable of much , much better work . Albums like this are why I remain skeptical when it comes to purchasing posthumous releases . I 'd have to say that , after listening to Capital Punishment , this album was a huge letdown.There are some decent tracks to be found , but they are most definitely the minority . `` Watch Those '' is cool , but it suffers from a suspect hook . `` Off With His Head '' is dope and `` It 's So Hard '' is tight . My favorite song on the album would have to be `` 100 % '' though . It has an infectious beat and Pun laces the track like he 's supposed to.Unlike his first album , the majority of this album is mediocre . `` My D*ck '' is hilarious and the intro to `` Laughing At You '' is funny too , but neither song should 've seen the light of day . Songs like `` Wrong Ones '' , `` Leather Face '' , and `` Ni**a Sh*t '' are all corny and `` We Do n't Care '' and `` You Was Wrong '' are just plain wack . `` My Turn '' literally put me to sleep and it 's pretty obvious that there were n't enough Pun joints to go around because Remy Martin has a solo joint on Pun 's album . Go figure . Oh yeah , the song is wack and Remy is terribly overrated.This album sounds like it was rushed and thrown together at the last second so Pun fans would have something new to hold on to after his sudden departure . All it did for me was confirm my suspicions about posthumous releases . While Pun can be mentioned as one of the better emcees to bless the mic , this album simply does not reflect the potential or follow through on the promise that was so heavily evident on his first LP . I 'd reccomend passing on this album if you 're not a die hard Pun fan.Standout Tracks : It 's So Hard feat . Donnell Jones , Watch Those , 100 % feat . Tony Sunshine , New York Giants feat .

Posthumous albums are funny things . Few artists recorded like ` Pac . That man lived in the studio if he was not in jail . Big pun released one album while alive and it is supposed to be a classic in the truest since of the word . I ca n't comment on that album cause I have never heard it but this album is fairly simplistic overall . The two skits are just bad . Then two of his Terror Squanders basically get solo tracks : Tony Sunshine with `` My D**k '' and Remy Martin with `` Ms. Martin '' , so right their your down to only 12 songs that actually have Pun rapping , and this is suppose to be his album ? If you throw all the guests in that number gets almost cut in half so overall you have a compilation album with Big Pun and lots of guests . Now sometimes this does not matter but the only great guests are M.O.P. , true prospect shows some promise on `` Off wit his head '' and Cuban link is aight but basically the terror squad had one great rapper , Pun himself , and lots of mediocre rappers . This album is laced with some nice Latino beats which means that you can at least here the wackness being backed by some good soundscapes . The one thing I will say that when Big Pun is on he is on his flow and lyrics can be spectacular . One example of this is `` We Do n't Care '' , for such a big man to have that great of breath control is very impressive since I 've heard people that are much smaller than him not be able to flow that well . So overall I would say check his debut and if you see this album used then maybe cop it otherwise it 's not worth it .	-1
Obviously , all it takes is 5 tolerable songs for an album to be considered good nowadays . I 'm not even gon na beat around the bush with this one . This album is very disappointing . Da Brat 's first album could be considered a classic in some circles . Her second album was n't classic , but it was still dope . Apparently , she abandoned the winning formula that she used on her first two albums . Do n't get me wrong , I do n't expect anyone to be the same way all of the time . You should n't be doing the same things in 2004 that you were doing in 1995 unless those things pay very well . But on this album ( released in 2000 ) , Da Brat apparently forgot how to rhyme . Also , the beats are generic and the guest appearances do n't add anything to the album ( with the exception of a VERY hot intro ) . But after the intro , the rest is downhill . This CD was for the pop heads I guess . Tracks like `` F*ck You '' , `` Breeve On 'Em '' , `` What 's On Ya Mind '' , `` All My B*tches '' , and `` High Come Down '' are plain wack . There 's no other way to put it . `` Back Up '' features Ja Rule and Jermaine Dupri blatantly rips off the Jay Z hit `` Can I Get A ... '' on the beat . Oh yeah , the song itself sucks too.There are a few bright spots on the album , but not many . Da Brat does manage to take it back to her roots on `` Hands In The Air '' and shows off the rhyme skills that makes her one of the better females rappers out there alongside the underrated Mystikal . And as I said before , `` The Intro '' features Millie Jackson and a blazing appearance from Twista.In a nutshell , I believe that Da Brat had the potential to be one of the best female rappers around , but she pissed all over that potential in hopes of gaining more spins and pop culture acceptance that never came . Maybe the joke is on me for expecting something profound from a memeber of Jermaine Dupri 's camp . I would n't reccomend buying this album unless you are a die hard Brat fan . If you 're not a die hard fan and you 're curious about this album , download it first.Standout Tracks : Intro feat . Millie Jackson & Twista , Hands In The Air , and Runnin ' Out Of Time	-1
Unrestricted is Da Brat at her best . She improves lyrically and shows a different side of herself . Still she does not impress me , she still could do alot better considering she has one of the best flows in female emcee history . NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
2 1/2Broadcast work with what they are given fairly well in this overpraised debut attempting to emulate a retro psychedelic sound , but the unimpressive songwriting leaves much to merely a weak , derivative atmosphere . While touches of electronic undercurrents help punctuate this moody pop in appreciative ways , it hardly seems enough to justify the noise made for these people , let alone be quality-compared with Stereolab . At least they provided elegant background music , Broadcast merely sound self-consciously elegant .	-1
Birmingham 's Broadcast play at the dark end of the electronica scale , the place where Portishead and Tricky meet soundtrack pioneers . On The Noise Made by People , their 2nd official release ( there 's also an EP collection ) , they 're most successful with concrete sound collages . `` Minus One '' sounds like Bernard Herrmann scoring Hitchcock ; `` Until Then '' is This Mortal Coil scored for a Hammer Horror flick ; `` City in Progress '' is a Stereolab waltz ; `` Dead the Long Year '' an ace Portishead rip . More often though , their conventional ambient electronica evaporates as you listen , partially due to Trish Keenan 's lackadaisical vocals , or the unimaginative soundscapes of her fellow bandmates , or both .	-1
For those who like Ennio Morricone and western spaghettis , Calexico may be an interesting band worth checking out . Their southern sound is cool , stylish and moody enough to deserve a listen . However , & quot ; Hot Rail & quot ; isn ` t a great record , as it is too long , repetitive and not very diverse . There are some good songs to be found here , like & quot ; The Ballad of Cable Hogue & quot ; or & quot ; Service and Repair & quot ; , but the album is mostly a collection of instrumental soundscapes and part of them are filler material . As mildly pleasant background music it ` s alright , though it doesn ` t have much more to offer .	-1
Being a big Jodeci fan , I expected a lot from this one . So how is it ? Lem me just say that if I made a list of the ten worst albums I have ever bought , Metamorphic would be on that list . He is a horrible singer and the songwriting is horrendous . I would say two tracks are just average . And everything else is simply garbage .	-1
Let start off by saying I 'm a huge Jodeci fan , and I support all of them , but I do n't know about Dalvin 's album . My favorite cuts on the album are & quot ; Why Ca n't We , Long Day , More Than Friends ( dope ) and Not my Girl & quot ; . The main problem is that Dalvin does n't have a real good voice and should know his limitations . Some songs sound good , others sound like Sh % t . I still looking for the Jodeci album .	-1
I Dig Old Jodeci.but their 's a Reason Why Mr.Delvin Never Sung On Their Records.The Material here & amp ; His Voice are Both Flat.I Dug The Cut Dangerous with DeVante but aside from that it 's Pretty Weak.what 's so funny is that He had the nerve to say that he had been Listening too Old Michael Jackson Albums FOr Inspiration ? More Like Michael Jackson The Beer Columist.I Hope Jodeci Comes Out with a New Disc & amp ; Keep Mr.Dalvin in His Place Away from The Main Mike .	-1
Four albums deep , Cypress Hill has been criticized heavily lately for still sounding exactly the same as they did when they first came out in 1991 . Well , this was their answer ; a half rap and half rock album.Muggs also experiments on the rap side and the result is , well boring . The rock side might attract new fans to the Hill , but for anyone who does n't like rock music ... this is only a waste of 6 tracks.So if you like rap/rock combos , this might be for you . If not , there is nothing here worth your money .	-1
There is a regrettable tendency for only those who like an album to write a review of it . ( I suppose even if this is not the case , there is still a regrettable tendency for those who like music of a similar previous style to buy an album ) . This review will not be in that mold.I was recommended to buy this album . I like some music incorporating rap.This is a really awful album . The rappers certainly have spirit and energy , but then that would be damning them with faint praise .	-1
The album was for me a matter of personal taste in fact . I believe that DJ Muggs brilliant hip-hop production with its typical fare of stringy and tinkling pianos help to reinforce the imagery and violence of the underground gangster life . I relished the skulls disc . On the other hand , being a hip-hop purist , I really did n't enjoy the rock disc all that much . I presume that it was a wonderful experiment but I really was n't so hyped on the actual execution . I wish that Cypress Hill finds a new direction in its production and that it turns to a heavier hip-hop style like the way that the Wu is evolving . Rap superstar is a must hear however .	-1
So they invented drum'n'bass . They define it as being Bossa Nova with a new beat . I tell you it 's nothing at all . I think they could add new material to it if they really wanted to create something new.What 's wrong here is to find that this is a new way of playing and feeling Bossa Nova . No , not absolutely , this is not Bossa Nova.Repertoire is good Brazilian music . Voice is fine crystal.Unfortunately this 'drum'n'bass ' ensemble is just a passing wave.Ms . Gilberto owes us something better .	-1
This is not rap buy rap albums like Nas and KRS-One and Rakim and Big Daddy Kane and Tupac and Kweli and Aesop Rock and even Necro those are all real rappers these are all wannabe thugs .	-1
After reading for years about Eva , I finally took the plunge and purchased this CD - - fully expecting to be blown away . As I listened , track after track passed by and I kept saying to myself `` OK , the next song will be great . '' Well , sorry to say , I found nothing here very special at all . Granted , Eva was blessed with a beautiful voice . But that 's not all it takes to pull the listener in . I 'm familar with most of the songs on this CD , but her versions do n't add anything unique . Her band is just OK and the recording quality of this CD is pretty bleak . I just do n't see what all the fuss is about and was greatly dissapointed .	-1
With their last album , & quot ; Vanishing Point & quot ; , Primal Scream were able to create another masterpiece , something like a & quot ; Screamadelica 2 & quot ; . & quot ; Xtrmntr & quot ; certainly is a disappointment . & quot ; Xtrmntr & quot ; is about being enraged . Listen to the first single & quot ; Swastika Eyes & quot ; and you get a flavour . Evil corporations rule the world etc . We heard that before and somehow Primal Scream do n't really have the credibility to deliver that message . As a short side-note let me add that in Germany , & quot ; Swastika Eyes & quot ; appeared as & quot ; War Pigs & quot ; . That only makes sense if you assume that the single is about making money ( so & quot ; War Pigs & quot ; would not insult the Germans ... ) and not about making a point . But making music for angry young people is a smart thing to do I guess.Apart from the lame message , the music on & quot ; Xtrmntr & quot ; is disappointing . Sure enough , the single & quot ; Swastika Eyes & quot ; rocks a lot . But that is pretty much it . Some other songs are nice and very similar ( lyrics and music ) but there is no spark and the album is rather patchy . What 's more , two mixes of the same song on an album are sort of dubious - especially if they are so similar . And the song done with/by Kevin Shields in fact already appeared on a remix EP . Anyway , what 's the music like ? There is not much of a variation as on the last album . Most of the music follows the path set by & quot ; Swastika Eyes & quot ; . Yes , it 's somewhat boring . Well , I guess I can wait for their & quot ; Screamadelica 3 & quot ; ...	-1
I do n't normally give much heed to what the pop music press has to say about either artists or their work , but since I 'd been anticipating Primal Scream 's follow-up to & quot ; Vanishing Point & quot ; ( quite possibly the greatest single recorded work of the 1990 's ) for ages by the time & quot ; XTRMNTR & quot ; finally showed up , I was cautiously optimistic and even a wee bit excited that I band I 'd REALLY grown to appreciate was given such heavy props for their work. & gt ; Well , congratulations to Primal Scream for their raving critical appeal ... but this CD really is n't all that . The best thing about Primal Scream leading up to this release ( with the notable exception of & quot ; Give Out But Do n't Give Up & quot ; ) was that such an incredible diversity of musical sounds , styles , influences , etc . was represented from track-to-track that the listener never had the chance to get bored with what they were hearing ... a more diverse collection of music would n't be found again until the Vines ' debut. & gt ; & quot ; XTRMNTR & quot ; does n't have this problem ; it 's as though Bobby Gillespie and Co. decided that & quot ; Kowalski & quot ; and & quot ; Motorhead & quot ; ( two of my least-favorite tracks from & quot ; Vanishing Point & quot ; ) were the direction the band was to take and recorded every track on & quot ; XTRMNTR & quot ; with the idea of sounding EXACTLY like those tracks . The result is basically an album's-length muddle of electronic noise not unlike listening to a machine gun being fired in your ears over and over again . Where 's the diversity ? Where 's the groove ? Admittedly it 's a great collection of electronic aggression , which might make it a great punk album , but Primal Scream were never a punk band . I mean , if I wanted to listen ro Prodigy I 'd buy their stuff. & gt ; I 'll give it two stars because as far as Primal Scream goes , the only thing they 've ever recorded that I may have thought less of was the aforementioned & quot ; Give Out But Do n't Give Up & quot ; ; if there was ever a Primal Scream CD worth one star or less it 's that one .	-1
They may be superstars now , but these meek losers got their start playing carwash gigs in a Detroit suburb that specializes in cheap subs and dirty mags . Kate Ryan started out as the bassist , but soon gave it up because - surprise , surprise ! - she could n't play . She switched to the drums which she continues to play even worse , and the history of White Stripes began.Not much to say of this album . The bass is too punchy sounding , the vocals are stretched thin , and the drums , well , the drums are just the drums . Do n't believe the hype of this strange 2-group combo - they 're really metal lovers at heart , and only became alternative when it became hip to do so after Headbangers Ball faded into oblivion.Long live r & amp ; r .	-1
Oh how I 've tried . Jack White is supposed to be the reincarnation of ... well , somebody important in music . I 've listened to the White Stripes . I 've listened to his solo stuff . I 've listened to the Raconteurs . I do n't get it . The songs are mediocre and the production is often weak . I know , the rabid fans will come to his defense . There was a guy who wrote a review on the Raconteurs who dissed Brendan Benson while praising White 's efforts . While I agree Benson does n't fit into the Raconteurs , he has more songwriting talent in his little finger than White will ever have . De Stijl may be some people 's cup of tea , but I ca n't in any way see how it could be considered a classic . `` But it 's done with just guitar and bass , man ! ! ! '' ... Yeah . Maybe that 's the problem ...	-1
Another example of the record company realizing they better start recouping some money off Billy since they are n't getting any new product to market from him . This album along with the just as needless Greatest Hits 3 started the flood of rehashing of Billy 's back catalog in the form of Best Of collections and live releases . A needless live release , with very few highlights , thats all . From what I 've heard , Billy 's voice is really doctored up from what he really sounded like that night . 12 Gardens is better if you 're looking for a more recent live Joel release but when it comes to the best of Billy 's live releases , Songs In The Attic is by far the best choice even though its much shorter in length .	-1
For years now , Billy Joel has been threatening to quit rock & amp ; roll and go into a classical career . Judging by the performance on his new double-CD , and to quote the man himself , `` this is the time . '' Recorded live at Madison Square Garden , Joel treated ( or subjected , depending on your point of view ) the hometown crowd to a set of 35 songs -- 24 of which appear on 2000 Years . For all intents and purposes , Billy Joel 's creative peak came in the late 70 's , and with a few exceptions , he 's been fizzling out ever since.There are a few high points on his new album , but most of the time he 's oversinging and turning the songs into a much larger production than is necessary . There are entirely too many musicians/singers onstage for much of the show . Does he really need seven backup singers on `` Big Shot ? '' Of course not . `` The Ballad of Billy the Kid '' ( one of his all-time best songs ) suffers from too many horns.Speaking of the horn section , they sound horribly out of place on just about everything except `` Big Man on Mulberry Street '' -- one of the few high points you 'll find on these two CDs . The only other high points to be found are `` Prelude/Angry Young Man '' and a cover of `` Honky Tonk Women . `` You 're probably wondering about the low points . Well , I wo n't list them all ( we do have space limitations here ) , but here 's a rundown of some of the worst . `` Movin ' Out '' ( ) when it was released in the first place . Did anyone really think it would sound any better now ? Ordinarily `` New York State of Mind '' is a high point in the set . Not here . Sure , he has Rich Cannata come in and reprise his sax solo , but unfortunately Billy feels the need to oversing again -- this time to the point where it sounds like he 's in pain by the end of the song.Joel says before `` I 've Loved These Days '' that it 's the first time he 's played it since 1976 . Maybe if he had n't blown his voice out on the last song , he would n't have had to lower the key to sing it here . Before his overblown rendition of `` Only the Good Die Young , '' Joel tells the crowd `` after this song , you have 15 minutes to have a whiz . '' Very professional , Billy -- especially on the CD . `` I Go to Extremes '' was one of the piano man 's few decent songs of the 80 's . Unfortunately , here it 's marred by a generally lame performance that Joel tries to cover up by oversinging . Are we detecting a pattern here ? The next highpoint is `` Goodnight Saigon . '' This was one of the few tracks ( along with `` Big Man on Mulberry Street '' ) that actually surpassed the original . Enough high points , let 's get back to the low points . `` Auld Lang Syne '' is awful . Someone should 've given Joel a monitor so he 'd be able to tell when he 's offkey . But wait , it gets worse . Up next -- the undisputed low point on the CDs , `` River of Dreams . '' The backup singers hit all the high notes for him ; then all of a sudden , he starts to scream like a wild banshee . He throws in a verse on `` Land of 1000 Dances , '' but even that ca n't save this from being just short of six minutes of pure torture.I could go on , but I 'm sure you 're getting the point . It 's a shame that someone with Joel 's potential has to subject his fans to a third-rate live album like this one . It would 've been better if he had just released an EP with the few good songs on it and called it quits on a positive note . If you want to hear Joel at his best in a live setting , check out Songs in the Attic . It does n't get any better than that .	-1
2 1/2The innovative pair have n't dated as well as good art should , instead sounding more like standard issue techno by now , stretched slightly further from well produced synth-driven melody .	-1
I 've been exploring the output of Scottish pop group Belle and Sebastian chronologically , and their first three albums have held steady and downright obsessive rotation in my listening . But with the fourth album , 2000 's FOLD YOUR HANDS CHILD , YOU WALK LIKE A PEASANT , things get ugly . The first two tracks are very strong . `` I Fought in a War '' is a haunting , poetic love song of sparse lines , an evolution in Stuart Murdoch 's songwriting skills . `` The Model '' is typical of the first three albums , and is a fine display of Murdoch 's sense of ( dirty ) humour.But then comes `` Beyond the Sunrise '' , where Stevie Jackson takes over main vocals and the band plays what sounds like the score to a western film . I wonder how many listeners have done a double take at this , wondering if there were some mixup with the CD or their MP3 playlist . And things never recover from there . The bulk of the songs on FOLD YOUR HANDS CHILD are sung by band members other than Murdoch and bear absolutely no resemblance to the Belle and Sebastian that I fell in love with . Even Murdoch 's own subsequent appearances in `` Do n't Leave the Light on Baby '' and `` Women 's Realm '' sound like an intrusion from another band . Furthermore , as majestic as some of the string arrangements are , it often sounds like the band is playing Fisher-Price instruments.I 'd recommendTigermilk , If You 're Feeling SinisterandBoy With the Arab Strapto anyone looking for solid pop with endless replay value . But I ca n't even get through this album without gritting my teeth and forcing myself to .	-1
I like Belle & amp ; Sebastian in spite of myself . I realize their flaws but at their best ( as on & quot ; Boy With The Arab Strap & quot ; ) they fill a niche that no other band can , and do it with wit and style.Unfortunately almost all of that wit and style are missing here . To sum up , the Stuart Murdoch songs on here are pretty good , if very gloomy ; not his best but certainly not throwaways . The problem with the Murdoch songs is that they sound a lot like Belle & amp ; Sebastian & quot ; doing & quot ; Belle & amp ; Sebastian . That is , there 's a certain amount of self-referential , unintentionally self-parodic stuff going on . The lyrics are not as sharp and witty and in some cases the new songs sound like old ones . & quot ; Nice Day For A Sulk , & quot ; in particular , is simply a rewrite of & quot ; The Boy With The Arab Strap & quot ; slowed down with different lyrics . In short , the Murdoch songs are acceptable but not great.The songs by the other band members , on the other hand , are largely awful . The guy with the groaning , tuneless voice and the labored classical guitar who does & quot ; Beyond the Sunrise & quot ; should immediately take up accountancy , BECAUSE I NEVER WANT TO HEAR HIM SING AGAIN . EVER . The Isobel-sung songs are hampered by her voice , which is frankly quite weak , and & quot ; Family Tree & quot ; is too wispy even to be called twee . It dissolves into inanity before it even reaches your ears . I may be in the minority but I think the band will get along fine without Isobel Campbell.Overall this album is a real disappointment . It 's scattered , unfocused , has at least one truly awful song that never should have been recorded , and even the best material on here is not up to the standards of their earlier work . Do n't make this your first Belle & amp ; Sebastian purchase , and even if you are a fan , give this one a wide pass .	-1
... One thing is for sure , [ B & amp ; S 's ] songwriting skills are morematured now . Their sound also has been modified to a certain extent , which is n't a bad thing at all . However ... This is another hugedisappointment ... I am having a nervous breakdown soon and this ... isonly making my headache worse . The opening track ` I Fought In aWar'sounds ancient , grand , orchestrated and anthemic . It is moving aswell , talking about a solider writing a letter home to hiswoman . After that song , a downward spiral begins , the slightly mutatedversion of old B & amp ; S seems to make a come back , not on formthough . Songs like ` Do n't Leave the Light On ' and ` A Nice SongFor a Sulk ' have nice melodies , ` The Wrong Girl ' is essentiallypop , it is even reminiscient of 60 's sound of early Stereolab withoutthe ` Bleep , Bleep , Bleep ' , retro stuff . However , I am immune to allthose , they simply can not reach the standard of the old B & amp ; S atall . The beauty lies in B & amp ; S music is their youth , their wit asyoungsters as well as their mordant sense of humour . This album mostlyfails to capture the above qualities , so I call this a failure . I wantmy darlings back . I want to be 19 forever , I want Belle & amp ; Sebastianto forever be the cuties whom I adored , all hopes are in vain , Iknow . People move on , but there is a price for that and I know that Idont want to pay the price .	-1
I got this album before anyone else who I know and man I was pleased . The one impression I wound up with from & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; was that Eminem was a talented rapper who needed to release another album before I could form an opinion of him - well , here goes.Eminem has seriously deteriorated from the potential he showed on his first album . On & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; he was an angry young man with reasons to be angry and the ability to rap about it to a decent standrd . On & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; he is an angry young man who seems to be angry at absolutely everything and instead of rapping about it he prefers to shout about it.From what I 've been able to find out , Eminem came to Dre 's attention through his work at the Freestyle Olympics . I mention this because on this album there are several tracks which appear to have been freestyles - at least to begin with . Some parts of & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; Kill You & quot ; I 'm certain started life this way and other parts probably did likewise . These verses - the songs do n't continue their potential - are far and away the best parts of the album.The tracks on this album can be roughly divided into three sections : those which sound good the first couple of times but then get annoying ; those which start off annoying ; and those which simply should never have been put out in the first place.Surprisingly enough , the singles - apart from & quot ; Stan & quot ; - fit into the first category . & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; What I Am & quot ; are great the first few times you hear them , then you hear them all the time and get sick of them ( same goes for tracks like & quot ; Kill You & quot ; and & quot ; Criminal & quot ; ) .The tracks with D-12 or members of it are quite interesting - they generally display the worst side of Eminem ( the side which involves repeated strangled shouts ) , along with the terribly lacklustre rapping of the members of D-12 . They round out the second category.The third category contains tracks like & quot ; Stan & quot ; and & quot ; Kim & quot ; . & quot ; Stan & quot ; 's only redeeming feature is the chorus - and even that is sampled from Dido - the reast of the song is profanity laced and generally repulsive ( even for me , a listener of ICP ) . & quot ; Kim & quot ; is even worse - it borders on industrial music with its lack of melody , beat , rhythm or anything much else.There are moments on this album which are quite interesting . Some of the humor hidden in & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; Criminal & quot ; is quite clever - but it is hardly worth the price of the album to get a few jokes here and there ( there are cheaper ways of getting those songs ) .It seems that either Eminem has discovered the world of fame and pop music or it has discovered him - either way the results are not enjoyable they just turn into another example of boring late-90s rap aimed squarely at youth and the pop charts.After I bought & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; I could n't wait for the next Eminem release . After buying & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; I do n't think I'l be buying anything more from this guy .	-1
Yes . I finally am getting around to reviewing Eminem . This is a hard album to review , and you most likely know why . I wo n't be quoting too many of the lyrics in this review for obvious reasons . [ There is a lot of profanity ] , and there 's all of those violent lyrics all over the place . ... The opening is weak , and not just the pointless `` Public Service Announcement 2000 . '' `` Kill You '' starts out very promising , but soon just drags on and on toward the end , and turns into one of the most obnoxious songs I & # 65533 ; ve ever had the dubious pleasure of hearing . Eminem has some guest stars in `` ... Please II , '' and even then they ca n't save the song from being one of the worst entries on the whole album . I can tolerate sick jokes and stuff , but not `` Ken Kaniff '' or `` Kim . '' Other lesser entries also include `` Amityville '' ( with some awful rhymes opening it up and being repeated on the chorus ) and `` Drug Ballad , '' ( which suffers from a weak beat and an annoying piano in the background ) . Not to mention the whole thing is too long . Hardly any of the music here is worth it , leaving a hell of a lot of ... and filler , most of which I have already mentioned . `` I 'm Back , '' `` The Way I Am , '' and `` The Real Slim Shady '' are a bit better , but they still annoy me . And although I know it & # 65533 ; s not saying a lot , `` Stan '' is the best song on this album . For those of you who do n't know the story , it 's got four verses connected by a catchy female vocal section . The first verse is a man named Stan writing to Eminem in a friendly way , giving the `` biggest fan '' sort of letter , saying how he can releate to the lyrics and wants to be like Slim , and also how he 's been waiting for a letter back . The second verse is Stan 's letter describing his feelings of hatred , frustration , and rejection because he thinks Shady is ignoring him . He mentions how he cuts himself to be like what Eminem makes himself out to be in his songs , and the way he can relate to everything that Slim says , and stating `` everything you say is real . `` In the third verse Stan has gone completely nuts and begins to record a tape for Shady , and gets drunk , drives ninety with his girlfriend in the trunk . He feels that he deserves a response and notes that they could have been something together . He now says that he 's not like his idol , makes some more angry remarks into the tape recorder and drives off the bridge . Eminem starts out the final verse unaware of what Stan has done , responding with a friendly letter , giving an autograph and encouraging Stan to get counseling after hearing that Stan likes to cut his wrists , saying that he was only joking in his songs . He apologizes for missing out on meeting Stan and taking so long to reply . Finally he encourages Stan to keep his relationship with his girlfriend going well , and hopes that the letter reaches Stan before he does something crazy , like this guy he saw on TV who was drunk and drove over a bridge , `` come to think of it his name was ... you . '' What a great song . Certainly not the best lyrics ever , but an interesting story acccompanied by a catchy beat , and those are the two good things hip-hop has to offer done at their best.Eminem has talent as a rapper , but it feels like he wastes his talent on the unnecessarily extreme level of profanity which gets really boring after a while , and the violence and sex just ruins the entertainment of some songs . ... . Pass .	-1
LYRICS GREAT BUT HES GOING POP IS HE GON NA END UP LIKE JA RULE	-1
Yo what up dog . I am just talking like them . Eminem thinks he is tough . I am really scared of a 5'10 150 pound boy who could n't survive one second in the army . Eminem is terrible so do everybody a favor and do not support his & quot ; music. & quot ; And he is a wifebeater . Why would you support a beater ?	-1
Eminem thinks he is such hot ... , but all I can think of when I hear this music is just how crude Eminem is . Pac and all the other great rappers may have talked with crudity , but Eminem brings it to an all-time low . Is it just music ? I think not .	-1
This guy reminds me of a whining little baby crying over spilled milk.I dont feel any sympathy for this guy and I wished hed stop with his mommy issues and seek therapy.This white little punk who pretends to be hard thug wouldnt last a day where im from.If hes so tough , then why does he need an army of security ? As far as the album , the beats are too repetitive and the lyrics are absolute trash.Hes just another commercial puppet like britney spears who will be unheared of in another 2 years.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
Okay , even I 'll admit I like `` Stan '' . Great beats , for one ; creative sample of Dido 's hit `` Thank You '' , and a chilling , fascinating portrait of a possessive , stalking fan . Even if some of it is a bit clunky , and even though the overuse of profanity is annoying , and even though there 's some obnoxious , trite homophobia , I still enjoy the song - but it 's more for the sample and beats than anything Eminem himself does . All right , that 's one song of eighteen . Actually , fourteen if you want to get technical : four of them are idiotic skits . The rest is a joke : either obnoxious , self-centered pandering to the gangsta-rap trends ( `` Kill You '' ; `` Kim '' ; `` Criminal '' ; `` Bitch Please II '' ) or self-centered diatribes against the media and mainstream culture that make constant sneering reference to Em 's record sales , all with awkward pop-culture references that are supposed to pass for humor ( `` Who Knew ? `` ; `` The Way I Am '' ; `` The Real Slim Shady '' - yes , Em , we understand you 're a rare white rapper ; `` Remember Me ? `` ; `` I 'm Back '' ; the acoustic `` Marshal Mathers '' , which I 'm sure is supposed to be `` experimental '' or something ; `` Drug Ballad '' ) with often unimaginative musical backdrops ( `` Amityville '' is the worst offender ; `` Kim '' sounds like a moment from a bad movie soundtrack ) . There are so many guest stars it 's hard to pick Eminem ( whose voice annoys me , I should add ) does n't even appear until the fourth verse of the sexist `` B*tch Please II '' . Em is nauseatingly sexist and homophobic : if it 's supposed to be satirical ( as I believe it is ) , it 's not funny , and if it 's what he really believes he 's got major issues . Either way , this is one of the most overrated , overhyped , over-lauded albums I 've ever heard : just an uber-extended single for `` Stan '' ( which is n't exactly `` The Message '' or anything in the first place ) . Look , I 'm not a huge fan of rap , but I 'll admit there are talented rappers , mainly of the `` Old-school '' variety : anyone who considers Eminem the greatest rapper ever has obviously never heard of Chuck D. I could recommend a huge variety of classic rock , modern rock , jazz , blues , funk and R & B over this , but then I 'd be accused of being a `` musical elitist '' , would n't I ?	-1
On his & quot ; Marshall Mathers LP & quot ; Eminem implores listeners to & quot ; love one another , sister and brother & quot ; and cherish our differences rather than let them lead to hatred and prejudice . & quot ; Do n't need no hate , love is my fate & quot ; he raps in the tender ballad & quot ; Kim & quot ; . He also makes a bold statement in support of gays and lesbians by defiantly rapping & quot ; I 'm Eminem and I 'm here to say , I love you whether you 're straight or gay. & quot ; Other controversial topics Em weighs in on include the environment , euthenasia , capital punishment , affirmative action , the tension in the middle east and racial profiling . Em 's message throughout seems to be & quot ; let 's heal the wounds of the past and work on making the future a little brighter for our children & quot ; . Soldier on , Em !	-1
This guy is talentless . He 's on MTV yet mocks MTV . Hypocrite . He writes songs about himself and how hard his life is/was . Redundant . He writes songs about people that do n't like him/he does n't like . Boring . The songs are stale , the beats are wannabe , and the voice/lyrics are really stupid . Eminem is for kids who do n't know any better . If you are an adult and you own Eminem , shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured , talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each `` song '' . Please throw away your Eminem material . Do n't sell it , just toss it . Thre is NO WAY that Eminem is cool . After a few years pass and the kiddies grow up , this will be ( already is ) an abomination to music collections through time .	-1
First off , let me say I respect Eminem because he truly is a musical genius . He is smart and has definite talent as a rapper . That said , listening to this CD is like watching a horror movie . It 's very depressing and has scary sounding songs . He has two songs ( Kill You and Kim ) that are about killing women , and in Kim the particular woman is his wife . Other songs include Stan , the story of a obsessed fan who writes to Eminem ( Which is the highlight of the album ) , and has a beautifully sung chorus by Dido . The Way I Am is a message to the critics and anti-Eminem population . The Real Slim Shady is just a way to get his various views on life across to his audience . I personally feel his previous CD , The Slim Shady LP , is a much better piece of work because I feel the songs are less angry and easier to listen to . If you like both rock and rap ( i.e . you love Limp Bizkit and you love Dr.Dre ) , most likely you 'll like this CD . I would n't recommend it to somebody who has only heard The Real Slim Shady , as that is really the only radio friendly song on the album .	-1
How do the folks at Interscope sleep at night ?	-1
I just dont understand why people would be supporting this crap . Thanks for ruining rap Feminem , before you we had great minds like Tupac , but now we have hobos and wifebeaters like 50 Cent and Lil Jon . See the difference ? Thought you would . This is nothing more than MTV promoted crap for preteens and wiggers who want to seem cool . Vanilla Ice was bad enough , but at least he used a good beat ( Under Pressure ) ( it was stolen , but it was still better than that gay Real Slim Shady beat ) . Feminem will be forgotten in a few years , and so will this poprap that him , Jay-Z , and P. Diddy created . NWA and Public Enemy stood for something , this stands for nothing besides the glorification of making money without earning it . I mean , who wants to listen to a scrawny wigger complain about his mother , wife , and life in general over and over again ? Only people trying to seem cool ! If Feminem is really the idol of todays youth , then I 'd hate to see the world twenty years down the road ... God ! Eazy E must be spinning in his grave ! Rest in peace Eazy E.Burn in hell Feminem ! Update : 7/27/05 ... I had to say something to that idiot who posted a review above mine . Apparently I dont have a right to my own opinion , thats odd , because I took US history and I blatantly remember one of my rights being FREEDOM OF SPEECH . Now , I dont know if this guy is familiar with the US Constitution , but I 'm guessing he lives in this country ( judging by his numerous mispellings and all ) . I think all that guy is is a 17 year old wigger , so I really should n't right more , he 's probably too stupid to comprehend what I 'm writing . Oh , and if Amazon does n't post this update I 'll be really , really pissed ...	-1

Eminem is Good for a Laugh I 'll Give Him that & amp ; the Dissing was On Point at Certain Artists.The Music & amp ; Production is ALright.but Overall it 's One Big Joke.He is Mainly Around For Shock Value which gets old Pretty fast.I Really Dug The Real Slim Shady but I Do n't really feel the other Tracks .	-1
The Marshall mathers lp has got to be the most overrated album in the history of hip-hop and music , to say that this is better than classics like It takes a nation to hold us back , Ready to die , Illmatic , must be on some kind of acid trip , I Thought every single song was useless , eminem claims he 's anti-pop , yet he has the same fanbase as the backstreet boys & NSync , the real silm shady was a ridiculous song and everything else is just silly . ( with the exception of stan ) This rapper paved the way for so-called hardcore rappers aka Poseurs like 50 who 's making rap look bad then ever.and 50 did n't get shot 9 times , that was just a gimmick , he got shot 3 times.If you want a real good album of 2000 's based on a white rapper look no futher than Bubba Sparxxx 's deliverence.Eminem is not for me , only for pathetic useless stans who only thinks this is a good album.This album is the most overrated album of all time live with it .	-1
I bought this to listen to because i 'd heard that this cd was being hailed as an artistic masterpiecce by a genius , and that the cd was hyped up to almost Godlike proportions . I never want to hear this again . Eminem 's main goal is to deliberately shock by putting in tons of swear words and writing songs about murdering or hurting his girlfriend/wife/ex-wife Kim , whatever she is to him now . The only good track is Stan , because it had a good story to tell . The song where he 's literally screaming his head off at Kim and then strangles her is probably the most hateful piece of junk i 've ever heard . He comes off as a whiny , immature child who has anger management problems and also issues with his Mom . Eminem needs to spend his money on serious time on the psychiatrist 's couch and not on making more cds to torture us with . This cd makes him come off as very self-aborbed . He needs to get on with his life and stop putting out songs where he 's angry at the world , the critics , his mom , Kim , and blaming everyone but himself . And any artist who puts down another artist in a song is very pathetic . What 's even more shocking is the fact that kids under 17 , especially VERY young kids who are probably 6 or 7 , will be listening to this cd and worshipping Eminem . This cd is NOT suitable for anyone under the age of 17 , i do n't care what anyone says . Videos and pop radio stations may be geared at the youth of today , and Eminem may be targeted for a youthful audience due to marketing , but that does n't mean a lot of his material is appropriate for really young kidlets to hear . Of course Eminem would disagree with everything i 've said in this review , but i frankly do n't care . It really disturbs me that kids under ten listen to music with a lot of swearing and disrespectful language and subject material . I seriously hope Eminem is a fad . I really ca n't see him having any long lasting appeal . Just because MTV tells us something is cool to listen to because they shove it down our throats does n't necessarily mean it 's good stuff you 're hearing . This cd is not the stuff we should be awarding tons of Grammy awards to . There are so many more talented artists out there more deserving . Not buying his cds is the smartest thing you can do this year , or any year for that matter . Do n't buy into the hype , people . Use your brain and listen to real music with lasting appeal , not the crap novelty of the moment .	-1
Let 's get one thing straight : I am not an Eminem hater.His rhyming skills are top-notch , his production professional.But his vocal delivery and lyrical depth I find to be lacking [ and I am the target audience , by the way ; I 'm 16 ] . ... ... ..In fact , the rather common subject of anger and helplessness ( felt by one ) does not lend itself well to a full-length disc . ... , or ... perhaps simply a keen awareness of who 's buying the record and what they want to hear.The most accomplished track on this album is indeed `` Stan '' , a haunting tale of a relationship gone awry and the perils of celebrity culture . It works so well , balanced with a sampling of Dido 's `` Thank You '' , and it is a minor classic.But the rest leaves something to be desired . There 's Top 40 pap , like `` The Real Slim Shady '' , which , while it has a wonderful hook , goes nowhere lyrically or musically . Eminem 's nasal voice simply sounds loud and belligerent ... ... and that 's it.It 's interesting to note that Eminem 's album really serves no purpose : if you express anger as an artist , it helps to be constructive with it . Eminem offers no alternative to pessimism , no hope for change.But I 'm not trying to preach . If you feel you 'll be able to relate to his anger ( and , I must admit , listening to this album when you 're depressed does relieve stress ) , or if Eminem 's music speaks to you , then this will prove an excellent buy .	-1
... I reviewed this CD when i used to like Eminem . I like him a little now because he hates all that annoying pop like Britany Spears , *NSYNC , Ricky Martin and he is very honest about it in & quot ; Marshal Mathers. & quot ; But he used to be one of the only rap artists I like because he had some humor in his brain unlike other rappers . His 1st album was so much better . The songs were funny and the pictures inside wer n't very serious . But in this album , you 'll never see him smiling . Hes always sittin ' there frownin . But not only that , but his songs are so depressing . & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; is n't , but the rest of it is . & quot ; Kill You & quot ; is scary and & quot ; The Way I am & quot ; is depressing and & quot ; Kim & quot ; is more scary and more depressing . Infact , & quot ; Kim & quot ; is probably the worst song ever made . If you want an Eminem CD , get & quot ; The Slim Shady LP & quot ; . That CD has hillarious songs on it with funny pictures inside the cover . And that was back in the days when he never got sued and he would n't lash out at people . ... nd you with some of his lyrics , but he 's said mulitple times , he 's just kidding . He doesnt mean everything he says , so dont get uptight about it.The only track on the enitre album I can say that I do n't LOVE , is Amityville . I like it , but not as much as the others . Stand-out tracks are & quot ; Kill You & quot ; , & quot ; The Way I Am & quot ; , & quot ; Kim & quot ; , & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; , & quot ; Criminal & quot ; , and & quot ; Stan & quot ; A lot of humor in this album is related to things mentioned in The Slim Shady Lp , so if you do n't have that either , get it so you can fully enjoy the album.One thing that bothered me was that Eminem 's record label , Interscope , forced Eminem to edit certain things out of the explicit version of the record . Tracks you can find this on are & quot ; I 'm Back & quot ; , & quot ; Kim & quot ; , & quot ; Criminal & quot ; , and & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; .Anyway , to those of you who say that Eminem has no talent , or that he is just a fad , you obviously no nothing about hip-hop or rap . Eminem is here to say , whether you like it or not .	-1
Eminem is the soundtrack for & quot ; The Future Losers of America & quot ; . All of his songs are negative and spiteful and meant to bring out the worst in humanity . & quot ; Stan & quot ; contains lyrics that promote the killing of homosexuals ( well at least that 's the way I interpret & quot ; stabbing a fag or a lez & quot ; means ) . Listen and deteroirate .	-1
Eminem had to struggle in his life , I 'll agree with that after viewing EMtv and other documentaries about him ... and I like that he 's expressing how he feels ... However , this album , in my opinion , was overated terribly . It is a decent album , but the hype surrounding it is trying to make this release seem like it was the best CD ever released in 50 years ... ... The # 1 reason to why I am not supporting eminem anymore is that he is out of ideas ... he 's out of ideas ... .The good tracks on the cd were : & quot ; Stan & quot ; , & quot ; Whoever Knew & quot ; , & quot ; Real Slim Shady & quot ; ( even though everyones sick of it ) , & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; , and & quot ; Kim & quot ; even though that is sadistic and morally no one should like that : - ) but the rest of the cd is self centered topics or just any lyrics slopped together and made into a song ... & quot ; I Am & quot ; , & quot ; B*tch Please part 2 & quot ; , & quot ; Kill You & quot ; , and the rest of the cd ... If eminem joined with Rawkus or another underground label ... he would n't be as popular but he would be a better artist ... ... Eminem is one of the most talented MCs out today . He can rap over practically any beat , speed it up or slow it down , whatever . Listen to this album and you will realize he can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to be together . BUY THIS ALBUM , BUT DONT LET IT BABYSIT YOUR KIDS . nuff said . l realize he can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to be together .

Im sorry , I love Trane and really enjoy live at the viilage vanguard , a love supreme , etc . I like the three Ornette Coleman albums I own . But this is nonsense . An experiment of making noise and see if something interesting happens . Put some little kids in a room with musical instruments and ask them to play as loud as they can and it probably sounds pretty close to this . Maybe that is art for some people , but please , at least listen to the sound clips in amazon before you buy this album , you 'll get the idea .	-1
As much of a fan as I am as John Coltrane , I must say that I found this cd to be rather pointless in its own right . It sounded like a bunch of musicians who are beginners just beating up on instruments . These recordings sounded so vague . It 's like Coltrane was trying to go in a different direction for whatever reason . If anyone out there is a stranger to Mr. Coltrane 's music , I would n't recommend this cd as the one to become familiar with . At All ! `` Love Supreme , My Favorite Things , Giant Steps and Blue Train '' are the one 's to seriously become intimate with . They are serious jazz masterpieces ! Do not purchase this one . In fact , I 'm taking mine 's back to the record store and trading it in for something else a little more worthwhile .	-1
this album is way overrated . I like the first few songs alright and `` Get off '' and that 's about it . `` The Dandy Warhols Come Down '' is a much better record than this . Get that one first ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..	-1
I just do n't understand bands that have sensational released songs and the rest of their album 's unreleased songs are nothing like the released ones either in quality , style or sound . A lot of songs on here seem to have had no effort put into them whatsoever when either writing or performing them.Bohemian Like You is a sensational song , probably the best they 've ever done . It is clever , catchy and one you can sing along to and would also be an excellent live song as well . You can not say the same thing about any one of the other songs on this album . Some of these songs start of great but never seem to find second gear . You 're listening , expecting something great to happen any moment but the song stays in the same first gear introduction format for its duration . Some of these songs even seem to be stuck in a loop repeating exactly the same thing for between three and five minutes . Even the songs which you are into at the start you get sick of halfway through them . The dreaded F word , Filler comes to mind.The Dandy Warhols have had great success with Bohemian Like You from this album , We Used to be Friends from Welcome to the Monkey House and Not if You Were the Last Junkie on Earth from The Dandy Warhols Come Down . Why ? Because they open their mouths in those songs and actually seem like they are interested in singing them . The rest of the songs on here are either mumbled , sung so softly you have to struggle to understand what is being said or are just plain terrible .	-1
Okay , let 's face it : the Music business is changing from to head to toes.Internet downloads -either legal or illegal- are making CDs sales to languish down to earth . In addition , Wall Street 's financial crisis is making people stopping what they used to purchase every month , week -or so . This includes music CDs.But , if in addition , record companies are issuing compilation `` Best Of ... '' and `` ... Greatest Hits '' albums , on which they `` REMASTER '' ( read it again : what they really do is request performers to RECORD BACK ONCE AGAIN ) the original Hit versions , the result is simply DECEPTIVE.This is the case with this Heart 's `` 1985-1995 Greatest Hits '' . The New version of their Hit `` Never '' is so obviously RE-RECORDED , that when I heard it , I just turned off my audio system ant threw away this record.WARNING : Be VERY careful to check out , everytime new `` Best Of ... '' and `` ... Greatest Hits '' new issues go to the market , specially those from classic bands as Heart . In such case , getting the oldest edition of their `` ... Greatest Hits '' or `` Best Of ... '' , if still available ( sometimes you will have to look for a 'Used ' or 'Like New ' sample ) , will guarantee you to get the ORIGINAL version of the songs . Period !	-1
Being a long-time Heart fan , it infuriates me when bands/artists that have been around for awhile ( at least 20 yrs ) churn out these `` Greatest Hits '' collections that only have half of the good songs from said time period with a bunch of fillers . Who decided the song list for this album , please ? ! ? Where are `` There 's the Girl , '' `` Bad Animals '' , `` Secret '' , '' I Love You , '' `` Almost Paradise '' etc. ? ? ? Heart has released at least 3 different 'Greatest Hits ' albums that I know of , none of which include all of their great songs . So many good songs were omitted from this album that I would NOT recommend it to any die-hard Heart fans . Until Heart comes out with a TRULY cumulative box set ( that includes the previously mentioned songs AND `` Sweet Darlin ' '' from the early years ) this consumer & Heart fan will continue to be disappointed & will probably end up buying all of their old albums on CD anyway . : (	-1
Years ago , I went to see The Wedding Present and they were selling t-shirts & quot ; The songs sound all the same. & quot ; Stupid me , I should have gotten a t-shirt . Anyway , I hope Stereolab will talk to The Wedding Present and buy the t-shirts which were n't sold then.I guess from this introduction it is already clear what I have to say about this album . In principle , it 's not a terrible album . It has interesting moments and even a few nice songs . The main problem with this album , however , is that Stereolab did it . Why is this a problem ? Well , first of all , Stereolab did e.g . & quot ; Emperor Tomato Ketchup & quot ; or & quot ; Refried Ectoplasm & quot ; . When I heard those albums for the very first time I was blown away by their sheer beauty . The last three albums they did , however , are really lame compared to the older ones . Which leads to the next point . Second , many of the songs on this album ( as well as on the last two albums ) are just plain boring . The old albums were never boring - even the long songs were interesting . Of course , a band which does the same stuff over and over again will not really stay interesting ( Yeah , you got ta face that if you 're a fan of The Rolling Stones ) .Change is necessary especially if musicians grow . But Stereolab just stopped somehow . For example the singing . On the old albums , the different voices created very nice harmonies and added up very nicely . On this album , it 's & quot ; dabbadabba & quot ; and & quot ; lalala & quot ; and that 's it - over and over again . The music itself is nice but it 's never really catchy . There are a few interesting moments on this album but they never really light the fire . I remember when I listened to the last album I was blown away by the first song - which was Miles Davis on acid - but then the rest was very disappointing . It 's the same here . So please start moving again , Stereolab , and please stop doing boring albums . Ah yes , the second star you get for the first song .	-1
First off , I love Anastacia . She 's got an amazing voice , one that really knocks Jessica Simpson off the block , but unfortunately , this album did n't deliver quite what I expected , or like so much . I was expecting more of an R & amp ; B kinda thing , not to the extreme , but much more than it shows up on this album ; however , some songs that I love are : & quot ; Why 'd you like to me & quot ; , & quot ; Ask of you & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't you wan na & quot ; , and & quot ; Black roses & quot ; . Anastacia is a heartfelt singer , and I 'll be buying her latest LP when I get I paid .	-1
I wanted to like this album sooo badly ! But alas , this is mere product . Whoever gave this horrendus LP the greenlight should be beheaded ! The music is the same tired , commercial , corporate , bland , unimaginative , lifeless [ music ] we 've had crammed down our throats for the last 10-15 years ... this is possibly the worst trash to come down the pop assembly line all year ( along with Alicia Keys ) and truly makes me question the so-called 'taste ' of most consumers . If I were rating on the basis of marketing perhaps I would go higher , but blond hair , good looks and a nice a** in tight clothes just is n't enough for all of us ... Anastacia has a dynamic voice ( the producers of this disaster obviously felt the same since her voice is WAY up in the mix , but no amount of soulful wailing and posturing can compensate for the lazy , amateurish lyrics ( `` Cowboys and Kisses '' ? What ? ) and horrific production . With regret , I must place this on my `` Worst Of 2001 '' list right on top . Too Bad , but the music industry should stop insulting our intelligence and trying to pass off just ANYTHING as good .	-1
I 'm not sure why , but old school Busta Rhymes just does n't interest me . His songs are too chaotic and his lyricism is just uninspired . `` Fire '' and `` The Heist '' are decent tracks , but otherwise , this album is instantly forgettable . Maybe I just ca n't appreciate this style of rapping ...	-1
This Disc is Really not much different then His Other Albums.His Formula does n't really change that much.While He has alot of Energy & amp ; Flow at different times through out his Disc 's Nothing Really Different Comes Ringing Out.for me he spends more time at crafting Songs Geared at Videos than Crafting solid Songs Too Groove to.He Needs too Try Something Different cuz Cuz this has been already done by Him.the Beats are n't Strong all the way.Cool Having Lenny Kravitz but he Should Had that kind of Vibe more so on this Disc.Busta has Talent but he has too Challenge it more so .	-1
Positives : Despite this bad album I still think Busta is a cool rapper . He lacks the former craziness . ODB gets criticized for going crazy , Busta gets criticism for becoming more normal . You ca n't win . There were three tracks I thought were decent on the album . Track 12 - & quot ; The Heist & quot ; with Raekwon and Ghostface . Track 13 - & quot ; A Trip Out of Town & quot ; had good rapping and a fairly good beat . And finally Track 17 has a cool violin part in it and Busta 's fast rapping is tight.Negatives : The bad heavily outweighs the good on Busta 's latest attempt however . I ca n't even begin to single out weak tracks . The choruses are consistently bad . The beats are so weak I have n't even had the heart to see who made them . His release with the kids in the chorus is something that nearly made me cry . I guess nobody told Busta that Jay Z was n't winning any real rap fans over with a kids chorus . My favorite rapper , 2pac , made a song with a kid doing the chorus . To the best of my knowledge he made only one . I could be wrong , but the point is , no really good rap track has ever had little kids singing in it . Leave the kids to sing in Sunday School and make some decent music . A decent attempt from DMX to turn things around near the end of the album ca n't even change my mind . This album is not very good and Busta needs to re-think his style .	-1
Busta bus has had some kick grass CD 's like ELE & Genesis . But this is just average . When I first heard it I thought it was crap , then after a couple listens to , it was aight.All it is really is a bunch of one beat songs with a bunch of fricken cussing ( ... ) It still has it 's good tracks but it seems like busta wanted it to have an a below underground vibe .	-1
This release is still very new so perhaps it just has n't grown on me yet , but I typically judge music on how it makes me feel when I hear it for the first time , and so far this just has n't hit . While far from being a failure , & quot ; Anarchy & quot ; simply does n't hold together as well as past works . So far the only standouts are the child-like sing-songy & quot ; Get Out & quot ; and & quot ; Live It Up & quot ; with superb production by Jay Dee from the Ummah . The iffy quality of this release hardly warrants it 's 75 minute length , and makes me think perhaps it 's time for Bussa Buss to take some time off from acting and dedicate more time to producing top-notch music again , we fans deserve nothing less . O well , maybe next time ... ... .	-1
Initially seduced by the breezy exuberance of Invincible Summer , k.d . lang 's homage to the California sound , I soon grew to dislike the majority of these eleven overdone tracks . Her sense of fun is camp , which elevates two good songs , `` Summerfling '' and `` It 's Happening with You , '' and she lifts up the simple-minded `` Simple '' by the remarkable power of her voice . Yet rarely has a significant gift been squandered regularly on substandard material . ( Call it Whitney Houston disease . ) Lang has n't had a collection of first rate songs since Absolute Torch ` n ' Twang in 1989 . Her ode to joy is weighted by philosophical musing , as evidenced by this quote , courtesy of Camus ( ! ) , that frames the inner sleeve : `` In the depths of winter , I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer . '' `` In this world of lemons , baby , you 're lemonade , '' courtesy of lang herself , is more to the point .	-1
First off , as qualifiers , I am a big fan of Veruca Salt . I am also interested in lots of different female vocalists ranging from 'kill all rock stars ' grungy to highly produced Avril . There is a point in listening to the highly produced stuff when you ask yourself a couple of questions : `` what is unique about this song/album/style '' and for me especially is there any `` catch song '' -- one that stands out on the first listen , that you want to listen to over and over , and holds your interest into the rest of the album . Avril had `` complicated '' , Juliana Hatfield had `` my sister '' , Veruca Salt had `` seether '' . Sometimes these songs are the released singles , sometimes they are not . I listened to this album twice looking for the song . It is not here . Like a previous reviewer , I guess I liked `` badway '' the best , and the album did seem to pick up a bit near the end -- -but not enough to move it over to my ipod . MY general opinion of this is `` produced to the point where there is nothing unique left '' . I paid a penny for this album , so I do n't feel put out . And- I also purchased Nina 's second album ... which at least from my 30 sec listens , I will probably find more to my liking .	-1
... and Veruca Salt , like the Smiths , was clearly one of them IMHO.Another reviewer writes , & quot ; After listening to Tonight And The Rest Of My Life and Veruca Salt 's bitter , very disappointing new album , it 's clear where the real talent in Veruca Salt lied , and it 's a good thing that Nina Gordon left the band when she did. & quot ; I just ca n't agree . True , & quot ; Resolver & quot ; ( the new VS ) is no & quot ; Eight Arms To Hold You , & quot ; but for repeated listening , I 'll still take its finer moments ( like & quot ; Disconnected , & quot ; Louise Page 's whisper-to-a-scream sendoff to Dave Grohl ) over anything on & quot ; TatRoML. & quot ; Gordon makes a play here for Aimee Mann 's crown , but she does n't have as much to say as Mann , and Bob Rock 's glossy production and the guaranteed-safe guitars help to mute most of the originality that remains.Considering & quot ; Eight Arms to Hold You & quot ; in retrospect , it 's clear that Louise Page and Nina Gordon were moving in different directions . For one brief , shining moment , the tension between their styles and outlooks drew the best from both of them . It did n't last , and perhaps it could n't have . I 'll continue to follow both artists , and hope that someday one or both of them will offer me more than watered-down echoes of the past .	-1
Not bad . If you liked VERUCA , you 'll like this release from ex-frontwoman GORDON . The music is great and GORDON 's voice is absolutely cool , as is the way she builds her hooks . Her musical stylings are reminiscent of KEN ANDREWS ( YEAR OF THE RABBIT ) . Her biggest flaw lies in the lyrics department . Her words are really lacking the substance her voice can manage . It 's a shame , if she could 've written some strong lyrics this release would be a lot better .	-1
I bought this album only because of how much everyone talks about how good this band is . Wow were they wrong . When I first listened to this CD after I bought it , the first thing I thought was that I had heard this before . This CD sounds , sadly like a half-and-half mix of KoRn and Limp Bizkit . Just think old Limp Bizkit guitars with less punch , with Jon Davis ' whiny , nasal vocals and horrible lyrics , with a rhythmic verse . It 's really not that hard . This is just another rap-metal album in a long line of mediocrity .	-1
well , this cd was kind of a disappointment . wait ... scratch & quot ; kind of & quot ; eplace that with & quot ; massive overhaul & quot ; . This is so much worse than welcome . it 's not surprising the group threw this album together in about 5 months . the vocals are sloppy , the guitar is n't nearly up to par , and all the ongs sound the same : whiny and obnoxious . a couple songs are tolerable , but i 'd spring for welcome before considering this .	-1
i saw this band live with deftones and incubus . incubus put on a great show even though i do n't particularily care for them . deftones tend to have a habit of sucking whenever they go on live . they just sound better on cd . that should n't happen . as for taproot , they sounded horrible . the only way i could tell what single they were playing was because i could hear the weird techno stuff , which they could n't possibly screw up because it was all samples . the guitars just sounded like a wall of static , the singer was hard to hear . you had to work to tell the guitars and the singer apart . the drums were hearable and ok but just ok. there are way better drummers out there , specifically Primus . even if you do n't like Primus you have to admit that they 're good at what they do and you ca n't get hacks like papa roach to recreate their sound . if you disagree with that statement , your opinion on anything is invalid . sorry . in that case , you 're parents probably grew you up on crap like AC/DC and Judas Priest so your taste in music is considerably dull . so yeah , i have n't heard the album , and i 'm hoping it 's better there . but i probably still wo n't like it much cuz i 'm tired of that kind of music . but i suppose you should buy this if you like deftones because the singer does have a decent voice , judging from the singles i 've heard .	-1
... I do n't understand how anyone could like these guys . I really gave this an honest try , even tried to let it grow on me . No way ! This is just NOISE . It 's kind of like SPINAL TAP meets KORN . It just plain ol ' stinks .	-1
Ok , I 'll admit that I bought into the hype generated by the music scene in MI . Already familiar with early demos recorded by the band ( very Limp Bizkit-esque , at least they got away from that ) , I bought this CD the day it came out and was seriously disappointed . Why , do you ask ? First of all , the music is very derivative of bands like Deftones and Glassjaw . But , with the guitarist 's solid riffs , that is excusable to a certain point . If only Taproot had a different singer , they could still be a pretty good band . However , the real downfall is their HORRIBLY OBNOXIOUS vocalist . The vocals incessantly grate throughout almost every song - Incredibly whiny and incredibly boring . The uninspired vocal performance bleated over the majority of the songs is simply laughable . After saying all of that , I will admit that 'I , ' 'Smile , ' and 'Again & Again ' are good songs . However , three tracks are hardly enough to revive a lifeless album .	-1
This compilation here is a not-very-imaginative rehash of previously released material . The reason I gave it one star is not cause it [ 's bad ] , but because ALL of the songs here one can get in more attractive/comprehensive packages , such as : `` Getz/Gilberto '' ( a masterpiece ) , `` Composer of Desafinado Plays '' ( a cool record ) or `` The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook '' compilation from Verve , which is really cool . So there ! If you are really interested in Antonio Brasileiro , skip this one and go for the real deal .	-1
The only Jets to Brazil album to buy is `` orange rhyming dictionary '' ; that album is fresh , alive , thought provoking ... .this album is cute , stale , pop that has no direction.How people could of compared it to `` beatle-ism '' is beyond my reasoning.The band will break up soon due to its stale crooning..better so maybe he could get his soul and edge back .	-1
Well I loved Eric Clapton 's Blues Breakers album , I thought Jeff Beck 's & quot ; Blow By Blow & quot ; showed genius and I had heard that this album was a raw early classic . Even with Rod Stewart on vocals I did n't think this album was very special at all . Green Sleeves and Old Man River -- come on ! Disappointing ( sorry -- but he did call it Truth after all ) : ( .	-1
My introduction to the Corrs was a live show with Bono which I enjoyed . I happened on this CD and took a chance . I think I must have seen a different band . I guess that despite their known dislike of Americans , they decided to go top 40 to cash in . If not for the pauses on the CD , you might have a problem distinguishing one song from the other . Nothing clever , interesting , original , or worthwhile . Truly a waste of money .	-1
Wow ! ! Long time ago , the Corrs was the best thing to come out of Ireland since U2 . But then enters Mutt Lange , who tries to turn these beautiful Irish people into Americans with this weak offering . Stick with their older material . Trust me ! ! !	-1
The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop , but on this album , I feel that they have lost their way a little . Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners ' , but this album is just average , at best . There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World ' , 'Radio ' and 'Breathless ' but apart from these , nothing else really rises to the challenge . Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others .	-1
This is recycled trash . This is old stuff they recorded on homemade equipment and slapped onto cassette tapes . It has no place in the real music industry . If they 're gon na sell such poor material , they should drop the price ... because production this sloppy is n't worth [ the money ] .	-1
Nowadays if you have alittle Groove with a Touch of Jazz you have Talent ? I still Stick To Sade.But Jill Scott ai n't even Anita Baker.this is 2nd tier Mary J.Bliege , Erika Badu Letovers.how many tracks have that click clack sound that the Roots Questlove & amp ; D'Angelo use ? I heard her on The Roots & amp ; on The WIld , WIld West Soundtrack & amp ; she was just Like Faith Evans a Mary J.Bliege Clone.this is Why R-N-B is in The Toliet Now , No Challenges.Jill Scott Needs To WOrking WIth PRINCE or SOmebody that has Real Talent instead of the same old Tip/Tap.She is a Good Writter.but the Music is Boring & amp ; Predictable.this is n't the Philly Era of Gamble & amp ; Huff.when Philly use to Rock.Jill Scott is Closer To Deborah Cox or TOni Braxton ( Boring Predictable Music ) than Sade .	-1
I should like this album more than I do because of it 's originality . It 's a mixture of street poetry and hip-hop and she has a fine voice but it just does n't do it for me . I 'll stick with Patti Smith or Lauren Hill .	-1
I do n't know what CD you simple-minded people out there are listening to , but I ca n't believe the undeserved praise you are heaping on this woman ! This album is just ( as the title says ) a bunch of random `` Words and Sounds '' thrown together with no regard for thematic unity , cohesiveness , originality or depth . Granted , Ms. Scott may possess some talent ( though I ca n't imagine what it is ) but whatever gifts she was given are squandered on this pretentious mess . I suppose if I lived in the Ghetto , sat around spouting pointless `` poetry '' and only wrote songs about 'me ' , 'my woman ' , 'I 'm fine ' , 'the rain ' , 'the way my woman loves me ' , ( and what exactly is `` Honey Molasses '' ? are n't they pretty much the same thing ? And what does that have to do with the content of the song ? ) , I 'd enjoy this more . The self congratulatory tone of the lyrics , as I 've mentioned before are a mess , touting spirituality one moment , then threatening to 'take you out in the street and whup your tail ' the next . And for goodness sake , can we please cease with the terrible little cymbal taps and repetitive , mindless drum tracks on EVERY song and then calling it 'jazzy ' , it 's not ! How about , oh I do n't know , SOME ORIGINALITY ! If this is all it takes to become a million-selling , Grammy Nominated superstar , then I want Hidden Beach to give me a record deal now . Wake up people , this is not real music , it 's mere product and you 're all being played for fools . I guess the old saying holds true : Ignorance Is Bliss .	-1
With the great eruption of Morcheeba into the realms of fame has unfortunately brought with it a desire to become a popular chart band . Becoming a popular chart band ( singles band ) means producing music that is palitable to the easy listener who will get a short but quick hit from a top ten single then probably forget about the song and move on to the next number one . If this is the aim of Morcheeba then they have done well for themselves because most of the songs on Fragments of Freedom are hits in themselves ( Rome Was n't Built In A Day ) , lovely easy listening , joyful , bouncy and easy to sing along to . I must admit that their songs will cheer you up however that is as far as it goes.On personal opinion I have given them 2 stars because this is n't the sort of music I am looking for however if I were rating the album on merit such as breadth , quality of the recording etc then this album does deserve 4 stars . The quality of the recording is excellent and will make any cheap stereo sound good , it is crisp and clear . Skye 's voice is brilliant for the Godfrey brothers ' music ( five stars there ) ! They also use a large variety of instruments , which makes each song have a different sound and thus makes the album a little bit more interesting . Another point I would like to draw attention to is that Morcheeba manage to make each song progress and change through out making it a slightly captivating album.So there you have it , with Big Calm as Morcheeba 's best album ( a lot more deeper and meaningful ) Fragments of Freedom has had a lot to live up to . Buy Fragments of Freedom if you want an easy listening album , it is well made and straight to the point .	-1
Firstly I have to say I am a big Morcheeba fan.I loved the first two albums and was really looking forward to this one after the amazing 'Big Calm'.And I have to say what a terrible dissappointment this c.d . 'Fragments of Freedom ' is . The c.d . starts off nicely with an excellent , smooth , opener-'World Looking In ' , which is as good as any of their other songs.Then it starts to go downhill with the 2nd song and the first single 'Rome Was n't Built In A Day ' ( but this c.d . was probably written in one ! ) .The lyrics on this track are the daftest I 've heard in a long while-e.g . 'One Fine day , we 'll fly away , do n't you know Rome was n't built in a day , Hey , Hey , Hey ' -ingenious ( It 's a real case of 'how do we finish this silly chorus ' ? ) The next 2 tracks are o.k.Trade mark slow paced grooves with a nice mixture of acoustic , electric guitars and on track 4 a nice brass section.Then we have track 5 a dreadful steel drum instrumental which starts off with a dialogue about Florida being hot and violent place . Track 6 takes a sample from Grandmaster Flash-'The Message'-it 's not a bad song.Then we have some dreadful songs featuring some weak rap artists-these songs are neither funky or catchy . 'Shallow End ' is my 2nd favourite song on the c.d . and it has an excellent disco riff , so currently in vogue.The remaining songs sound like b-side rejects , with nothing particularly good about them . I hope this c.d . is just a temporary abberation for Morcheeba and hopefully the next c.d . will be a big improvement.One final thing is I suppose groups should be admired for trying something new and this c.d . certainly sounds like a group experimenting with a newish sound-but in my opinion they just do n't carry it off very well .	-1
To my ears , the problem with `` Fragments '' is n't that Morcheeba is trying something new , the problem is that this effort fails so miserably at it . I like retro-funk-disco as much as anyone ; I grew up with it , as a matter of fact ( listen to Chris Joss or an Ursulla 1000 mix CD to see how much fun this genre can be ) . But this makes KC and the Sunshine Band sound inspired . It 's not happy , it 's not interesting rhythmically , and the melodies are about as memorable as a tone row in one of Arnold Schoenberg 's later twelve tone compositions . Unlike most reviewers here , In my opionion WCYT and Big Calm are not all THAT great compared to the real classics of Trip Hop and Downtempo music ( i.e Mezzanine and Mirror Conspiracy ) , but this is one of the blandest , most forgettable things I 've had the misfortune to purchase in years . Maybe if it was entitled `` music to wash dishes by '' -- its not overtly offensive like , for example , the new Brazilian Girls disc . But as a `` major '' work , by a `` major '' artist , forget it .	-1
Yet I can add another name to the list of Pop Music sell outs . I baught this cd expecting Morcheeba to continue there ground breaking trip-hop cd 's such as Big Calm and Who Can You Trust ? But Fragments of Freedom seem to be just a cheap rip off of Mary J. Blige or Kelly Price . I think this CD is a dissapointment , the lyrics are terribly written and the music seems to sound like any 70 's disco song . I urge all Morcheeba fans to not buy this and save there money !	-1
Wow ! So very disappointing . I understand and respect an artist 's right and need to explore new avenues of expression , and , as a Photek fan I realize that he could n't go too much farther with the minimalist drum and bass he 'd become known for . However , I think this record mostly falls flat . First of , the two old-school house tracks are terrible . Are n't there enough crappy house tracks out there ? The rest of the tracks retain elements of Photek 's dark and intricate sound , and in my opinion there is about a 50/50 sucess/failure rate . Nothing is as awful as the two house songs , but all in all , i think i 'll stick with & quot ; Modus Operandi & quot ; and & quot ; Form and Function. & quot ; I 'd try to listen to some of this before you run out and buy it , because it 's a big step in a different direction , and if you 're expecting & quot ; Modus Operandi & quot ; , you 're going to be disappointed .	-1
This stuff trys way too hard and it stinks . hey lets sound quirky ! ok. Hey lets sound like built to spilly ! ok. man were rock visionaries ! yeah we are . From what I understand they are from Norman ok , and just for that there credebility should be placed under inspection .	-1
I picked this up second hand a couple of weeks ago and I would have been happier to leave it behind . This sounds like a album that producers decided to off load there average beats to , to cash in on some extra doe . Now I dont look at raps as being the issue on rap albums as the raps should only be taken in as an over throw to the beats . The west coast is all about the groove of the music and the rappers slicking there rhymes over the top in mesmeration to these beats . How any of the rappers that feature on this album does this beats me or are they like the producers just cashing in . The good tracks as few as they are on this arnt even that worth repetitive listens . Sorry Bad Azz but if your style incourages beats like this then your crossed off my list .	-1
Im not feelin this album . I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers , , , I thought his & quot ; word on the streetz & quot ; album was good , , , , but I just dont feel this album . In my opinion the best song is & quot ; wrong idea & quot ; which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg , and it isnt a real great track ... .. so that doesnt say a lot for this album	-1
Sea & amp ; Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past , but there is only one good song on this album , and & quot ; Afternoon Speaker & quot ; is it . It even gets a bit monotonous , but at least it 's perky and interesting . Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep .	-1
Suprised with all the positive reviews for this album , since this is one of Too Short 's weaker albums . There are a few enjoyable tracks here , but nothing to write home about . `` Shorty the Pimp '' and `` Get in where you fit in '' are so much stronger , that this I wouldnt bother with this one .	-1
I have been a fan of R. Kelly for a long time and when I heard that TP-2 was coming out , I could not wait , especially after hearing the remarkable & quot ; I Wish & quot ; and & quot ; To the Homies That We Lost & quot ; . At first it seemed like this was going to be a great album with the interesting arrangement of & quot ; Strip For You & quot ; , but I was dissapointed by the next five tracks since they were quite mediocre and overly repetitious . Many critics have said the R. Kelly is a little repetitive , but I never really agreed until hearing these songs . & quot ; Fiesta was nice & quot ; , the guitar a little remeniscent of & quot ; Did You Ever Think & quot ; for & quot ; R & quot ; . & quot ; The Real R. Kelly & quot ; was funny at first but not enough to save the somewhat boring & quot ; One Me & quot ; . At last we came to a nice stretch & quot ; I Wish & quot ; , & quot ; I Decided & quot ; , & quot ; To The Homies That We Lost & quot ; , & quot ; All I Really Want & quot ; , & quot ; Feelin ' On Yo Booty & quot ; and & quot ; The Storm Is Over & quot ; . Sadly these tracks are still not enough to save this album . Even the photography of a more thuggish-looking R. Kelly were no way as good as the classy material used in the & quot ; R & quot ; liner notes . On another note , I read recently a review by someone saying that R Kelly 's on a downward spiral into thuggery . I feel that R always had that thug persona bubbling at the surface and I feel that it should not interfere with his music , but if I discovered that it is the cause of this mediocre album , I would be most disappointed.Honestly , I would recommend that you do NOT buy this album and instead invest in & quot ; R & quot ; . It has a much better mix and of a higher class . & quot ; R & quot ; is still one of my favourite albums after many years of listening . If you really like the singles such as I Wish and Feelin ' On Yo Booty ( really good remix ) purchase them instead and ignore this album . That may give R the message that he should rethink his strategy .	-1
What has happened to R.Kelly ? Too many collaborations with guest rappers , perhaps ? How tiring it is to see yet ANOTHER young talent waste it on singing nothing but soft porn dressed up and masquerading as & quot ; sensitive & quot ; love songs.This album is a far cry from his second , which although had switched focus from the bedroom to the dance floor , at least contained some innovative future funk , and slinky friday night beats.While by now we are all familiar with Kelly 's over-the-top , self-indulgent style , his last two albums have gone far even by his standars - this album seems to want to go in 10 directions all at once with no clear focus . One second he talks of bit**es and h* 's , and in the next breath they become his ladies . One minute he 's a shy boy calling mama for direction in life , and the next he 's a thug who 's only concern is a & quot ; bling , bling & quot ; lifestyle.Kelly gets two stars only because of his showing his potential in earlier works , and his excellent work as a producer . But please , Kelly , stop throwing & quot ; hundreds up for grabs & quot ; and use the money to buy yourself a songwriter : )	-1
Another bad album by the Pete Townsend of R & amp ; B . If you love R & amp ; B , then you 'll probably dig this ... but for me , R & amp ; B has no place in my album collection , especially an R & amp ; B album by a child molester . I gave him 2 stars cuz he 's a good singer .	-1
This was typical of what happens when a talented young artist gives up ! The songs are all fluff with no substance . He just talks about getting some ( Wow what a new concept ) This was pure cookie cutter Music . Shame on you Kelly	-1
R Kelly it seems has gone from a super producer and good singer to an arrogant , wan na be thug . This guy really trips me out . He sings a song about feeling on a girl 's butt . How immature is that ? 12 play , although very sensual ... Was good . To see him regress like this is pretty ... ! To see all of these garbage collaborations with whack hip-hoppers like Jay Z is equally ... . ! This guy has not evolved , but has dissolved . A once good singer has completely done a 180 !	-1
YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DO N'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE .	-1
... I liked & quot ; 12 Play & quot ; , but since then Kelly 's gone down hill , his sound is radio saturated , he needs have a different sound or something else ... maybe a different producer , some other songwriters or sompin ' -- I ai n't kidding either . Maybe a trip to Kathmandu or Tibet will help . I thought that the single was alright , but this leaves a lot to be desired especially that Cheesy & quot ; Strip for You & quot ; . Pul-leeze . Just buy a replacement & quot ; 12-Play & quot ; CD ...	-1
Juliana Theory is not a bad band . & quot ; Emotion is Dead & quot ; , is , however , a horrible record that sounds as though it was targeted to pre-teen girls . I 'm guessing that this was an attempt to get famous , which the band most likely regrets ; because I recently read on the Tooth and Nail website that the band themself ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN . Again , they said that . Hopefully they will return to the days of & quot ; Understand this Is A Dream & quot ; on their next release .	-1
Hard hitting and over the top emotional punk rock with flailing guitars , tight drumming and impassioned ( screamed ) vocals should be alright should n't it ? I mean obvious Fugazi worship aside , ATDI 's sound is one I should like 'cause in general I like aggressive , emotional music . But I do n't for several reasons . If you 're going to invest that much angst in your music , project that much power , perhaps you should have something to say . ATDI have nothing to say , at least nothing I can discern in these high-school journal keeper swamp of lyrical pretentions . Compared to these guys Yes are as clear as an unmuddied lake , as an azure sky of deepest summer . So that makes all the impact their music and delivery dissolve into an exercise in emotion for emotion 's sake . Which could be interesting ( see Yes reference above ) if the music were of an outstanding character , but ATDI keep up the same formula for every song ( almost ) and the lack of sonic variety coupled with Cedrics screaming just makes for a grating musical experience . After about the third song I started to get annoyed with the overblown silliness of it all . All that angst and not a damn thing to say = tiresome.Here 's some lyrics from Non-zero Possibility ( whatever that is ) I 'm just tired of counting bodiesis this mausoleum tardylet 's just paint you a pretty faceflies dip tongues into tear ductsin toothpicks fought unborncontusion is hungrythey still eat their youngproto-culture null and voidall veins in highway lapsthis breath collapsed againthis hex was delivered spentorchestra influenzadrawn and quartered petsit dwells and growsSara Palin at her worst makes more sense .	-1
I did n't care for this at all . Noisy and scattered . Did n't do anything for me .	-1
Back in 2000 I made my brother buy me this album and ever since I have regretted making him get it for me.Limp bizkit is a good instrumental band but their weak link is FRED DURST.If they took him out and replaced him some guy who won a reality show kind of like the INXS show they could get a more talented singer , better song writer and overall a more respectable person and human being.The only thing I got out of this album was the crystal casing for another album.If any band or even one man you can find for hurting nu metal is here , The songs are dumb and sound like a retarded person wrote but i believe amentally challenged person could have written a better song song than him , in fact I have met people with dissabilities that could write a song that could chastize them in public.I hope that after this some stations he in California could stop playing their songs and play way better nu metal fans than these has beens .	-1
3 Dollar Bill Y'all : Well put together music , bad lyrics . Significant Other : Poor music ability , great lyrics . Can Limp Bizkit get it right ? I was hoping so . Instead , on their third studio album , LB serve up mostly songs made for parties.There are a few gems on here like & quot ; Take a Look Around & quot ; and & quot ; Hold On & quot ; but what was Fred thinking when he wrote & quot ; My Generation ? & quot ; It seems to me that Fred is trying to please his & quot ; hardcore & quot ; fans again by pretending he 's a badass and saying the & quot ; F & quot ; word as many times as possible . He even rips on NIN on the song & quot ; Hot Dog & quot ; which is a pretty stupid thing to do , and just shows Fred 's immaturity . Just about every lyric in here was written in probably about a half hour 's time . Fred needs to just sit down and actually write a whole song , instead of making referrals to his bands name and how many records he has sold . The music on here is very simple . Wes ' guitar continues his singature & quot ; fart & quot ; sound and John Otto 's drumming is as simple as a baboon banging on a tree hoping for coconuts to fall down . I 'm not saying Limp sold out , but they definetly got lost somewhere in the mix.If you want some better music listen to Limp 's friends that take time on their lyrics and music ( i.e . Korn , Cold , Staind , etc . ) I would highly suggest staying away from this CD , instead get the first two , they may not be perfect , but compared to this they are classics .	-1
Limp Bizket is worthless and nothing good to listen to . My ears bleed whenever I hear it . Its terrible , and its just a younger version of Linkin Park..but mostly RAP..Its garbage ... .Its pure stupid .	-1
When I first bought this album , I thought it would be a new type of food product . I thought it was going to be a pack of chocolatate starfish with some hot dog flavored water to wash it down . Well , I was slightly dissapointed because I did n't get what I wanted . I mean , Limp Bizkits '3 Doller Bill Y'all and Significant Other ' were better than this ! For some reason though , I did n't confuse those albums with food products . Maybe it was because they had way better name for the titles of their albums . I mean , why kinda name is Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water ? ! Limp Bizkit shouldent confuse us like that ! This album is kind of boring too . Theres not many good songs here . Even some songs that are supposed to be serious ( like & quot ; Boiler & quot ; ) have some silly lyrics like & quot ; No eating no sleeping just giving into you and i 'm dumb & quot ; . Why are you gon na starve yourself out , Fred , when you can eat chocolate starfish and drink hotdog flavored water ? I just do n't undertstand . My favorite song on this album is 'Hold On ' . This was very dissapointing . Buyers beware : this product might not be what your looking for . Get it expecting a not so great Limp Bizkit album . Do n't get it looking for chocolate starfish and hot dog flavored water . Hey , at least I know why they do n't sell it in super markets ...	-1
Limp Bizkit 's ridiculously titled & quot ; Chocolate Starfish & amp ; Hot Dog Flavored Water & quot ; is exactly what it calls itself : a piece of a chocolate starfish that has puckered itself too tightly . The album 's overall performance , which remains extremely inferior to their sophomore release & quot ; Significant Other & quot ; , is disappointing and seems to be driven by their immense success of their previous album -- while completely ignoring the quality of the music. & quot ; Hot Dog & quot ; , an awful rip of Nine Inch Nail 's & quot ; Closer & quot ; , is an opening track that praises their own band 's success while trying to sound hard at the same time . Bragging about the amount of f**ks they use during the song along with an outlandish sense of trying to sound comprehensible deteriorates Limp Bizkit 's original image of being unique.Other tracks including & quot ; Full Nelson & quot ; and & quot ; Boiler Room & quot ; just shows that the band threw together what they could as quickly as possible -- leaving most fans slightly annoyed with the band 's new make-up . While & quot ; Rollin ' & quot ; is both catchy and entertaining , the rest of the album seems like egotistical rambling that becomes just plain annoying by the fourth track.Limp Bizkit , brilliant in their & quot ; Significant Other & quot ; album , has released a weak and boring album that , unfortunately , does not catch the essence that Limp Bizkit had on their previous albums : a band that successfully combines rap with hard rock .	-1
PICK YOUR EAR CHANCES ARE THAT LITTLE PIECE OF EAR WAX HAS MORE TALENT THAN LIMP ( POST 3DOLLABILLYALL )	-1
I love this album . It 's so ultra heavy , and I know that I 'm really alternative because I listen to it . The lyrics are great , the guitar parts are so hard to play , and my God the vocals ! Fred Durst is an absolute genius.A modern masterpiece . Great stuff.Almost as great as sarcasm .	-1
When the history of post-Nirvana rock is written , Chocolate Starfish will probably have a worse reputation than it deserves . I say this because it was n't until after Limp Bizkit put out this album that I really noticed any comparisons of nu-metal to 80 's hair metal . After seeing the heights Limp Bizkit was capable of in Significant Other , watching them crash with this one is all the more painful.What is wrong with this album ? In a word , filler . I do n't mind filler on albums , as long as it does n't distract the listener from the good stuff . The filler on Starfish , however , is either bad , or entertaining in its badness ( like an Ed Wood film ) . It sounds as though Durst realizes his conflict with his ex-girlfriend has finished , but he 's still angry . Probably the biggest mistake is starting out with `` Hot Dog '' , Mr. Durst 's ode to his favorite four-letter word . I might have been able to forgive this , had it not been for the track that immediately follows . I did n't expect `` My Generation '' to have any connection to my favorite song by The Who , but when Durst launched into the chorus with a cheap imitation of Roger Daltrey 's stutter , I became so incensed that the rest of the album , was , for a intents and purposes , ruined for me.Although there are some reasonably good singles ( `` Boiler , '' `` My Way '' ) , the bad tracks make this purchase questionable for anyone who is n't already a Limp fan .	-1
I bought this album the day it came out ... Everyone has to admit that `` Rollin '' is catchy as heck , and it is a fun listen even though like all radio hits , it tends to get old . Really though , if you like heavy music `` Full Nelson '' is not a bad song at all . `` Boiler '' and `` The One '' are both good emotion driven songs ... .this CD is not all bad , and if you can get a bargin for it somehow buy it for those three songs .	-1
I must admit that I did like Three Dollar Bill somewhat and Significant Other did have it 's high points . Chocolate Starfish is a horrible example of what rap/metal has become . There is no high point either lyrically or musically on Chocolate Starfish- this album is just plain NOISE ! ! ! I 'd rather smell someone 's foot odor all day than be subjected to this trash again ! !	-1
The title says it all . I 've been toying with the idea of reviewing this album for a while now , and after hearing it being overplayed on the radio for so long , I could n't wait any longer . First off , I do n't subscribe to the idea that Limp Bizkit has sold out or that they never have made anything worth listening to on their now three releases . I LOVED 'Significant Other ' , and the raw energy and hunger on 'Three Dollar Bill Y'all $ ' was pretty inspiring . However , 'Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water ' does absolutley NOTHING to squash the feelings in music fans ' minds that Fred Durst is a totally empty songwriter . It seemed that every songs lyrics seemed to say nothing more than & quot ; Limp Bizkit in the house ! & quot ; Whoa , I 'm impressed . I could have wrote better lyrics using a word list from a third grade spelling bee . And , do you remember when his voice roared on the first two albums ? On here it sounds like the rest of the band was pinching his nipples while he recorded his vocals . I listened to this CD a few days after its release , and my feelings then are still the same : I knew this album would make Limp Bizkit more successful commercially , and that both the album and tour would be bigger than the last , but this is STILL an artistic dissapointment . And please Fred Durst , STOP TRYING TO RAP ! ! You 're horrible at it ! ! If I wanted to hear rap , I 'd put on Ja Rule 's album . I 'm so glad I did n't succumb to the hype surrounding this album by purchasing it . Come on guys , I KNOW you can rock , so just do it , and stop wasting the fans ' money , time and insulting our intelligence with tripe like 'Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water ' .	-1
Look i loved limp bizkit but when was that , like when i was 9 , oh well any way limp bizkit have lost their touch like sparkart said but not only that , they are very untalented , i mean who thinks fred durst is cool when he tries to beat the records of the most swear words in a song like hot dog , any way its pretty pathetic that fred durst has to hide his poor song writing with the f words , and look young fans of limp bizkit are gon na know fred is a phony one day once they realise he is not hardcore and its not cool to swear all the time . Look i do n't mind a bit of swearing but when its like too much swearing then no i do n't like it , and just too prove to you kids that im not a phony who just bags out a band without listening to it , heres a discription and a rating , plus i 'll even say how long each track goes for , and yes i do own it.1.INTRO : a boring intro with just electronicy space music . 1:182.HOT DOG : oh dear , yes this is the song with 46-48 f words . Poor lyrics as well , this song is mainly just a rhyme with f words in it . 3:50 0/103.MY GENERATION : ahh this is one of limp bizkits good songs , decent guitar riffs , nice bridge in the middle when he says you take the blame . This is one of freds best songs on the album . Though it gets very old . 3:41 8/104.FULL NELSON : a crap song with fred just repeating you 'll get knocked the f**k out . This is the heaviest song but its horrible . 4:07 2/105.MY WAY : i like this song , its slower than most of limp bizkits stuff . This song starts out with some wierd voice saying check , check out , the melody . Not bad . But it was over played and sadly limp bizkits songs do get old fast . 4:23 7/106.ROLLIN ' : a horrible song . Its way to catchy , repetitive , and the song writing is awful . Starts out with fred saying allright partner you know what time it is , keep on rollin baby . 3:34 3/107.LIVIN IT UP : its below average , he swears a bit too much for stupid reasons . Any way starts out with a wierd voice saying life in the fast lane , and then fred raps about pointless stuff . 4:24 4/108.THE ONE : this song is very boring , the lyrics are better atleast but its to boring and slow and he has such an annoying voice , starts out with im dead from all the loneliness and the chorus is this could be the one . 3:42 3/109.GETCHA GROOVE ON : too much swearing for pointless reasons , and i do n't like xzibit whos featured in this song . Starts out with xzibit sayin millenium ... . 4:29 2/1010.TAKE A LOOK AROUND : ok song , starts out with fred saying all the tensions in the world today , all the little girls fillin up the world today and then in the chorus you hear him say i know why you wan na hate me . At least there is not as many swear words but its still a not so good song . 5:18 5/1011.IT 'LL BE OK : a boring song talking about leaving a girl friend . Gets old very quickly you see after a couple of listen s of the album you get sick of it . 5:06 4/1012.BOILER : Not bad , in fact i like it a bit , because he is actually expressing his anger and when he swears he swears for a reason . Another song talking about a relationship . Check out the video clip . 5:47 7/1013.HOLD ON : the slowest song on the album , horrible , he ca n't sing . 5:47 1/1014.ROLLIN ' ( urban assault vehicle ) : such an awful way to end the album . Feartures red man , swizz beatz , method man and fred . You would have to be a mega hardcore rap fan to like this , though in my opinion i do n't like it and it has too much swearing for no reasons . 6:23 -1/10 ( yep , thats a minus ) 15.OUTRO : not funny ! ! ! ! 2:01So overall do n't get this album go get his older on 3 dolla bill if you have to get an album by limp bizkit . If you want a band like limp bizkit check out linkin park , they are slightly less rappy , and way more talented , not that i like them but they did win last year an award for the best selling album which was hybrid theory .	-1
Ok I 'll keep this short ... The band ( not Durst ) has talent . Wes Borland is an innovative guitar player , Sam Rivers a good bassist , John Otto a great drummer and DJ Lethal is untouchable since House of Pain ... but Fred ... my God , you 're awful ! ! The so called `` lyrics '' on this album are nothing more than immature swearing , `` Hot Dog '' or nothing more than boasting about how tough and `` ghetto '' Fred is ( Rolling ) ... The average intelligence level of everyone has decresed after this album was released and if another one comes out ( come on guys , follow Wes 's lead ) then it will truly be the nail in the coffin for humanity . Do not pick this up . It is neither `` phat '' nor `` crunk '' ( whatever that 's supposed to mean ) . Just plain awful .	-1
For the love of God any youngster who loves this trash ... WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE . Is it just me or is this exactle what answers my question about the dumbening down of Americas youth . This band is nothing but pure garbage . When I borrowed this CD from a classmate about a year ago just after this album came I laughed at the stupidity of the content of what came out of my boombox . Hot Dog was so stupid I could n't help but laugh at Fred Durst for making a complete and total fool out of himself . It 's also funny how a band tries to put the F word into a song and yell it over 50 times in just under 4 minutes of endless noise . It 's so sad that our culture is becoming low-life when worthless bands like them are shoving this garbage down the throat of America . There is nothing good to say about this really BAD CD . I have never heard such musical vomit in my life.DO NOT call me some 50 year old bald man because I , m 19 years old and I am appalled at the fact that many 13-16 year olds paying more attention on how 'cool ' they are by using obscenity than how smart they really are . Well what I can say is that music is really dead if this is what the future holds for our countrys music scene.Buy Roland Orzabals Tomcats Screaming Ourside ( One of the best pop albums I , ve heard in years ) , Bjorks Vespertine , or anything by Afro Celt Sound System . Bloody hell even Korn does better than this .	-1
Sorry , I like Amazon but why do I have to rate something that deseves 0 stars ( if even that ) 1 star ? ? Limp Bizkit is one of the worst things ever to exist in the whole universe . Seriously , they make clowns like Good Charlotte and My Chemical Romance look like Megadeth and Iced Earth for gods f****** sake ! Fred Durst is possibly the WORST singer/songwriter ever , his lyrics are sooo dumb @ $ $ and do n't get me started about his voice . Wes Boreland is maybe the WORST guitarist ever . Even a monkey can play better than this loser . He barely knows to play 10 notes , probably he ca n't even dream that he makes a solo ! The drummer has off-tempo and slow beats , even I can drum better than him and I 'm not even a drummer . The DJ ... DJ is for trance and dance not for rock band wannabes ( this is what LB is ) . The bassist is average at best , but who gives a f**k ? 5 out of the 6 members are the worst they could be so the whole music sucks , end of story.Anyway about the album , of course I did n't bought it , it is blasphemy to buy a LB album ! But I got the 'My Way ' Single as a bonus CD for Linkin Park 's 'Hybrid Theory ' 5 years ago ( Linkin Park sucks as well , I was 11 back then and did n't knew good music ) , I decided to put it in the CD player last year and this is really a ripoff of Pink Floyd 'See Emily Play ' , and only 3 notes are played all the way ... I 'd might add ! I also heard Rollin in one of the radios in school , I could n't stand it so I took a knife and cutted the power cable.LB is a generic lame overrated band . Anyone who likes them is not a real music fan . They are responsible for the nu-metal invasion , and they brought disgrace upon great talented rap/rock bands like Rage Against The Machine and Faith No More.Bottom Line : F**K LIMP BIZKIT AND IF YOU LIKE THEM SO F**K YOU TOO !	-1
... One thing that kind of got under my skin was when the Europen Geramies gave Fred Durst the Gramey for album of the year as if he had good writing abilities or some thing even close to that . Some of the very worst songs I have ever heard like Hot Dog , My Generation , both of the Rolling 's ' ect . are on here and to me thats reson enough to hate this album . ( It all [ stinks ) In my mind Bizket has not released any thing any good at all scence `` Three Doller Bill Y'all '' in 1997.From what I 've heard the latest Bizket CD `` New Old and Remixed '' is the groups very worst , but I am not going to waste mony seening if their wright or not .	-1
Enough ! I 'm embarassed I ever owned this idiotic waste of a perfectly good disc . ( Needless to say , I gave it away . ) If anything , the one star could be for the fact that you could use it for a coaster . Okay , I admit sometime music can be great in its simplicity ( Ramones , etc . ) but this is just macho-white-boy posing over `` phat rapp-meddle beetz '' . If this is metal , than Shania Twain is NYC hardcore . OH ! And lets not forget the brilliant poetic lyrics : `` Yo , ... Fred Durst ! Leeyemp BEEZkeet ! Cumin ' atcha NOW , punk ! '' Shakespeare this ai n't . Stop calling this guy a hardcore vocalist : all he does is whine , whine , whine ! And what gives with `` My Generation '' ? This guy is like 35 . As for dissing the great Trent Reznor ... this little group of nothings do n't even deserve to MENTION his name . NIN is a million times better than these guys will ever be . ( Not that that 's much of an accomplishment . ) Mr. Durst is enough of an egomaniac as it is . So everyone , please stop buying his albums . Maybe then he 'll realize his talent is actually in the negatives , and go away . Pick up a Tool album instead . Your ears ( and brain ) will thank you .	-1
This album is horrible and the 5 star reviews on here do n't even know how to use proper grammar ! Enough said ! & gt ; : (	-1
The blatantly immature , homophobic , trashy joke that is the album 's title is even less funny than the old standby `` Why did the chicken cross the road ? `` , and the band itself is just as predictable . Do n't let Fred Durst get away with his version of `` music '' , buy some Beatles or AC/DC instead .	-1
This is really the last breath of Limp Bizkit ... .After 2 albums that made huge success in the late 90 's , Bizkit recorded this really silly collection of Rap NU Metal songs ... ..That Rap posture destroyed what could be a good band because Bizkit 's debut is good , with more gutural vocals ... .Some lyrics here are completely embarrassing , with lots of f*** and s**** ... ..WOW ! Fred 's lyrics must be the worst of ALL TIME ! ! ! While i think the duet with Scott Weiland on HOLD ON is a great song , and i barely like others like ROLLIN , MY WAY and TAKE A LOOK AROUND , this album really sucks ... ..	-1
rate this 1.5 stars . My Way and Rollin'are improvements over prievious Limp Bizkit hits like Faith , and Nookie , but this band still blows .	-1
Hot Chocolate and who ? This is about the [ worst ] cd I bought to date . The only song I like on this cd is `` my way '' , but I did'nt wan na spend 14 bucks for it . Fred or Freddy D whatever , performs his worst lyrics all on this one cd . And he tries to dis Trent Reznor , please , he was making music before you and he 'll be here after the end of your disgraced music carrer . Linkin Park 's `` Hybrid Theory '' is 100 times better than all 3 of Limped Bizkit 's cds . And at least Mike can actually rap without the ghost writers . Fred , I advise you not to rap anymore , because you Ca n't . No More Bizkit 's Please .	-1
Most of the Amazon reviews I read didnt say much about the actual CD . Instead they talked about how Limp had sold out and rapped too much . One insisted that Tool was coming to save the world . So I 'll give you a breath of fresh air and actually review the music ... ... Which isnt really that good.The first 3 songs ( not counting the intro ) are almost nothing but swear words . The theme is `` I 'm such a punk , I can knock you out . '' Ooh , I 'm scared . They spend 3 songs in a row saying this . You would think they would figure out that nobody over 10 is really impressed by swear words anymore . I guess not , because they have songs consisting of only swear words over the entire CD . As for the rest of the CD , they have a few angry-sad love songs . These are pretty good , really . Theres My Way , which is basically a rebel song without swear words . This song is pretty boring . There are the Rollins , which have stupid lyrics but some awesome beats . They have the Mission Impossible Theme , which also gets boring . So most of this CD is either stupid or boring . Significant Other is a much better CD . Get that , or if you want to see Fred Durst doing something more worthwhile , get Staind or Puddle of Mudd , but I really dont recommend getting this .	-1
You know , all of these songs really are stupid . Like & quot ; Hot Dog & quot ; and & quot ; Boiler & quot ; obviously just put on this CD to attract attention to 50 f words and suicide . I mean really..its sad , because Limp Bizkit wasnt always this bad . Theyw ere never great , but this is the CD thats going to wreck their career . Sorry guys , you suck .	-1
I loved Limp bizkit i nthe days of three dollar bill ya'lll and half the songs oof of signifigant other but what is this ! it seems like a poser rappers album the only reason i did n't rate it one star is theres one or 2 decent songs but thats it , i feel that Lb is going down the mainstream road and it pisses the sh*t out of me they had so much potential ! and im dissapointed in them.No wonder Wes left the band he wanted to rock he wanted to play metal ! ! ! ! ! ! SO fred stop worrying about britney spears and go back to your roots .	-1
I like music with lots of swears , because when I listen to swears that makes me cool . My momma used to say , `` Swears will make the devil have a party down under , and every time you say one he gains more power . '' But I never listened to my momma so why start now ? Chocolate Starfish does n't have enough swears . Fred Durst says the baddest of bad words about 100 times , but after it was over , I was left wanting more , darnit ! More swears ! Lots of swears ! In fact this idea of having `` lyrics '' in music is a bunch of hokey balogney . If it were up to me , only swears would be allowed in music . Loads of swears . So many that swears would flood the whole earth and we 'd all start using swears on a random consistent basis.Limp Bizkit is OK , but Fred Durst needs to use less words and more swears.Oh wait what 's that you say ? Chocolate Starfish is just a bunch of swears with no lyrics ? Fred Durst resorts to foul language in an effort to make himself sound tough and cool and rebellious ? Well pick me up and throw me over a fence , I 'm aghast ! Five stars for this then .	-1
This is a great cure for insomnia , otherwise it 's worthless and totally monotonous ( then again , it 's new , so that 's expected ) .	-1
I do n't know ... I guess I just feel bad for people who think this is good music . Yeah , I 'm a music snob , but you have to be in this day and age . I 'm afraid people who listen to this stuff will just never know how amazing music can be.If this is the sound of my generation , well then yes ... I hate my generation .	-1
Fred Durst . Punk rock or rap . He should have just stayed with Punk Rock . Why did he make the move toward , trying to sound ghetto . Heres the main topics on this CD , how he dates fine bunny tricks , how hes rebellient and kids listens to him , and how he likes to use the F word . He can not rhyme worth of lick other than the song where he used 64 & quot ; F & quot ; words and rhymed with simple stuff like mom dad , cop , badge . I was eager to listen to this album after I heard the song Rollin , Rollin remix , and My way . Broiler was on TV and that song is just 5 or 6 lines being repeated . Its like Limp Bizkit try 2 make the best of this album putting songs like Broiler on TV.Lyrics : F*Production : BDelivery : F*Overall : F** F means Failing in case some fans may misunderstand me as one the hardcore moshpit fans who uses the F words .	-1
There 's a sucker born every minute and Fred Dirt proved it when he released this cd of trash . This cd is terrible and millions of suckers went out and bought it . I can understand buying it because you was fooled to think that Fred had something to offer , but to buy it and STILL like it ? ! No excuse ! ! I will admit , I liked their & quot ; Significant Other & quot ; cd , but that 's it . Its no wonder why some kids are so brain dead ... they are listening to junk bands like Limp Bizkit .	-1
I can not believe I used to like this pile of sh-t ! it is the definition is WACK ! Every song is terrible , the only 'ok ' song is Getcha Groove On , only because of Xzibit . One of there most wack sonsg is 'Hot Dog ' where Fred says f-ck 46 times ( ooooh he 's hard , not ) alos 'Rollin ' 'Take a look around ' and all the other tracks which are just WACK . Take my advice and do n't buy this or any other of there albums becuae they are jsut terrible.Fred Durst , wes borland and all the others FU % K YOU ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
That title is a good summary . This entire CD , as well as the rest of Limp Bizkit 's albums are . Rap and metal DO N'T MIX , and I really wish that many of the nu-metal bands could realize this . It 's been done , and it clearly should n't be done again . While the bass lines on this album are relatively good and fun to play , the guitar , drums , and vocals ruin it . ... I feel sorry for Puddle of Mudd , who were signed and discovered by [ Fred Durst ] . Unlike LB , Puddle of Mudd has talent , and it 's just a shame that they fell in the shadow of their ... benefactor . DJ Lethal is just ... there . He barely does anything to make the `` music '' better , and it just makes his prescense more annoying . Guitarist Wes Boreland ( the only member with any hint of talent ) left the band about a year after the release of this album ... I ca n't believe he took so long . This music is PURE $ ELL OUT POP ROCK ! ! I mean ... even Limp 's guitarist left because he knew the band was sold out . That 's just sad . The music is terrible , and the band is awful . Save yourself the pain on the ears and do n't get this . It is just sad that this band got a record deal . Excruciating .	-1
fred durst turned 40 yesterdayits funny becuase he makes music for all ageskids under 13 love fred , they look up to him as a fatheronly a genius could make music that appeals to young teens like me	-1
When I first wrote this review , I was just glad to have the CD and I was trying to be the first to review it . Now that I 've listened to it for a while , I must say , I am disgusted with this CD . The songs all are truly forgettable with the weakest lyrics I have ever heard on a CD . Even though Wes Borland learned how to play guitar , it was n't enough . Fred Durst just wants money and hopes to get girls out of it . He does n't care about his fans ! It seems like Sam Rivers has all but stopped trying on the bass , because he now plays weak tunes with one or two chords unlike the fast paced complicated lines from Three Dollar Bill Y'all $ . John Otto is a bad a drummer now as he was before , or maybe even worse . DJ Lethal seems to have expanded his horizons , but please , tell me something I have n't heard . Every song has about 20 swares in it , because Fred Durst thinks it impresses girls when he cusses overexcessively but it sure makes me bored . All of his cussing is careless , especially in the song Hot Dog , where he adds that word we all know in every long , and shows more than writer 's block , but a bit more than a little stupidity also . But it 's not all bad on this CD . Several of the songs show attempted enthusiasm in music style , but they all fail . My Generation and Livin ' It Up try very hard to impress people , but they fail lyrically . The only good song on this CD is Take A Look Around from the M : I-2 soundtrack but maybe that had something to do with the fact that Fred did n't write the lyrics ! Please , do n't even bother . I 'm disgusted , and to make up for it , I 've been listening to Three Dollar Bill Y'all $ even more . There are n't any really lame songs on that CD , and none of the lyrics show as much sellout as Limp Bizkit . And I take back what I said about Eminem selling out more . I was wrong .	-1
Man - i thought that Limp Bizkit was quite good band when i heard & quot ; Three dolar bill y'all & quot ; which is my favourite Bozkit album.on & quot ; Significant other & quot ; some strange hip-hop signs appearded and music lost it 's power in some places.on this album Limp Bizkit simply changed into a band of jumping and shouting middle-aged pop-metal men ... after hearing this album i just turned it off because i was scared of such a idiotic lyrics and many creepy hip-hop parodies ( i mean there are good some good hip-hop tracks but here are only horrible ones ) Go listen Tool or Pearl jam instead of this nightmare.do not let Fred Durst get your money !	-1
Fred Durst & amp ; Limp Bizket are so Contrived it ai n't even funny.the words & amp ; music never change it 's always the same thing.the Lyrics never go anywhere & amp ; the music is the same Re-Play Over & amp ; Over again.i always think of this Group as a Funny Lounge act.i do n't wan na here no more about Rap & amp ; Rock.they can do neither.you got ta be able to do one.this band will probably come right back with the same sound & amp ; themes in the years to come making them closer to Kenny G than a Band doing anything worth remembering .	-1
This band blows and so does this album , the only half way good song is 'My Way '	-1
To start this review , I 'm am going to say that Limp Bizkit did n't sell out . They just made a really bad adjustment . 3 Dollar Bill Y'all was a great debut , and Significant Other was nothing short of awesome . But this CD is very uncreative and unoriginal.To start , is the guy who wrote & quot ; Hot Dog & quot ; the same person who wrote & quot ; Re-Arranged & quot ; and & quot ; No Sex & quot ; ? Freddy has seen to gone stupid , using the F Word more than 46 times in a song . This is n't the only song ; the next tracks , & quot ; My Generation & quot ; and & quot ; Full Nelson & quot ; , which has just as much concentration on curses. & quot ; My Way & quot ; is a pretty cool song , and & quot ; Rollin & quot ; is a good song for the first 2 or 3 listens , but it becomes repetitive . & quot ; Livin It Up & quot ; is the worst rap-rock song ever , plain and simple. & quot ; The One & quot ; is an excellent song , I must say that . But then it gets followed by the weak & quot ; Getcha Groove On & quot ; .Then , something magic happens , 3 good songs in a row . & quot ; Take A Look Around & quot ; is the MI-2 theme , and an excellent song . & quot ; It 'll Be Okay & quot ; is next , which is a good quality song with depressing lyrics . & quot ; Boiler & quot ; is the CD 's best track , showing Fred 's talent , which he seems to be running out of. & quot ; Hold On & quot ; is the weakest track on this CD , not only because I dislike Mr. Weiland 's recent work , but it 's very boring . & quot ; Rollin ( Urban ) & quot ; is just another weak , unoriginal rap track.The & quot ; Outro & quot ; with Ben Stiller is funny the first time but then gets annoying.This CD is not essential for your collection . If you have Significant Other but not 3 $ BYall , get that and skip this .	-1
I Really Hate this album and this band , they remind me of the rap rock version of G-Unot , this album is incredibly awful , the lyrics are terrible , the drumming is terrible and everything else is terrible as well , I Blame Nerdvana for bringing this whine rock genre in and destroying music like this , and this band is the perfect example of that.Chocolate Starfish & The Hot Dog Flavored Water is a stupid sloppy messNu Metal is even worse than boy bands and hair bands ( at least they can play instruments unlike nu metal b.s . ) Limp Bizkit and G-Unot sucksF*ck Fred Durst & 50 Cent .	-1
This cd is their best , it is really good . If you do n't have this cd , you should buy it . You will not be dissappointed . Buy it now if you like good music.Now , a REAL Review ( the previous statements would fit perfectly in the under-13-years-old kid 's review form ) : This album is more of the same , thrown-together , uninspired mix of rap and rock that was soooo mainstream that they had to jump on it to make money . `` Hey , rap-rock is happening , so why not do it ? I know it was Aerosmith and Run DMC who did it first , but now everybody 's doing it . It 's hot . '' These must have been these guys ' thoughts and plans for forming a band . Well , here you have the fruitful evolution ( not ) and innovation ( dream on ) that they have achieved on their last cd . Durst is still his perennially annoying self , the riffs sound generic , the rapping boring and whiny ... all in all , forgettable . A feeble attempt at fitting in on the trend of the moment . If they come back and sell half as many CD 's as this one , it is because of the arrival of Evanescence - a band who with their immensely superior music brought new momentum to this genre , which was almost gone . Barney , the purple one ( aka Fred ) must love the fact that a female-led band would be very influential in determining his band 's future . Time will tell .	-1
... ... .seriously , do n't waste your money in these stupid things ... .you rather give it to welfare or something ... .we hope not to see these guys once again ever ... .and we hope that Less Is More never face the day light	-1
yo yo yo dis be mikky d and i be herre ta say sumpin bout the bizkit . yo , my man fred 's a genus . he can make rhymes like phat , and them otha peepz in da band r pretty good to . i like da way wes borland iz a terrible guitarist but he hidez dat wit hiz costooms . sam be bangin on dat bass , wile john keepz da beetz phat wit them 3rd grade beetz . & all da wile my boi-you know hoo i be talkin bout-mr. house of pain , dj lethal ! u know how he doez . keepin them scratches goin at lite speed , ya herd ? but yall shuld stop dissin on dis album . its got great rhymes & i love tha way tha music revolves around rap instead of rawk . and dat blazin joint my way gets me rite herre , dawg , ya kow i be talkin bout da hart . fred sounds so tuff , talkin bout how hes man enuff ta walk out on theze hataz . i would give dis more starz anyday , but dey jus kuss 2 much !	-1
... because I honestly was n't expecting a whole lot with a title like this . This album certainly has it 's highs and lows , but the lows definitely outnumber the highs . And when Fred tries to rap - look out , thats when his extremely whiny vioce reaches its most irritating . There are a few good songs here , though . & quot ; Take A Look Around & quot ; is one of , if not the , best song Limp Bizkit has ever done . A combination of the Mission Impossible theme and Limp 's own kick- @ $ $ attitude , the song has real depth to it , and it flat out rocks . I also like some of the more mellow songs on this album . & quot ; Hold On & quot ; is a good song , despite being quite far from Limp 's usual style . I also kinda like & quot ; It 'll Be OK & quot ; and & quot ; Boiler & quot ; is okay too . & quot ; Rollin ' ( Air Raid Vehicle ) & quot ; is a very energetic , fun song to listen to . Unfortunately , many of the other songs on this album ( & quot ; My Generation , & quot ; & quot ; Getcha Groove On , & quot ; & quot ; Rollin ' ( Urban Assault Vehicle ) & quot ; ) are downright plain , boring and/or just plain annoying . Three Dollar Bill , Y'All $ was a great CD , Significant Other was OK , hopefully Limp wo n't continue their downward spiral with their next album .	-1
This is by far the CD I most regret buying last year . In fact , the only CD that was worst was Jennifer Lopez 's & quot ; On The 6. & quot ; In the words of your typical teeny bopper girl I can sum this baby up in one word : EW ! If it were n't for Fred Durst 's bad boy image , this band would be nothing more than a bunch of derelicts running around cussing . The only song I can stand without wanting to sue them for verbal assualt is & quot ; My Way. & quot ; As for the overall feeling of the album , well , we 're paying a group of guys to scream profanities at us . If you want good hard care stuff , check out the recordings from the family values tour or Eminem 's & quot ; The Marshall Mathers. & quot ; These are some CDs that actually are catchy and enjoyable though granted , they 're still just screaming at you and/or bashing you and your beliefs .	-1
Once I tried to get into what was popular at the time to see what the hype was all about , after trying this album , I decided that I was n't ready to expand my horizons to the point of listening to artless , immature , untalented , unimaginative , banal , idiotic , rap-rockers that are neither good at rap nor rock and are less hardcore ( contrary to what they think ) than Britney Spears . I was depressed that people could stoop to the level of actually thinking this garbage was any good , the disc 's only useful purpose could be as an expensive coaster or something .	-1
Edit : Ok , I give this 2 stars for the number of good songs : & quot ; Boiler & quot ; and & quot ; Take A Look Around & quot ; . All other songs here are bad .	-1
I could really care less if a band & quot ; sold out & quot ; because music should sell well if it is good . Now Significant Other was fairly good and a hell of a lot better than 3db , but CSF.. really has some just terrible things happening to it . 1 . Fred Durst , you know you do n't have to use the f word every 3 seconds to be considered cool . 2 . The band has gotten lazy , they know damn well that their album will sell well and it seems that this whole album sounds like a demo tape . 3 . The ego has grown ... and grown ... and grown ... and grown ... 4 . Hotdog , sorry but NIN is one of my favorite bands and I do n't really consider it funny at all.All in all it could 've used some more time and some better songwriting .	-1
Chocolate Starfish turn Limp Bizkit in one of the most famous bands in 2000 ... This was the end for Limp Bizkit ... Fred Durst lyrics sometimes provides some interesting stuff , but most of what he sing is total crap ! Ok , ALL THE RAPPERS got some lame and mediocre lyrics , so Fred 's rap style obviously will provide bad rhymes ... this last breath from Limp Bizkit got some good songs like MY GENERATION , LIVIN IT UP , MY WAY and the best limp song , the duet with Scott Weiland HOLD ON ... BYE BYE FRED ...	-1
thank God that the whole rap-metal scene died down ! `` rap-metal '' is no substitute for real metal . and that closet queen diva fred durst should go sing wit da Village People ! i am docking one star just for Fred Durst being on this ! the other 3 stars are subtracted because this crappy record is just a contrived record company caca scheme .	-1
There 's really no point of even writing a review of this record because anyone with even half a brain cell knows this record is garbage . But why not.I guess if you really , really like corporate rock , Limp Bizkit is perfect for you . Even NSYNC spend less time out golfing with their label executives . Chocalate Starfish is also for you if your ideal rock star is an overweight gansta-wannabe who does n't even go to the McDonalds drive-through without a security guard . Note to Fred : Dr. Dre you ai n't . Although I suppose if I made music as bad as you , I 'd want to be protected from the public too.Also , if you 've recently discovered these things called & quot ; swear words & quot ; like Fred apparently has , you 'll also love this record , cause he uses them a bunch . How cool ! I wish I could come up with lyrics as deep and meaningful as & quot ; Keep rollin , rollin , rollin. & quot ; I bet bands like Pearl Jam and Nine Inch Nails just wish they were cool enough to get to do a duet with Christina Aguilera on MTV , but they just are n't cool enough I guess . Maybe someday .	-1
1999 's Significant Other from Limp Bizkit was often overlooked ; a smart , bouncing album with an almost perfect mix between heavy metal and rap , even with some melodic pieces , and an appeal to audiences both black and white , young and old . Enough about that . One year later , the hastily made and stupidly titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is a stupefying mess of faked anger and roughness ; opening song Hot Dog is a swearfest of over 30 'F ' words , with no reason behind it ; nothing has happened to Fred Durst to make him [ madd ] at the world ; while Fred may consider himself the voice of a generation ; what he does n't realise is that he is 30-year old man refusing to clear his room and thinking he is making a connection with the youth of America , while for some reason begging to be hated . The pointless mess of swear words simply displays an utter lack of creativity ; while other artists such as Eminem can marvellously use swear words to show incredible talent and transport anger through musio , Fred Durst just turns out to be some dumb white guy in a red hat swearing for `` shock value '' which soon wears out , and for trying to establish a `` cool '' reputation to kids because of his potty mouth . Meanwhile , his band kick out the most uninteresting and simplistic of riffs , while the songs have irritating and nonsensical choruses like `` keep rolling rolling rolling '' and `` my way or the highway . '' This is not an album I am proud to own , let 's put it that way .	-1
When I first heard Limp Bizkit on their debut album `` Three Dollar Bill Ya 'll '' , I instantly fell in love with it . Then in '99 they released `` Significant Other '' , which I found a bit dull , but still liked it ( only for `` Nokkie '' and `` Rearrange '' ) . And then came ... THIS ! ! Chocolate Starfist and the Hotdog Flavored Water . Yes , the beats may be good and upbeat but not even the beats save this sorry record . The intro is just a bunch of mindless junk not even worth listening to . `` Hotdog '' would be ok if Fred did n't use the `` f '' word all the way through it . In fact this record is loaded with foul language . I do n't really mind explicit lyrics but this is extreme . `` My Generation '' again , is just another rap/rock song pointless and dumb . About the only good tracks are `` Rollin '' , '' My Way '' , and `` Boiler '' . Even their own guitarist said this music was [ bad ] . Now they 've released `` New Old Songs '' ( should be called `` Old Songs '' ) which is no better than CSATHFW . Take my advice , do n't buy neither of these and save a good [ money ] .	-1
holy ... ! I love this album.seriously , this cd really works for me ! every time I play frisbee it never fails to keep in the air . God bless u soggy bizkit for once you did something useful ! ! ! ummm.. would i listen to it ? NONONON NO . but limpbizkit , my fine frisbee thanks you .	-1
I love rock music . When done properly it can be invigourating , challenging , energising , funky , emotive and thought-provoking . Fred Durst and co. clearly do n't know how to do well.With a ludicrous amount of swearing , lyrics whaich amount to little more than `` I 'm great so listen to me '' or `` the world is terrible '' , and music which often amounts to little mroe than thrashed guitar lines and out-of-place turntable work , it 's rather hideous at times.The hip hop overtones are also offputting , especially the second version of Rollin ' and Boiler . Used properly turntables can add to rock music , but the rapping her eis unitellgent and negative.The fact that this CD only averages 3 stars on here says it all - I 'd deft you to find anythign else which has such consistantly poor reviws . Besides , a lot of the faovurable onces seem to be written by people half Durst 's age ( astonishingly he 's not far short of 40 , although his IQ is ) and amount to little more than screaming fanboy views from typical teeange stoners.Please , people , try to expand your minds beyond this . At the least , bands like Tool , System Of A Down and Weezer have some imagination , variety and musical structure to them , wheras the clasiscs such as Hendrix , Led Zep , Metallica , AC/DC and Iron Maiden will show you how to play a guitar properly .	-1
I liked this CD way back when it came out but compared to other rock albums this album lacks big time . Fred enjoys using MF in his lyrics for no reason . I mean I could give a care about the language in the albums I listen to but this guy was just saying it to say it . The songs are mediocre and better left unheard . If you want rock go buy any of KoRn 's albums .	-1
this band sux badly i ca n't believe that crap is still coming from them i would rather shoot my self then listen to that craptoo bad i had to give this crap one star	-1

When it comes to no-talent & quot ; musicians & quot ; who are just in it for the money , Limp Bizkit takes the cake . I thought they could n't sink much lower with & quot ; Significant Other & quot ; , but somehow they have managed to create an even worse album . This has got to be one of the worst albums ever made . I mean , really , can Wes Borland even play the guitar at all ? I 'm not a guitarist , but I think that after about an hour of practicing chords , I could outplay him with ease . Then there 's Fred Durst . He 's got ta have one of the most irritating voices there is . He ca n't rap at all . I 'm not really a fan of rap music anyway , but I know that someone like MC Overlord or LL Cool J could outrap him without even breaking a sweat . If anyone in this band has any talent at all , it 's the bass player , but he 's still average at best . And , the songs ... & quot ; Rollin & quot ; and & quot ; My Way & quot ; are about as bad as a song can get . & quot ; Hot Dog & quot ; is one of those & quot ; let's-see-how-many-times-we-can-fit-the-f-word-into-one-recording & quot ; kind of deals . Pretty immature , actually . & quot ; The One & quot ; is yet another lackluster hip-hop-ish ballad that is better than most of their stuff , but still not very good . It all compiles into one awful package . I 'd list all the albums that you should buy over this one , but there is not nearly enough room . If you want good rap metal , get Papa Roach 's & quot ; Infest & quot ; , Faith No More 's & quot ; Real Thing & quot ; , and Machine Head 's & quot ; Burning Red & quot ; , but this is not even vaguely worth it . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I feel like getting in my car and & quot ; rollin , rollin , rollin & quot ; over a copy of this CD !	-1
Come on guys ! ! The worst band ? Come on , yeah sure these guys , what with all that fake tough-guy image , and when swearing became a serious 'prop ' and nothing else , well , yeah , they suck , but I put to you just two songs , two songs , 'The One ' and 'Hold On ' . Okay , so they 're droopy ballads , but hey ! 'The One ' is one of the best ballad tracks I 've heard since 1990 ! It is simply fantastic . How can you say these guys suck ? I put it to you , neither Korn , Rage against the machine or Linkin Park or any of their contemporaries , none of which get as bashed as much as these guys , could cut a song like that ! Sure , Rage rock heaps , they are generally a better band than Limp , but they ca n't construct such an impressive piece of melodic pop , and the others are n't even worth talking about , in my opinion.Well , yeah , all the mean attitude and swearing and toughness grates after a while , how many times do you want to listen to someone tell you they 're gon na bash you ? And how true is this so-called angst anyway ? I do n't think Fred Durst has ever been put on suicide watch . Actually , the thought of it is laughable ... Fred Durst on suicide watch ! Ha Ha ! ! He need `` braggin ' 'bout my big money '' watch ! But aside from all that , well , this album is kind of good.This band REALLY know how to lay down a groove ( yes , it had to be capitals ) . After the obligatory 'intro ' the album begins with 'Hot Dog ' . I actually like this song , that chorus CRANKS , man ! Sure it needs better lyrics , but that bit about 'everybody knows this song ' has a kind of eerie Middle-Eastern feeling to it , and , as I said , the chorus really pumps . It 's followed by a couple of predictable heavy , tough acting songs , like 'My generation ' and 'Full Nelson ' . However , the second half of the album is surprisingly mellow and there are some great songs in there , actually . The afforementioned 'The One ' is a poppy-ballad that ends with some loud distortion , it kind of blends ballad , R & B ; , rock , etc . and is simply a fnatastic song . 'Hold on ' is another excellent ballad . It features Scott Weiland on vocals , but sounds like a cross between Crosby Stills and Nash with The Moody Blues , seriously ! It 's an excellent song.Then there 's the hit , 'Take a look around ' , a more traditional LB song . This song is ... excellent ! Sure , it rips off 'Guerilla Radio ' but it 's still an excellent song . The lyrics this time are kind of deep , with the catch-line 'now I know why you want to hate me , because hate is all the world has even seen lately ' . It 's the sought of insightful lyric unique to Limp Bizkit . Then 'It 'll be okay ' is a very powerful break-up song , with emotive lyrics like 'If their 's a better place you can take me , Better life you can give me . Whatever place I can start all over . And I would never need what you gave me . ' But the song would benefit from having the 'F***ing up my whole life ' part removed . Boiler is also a good song ; eerie and deals with the sought of frustration Limp Bizkit usually sings about , without going over the top.Unfortunately , there is too much weak material and miss-steps to consider giving this a high-rating . However , a deeper insight reveals a band full of talent and potential that is unfortunately going down the wrong path , but with a few gems to remind us of what could have been . Rating **	-1
The fact that Dan Gennoe , the Amazon editorial reviewer , says that Limp Biscuit have give ` sterile electronica laced with dark melodies as infectious as anything Britney has to offer ' I 'm not sure if this is a rather humorous joke , insulting Limp Biscuit , which I would prefer , as apposed to a dribble piece of writing . For non-believers of Fred Durst and his motley crew of loosers , its funny . ` Ultimately , though , it 's that undeniably intelligent musical backdrop ' oh dear , maybe Dan was in fact being useless and writing any old contrived piece of [ ... ] that came into his mind to please the readers , and quite simply do his job . This statement was obviously unplanned , and filled the sentence nicely , to say Limp Biscuit use ` intelligent musical backdrops ' is a complete utter [ ... ] .The supposed ` glory days ' of Limp Biscuit are long gone , nowadays they have done the seemingly impossible , to go down hill ... which , considering they started at the very depths of raucous dribble metal-come-rap , is profoundly outstanding . The wonderful concoction of hip-hop and nu metal is quite original . But , when you consider both of these genres are truly awful you begin to realise Limp Biscuit are indeed one sh*tty band . Mind you , they are intelligent .	-1
this was the first cd I got back in 6th grade , and boy did I think it was funny . I mean , the guy sings the `` f-word '' about 50+ times in one song , so whats not to like , right ? well , other than the fact that I `` grew up '' and listened to better music later on , this is n't that bad . well , unless you are older than a 6th grader . then it sucks . and boy , this album sucks . basically everything wrong with music today can be traced to this album . its that bad . its funny as heck , but this is terrible music . it is worth a novelty listen if you want to be cracked up a bit , but other then that its garbage . and Fred Durst trying to do slower emotional songs at the end is just a complete joke . avoid this cd and their others like the plague .	-1
Seriously , every song on this album is terrible . Is there anything else to say except Limp Bizkit is probably the worst band ever ? Vote yes if you agree that LB is terrible , vote no if you like this trash .	-1
Well I wo n't go in to depth on how terrible this cd is . All I 'll say is this ; Bad boys is the only good song on the cd the rest is not good at all .	-1
I only bought this album to hear `` Bad Boyz '' , and in true Bad Boy fashion , they cut the song off too early . Really , Shyne raps best over reggae grooves like that one , `` Bang '' , and `` Bonnie and Shyne '' . The rest of the album is a yawner with all of the usual suspects ( pushing weight , some songs for the radio , and an obligatory Neptunes track , `` N 's Gon na Die '' ) . The most surprising thing about this album is that it 's under 60 minutes , something unusual for Bad Boy products .	-1
... I mean album.Sean Combs needs to let it go . Biggie is dead . Let him rest in peace . And Shyne ( Poe ? ) is no Biggie . Sure Shyne has a gruff breathy baritone like Biggie . Sure he comes from the streets of Brooklyn . But Shyne just seems like a phony . Biggie 's first album Ready To Die sounded like it was written with the angst of the street . Although Biggie eventually choose another lifestyle you at least believed his 'recently reformed criminal reporting life on the streets as I saw it & quot ; persona.Shyne has been signed to Bad Boy for nearly two years . That means that for some time now , Shyne has been enjoying the luxury of that fat penthouse apartment in Manhatten that Puffy gave him along with the ( rumored ) 1,000,000 dollar signing bonus that came from the Def Jam/Bad Boy bidding war over this emcee ( I use that term loosely ) . Two years of living the life of a ghetto fabulous recording artist has created a young man who has no identity so tries to assume the identity Biggie circa 1993.I do n't have a problem with an emcee who talks about crime or the streets or hoes , but I have a serious problem with and emcee who does n't know how to express himself . I give artists like Lil ' Kim and Eminem credit . They might be playing a role as well , but the act is believable and there are still a few drops of passion and art to be found in their works . The same can not be said for Shyne . The album sounds contrived and like and attempt to give people what they want . The people do n't know what they want however and even if this album goes crazy platinum , do n't look for it to be still spinning in anyone 's AIWA this time next year.His voice is strong and his delivery and timing come off more often than not , which means that this album will produce a couple of bangers for the clubs . But by no means is this an album that can be listened to from beginning to end . Go to mp3crackhouse.com and download a few tracks and see for yourself before you waste your money .	-1
First off what is garbage ? Something you use for about two hours and then toss it in the trash can . So is there a difference between garbage and trash . Yes ... ... ... ... ..trash lasts longer before you toss it in the can . Good thing Common exposed this [ ... . ] But hey , at least he has one good thing going for him by snatching up the sexy T-Boz from TLC but that is ALL hehas going for him . Put it like this ... ..A three year old could make a better album . Stay Away ... ... ... ... ... Far Away .	-1
Dont think that I hate Mack 10 . His first self-titled album and Based On A True Story were undeniably west coast classics but if any album was the tip off to this stink bomb of album it would have to be The Recipe . For starters Mack 10 doesnt sound as hungry as he did on his previous albums , the production is just as weak and Techniec is on five tracks in the album and everybody knows that he sounded better on Game 's mixtapes then he does on here . The Good : From tha Streetz was a good first single to kick off the album with , I 'm Dope was hard and Pimp Or Die ( featuring Techniec and Too Short ) is also a highlight . Sorry to say but these are the only tracks that stick out . The Bad : Tight To Def featuring his former wife and TLC member T-Boz was a tepid second single and why he chose it to be his next single is anyone 's guess . For Sale which features YoungBloodz and Big Gipp is deader than disco and that has to be the worst verse of Big Gipp 's rap career . Hustle Game and Keep It Gangsta will knock you out like elephant tranquilizer ( yes they are that boring ) . The Ugly : Nobody featuring Westside Connection is the worst song on here and that has to be the worst beat that Timbaland has ever produced next to Diddy Rock ! Spousal Abuse is so corny you 'll break out into hysterics , Pop X is hot rubbish and everybody on the track ( with the exception of Xzibit ) had some lame verses and Tha Weekend is just as awful but I must say that the positive thing about that track is that its the last song . Bottom Line : Its unanimously agreed that The Paper Route is Mack 10 's worst album . You can tell a rush job when you hear it and this album was an obvious rush job . In comparison to Mack 10 and Based On A True Story , Paper Route is extremely pale in comparison and will be forgotten like Bang Or Ball .	-1
YO this album can be described in the simplest term - Garbage .	-1
This is Clapton 's lowest point in his career , the day he succumbed to the usual record company pressure for & quot ; GIVE ME A HIT SINGLE SOON & quot ; , or & quot ; GIVE ME A HIT VIDEO FROM A HIT SINGLE SOON & quot ; ..The album is totally commercial , what is no surprise if you check who is at the helm of production : Mr. Phil Collins , who a long time ago was a serious musician in a great band called GENESIS , but who decided to go with all his force and talent into mainstream pop music . Clapton seems lost here , the songs are inconsistent , maybe because his record company brought others producers , including Van Halen 's Ted Templeman . The album is so heartless and uninspired that you ca n't believe it 's Clapton on it . Only & quot ; SHE 'S WAITING & quot ; appears in the CROSSROADS compilation ...	-1
Behind The Sun was Eric Clapton 's attempt to & quot ; modernize & quot ; his sound . Calling on Phil Collins to produce , the album has a contemporary 80 's feel , with a slick studio production that all but stifles his blues roots . The album opens up with & quot ; She 's Waiting & quot ; which is a very good song that is accentuated by the fife and drum coda . But after that , the album falters with bland music including one of his all time worst songs , the calculating & quot ; Forever Man & quot ; . The album is revived for a bit by the strong & quot ; Just Like A Prisoner & quot ; in which he lets loose on the guitar . By associating with Mr. Collins , who was super hot at the time , Mr. Clapton assured himself of getting some airplay , but the collaboration fizzled in the quality end .	-1
horrible 80 's production , voice not recovered from years of alcohol abuse , guitar playing so so / negligible . A commercial success because of a certain mr P. Collins , who modernized Clapton 's sound.I think it was a commercial success not because of his old time fans but because of people who fell ( temporarily , no doubt ) for the sound	-1
and this new Default album is n't too great either . Or ... wait , this is Fuel . How silly of me . Really , is anyone as sick of these grunge throwbacks as I am ? We all know the formula by now , or should . Subpar lyrics about whatever type of white boy pain , subpar music with energetic but boring drumming , unimaginative basslines , whatever guitars , and 'emotional ' vocals . But Fuel just makes it worse . Bad Day ? Jesus , the lyrics to that song are LAUGHABLE . I 'll admit , Hemorrhage was a good song , but it got played to death and all the strings get on your nerves . Indeed , Fuel abuse the strings as much as Jimmy Eat World , but at least JEW utilizes their strings efficiently . All the songs sound the same , the lyrics are awful , the music does n't elevate past radio standards ; jeesh , why do people still buy corporate , boring rock ? I should n't worry ; in a few years , Fuel will sit alongside The Calling and Wheatus in the used CD section ...	-1
I 'm not an electro-pop fan but I happen to have bought a couple Hooverphonic CDs many years ago . This one leaves me quite cold . If you want something better by this group I 'd suggest `` Blue Wonder Power Milk '' which is pretty catchy somehow . It 's a much better CD than the inaptly named `` Magnificent Tree . ''	-1
No one liked the first album more than me , and I admit : maybe my expectations for this record were a little too high based on the so-so release & quot ; Bag Lady & quot ; . Sorry fellow fans , but this CD is n't getting it . Some of the groove is still there ( though not anywhere near as solid a bunch of tracks as I 'm used to hearing Jay Dee and The Roots associated with lately ) , but the lyrical content sounds like a lot of sound-check rambling . This may have been good enough to give us classic tracks like & quot ; Tyrone & quot ; , but you do n't write a whole album with that kind of energy ... it 's not enough work.Not to mention the inordinate amount of apologies and packaging inconsistencies ! First off , the track listing differed from the package in number of tracks ( you lose one on the actual disc , but that 's small bereavement here ) AND in order . There were lyrics inside , save for one song she readily admits in the notes to not having ready for print . She apologizes for not having the well-known version of & quot ; bag lady & quot ; on the actual CD ( what you 've been hearing on the radio is a remix , which is , of course , better than the version here ) .Jeez , if I wanted a bootleg version of the CD , I 'd have gone to the flea market . I kept thinking & quot ; did anyone at Motown listen or look at this thing before they put it out ? & quot ; All this AFTER they pushed it back at least a month ! If you 're going to release a so-so product anyway , why bothering putting it out ? Not enough good music , not anywhere NEAR enough good lyrics , and the package is a bit ghetto . Get it used . Trust me ; you 'll be able to find it .	-1
all the five stars were from people who have little to no knowledge of Electronic Dance Music.darude is , essentially , talentless . his record presents nothing but one tired knockoff after another of & quot ; sandstorm & quot ; , which did nothing but capatalize on the cheese factor that 's given trance a bad name while making it commercially swallowable for the pop-music masses.yeah , buy it ... then , when you 're ready for real dance music , come back and start with sasha 's global underground SF or some paul van dyk .	-1
The songs from the first album are the best . The songs from the second album are horrible , and now I remember why I stopped listening and buying . The songs from the rest of the albums are ok , nothing great . If you want to know Montrose , all you need is the first album .	-1
This album is the beginning of the end of the real Ja Rule . Venni Vetti Vecci and this album are on opposite ends of the spectrum . Unfortunately , Ja has decided to pander to the teeny bopper audience . This move has undoubtedly netted him more sales and money , but he has become a sell out in the process . Either that , or he never recovered from getting slammed by DMX on Funk Flex mixtape Vol . 4 .	-1
If you want to get a Ja Rule CD get his debut album , vetti venni vicci or something like that . I heard this album in some girls car ( obviously only girls like ja rule anymore ) and it 's absolutely horrible . After his first album he fell in love with the money and turned into a pop singer . If you like good music you should get Talib Kweli - Quality . Look at my recommendations for good CDs to buy.. but whatever you do , DONT GET THIS ONE	-1
The Inc is Gone and it wont be back deal with it ppl.this cd [ is bad ] and almoust all the sungs are made for girls.if you like hard rap go buy some 90 's rap	-1
A lot of people are meriting Ja 's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998 . So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000 , that is one of the worst Ja albums I 've heard ( not the worst , The Last Temptation takes that title ) .Ja tries to be `` gangstafied '' on this album but fails terribly . Starting with the first single `` Me & You '' thinking his thug style can attract women . I have n't bought the concept in 2000 , and I 'm still not buying it six years later . Or how about the flat falling track `` F*** You '' featuring Vita and 01 ? Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album , which seriously damages his creditablity . How about the song `` Put It On Me '' before Lil Mo joined song . Sounds wack ( er ) with out her . Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song `` Extacy '' ( and thats one of the decent tracks on this album ) . Oh and remember when `` Between Me & You '' was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster ? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded did n't have Christina Millian singing the hook , but had Ja singing it himself . Thank god that was n't on the album.Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out . `` 6 Feet '' is a standout track , and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite . `` Watching Me '' is another tight track , as Ja spits with a load of energy within him . `` I Cry '' and as mentioned earlier `` Extacy '' are decent at best . Other than that , most of the tracks on this album are skippable.Overall , a sub medicore Ja Rule album . Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ( `` Put It On Me '' [ Remix ] ) . To me , this album is nothing else but a pop rap , falsafied thug rap album that just does n't appeal to me . I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they do n't have this already.Lyrics : CProduction : C+Guest Appearances : C-Musical Vibes : D-Favorite Tracks : Watching Me , 6 Feet , Die , ExtacyHonorable Mention Track : Chris Black ( skit )	-1
This album is an end to end example of everything that is wrong with hip hop today . If you consider yourself any sort of real hip hop head and you like this ... , you should be ashamed of yourself . Ja Rule ... makes DMX sound like the greatest MC ever to grab a mic . Jah do n't rule this album . ...	-1
To classify this as & quot ; music & quot ; is to do the word a disservice . I listened to all sixteen cuts and found nothing commendable about any ONE of them . The owner of the disc , my younger brother , could not change my impression.Four-letter words mixed with masochistic and narcissistic ramblings done by an angry & quot ; brutha & quot ; do not make music to MY ears .	-1
I loved Ja Rule 's first album `` Venni Vetti Vecci '' so I expected this to be another great hardcore rap album . Boy was I wrong , I guess Ja decided to go pop to sell more records , what a sellout . Where 's the emotion & pain that made his first album so great ? Where 's the hardcore do n't ... with me kind of style I loved so much ? Wherever it is it 's not on this album . This CD is n't completely horrible I do like `` Put It On Me '' & `` I Cry '' because he shows some emotion , but they sound more like R & B than Rap . If you like Ja 's hardcore style from his first album you should stay far away from this , but if you like R & B you might wan na check this out .	-1
Question : When has Memphis Bleek delivered a top notch album ? Maybe his recent `` 534 '' album , thats it . As of 2006 , he 's four albums deep and seems to have n't acquired the status of some [ former ] Roc-A-Fella artists ( i.e . Beanie Sigel , Freeway , Kanye West , etc . ) As being Jay-Z 's close friend , Jay always says he 's one hit away . But giving him the benefit of the doubt , I decided to check out this album for only one reason . The hit song `` Is That Your ( Chick ) '' with Jay-Z , Missy Eliott , and Twista . It 's ironic because the song was origonally Jay 's and was supposed to be on the `` Vol . 3 : Life And Times Of S. Carter '' album , Bleek was just thrown in there ... thats why it 's subtitled `` The Lost Verses '' .Anyway there are many other songs on the album too that are below expectations . `` We Get Low '' is one of these tracks . `` Bounce B**** '' will make you laugh , because of how horrible it sounds , along with the production . And `` Everyday '' with Carl Thomas , is a prime example of how wack Bleek is . And his good friend Jay-Z does n't make anything better either on some tracks . `` Do My '' is one of those tracks that are below both Jay 's and Bleek 's expectations . But Jay , Beanie Sigel and H. Money Bags will outshine Bleek on the track `` My Mind Right '' .There are some good songs here thought that I have a feel for . `` I Get High '' is a laid back track about smoking weed while driving . Bleek and Beans will do a decent job on the song `` Change Up '' ( I would n't credit Jay-Z on what he does though ) . `` They 'll Never Play Me '' Bleek actually flips his word play and makes it a good song . The album 's closer `` In My Life '' is a real good emotional track that I like very much.As you can hear , Bleek can pull some tracks on his own on this album , but he fails to do on others . In most songs that he makes with a guest , he is outshined ( see next album M.A.D.E. ) . I wo n't lie though , Bleek has had a somewhat successful career , because he stood in Jay-Z 's shadow . Trust me , if he was on his own , he would have fallen off real fast , and would have never have made it to `` 534 '' . I guess if you 're a Bleek fan or want to hear one of his albums , go ahead and cop this . Otherwise , save your money.Lyrics : CProduction : C+Guest Appearances : B-Musical Vibes : C-Overall : CFav Tracks : I Get High , My Mind Right ( Remix ) , They 'll Never Play Me , Is That Your ( Chick ) [ The Lost Verses ] , In My LifePeace Everyone !	-1
Diz album has to be a joke , right ? Memphis bleek 's `` the understanding '' sounds like crap and the beats ? Terrible . F*ck cocka-fella records . Why yall support diz kind of trash when there 's much better music to listing to ? Idiots .	-1
As a matter of fact this cd is WACK . Memphis Bleek is one of the ( if not THE ) wackest rappers to ever touch the mic . I ca n't see how anyone likes him because he is not good . He is an awful rapper . Timbaland sells this album with his track Is That Yo Chick . It features Twista , Jay-Z , and Missy . Memph Bleek almost ruins it with his verses ( & quot ; him hot , him not & quot ; I know three years olds who can do that ) , but the other rhymers thankfully save this song . This album would have been much better without Bleek rapping at all . Do My ? I ca n't even believe this sorry trash track EVER got played ANYWHERE . Beanie Sigel drops some nice verses throughout but otherwise stay away . Unless you are REALLY a HARDCORE fan , this does n't even warrant a burning . Just pass on it all together and forget it ever came out . If you already have it Ill tell you what to do with it . Do You remember that game on Nintendo where they would throw the disc in the air and you would have to shoot it before it fell down ? Thats what I did and thats what you should do .	-1
Oh boy ! Memphis was supposed to be the real , that was coming from Jay 's mouth years ago , before the truth was leaked . When we actually heard him and the majority of us were unimpressed . Originally , Sauce Money was going to be the next Jay , and actually had the potential . But we know Jay makes some questionable moves . I do n't even try and figure this sh*t out . This album is Memphis 's second . Apparently the first time around , nobody cared . I will give Jay credit , he does n't simply drop an artist when they do n't do well . For whatever reason , he believes in this man and is sticking behind him . I can say as a life long lover oh Hip-Hop . This album did not a damn thing for me . Memphis is n't wack , but he is just not up to par , or even close . He reminds me of a cheap Jay Z knock off . Somewhat like Carl Thomas reminds me of a cheap Brian McKnight knockoff . Boring , uninspired rhymes , stupid hooks . Production that makes my head hurt . It 's pretty funny when I think how Memphis is talkin about being the man , and being rich . When his `` boss '' is laughing while he counts the ends he got pimping him.My suggestion , Sign Kane Jay . He is the reason you 're an emcee , HE put your Burrow on the map . And he is the originator of all that stuff you talk about today , only he was doing it well over a decade ago.Album Highlights : the silence between the tracks , and when it was over .	-1
Everyone I 've ran into that owns this CD said they are unhappy that they spent money on this piece of burnt wax . I even listened to the album myself and their claims were justified . I do not recommend this album to anyone and I suggest you stay away from it at all costs . Do n't waste your money and do n't be fooled by overbudgeted videos that intice you to this trash .	-1
`` Do n't compare me to Jay-Z ... '' Memphis Bleeks commands on `` They 'll Never Play Me '' , the 11th track on his album `` The Understanding '' . In some sense , that is reasonable request . An artist should stand or fall on his own merits . However , it is inevitable that Bleek would be compared to his mentor , not because of his status as Jigga 's one-time understudy , but because Jay-Z is the yardstick by which most MCs in the Mafioso rap sub-genre are measured.Bleek may as well demand that listeners not compare him to AZ , Nas , the Notorious B.I.G. , Raekwon , or any other MC that 's ever picked up the mic and spit about pushing weight and bagging broads . In truth , it would be better for him if we did n't . Although Bleek is n't terrible , he comes across as rather average in terms of both concept and flow . His subject matter is mundane ( by hip hop standards ) and his delivery is all right , but it 's nothing special . His lyrics definitely lack complexity , and this is never more evident than when he 's rhyming alongside his former mentor ( Jigga ) who makes appearances on no less than four of this album 's tracks.All in all , Bleek , while competent , fails to stand out from the crowd .	-1
the understanding , the 2nd installment from roc a fella artist memphis bleek , does n't exactly make the cut . from a beat perspective it 's great , ( futuristic sounding ) but lyrically it is the pits . true , memphis bleek has a voice filled with energy but where 's the depth ? his lines sound like they could be written by a little kid . plus he bites too much . & quot ; bout it bout it & quot ; and & quot ; soulja & quot ; have been used one too many times by the no limit camp and you see the result of what 's happened to them . plus it is said that jay-z writes his lyrics . frankly , i just miss the memphis bleek that spit on the hard knock life intro , & quot ; hand it down & quot ; THAT was a lyricist . i rate this album 2 stars because i know memph is sellin himself short and can come with it a lot better than on this attempt .	-1
I 've always held the philosophy you are what you 're entertained by . So , those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women . And speaking of women ... Ludacris never met one who was n't a h-o.Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men : you demean and look down on women for being h-oes , yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you 'll have no problems getting laid . But then , you 're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you , so you go and find a `` nice girl '' because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her . But then you cheat on her with a `` bad girl '' because h-oes need h-oes ; but then you ca n't respect the `` bad girl '' because she 's a slut , so you go back to the `` good girl . '' But she 's not nasty enough for you , so then ... around and around we go . Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.He 's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes . It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it . Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever . I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women -- ALL women -- then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.What 's the music like ? Well I 'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What 's Your Fantasy . That 's it.Addendum : 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I 'm `` wasting ' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews . Well , first of all , if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it , everything on Amazon would have 5 stars , which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.Secondly , I do n't like Ludacris . I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect ; but he does n't . My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is , and I feel that argument is valid . There 's no way to critique Ludacris ' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women . Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us ? I 'm biased against him because he 's biased against me . So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e .	-1
Fatboy Slim 's third album is surprisingly bad . From his first two albums , it was clear that he had a knack for mixing hard-to-find samples and making them sound like his own songs , and the songs always made you get up and dance . But this album makes you do the opposite.The only song really worth listening to is the second single , `` Weapon Of Choice '' , which features vocals from Bootsy Collins . And that 's the song that really made people buy this album because I do n't think people were running to get it because of the first single , the boring `` Sunset '' . Another all right song is `` Demons '' with Macy Gray , but it seems like it should be on Macy 's album.Most of the rest of the album is uncreative . Electronica and dance artists are supposed to mix verses and beats , not lift whole songs like in `` Ya Mama '' and `` Talking Bout My Baby '' . Then there 's `` Star 69 '' , which features verses that should have never been sampled : `` They know what is what/But they do n't know what is what/They just strut/What the F. '' My sentiments exactly.The rest of the songs ... actually , ALL of the songs ( except for `` Weapon Of Choice '' ) sound like generic remixes of `` Acid 8000 '' , the last song on his last album . And the 12-minute song `` Song For Shelter '' is a little hard to get into . I do n't know what Slim was doing on this album ; it does n't really sound like he was doing anything . I seriously hope he does better on his next album .	-1
Fatboy Slim set his own bar too high with & quot ; you 've come a long way , baby & quot ; . The only way for Norman to evolve and escape the high expectations set by his former work is to evolve into a new direction . He chooses to literally spoil his own style by collaborating with Macy Gray and Bootsy Collins . Whether the already mentioned collaborations are fine is questionable . The fact that they are not techno at all , is however , not ! The rest of the album also aims to sound original and makes a large step back from the quality of & quot ; you 've come ... & quot ; . Although this album has an enormous commercial success , it is much much worse than Fatboy 's last work .	-1
His previous album `` You 've come along way baby '' was so good and original but now it seems like he 's spending more time on his music videos then on the music , many songs on this Cd are also based on samples from older songs like `` Star 69 '' and `` Weapon Of Choice '' and `` Sunset '' some say he 's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why do n't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of . Norman Cook is a dance artist and there 's no way he should try to do something he is n't used to . Bootsy Collins `` Weapons of choise '' and Macy Gray `` Love life '' is Cd , so does the Voice of Jim Morrison on `` Sunset '' but they can not save this album from fiasco , to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place , it 's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here . `` Yo Mama '' got a cool sound though , but he could have tried to do something more with that song . `` Song for shelter '' is dark and slow aswell , think he even released it on single . Let 's just wait for a better time , this album was really a flop .	-1
Another album from our dear Mr Zoe Ball , wow , it has Bootsy Collins and our hottest neo-soul diva Macy Gray featured on it , yeah , it is different from the last album , but still , Fatboy Slim is forever Fatboy Slim , he is neither the creater of Big Beat music nor is he one of the most innovative . This might be a much better album than his awful 'You 've come a long way ' , still , I smell much cheese in it . Come on , he ca n't even beat Chemical Brothers in terms of sonic experimentation , you expect him to experiment ? ? It is one of those insipid HUGE dance albums of the year , together with Roni Size 's 'In The Mode ' and Moby 's 'Play : The B-Sides ' , all of those albums have GREAT marketing strategy and most dreary music . I rather stick to my Photek and Amon Tobin , sorry ! Heard that he is not going to make music again , if it is not a stunt for Mr Ball to sell more copies of that trash , then I will say : Horray ! ! ! Hey , Mr Ball , the exit is there !	-1
I think her voice is too nasal and it grates on my nerves after a short time of listening . I also do n't like the beat box-sounding music in the background of most of these songs . They seem to also lack direction at times and fail to flow as a song should .	-1
Horrible album from a no-talent zero . Yeah I 'm sure she 'll be around for decades to come with this laughable effort . I 'm Like A Tird is a horrid piece of pop and only appeals to brain dead Clear Channel listeners who think Justin Timberlake & amp ; Pink are & quot ; gods. & quot ; Look for her sophmore effort to fail miserably in the upcoming weeks .	-1
Another example of the mainstream music industry trying to force us to like something . No , just because something is on the radio does not mean you have to listen to it . Nelly Furtado is getting so much media push it 's sickening . Manufactured pop stardom at its finest here . This is no different than N*Sync or the Backstreet Boys . It 's just a different flavor . *yawn* Can we turn off the Macy Gray cloning machine befor it gets out of control ? bzzzzzzzt ... too late . one star for the production quality and one star for the album packaging . that 's it .	-1
That 's right . If you liked Naked Gun , you 'll like Naked Gun , Part Deux . That 's how I describe this album by Nelly Fartado . Sounding like Alanis Morrisette is a GOOD reason to stay away from this . Although a few tracks are good , it 's not enough to turn the entire album around . I feel cheated when I buy an album and only one or two songs qualify as singles and the rest blow . Do yourself a favor and just listen to your little sister scream .	-1
The music of `` Whoa Nelly '' can not be faulted too much , but the vocals and lyrics that are tacked onto it can be . A lot . Nelly Furtado has some small measure of potential , but this album is hampered by so much terrible stuff that it does n't even rise to `` mediocre . `` A few of the songs , such as the likable `` I 'm Like A Bird '' and the soft ballad `` Scared of You , '' show that Furtado might manage to do more than she does . But the rest of the songs are deeply flawed -- the nasal and rather bitter `` S*** on the Radio , '' the annoying no-high-points `` Trynna Finda Way '' with its surreal monologue ( `` the beauty of my youth is gone but the chemicals remain '' ? ) , the overemphasized `` Baby Girl , '' dismal `` Party , '' and the self-satisfied `` Turn Off The Light '' ( `` They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough '' ) .While it 's noteworthy and to be admired that Furtado writes her own songs , it 's not so laudable that she does n't know her limitations . A few of the songs are quite good , but the lyrics tend towards trite and repetitive . Some examples of repetition are repeating `` Party 's just begun '' and `` Trynna finda way '' over and over . Often she fills gaps in songs with very unimpressive lines that exist merely to rhyme ( where did she get the ghastly line `` to be one da-dum with my own star under my own sun '' ? Or `` this fire was more funner than proper grammar '' ? Or `` I say what I mean but I do n't mean what I say/well , well , it 's fine out today '' ? ) The result is that her lyrics often have the shallowness of ordinary pop , but none of the polish.Furtado 's vocals also are n't up to the job . A stronger , richer voice could whip the mediocre songs into shape . But her rather nasal voice is apparently limited in range ; it never rises very high , nor does she ever hold a note for very long . ( When singing `` Scared of You , '' her idea of holding a note seems to be singing `` too '' as `` too-woo-woo , woo-woo . '' ) You do n't need a perfect voice to handle professional singing , but Furtado is reaching for something she simply ca n't handle.While the music in itself is quite catchy and pleasant to listen to , Furtado 's mediocre vocals and trite songs make `` Whoa Nelly '' a pain to listen to . Not recommended .	-1
One rainy day I spent at Borders , I listened to this c.d . as I had liked & quot ; LIke a bird & quot ; when I heard the first time on mtv . That was probably 8 months ago . For some insane reason , I bopped along for quite a while.I got the disc for Christmas and have listened to it once ( I do n't think I could handle it ever again ) . It was like listening to someone scrap their nails down a chalkboard . She has the most annoying voice . It sounds like she is singing through her nosy..VERY NASALLY ... Some say she has a unique voice , it 's unique alright . but not good . I found the songs so repetitive..How many times is she going to turn out the light ? Maybe if you are a rap fan , you might appreciate this more as she seems to have hip/hop and rap influences and it 's pretty obvious in her music. & quot ; Like a Bird & quot ; is the one song that everyone knows and the only song that she does n't sound so whiny . I saw the video before the album even really hit the stores and I really liked it.It seems that some c.d . 's sound better in the store , but once you actually own it and listen , it just is n't the same.I have no intention of listening to this c.d . again ! I 'm sure a lot of people appreciate her very unique voice , but I am just perturbed . I wonder how many people have already sold their copy to a used record store ?	-1
Overrated to the extreme , this debut is not bad for a mainstream pop album , but it ` s hardly as good as many claim . So Nelly Furtado makes a somewhat interesting mix here , combining diverse influences from hip-hop , bossa nova , trip-hop to fado or R & amp ; B . While it works at parts , it still is way too uneven and inconsistent as a whole . Furtado ` s voice ranges from exotic and peculiar to tiresome and irritating , delivering a flawed hit-and-miss effort that at least tries to offer something new and refreshing to the current pop scenario . The album has a couple of good moments , like the melodic opener & quot ; Hey , Man ! & quot ; , the urban & quot ; Trynna Finda Way & quot ; or the catchy single & quot ; Turn off the Light & quot ; , while most of the other songs are just curious yet nothing special experiments . Given that & quot ; Whoa , Nelly ! & quot ; is just a debut , it indeed shows some promise , presenting a sometimes appealing roots fusion . It ` s also interesting to see how she incorporates her portuguese backgrounds into her music.Deserves a listen , still it ` s far from a keeper .	-1
I know that I am going to get some negative feedback on this one . But I do have something nice to say . I bought the album and really wanted to throw it out the car window . I loved the single , like everyone else , but the rest of the album literally lacks direction . Nearly every song sounds exactly the same . The beatss are cool , but for how long . I do think she is creative and does have a powerful voice . I also have to credit her for writing her own stuff which is always impressive to me no matter how bad the song is . I will wait and see what she comes up with next . the nice thing that I have to say is that I did see her open up for David Gray and she is much better live than on record . Hopefully she will be able to incorporate her stage presence into her sophmore effort .	-1
I had no idea who the heck Nelly was , while at work on a long drive , the guy i was with had a choice of 3 CD 's , this one , some Brazilian love CD and god knows what the other was , for some reason I chose this one.Instantly from the moment it started , it gave me a headache , who is Nelly ? How did she get a record deal ? Her voice was irritating , her lyrics where trash , and what is with the side singer that sounds like he is talking through a paper mega phone ? I could not wait to get back to the office and get the hell out of the car away from this % # ! % .Every single song has the same annoying and irritating beat , every song sounded the same ( bad ) and there was nothing on this album that could make me understand who the hell could listen to this crap .	-1
I do n't get the hype behind this girl . She 's pretty , and the song I 'm Like A Bird is not bad , but the rest of this cd is a mess . It goes off in too many directions and tried to please too many genres in the music industry . That song Turn Out The Light is annoying with the lyrics : & quot ; bubbly bubbly bubbly go down down down we 're gon na turn out the light & quot ; . I mean who the hell wrote that , a little child ? And that other single about her radio is just garbage and ending of the song hurts my ears . Nelly 's voice is horribly nasal and irritating to listen to . I 'm embarrased to be Canadian and hear people say she 's one of the most talented things to come out of Canada in years . If that 's the case then i 'm scared . REALLY scared ! They hype this girl is getting is undeserved . My prediction is one more cd from her and then no one will give a damn about her any more . Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame , Nelly . Your days are numbered !	-1
The almost-retro front cover of Nelly Furtado 's Whoa , Nelly ! fooled me . Between the image of her lying sedately in the grass and the songwriting credits in the liner notes I was sure i 'd be hearing some folky music . First track `` Hey , Man ! '' raised my expectations for the album incredibly high with Nelly 's slightly rasping voice tangled in ringing acoustic guitar and a playful string sample . It all sounded like Patti Rothberg channelled through Madonna 's childish `` Hey Jesse . '' Fun , pretty , perfect . An album full of songs like this would have made my yearly top five easily.Nelly did n't quite deliver what i was hoping for . `` On The Radio '' has unmusical verses that launch into a ho-hum chorus.. `` Baby Girl '' just does n't cut it with totally embarrassingly unpronunced verses and popping synth percussion , although it features a decent chorus hook . Both songs are unexciting when heard on the album , but either could be the next big top 40 hit with the right promotion . `` Baby Girl '' especially fits this mold , and could be seamlessly added to any urban pop radio playlist.The problem is that the production on Whoa , Nelly ! just ca n't decide if she 's Jennifer Lopez , Macy Gray , or Patti Rothberg . Most of the time it rests uncomfortably in the middle . However , honest lyrics and a great voice are both clearly attributes that Nelly possesses and not some trifling studio trick , and both save the album from being just another pop wanna-be . `` I 'm Like A Bird '' is a definite success , sounding like a Jon Brion produced track with it 's plodding keyboards and sweet chorus . It 's followed by two more pseudo-Lopez tracks , the overly agressive `` Turn Off the Light '' easily better than the flat `` Trynna Finda Way . '' The bare bones rhythm of `` Party '' is more engaging than either of the former two , but still not quite perfect . By contrast , `` Well , Well '' is about as good as the album gets after the opener , and it 's definitely better than most other pop fare released this year . `` I Will Make You Cry '' has a great churning samba riff buried beneath layered throaty vocals , and plently vitriol and lyrical flow . Album closer `` Scared of You '' is cooly perfect with its guitarra solo and classy lyrics.The disc honestly is n't too good or too bad , but i think that 's mostly the fault of Nelly 's producers . Her writing is fine and could develop into something great , and her voice is simple incredible . She achieves some great pop moments on the disc , but they 're too muddled with stylistic confusion on the other tracks to effect the album as a whole . I wholly look forward to a second effort from this emerging artist .	-1
i know every1 is going to hate hearing this but this is my opinion ... i know all these so called great artists and actors took pac 's written words and made music and poetry out of it , which is nice and all but its not worth your money to buy this . If you know what pac was saying in his lyrics then you know he would of wanted some of his real homiez put down some things for him and give their piece of mind instead of the cast of LION KING . Although I know the outlawz and mac mall are on here with a couple of others , but I would loved to hear some real gz put down some stuff for him that had rolled with him to the end . So in my opinion its not worth the money .	-1
It really is a pathetic tribute to a increadible artist . Tupac deserves more than this half job , weak tribute . I 'm a huge 2Pac fan , and I 'm telling you personaly , do n't buy this CD . This is n't a 2Pac CD , and it should n't be called one , becuase he would never make such a horrible CD .	-1
This should have been called & quot ; A Collection of poems written by Tupac , read by others & quot ; . The man him self is on the LP about 45 seconds , and that 's it . There is some good music on here , but it does n't belong on an album that makes it look as though Tupac performs the poems . If you are looking for new previously unreleased Tupac songs , look elsewhere . He does n't even rap on this LP . If you are trying to collect every one of his albums , make this the last one you buy .	-1
I have absolutely no problem understanding why these guys have had such a hard time breaking the American market . First of all , they write lyrics that do n't translate to Americans . Second , they sound as if they could n't care less anyway . Now , is that any way to impress the nice Americans ? Blur represent everything that Americans do n't get about English pop . They perform guitar rawk without much to provide any sense of cohesive unity , or even originality . In order to survive the extraordinarily fickle English music market , they have changed their style every two albums or so . This helped them survive on their side of the puddle , but it did n't do them any good over here . It did n't help that all of these ` stylistic ' changes hardly affected the band 's sound at all , with each incarnation leaving them sounding like any other second-rate guitar-based pop band.I 've listened to this disk five times in a row , and yet I have absolutely no idea what the hell they are going on about . Some attitude creeps through , but it never seems particularly clever ( or particularly literate ) . Some examples - `` This is the next century . The universal is free . You can find it anywhere . '' `` When I feel heavy metal , and I 'm on pins and needles , Well , I lie and I 'm easy ... '' A track like `` Tender '' features a gospel-sized chorus and is pleasant musically but is so lyrically inept that it becomes grating . Here 's its chorus ; `` Oh my baby , oh my baby , Oh , why . Oh , my , '' repeated ad infinitum . Who needs this gobbledygook ? Some songs are good , but not particularly noteworthy . `` Boys and Girls '' is a bit of disco fun . `` The Universal '' features some interesting orchestration , and `` Park Life '' is a lively stomper . `` This Is a Low '' sinks in a bit after repeated listenings , but not enough to warrant the attention I paid it . A trifle like `` To the End '' combines bits of Burt Bacharach and Serge Gainsbourg , but results only in a mediocre lift of the `` Midnight Cowboy '' theme.Elsewhere , the music and lyrics are so English that it 's almost alienating . `` Beetlebum , '' for instance , is ludicrous ; `` Beetlebum , because you 're young , she 's a gun . Now what you 've done , Beetlebum ... ... '' What the heck is that supposed to mean ? Do they get this in England ? The extra live disk that comes with this set helps to explain things a bit , especially when you hear the English crowd going crazy and singing along , but Americans will probably continue to scratch their heads . `` This Is a Low '' is even less clear - `` On the Malin head , Blackpool looks blue and red , and the Queen , she 's gone ` round the bend . Jumped off Lands End . '' It is no wonder that these guys lost their battle with Oasis for supremacy . B- Tom Ryan	-1

This is BY FAR the world album Jay-Z has ever put out . He keeps distancing himself from the great rapper that he truly is . This album just does n't have the same feel as any other Jay-Z album at all . Russell Simmons does n't kick the album off with his standard & quot ; Okay I 'm reloaded & quot ; ( a Jay-Z tradition ever since Reasonable Doubt ) . The style of rapping is SO boring and totally different than any other Jay-Z album released . The gimic of Roc La Familia is a weak one , I would have much rather heard all JHovah throughout , Bleek and Siegel get annoying as either one or the other is on ALMOST every track . There are only about 3 songs that I will listen to off this album , which is totally different from any other Jay-Z cd where you can listen to just about the whole thing all the way through . I was so disappointed with this ... I am a huge Jay-Z fan and there was no way I was NOT going to buy this album , but I would advise anyone else not to waste their money . Jay-Z is a changed rapper and as much as I hate to say it , he is going for the money-grubbing pop scene like DMX did . Finding true rappers is very rare now ... basically Wu is the only group to still keep things real . I just hope this & quot ; Team R.O.C. & quot ; thing does n't turn into another Cash Money situation where they pump out albums just for a quick sell . If you really like Jay-Z , find Vol . 1 ( also his best ) and his first release Reasonable Doubt . He was much better when he was underground and unknown , which is the case with most rappers . Rocafella is boring , end of story .	-1
All the songs sound the same , and it get 's old fast . The best songs off the LP are & quot ; I Just Wan na Love U & quot ; and & quot ; Parking Lot Pimpin. & quot ; Jay-Z is quite skilled , but if only he would actually use his skill as best as he can . Basicly , if you have bought any of his past albums , you basicly already have this one . They all sound the same . There just are n't any new ideas , and nothing is groud-breaking ( Pimpin ' , Money , and Hoes , there are more things to life then these ... . )	-1
Dont even think about buying this cd because it is a waste of your money and time.There is only one good song on the entire album and the rest of it sucks.Poor beats , weak lyrics and boring sound production.He is the most over rated rapper in all history and has fooled alot of people into supporting his junk.Hip hop will eventually meet its demise when people wake up and realize how untalented of a genre it really is.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE ! ! !	-1
Two words of advice : Lose Beans . His flow is garbage . He 's better free-styling than on wax but , even so , it 's still soft as hell . On & quot ; Change the Game & quot ; , he actually utters the lines & quot ; Get your wig pushed back by the wig-push-backer. & quot ; What ? And Bleek is aight but too immature to take the throne after Jay steps down .	-1
Well when your intro beat is better than 80 % of your album you know it 's not going to be a great album . Jay Z needs to go back to how he was in Vol 1 and stop doing albums for only money and start entertaining his fans . Download it , do n't buy it .	-1
Rap has gone way too commercial and Jay-Z who is actually a talented rapper is only making `` me , myself and i '' lyrics bragging about how many chicks he got , how nice cars he bought , how much cash he can spend , what clothes he wears and how many parties he makes in his 100 million dollar house . This is not something we care about . This is a annoying cd where Jay is just talking [ nonsense ] which ends up with some soul hook . We got a decent R. Kelly song `` Guilty before proven Innocent '' but that ca n't save this poor mass production cd .	-1
Jay-Z has no depth in his rappin ' . All his songs are about how much ice he has , cars , groupies , and other shallow concepts . Not only that , all his songs sound the same , have the same boring feel to them . I wonder if the leading age in buying Jay-Z records is in the ninety-year-old senior citizens category . His lyrics were at one time good but he 's totally fallen off since his second album . The track with Snoop , & quot ; Get Your Mind Right Mami & quot ; could 've been a lot better , it was n't very impressive , mediocre at BEST . And it was the best song on the CD . Let me tell you , if Jay-Z is the leader in today 's commercial hip-hop world , we 're in a lot of trouble . I do n't like hearing about Kurupt and Daz doing a song with him either . I admit & quot ; Change The Game & quot ; remix with Kurupt and Daz was good but they do n't need Jay-Z to sell records . Stay Away From This .	-1
this album is total garbage , this is his worst work yet , not to mention all his lyrics surround his big pile of money , im not hating , im just saying Jayz is making a killing off of people who have no clue as of to what hip hop really is . Jayz is an intelligent business man cause he has white fans and every 15 year old saying & quot ; o my god mom you have got ta get me that new Jay Z cd & quot ; and doesnt even have a clue whats on it ... .. that is my point JayZ is almost as bad as eminem i would give it negative stars if i could dont buy this ENHANCED GARBAGE ... .	-1
I had Vol . 3 be Jay-Z 's worst . Even though it is a Jay Z album , there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek , Talib Kweli , and Amil . Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff . Jay-Z puts some good material despite , like `` I Just Wan na Love U '' .Not a good album . Very commercialized . Do n't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan .	-1

bwahaaaaaahaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahha NO SERIOUSLY im not finished HOLDING MY SIDES YET BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh man to actually think their are kids out there who consider this music . I know im going to quit my job and paint my face with clown make up and change my name to weakho The @ $ $ clown ( hey it wouldnt be any more ridiculous than any of these other lame retards names . colton grundy ? ? ? ) and I should have millions by the end of the year from all the fuggaloes who are obviously smokin punds of weed out of a pipe to be diggin this junk . Canibus or asheru could rip these weak retards inside of one verse minus 500,000,000,000,000 stars . peace to all the real Hip hoppers out there	-1
Their only asset is that the were affiliated with the fallen legend Pac . If you are willing to buy an album based on that , do so , If you are looking for a dope album , look elsewhere . If with Pac , these guys ... How many albums can you make about killing people ? I know that this is entertainment , but even Stallone and makes a different type of move every once and a while . & quot ; Smash & quot ; is the only song that I like because BadAzz and Fetty Chico ( if you are a fan , you know who this is ) are in it .	-1
I like Bone a lot , but this album is not very good at all . I 'm not tryin to hate on em or anything , I have The Collection Vol . 1 , and that deserves 5 stars . There are a few good songs like & quot ; Thug Luv & quot ; w/2pac , & quot ; Look Into My Eyes ( Remix ) & quot ; , and & quot ; Hook It Up & quot ; , but the rest were pretty weak . There are a lot of other great songs that could have been put on this album . They should have used some more classics like they did on Vol . 1 . This is not the worst CD I have ever heard in my life , but I expected more from a great group like Bone .	-1
QB Finest sums up the problems in the world of hip-hop today . Every big name rapper has to have a clique . And in this clique , most of the rappers are average at best , and som are just boring . Here , the only member of Nas ' QB clique i would want to hear more of is Nashiem . I do n't know if Nas is just so good he outshines them ( like on Da Bridge 2001 ) , or if these guys are as weak as i think they are . Not that they lack teqnique , but songs like Our Way , we Live This and Break Bread are just lyricaly boring and have no concept . However Nas does return to old form with the should be classic Find Ya Wealth , and comes with a lyrical intensity not seen in years on evey verse ( especially with Prodigy ) .Honestly , the only non-Nas cut on hear that in legit is the Prodigy Freestyle ( track # 10 , and I 'm not even a Mobb Deep fan . Do n't beleiv e the hype . The only peolpe who should buy this disc are Nas fans just trying to get tracks with him rapping on it .	-1
I 'm changing my original rating from 5s to 2s . This is not a very good CD . I thought it was boring .	-1
... he 'd be rolling in his grave . Ender 's Game is one of the best books I 've ever read and when Chris Carabba refers to it in one of his songs , it really irritates me . This is not & quot ; true emotion. & quot ; It is someone whining and crying about love gone wrong , something that gets old very quickly . Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel ( bless his soul ) make REAL honest acoustic music . Instead of & quot ; I miss your bed , I never sleep & quot ; it 's & quot ; what a beautiful face I have found in this place that is circling all 'round the sun. & quot ; Notice the difference between a man missing his old girlfriend 's bed and a man recognising the beauty of a face he may never see again . You decide which one is wiser . You decide who is the real poet.Feel free to vote this review not helpful . I am only trying to tell you the truth .	-1
I used to like Dashboard a lot , but I do n't know ... it was just a phase I guess . Although I always preferred the pre-Things to post-Things Dashboard , I do n't like any of it now . At first , you will fall for it : the songwriting , the backup singers ... but then you wont like it anymore . The later songs are n't as good , and with only 2-4 songs I REALLY like , I just do n't recommend it . Go download some of the songs . I do n't hate Dashboard : Chris is a good songwriter and singer , but I do n't really like this album .	-1
I saw one of Elton John 's solo shows in 1999 , and it was absolutely fantastic , with a classic mixture of classic hits and album-cut classics . I was hoping that this cd was going to be exactly like that show . I soon found out that I should n't have had such big expectations.Filmed and recorded over two nights at Manhattan 's landmark Madison Square Garden ( thus making the title quite ironic ) , it just featured standard fare like Candle In The Wind and Crocodile Rock . There are also several unremarkable duets . Mary J. Blige and Kiki Dee are just plain stellar on their performances with Captain Fantastic , but the rest are just filler . Bryan Adams ruins Sad Songs , and Ronan Keating massacres Your Song . But the major disappointment is Anatascia 's miserable performance of Saturday Night 's Alright For Fighting . If you really want to see a great Elton show first-hand , then get the dvd of this concert , which features 27 songs . Elton resurrects older songs here like Little Jeannie , Blue Eyes , and Club At The End Of The Street . My advice : skip this disc	-1
Although there is a bunch of great Elton 's early classics and also the sound of the band is really big , Elton 's voice is depressing ! ! Even his outfits do not remember the great 70 's and early 80 's Elton John 's , I mean the personality that he used to transmit on stage . That hairstyle he 's wearing is ridiculous ! ! But the mean problem is about his voice . Elton has better live albums , such as `` Here and There '' or `` 17-11-70 '' . Sorry , for me this one can go directly to the trash can .	-1
Elton John is a great talent but like many other great talents for whatever reason he gets caught making safe product & amp ; this is no exception to the rule.Live this is worth checking out but to have to hear him being paired with others & amp ; just making by the numbers product does him an injustice.His Talent should be about challenging his craft not doing what he could do in his sleep .	-1
Xzibit 's Restless gets worse and worse with each listen . The first time I was a little generous on this album and it received three stars . But now going back trying to listen to it ... it just aint hittin on nothing . This album is complete garbage . I had so many high expectations for this album ... but am extremely disappointed . There 's only about three good songs . Xzibit 's aggressiveness and lyrical prowess is nowhere to be found , the beats are too commercialized and poppy sounding ... it just makes me want to throw up . To me this is the equivalent of Faboulous ' album , in terms of wackness ... and I would n't recommend it all ... .not even to burn it from a friend . His other albums are exponentially greater than this trash ... Lets just hope his next album ` Man Vs. Machine ' is nothing like this . Do n't buy this ... and avoid it all costs .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , Xzibit used to be quite the ill MC back in the day but this collection is just too overproduced and overhyped for words . Too much bravado , too less substance . I guess the album title for this CD suits it since Xzibit and his production team seemed & quot ; restless & quot ; in the studio while recording these lackluster tracks . The only people who get & quot ; five stars & quot ; in this case is his record label for overhyping and overpromoting this unworthy album like crazy .	-1
I kept hearing Xzibit this & amp ; Xzibit that so finally after hearing this set i ca n't figure out all the Hype ? He has a Allright flow but nothing here shows me what all the hype has been about.as much as I Dig DJ QUIK & amp ; I Respect Dr.Dre they ca n't save this set.despite all the Hype something is missing here for me .	-1
Xzibit 's debut was awesome . his 2nd was very good . this being his 3rd was OK , nothing special . and obviously man vs machine has to be his worst album . Anyway , onto the review , this overall was a major disappointment - it just does n't have enough good songs on it . Sure , there are some gems , such as X , Kenny Parker Show , Get Your Walk On , and Sorry I 'm Away So Much , but thats just about it . There are some not bad/average tracks , then the rest are pathetic . Alkaholic is one of the worst songs , it has one of the most corniest beats ever , and the lyrical content is pathetic . Only buy this if you are a die-hard Xzibit fan . If you want Xzibit at his best , then get At The Speed Of Life , and 40 Dayz 40 Nightz , because they are both far better than this .	-1
I got this album because I heard IVY 's song Worry About You as the theme for Kingdom Hospital . I figured the album would be filled with more haunting vocals ... but I was fairly disapointed . Worry About You is a good song of course , and so is Midnight Sun , Lucy Dose n't Love You , and Digging Your Scene . But for me , the majority of the album is just filled with bad lyrics , cheaply sounding Dido immitating vocals , and songs that drag along .	-1
The music here is very good ; haunting , moody , ethereal . At times the lo-fi recording even adds to the ambience . When John starts singing , he loses me . When he sings in his normal voice , I can get used to it . It detracts from the music anyway , but I can handle it . But then on too many songs he reaches for a falsetto he can 't pull off and makes the songs unlistenable . If this were an instrumental CD I 'd give it 4 stars for the style and his amazing ability to play the guitar . But the songs have words and John sings them and he should n't . I have listened to this CD over and over , but his voice never gets any better and in the end it lessens the songs for me .	-1
Cydonia is comprised of short pop songs , often with vocals , that are more content to safely tread water than explore the ocean . This was nothing like previous Orb releases and for me was my first disappointment with the Orb . In the past the Orb created sonic worlds that blended into one another with a kind of serendipitous cohesion . But alas this album has no organic flow , no overarching sonic concept . It sounds rushed , offhand and is content to imitate the trends of electronica/pop circa 2001 rather than innovate . For example the boring and pointless female pop vocals found throughout the album tether the music to a formulaic pop syntax that is neither groundbreaking , pleasant , nor anything but bland . In fact the vocals sound out of tune much of the time so let 's add irritating to the list of adjectives . I do n't have anything against The Orb trying something different only that they keep up a high level of imagination and quality . If they wanted to make discrete pop songs , so be it . But Cydonia fails to be anything but imitative , there 's no spark , no wit , no exploratory whimsy . With this album The Orb ceased to be leaders in electronic music and , to my ears anyway , lost their muse and it killed the band for me .	-1
Sadly , I have to agree with some other people here : This is not the comeback it should have been . We all know that it always takes mastermind LX Paterson a few years to complete the Orb 's albums , however , the anticipation that greeted & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; was relatively small compared to the Orb 's second and third album . What remains strange is the fact that The Orb had given up all remix projects in the late-'90s , so the wait for & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; seemed even longer . It 's not impossible to tell where the time went -- the production and audio quality of & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; are as good as one would expect from an Orb album , but what feels shocking is how this new release feels like no leap forward in terms of sonic construction and songwriting . Unlike the Orb 's earlier efforts , it provides no answers to the question , & quot ; Electronic music . Where next ? & quot ; . Unable to shed the weight of their brilliant history , The Orb produced a backward-looking and self-referential record where nearly every track contains an element we have already heard on an earlier Orb album . There 's no denying in that it does offer some interesting variations on Orb themes and does move between the genres quite seamlessly , but considering that & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; arrives more than three years after & quot ; Orblivion & quot ; , that is a let-down for such a progressive project like The Orb . Even the song titles themselves are not as unique as those of earlier albums ; & quot ; Ghostdancing & quot ; is the name of a Simple Minds song , & quot ; Terminus & quot ; is taken from Photek 's last album & quot ; Solaris & quot ; , & quot ; Thursday 's keeper & quot ; seems to be inspired by either David Bowie or Tanita Tikaram , and so on . This may be forgivable if & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; had to share a killer batch of songs , but even on that level the album falls a little flat . In my opinion , there 's only one song which is eminently listenable and satisfying ; the first single & quot ; Once more & quot ; . It 's a deep , funky ambient-house song with floating melodies and soulful singing , the latter being perfectly integrated into the music . A worthy successor to the Orb 's first vocal hit , & quot ; Little fluffy clouds & quot ; , & quot ; Once more & quot ; is a total winner of beat , sound , and arrangement ! Unfortunately , the decision to include some Bjork-ish vocals does not always make for a great listening experience , as & quot ; Ghostdancing & quot ; , & quot ; Centuries & quot ; , and & quot ; Plum Island & quot ; prove . These songs have been turned into fairly lackluster dance takes -- listless female vocals with some electronic burblings in the background and weak rhythms . It would be a mistake to say that the rest of & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; is a complete failure ; & quot ; Promis & quot ; flirts successfully with Eastern-tinged sounds so typical for the Orb 's earlier albums , while the 8-minute & quot ; Hamlet of Kings & quot ; comes up with a more engaging bass figure and stronger melodic flair . The 36-second snippet & quot ; 1.1.1 & quot ; seems to be a pun on The Orb 's former side-project 777 , and & quot ; Thursday 's keeper & quot ; brings out the band 's funny side with lots of vocal samples . The musical low-points , however , mean that the Orb meander directionlessly for far too long , the best example being the 11-minute ambient mega-work & quot ; Terminus & quot ; : The band simply does n't sound as innovative as they once did with & quot ; A huge ever.. & quot ; ( my all-time favorite chill-out track ) , thus playing tuneless and uninspired soundscapes . And this does mean that there 's simply too much mediocre material on this disc for anyone but die-hard Orb followers . The first few Orb albums ( and some of their remixes ) were real landmarks in the history of electronic music , picking up the aesthetics of '70s space-rock and ambient and mixing it with modern rhythms and samples . Put simply , & quot ; Cydonia & quot ; lacks the magic of these efforts and confirms a growing belief that The Orb have evolved into a very skillful but somehow dispassionate and boring 'dinosaur band ' , like Yes and Pink Floyd . My advice : Forget this album and buy the CD-single & quot ; Once more & quot ; instead .	-1
There 's really not much to cheer about with this album . Time seems to have left Orb behind . Gone is the long , spacey ambient flotation and we are left with music that is more dub with female vocals more than anything else . I do n't like the feel of this record though there seems to be plenty of other reviewers who disagree . Can anybody really say they like the cover ?	-1
I 'm a big fan of Sade and I do n't expect anything but the best from her . Unfortunately , she has fallen short and `` By Your Side '' has to be her worse single ever . It 's not jazzy , it 's not groovy , and there is no bass . Who the heck wants to hear a twangy guitar ? Skip this lousy song .	-1
Jefferson Airplane / Long John Silver : `` Milk Train '' is the best song on this album . It is a wonderful Papa John Creach song with lyrics added to it . This album is fuzzy and loud , which is fine , but what kills the album is its ridiculously PREACHY and ignorant lyrics . Honestly , by the time you hear half of the last track ( Eat Starch Mom ) you want to throw the disc out a window . Two stars ( not even Papa John could save this one ) .	-1
One of the best ways to maintain an appreciation for a band is to start with their strongest albums first . So you work your way down until the law of diminishing returns kicks in and mediocrity becomes less appealing than some other artist 's highlights . By that measure `` Long John Silver '' is the kind of album that will appeal mostly to those so enamored of the Jefferson Airplane that they want everything the band recorded . While there 's always some pleasure to be found in the unique sound of the JA , this , their final album just did n't have the songs . You do n't have to take my word for it ; listen to the samples . The most interesting thing about this album was the cover , designed to be folded out into a big cigar box ( or something like it ) . That element of packaging appeal is lost in the CD and mp3 eras.If you 're new to the Airplane , Surrealistic Pillowis probably one of the 100 best albums of the rock era.Crown Of Creationwas also a good album , although the casual fan might be content with its highlights included on some of the compilations ( `` Lather '' , `` Greasy Heart '' , `` Crown of Creation '' , and that foreboding experiment in sound , `` Chushingura '' ) . So too with theVolunteersalbum ; any of these would be better investments to make first . If you want a single compilation,2400 Fulton Streetis probably the best track listing since it includes the live version of the song `` Volunteers '' from Woodstock . It also includes the best representative from this set , `` Eat Starch Mom '' .If you 've worked your way through the rest of the Airplane 's catalog and you 're still hungry for more , this album may be right for you . Otherwise I 'd say move on and try some of their more mainstream 70s things likeRed Octopus . Something may have been lost in the transition to the 70s but at least with `` Red Octopus '' the songs were there , and Papa John Creach 's instrumental `` Git Fiddler '' may have been the most entertaining thing the Jefferson Starship ever did in their 70s afterlife .	-1
Sheiks latest effort & quot ; Phantom Moon & quot ; goes deeper and deeper into his dark side.I have to disagree with the rest of the critics regarding & quot ; Barely Breathing & quot ; which was his catchiest song , and strongest effort to date next to & quot ; She Runs Away & quot ; and & quot ; Serena & quot ; .His next effort got progressively worse and boring with & quot ; Humming & quot ; , and the record buyers ran away in droves , and it shows here again in & quot ; Phantom Moon & quot ; .I am sorry but I like the POP side of Duncan Sheik , and I still ca n't believe that & quot ; Barely Breathing & quot ; almost did n't make it to his album . Its a classy pop song that will stand the test of time.Here on & quot ; Phantom Moon & quot ; there are no stand out songs , hooks , just dismal , depressing , wallowing in pity songs.I say Sheik get off your Jack Kerouac stage and start writing some catchier tunes . I give it ( 2 ) stars because Duncan has an incredible voice and the production , though I did n't like the music is first rate .	-1
Daft Punk 's second release is better than their debut , and yet it is only for fans of this kind of electronic music , or soft techno.It was recommended to me because I , despite my rejection of this musical genre , fell for the other French band 'Air ' . But Daft Punk is less soulful and more electronically sterile . Still , the variation in the songs is remarkably high - my compliment for that.Songs like 'Veridis Quo ' and 'One More Time ' do possess a certain charm . But for an old rock fan like me , it is far from enough to justify a buy .	-1
I 've never understood the appeal of Daft Punk . `` Around the World '' is probably the only track by them that I like . Everyone raved about this album the week it was released and the catchy , `` One More Time '' hit the airways chronically.Of course I bought it that week also , and probably thought a little ( but not by much ) more strongly about it at the time . Listening to this album today on the other hand , truly unmasks how aweful it really is . Daft Punk may know how to create a few tracks that will make it into the pop top 40 , but these guys have very little talent when it comes to quality electronica.2/5 stars .	-1
I bought this album out of curiosity , after I had heard the opening track , & quot ; One More Time. & quot ; That ONE track was awesome , but I was dissapointed to find out that the rest of the album is very , very similar in sound . I think they 're beeing overrated . Sorry ... I know I might be offending some of their fans , but I really did n't like this work . As I said in the title of the review , I sold it . I give it 2.5 stars .	-1
When the day I got this album , I purchased it used because it was cheap . When the day I got it in the mail , I just had the cd and not the WHOLE ALBUM . I was ashamed and good thing I purchased Ima brand new	-1
The problem with this album was that it was too predictable ( same song structure , same guest stars , etc . ) and he made a poor choice for a first single ( & quot ; Let 's Get Dirty & quot ; ) . This helped make 2001 the year for Wack Rap Albums . For your next album , Red , tell producer Erick Sermon to step his game up ( for once ) , and also , chill with those stupid radio skits ; they 're not funny anymore .	-1
How do you see an album like this one coming ? What Thee Album , Dare Iz A Darkside , Muddy Waters and Doc 's Da Name 2000 were all great albums . So why does this stink . 1 . He sounds uninspired on here . 2 . He has too many of his local homies who all ( except for Icarus and Jamal ) suck . The Good : Aside from the commercial tracks like Let 's Get Dirty and Smash Sumthin ( which are good ) he has only three others which are standouts . Uh Huh is vintage Redman . Real N****z ( featuring Scarface , Mally G , Icarus and Treach ) is one of the best songs on here minus Treach 's weak verse . Scarface , Mally G and Icarus stole the show on that one . Enjoy Da Ride is the best track on here with Method Man , Saukrates & Streetlife contributing some solid verses on the track right along with Redman . The skits are pretty humorous also ( the Jerry Swinger being the funniest out of them all ) . The Bad : Songs like Lick A Shot , Diggy Doc and Muh F**** are as dull as it gets . And dont get me started on Bricks Two featuring all his garbage homies ( D-Don sounds like a New Jersey version of D12 's Bizarre ) who stink up the track worser than it had to be . The Ugly : Songs llke Whut I'ma Do Now , DoggzII , J.U.M.P. , Da Bull**** ( Icarus was alright on here but its still a suspect track ) and the ultrawack Soopaman Luva ( parts I & 2 ) should have been Shaquille O'Neal slam dunked into the studio trash can . Dat B**** ( featuring Missy who adds nothing to the track ) is the dumbest track that Redman has ever made period ! Bottom Line : Redman should be sued for Malpractice ( literally ) . The beats stunk , Redman sounded bored on most tracks and the guest appearances were weak . To put it bluntly : the skits were better than the album itself . Never mind that Redman himself said that this album was weak . Listen to his previous albums then listen to this and you will see how much of a dud it is .	-1
Last response , promise . & quot ; Smacks of racism & quot ; ? I simply asked if Brazilians shared my point of view - Astrud IS a Brazilian , and Brazilians have varying opinions of her talent . No , I am not using a review venue as a chat room - I was responding to ( like your & quot ; review & quot ; ) a personal attack . I did not start the rudeness . Yes , I am an audio engineer - no , I do not & quot ; claim to know everything & quot ; . If you read my ORIGINAL review , you will see that I have an opinion that I expressed politely . Only after I was attacked personally ( twice now ) did I go any further . Such silliness ! !	-1
this cd is the worst thing the artist known as trick daddy had ever put his name on . first up , it 's not a trick daddy album . he 's noteven on half the songs . he only has 1 solo track the weak i 'm a thug where he tries to use a little kid chorus to draw attention to his lousy rhymes but fails . trick only succeeds in pleasing me with amerika where he finally gets into his real flow zone . the rest of the slip n slide crew besides society fails to represent . the worst by far is the mystikal jock-off migraine . the hotness and for all my ladies are the best tracks by far . trina 's pull over remix fails to please considering the cut out the original best verse ... the old school beat is somewhat accurate tho . there are hot beats throughout the album no doubt ... but the lyricism is sure as hell not there . for example noodle has a bangin bass beat sure to rock any system , but the rappin is just a bunch of mumblin and cussin . society is the only person besides trick that is creative with his lyrics . the deuce poppi sampler has one good song hich begins about 3 minutes in . be sure to check this sample out . beside about 3 or 4 songs this album is garbage . i reccomend this to no1 . even if u r a hardcore trick fan be warned this is not a real trick daddy album ... .	-1
trick daddy is a great artist . i love his southern drawl and his i do n't give a ... . attitude . his music has always been catchy , and that 's why , to this day , i buy it . but & quot ; thugs r us & quot ; is definately at the bottom of the T double D list . songs like & quot ; i 'm a thug & quot ; , & quot ; where i 'm from & quot ; , & quot ; to all my ladies & quot ; were very catchy but the rest of the album was filled with too many no names and subpar beats . & quot ; the drought & quot ; was very dull , & quot ; n word & quot ; is repetively boring and & quot ; bricks and marijuana & quot ; sounded like a sean paul song . overall , i bought the cd based on the name , trick daddy , cuz he 's one of my favorite rappers . but this is one of those albums killed by too many guests . anyway , i 'll still keep buying the boy 's albums cuz i know he can do better than this . slip n slide baby !	-1
Aaron Lewis is fighting a losing battle with Staind . He should just drop them off at the gas station he picked them up at , and start belting out some phenomenal material from his real band , Puddle Of Mudd . Why do artists collaborate so much . They should focus on one band !	-1
Staind was a really good band , emphasis on was . That was before Fred Durst and TRL , two forces you can count on to ruin anything . Dysfunction was a very good cd and I was hoping Break the Cycle would be too , but after I was informed that they performed on TRL a few days before this cd came out I knew it was n't going to be . Unfortunately , Fred Durst 's influence on them really shows . They sold out . Their decent musical ability saved them from dropping to the horrible level of Limp Bizkit , but this cd would have been a lot better if Fred Durst had just left them alone .	-1
What happened to Staind ? I was a fan of & quot ; Tormented & quot ; and & quot ; Dysfunction & quot ; but this CD is just a piece of pure garbage ! From the contrived lyrics to the muddy and bland music Staind has proved that they were just waiting to get to the top of the music scene then conform to what MTV and all the other big corporations wanted to them be . And they did it , along with the guru at selling out , Fred Durst . This was a huge sellout record and it 's just disgustingly pitiful . My friend burned me this CD and I 'm glad because I got to hear it before I might 've made the mistake of buying . I 'm glad I did n't . So please , do n't buy this huge disappointment .	-1
What happened to the Dysfunction-era Staind that was darker and heavier ? Why did they become so gentle and radio friendly ? I would n't recommend this album to anybody . I 'd only go with Dysfunction . The only reason I give this 1 stars is because of the song `` Fade Away '' . That 's probably the only good song on it . I hate `` It 's Been A While '' and `` Outside '' .	-1
& quot ; Fade & quot ; , & quot ; It 's Been a While & quot ; , & quot ; Change & quot ; , & quot ; Epiphany & quot ; , & quot ; Suffer & quot ; , & quot ; For You & quot ; , & quot ; Outside & quot ; , & quot ; Waste & quot ; , and & quot ; Take It & quot ; ... These songs ( 9 out of the 13 on & quot ; Break the Cycle & quot ; ) all contain the word & quot ; feel & quot ; ( and/or & quot ; felt & quot ; or & quot ; feeling & quot ; ) .DAY ONE : I 'm at a friend 's house right now , and he 's playing & quot ; Break the Cycle & quot ; by Staind . That singer feels a lot . So I infer that he is pretty complex . If he & quot ; feels & quot ; on 9 out of 13 songs on this CD , and each one of these songs have a different premise ( speak of different feelings ) , then there 's a really good chance that at least one of those songs will relate closely to how I feel about certain things going on in my life.DAY TWO : A friend played some Creed for me today in his car ; I had never really listened to it . When this song & quot ; One & quot ; came on , my friend cranked up the volume . That guy -my friend informed me that his last name is Stapp- & quot ; felt & quot ; something at least eight times in that one song . Man , and I thought Staind were feelers . This Stapp dude feels & quot ; angry & quot ; and feels & quot ; helpless & quot ; and feels & quot ; violent & quot ; and feels & quot ; alone & quot ; because he ca n't unify the world ; I 've felt all of those feelings at some time or another , but for all sorts of different reasons , so I guess I can relate to Stapp , too.DAY THREE : So I 'm at a party , and notice that the first three bands -none of whom I have yet been introduced to ( Linkin Park , Nickelback , and especially Puddle of Mudd [ who & quot ; feels & quot ; on & quot ; Control & quot ; , it sounds , to be & quot ; feeling & quot ; for no coherent reason ] ) - blaring from the speakers all & quot ; felt & quot ; like crazy ... Just like Staind and Creed did.After fleeing the drunken revelry , I started to wonder why all of these bands that pretty much sounded the same ( singers with a hybrid voice of Eddie Vedder and Scott Weiland , and 4/4-beat , riffy music ) all incorporated the word & quot ; feel & quot ; into their lyrics . I started to think of these bands ' motive . When I arrived home , a dollar fell from my pocket as I was rummaging through my pockets for my house key.It was at that point when everything culminated : NOW : When the word & quot ; feel & quot ; is mentioned in a song , people listen ... ESPECIALLY when that word is associated with turmoil . Thus , the song has a greater chance to persuade a listener to buy the CD . What will NEVER be heard from beloved Staind is any attempt of resolve . 'The world is a horrible place , that 's just how it is , and I 'm gon na vent my frustration and whine in my overused ( but profitable ) fake voice until the day I die . ' Why is this standpoint abused by modern rockers ? Because it sells like hotcakes , baby . If a singer says , & quot ; I feel violent & quot ; , it triggers a natural response mechanism ; it 's unavoidable -innate- , and the record conglomerates KNOW it.Question Staind 's integrity , folks . I regret to inform you that you would n't hear this monotonous babble ( musically , lyrically , and vocally ) if the bands would n't have caught the record conglomerates ' attention in the first place by selling their & quot ; product & quot ; to them . These bands do not write lyrics and concoct their purposely-simplistic garage music to satisfy themselves emotionally ; they do it because they want to live the American Dream : to be rock stars , and make a lot of money .	-1
Staind is nothing more than a self-involved bald fat guy with a pierced eyebrow . Is that signature `` eyebrow ring '' supposed to be cool or something ? ? I 'll tell you what would be a lot cooler : good music.These guys crowd up the radio with their boring brand of bland corporate rock , no different from many metal bands in the 80 's . There are TONS more bands out there who deserve radio airplay , rather than Staind.I can empathize with Staind fans who might get something out of Aaron Lewis ' demoralizing lyrics - but that 's all . Musically , I 've heard better tunes done by the Brady Bunch.P.S . : These guys toured with Stone Temple Pilots on the latest Family Values tour , and were swiftly upstaged . Aaron Lewis does not have what you 'd call an entertaining stage precense . Maybe he had too many hot dogs before going on ! ! ...	-1
Look staind are an excellent band , with great riffs , and singing , though unfortunately staind has managed to fail like bands like limpbizkit , creed and more . You see staind use to be heavy and more agressive , and the lyrics where better to , though sadly fred durst made a record deal with them , and now they end up like this , with [ bad ] lyrics , and bad music . Oh well thanks for reading , go get dysfunction , their better album , which is what they use to be .	-1
Staind latest effort is true rock formula , losing their style from their previous efforts of & quot ; Dysfunction & quot ; and & quot ; Torment & quot ; .I think Fred Durst influence has ruined this band . & quot ; Break the Cycle & quot ; which is the # 1 album in the country 2 weeks in row , I am sure will get word of mouth quickly with true Staind fans.This group has sold out to utter nonsense , sounding like every other MTV video rock band out there.All the songs are your typical formula sounding rock song with no stand out of creativity or imagination.But since the album has already sold over 1 million copies in just 2 weeks their next album will sound more like Backstreet Boys or 98 Degrees or who knows maybe they will really sell out , buff up , remove the tattoos and get Debbie Gibson , and Diane Warren to collaborate for some pop/ballads.If you want true rock that will be a classic get Tools latest & quot ; Lateralus & quot ; ... .end of story .	-1
I bought this c.d . on the basis that I really liked the songs & quot ; Open Your Eyes & quot ; and & quot ; It 's Been A While & quot ; which are two really good rock songs in my opinion.But when I actually listened to this c.d . from start to finish I found myself getting more and more exasperated by the worst most self-indulgent lyrics I 've ever heard.I mean what is it about these groups that sings songs of their endless inner torture , of feeling misunderstood all because they felt a little neglected by their parents.They always seem to have songs where they are desperately trying to & quot ; escape their fears & quot ; , they always seem to be in a state where they are suffering in silence-yeah right ! Why ca n't these groups and their fans just lighten up even just a little bit.The vocalists all come from the Eddie Vedder school-I mean Pearl Jam , Creed , Stone Temple.. and now Staind-is there any difference at all ? This c.d . is just one big loud moan from start to finish.So that is why I only listen to it now a few tracks at a time. & quot ; Fade & quot ; is a good song-more loud brash grunge driven guitars-the song builds up excellently with the bass and synths coming in before it explodes into the chorus. & quot ; It 's Been A While & quot ; is as good a song from this particular genre that I 've heard.Then we get to the really bad section of the c.d.-track 5 singer goes on about 'torture , torment and a place to retreat to'.Track 6-singer goes on about 'travesty surrounding me-needs to find somewhere to flee . 'Track 7 ( actually I like this more subtle song a lot as it 's moody yet catchy and does n't rely on loudness to express his inner anger ) -singer goes on about-'not being able to take anymore , being torn apart and being a little boy inside that needs attention ! 'Track 8-song is called Suffer need I say more ? Track 9 singer goes on about trying to 'escape the demons I am forced to keep'.Track 10-the worst yet-that old chestnut about did your parents really love you-or did they love you too much.It 's at this stage of the c.d . that I feel I 'm about to be violently ill.Thankfully another good song & quot ; Outside & quot ; is only a few tracks away.I love this song with it 's quiet almost acoustic verses before it bursts into life with the loud , surging chorus.That is the thing about this album-musically it 's quite good in parts-it 's got some great individual songs-it 's just unfortunately so morbid and terribly repetitive.C'mon guys cheer up a bit ! ! ! ! !	-1
Released in may 2001 . This album topped the billboard album chart for 3 weeks selling over 700,000 copies in it 's first week . Perhaps the reason for this is because this album is very trendy . Why do I say that . Over the past 3 years or so nu-metal and this so-called art-nu metal and new angst rock has arrived and although being critically bashed it seems that they all recieve good airplay and good album sales . Staind is one of those bands . This album is one of these trendy releases this angst-ridden depressed rock . Most of these song lyrics are about abuse and stuff that has made the lead singer angry and depressed and he is trying to get it out of his system by showing the record buyers that his life has not been good and they buy it for that reason a long side that MTV has promoted this album so heavily and [ convinced ] young rich kids to buy it . Oveproduced with cliched lyrics and guitar riffs . Absolutely no orginality and very boring Break The Cycle is one of the worst excuses for an album in a long time . Yes it is that bad . This band has talent for playing but obviously need to find time to write better songs and find a decent producer if they do that then they will be a lot better but this is n't very good I do n't care what it sells . Aaron and co need to get rid of Fred Durst soon .	-1
I ca n't believe this is the same band that brought us & quot ; Tormented & quot ; and & quot ; Dysfunction & quot ; , I shake my head in disbelief . I had heard of Staind almost four years ago when a friend of mine had gotten their original first album called & quot ; Tormented & quot ; , an album that was violent , loud , and heavy , and had cover art of blood stained dolls , inverted crucifixes , and satanic suggestions . So naturally I dug them . They were the kind of band I was looking for then that brought the heavy melody of Alice in Chains and were nearly as heavy as Pantera . Then Fred Durst gets them a real record deal and they put out & quot ; Dysfunction & quot ; , which was a good album though not as heavy as their original debut . Then I hear a song called & quot ; Outside & quot ; that sounded a bit too poppy and even had Fred Durst credited for singing on it even though he only says about three words during the whole thing . I started to get leary of what was happenning to Staind , and then my worst fear was realised . I hear & quot ; It 's Been Awhile & quot ; , and the first time I heard it , I thought to myself & quot ; sell out and cash in & quot ; , and I was right . Since then & quot ; It 's Been Awhile & quot ; became very overplayed and & quot ; Break the Cycle & quot ; went triple platinum . Another thing is & quot ; It 's Been Awhile & quot ; sounds very reminiscent of one of Alice in Chains ' hit singles , & quot ; Down in a Hole & quot ; . Every song is about the same old & quot ; woe is me , I hate myself , I want to die , buy our record & quot ; lyric content that gets extremely repetitive rather quickly . Aaron Lewis sounds like he 's begging to be loved rather than demanding to be hated like he did on Staind 's brilliant debut album & quot ; Tormented & quot ; , and their rather good follow up & quot ; Dysfunction & quot ; , and now whenever I hear Staind on the radio or see them on TV , I simply click the OFF button .	-1
Staind is nothing but another crappy , unoriginal nu-metal band , along with Linkin Park , Trapt , Drowning Pool , andmany others . The lyrics are dull and repatative , and the singer 's voice is a pathetic atempt to be grunge . For good nu-metal , listen to KoRn , Slipknot , Godsmack , American Headcharge , Tonight The Stars Revolt-era Powerman 5000 , HED ( pe ) , and Sevendust , and for real metal in general listen to Death , Pantera , Damageplan , Down , lacuna Coil , Crowbar , Slayer , Down , Exhorder , Megadeth , Venom , Anthrax , Sepultura , Soulfly , Machine Head , chimaira , old Metallca , Hatebreed , and Soilwork .	-1
[ ... ] the reason why I gave this 2 stars is because ... .well , this cd is bor-ing . It 's like they [ took out ] all the raw emotion , and a sort of sloppyness which made Dysfuction so powerful , out of Break the Cycle . Where 's songs like `` Raw '' , or `` Just Go '' , or `` Sufficate '' . I know `` you have to expect a band to grow '' . Ok , fine , cool , grow but do n't loose the energy and replace it with plain simple melody . Song after song , it 's the same , never once does Aaron just go off . It 's like they took the music and lyrics of dysfuction , but steamlined it , or held it back . Honestly , I at first liked `` Outside '' , but then `` It 's Been Awile '' came out . I remember the radio saying 'This is the brand new staind song ' and I was like YES ! And then my jaw dropped , I mean come on , that is not Staind ! ! The only songs I can stand are `` Open Your Eyes '' and `` For You '' . `` For you '' being actually an extremely good song , but besides that , it 's just blah.Avoid this , listen to Cold 's self entitled cd ( Cold came out 2 years before Staind , and are much better ) , get Toxicty by System of a Down cd , or anything by the Deftones , and be saved.Oh and by the way BLACK rain is the hidden song on Dysfuction .	-1
This is truly horrible . All Aaron Lewis does in the whole album is whine about how horrible his life supposedly is when he 's filthy rich off of this [ stuff ] . The music is so simple , it 's not even funny . But the worst thing is the whiny vocals . Do n't get me wrong . Dysfunction was nothing great either . But at least he did n't whine as much and some of the guitar was heavy . This is just dumb . It is n't dark , it 's dumb . `` Open your Eyes '' particularly bothers me because what are the chances that he even cares about what he is singing about . He probably thought it would make him seem like a more meaningful lyricist but it does n't . ...	-1
Hard rock has decided to become the music genre fit to evoke our depressions , fears , frustrations and suicidal moments . The interesting thing is how commercial these moods have become , with the exception of some stellar bands such as Audioslave , hard rock bands offer nothing these days but trips through the singer 's disturbed psyche . Staind fits the bill if you want a soundtrack for your abused childhood , rejected days at high school , or even for when you see that hot babe that just wo n't give the time of day ( well , if that sort of thing makes you clinically depressed ) . But they offer nothing new in their work . Produced by Fred Durst , known as the frontman of the horrible Limp Bizkit , `` Break The Cycle '' is simply recyclings of subjects and styles done much better by previous bands . There is nothing wrong with rock bands exploring the darker sides of life , a lot of great art tends to do that , and groups such as Metallica , Soundgarden and of course , Nirvana , have explored the darkness and come out with classic albums . Staind sounds more like a collection of repetitive riffs and laments . Singer Aaron Lewis sounds more like an Eddie Vedder imitator , the only difference is that Vedder is exciting , Lewis is just mournful . There are two noteoworthy songs here among the mush , `` Outside '' which is a wonderfully written ballad as well as `` It 's Been Awhile . '' These two songs prove that the band can indeed produce some good material if they try . The rest just sounds repetitive , nothing here feels fresh or classic . There are plently of riffs , but none of them are original . It 's a been there , done that job .	-1
OK , so like 10 years ago we had grunge , and it was good . And now , we have ultra-whiny derivitave post-grunge in the form of Staind . What can you expect from a band that got its big break from Fred Durst ? I 'd be whining too if that was the only way I could get a record deal . I could probably make a 100 piece list of reasons this band is almost as bad as the Backstreet Boys , but I 'll limit it to 5 since pretty much everybody has by now realized how awful they are.1 . Not only did Fred Durst sign the band , he also sang on Outside and directs videos for them . Yeah.2 . Powerballards went out in the 80 's . Staind obviously has n't realized this.3 . Despite Aaron Lewis 's very strong attempts to imitate Tool 's Maynard , he still has n't learned how to sing in key.4 . Fade was the second single off this album . Enough said.5 . They ca n't even spell the name of their own band right . Unless maybe they 're right , the lack of the e just makes them so much cooler . Kinda like Limp BiZkit.6 . I just had to add one more reason . Because even crap bands like Weezer , and , uh , Winger , can sing better than this guy .	-1
Aaron Lewis should seriously see a psychiatrist or something , due to all the whining about his life [ being bad ] on this album . Oh wait , then he would n't make millions off 12-year-old girls who think he 's `` cute '' and can `` totally relate to his problems '' buying his album . I know you are all going to vote this review `` not helpful , '' and go on not paying attention to me , but if you 're into angst rock , why not get into bands like Glassjaw and Jets to Brazil who can sing about their lives without sounding stupid ? Or better yet , forget listening to some guy with an acoustic guitar crying , and actually FEEL the depression via Radiohead and Sigur Ros ?	-1
I was very disapointed when I got this album . The songs all have the same sound to them and are generally annoying . Plus , after you hear him on the radio so much , you never want to hear Staind again . I gave mine to my mom because I did n't want it anymore . Do n't buy this album .	-1
This thing is terrible . How many times can you repeat the words Its Been Awhile ? Someone 's smoked one too many . Its Been Awhile bears an uncanny resemblance to Alice in Chain 's Down in a Hole , a great song that Staind has obviously just mimicked , minus the Alice in Chains genious , but who will notice , right ? The rest of this album really [ bad ] too . What happened man ? Dysfunction was a killer record . The only explanation is that Fred Durst snuck in when they were finished and just trashed the sucker.I do n't know who the people are rating this thing , but Im willing to bet [ ... ] . Thats how he got popular , not by actually being a good musician .	-1
I really would much rather listen to something that has meaning . This guys just whines and drwons his orrow in booze . What 's the differnce between this lyrical content and your typical country song ? NOTHING . Musically the band is very easy to play . I 've played for 5 months and can play each song just by listening to it once . Just another trend , maybe , unless these guys pick up the pace and quit whining , it 's getting depressing and boring . Try some Nile , Origin , Tourniquet , Midtown , and Extol for some REAL music . Okay , now you can click the unhelpful button so that I may see how many sheep there are on this website .	-1
I swear if I hear & quot ; Its Been Awhile & quot ; one more time I will explode . Ballad rock is getting really old , really fast . Staind , Creed , Fuel , Lifehouse , 3 Doors Down etc . are all bands that depend on cliche & quot ; poor me , Im a rich musician that had a horrible childhood & quot ; lyrics . I cant understand how someone could enjoy songs such as & quot ; Its Been Awhile & quot ; or & quot ; Outside & quot ; other than the lyrics . Its obviously not about the music , because there is n't any . These lyrics are n't hard to write . All Aaron Lewis did was think of all the bad times in his childhood , which we 've all had , and write them down to sub-par song-writing . These radio friendly ballads sound all the same to me . There is absolutely no creativity or originality in the lyrics or the music . One thing I can not understand is why the boys in Staind are so concerned about pleasing the masses ? Self-respecting musicians make music that pleases fans that actually know something about music . At the end of these bands lives they feel satisfied that they made music that meant something to real music fans . Im glad that Stainds first two albums were n't very good , or else this album would be a huge let-down . I guess we can all thank Mr.Cobain for bringing all this ballad junk into extreme overplay on the mainstream radio .	-1
The acousti-fying of `` emo '' is an idea that was lucky to work once . Unfortunately for Dashboard Confessional , the New Amsterdams barely beat them to it . Listening to this is like listening to the New Amsterdams , albeit not anywhere near as good . I guess it should n't be a surprise , though , since the Get Up Kids are so superior to Further Seems Forever . Anyway , the new New Amsterdams CD is nowhere near as good as Never You Mind . This entire idea is unusually boring . About this CD , there is nothing to it . There are no melodies . To be nice , it is ... . At least loud `` emo '' is sometimes interesting ( although Further Seems Forever is completely useless ) . Anyway , if you want to obsess with this guy Chris , go for Further Seems Forever , but a better idea is just to forget about him .	-1
So this is what music is coming to , huh ? A guy almost in his 30s writing cheesy , catchy songs about his trivial high school romances . Wow , ( please note the sarcasm ) , that 's never been done before ! & quot ; Oh jeez , 10 years ago this mean girl dumped me ! I did n't get sad until now when I can strum a few chords on my guitar and whine about it . I did n't get sad then because now I can make lots of money . Man , all the little 12 year olds will love me ! & quot ; And it 's the truth . I 've heard people say before & quot ; Everyone can relate to dashboard confessional. & quot ; It 's true too , if you like simplistic garbage and the basic is the most you can comprehend . I 'm not going to suggest you buy something else in place of this , I 'll just suggest you do n't buy this . It 's bad bad bad . Trust me .	-1
Whenever I first hear an album , I try and have an open mind and avoid making presuppositions based on the first single . In the case of The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most by Dashboard Confessional , however , this proved exceedingly difficult , as I positively detest `` Screaming Infidelities , '' even going so far as to vote for Limp Bizkit on MTV2 's `` Control Freak '' to keep from hearing it . Nevertheless , I decided to borrow this CD from a friend , hoping that there would be some variety to make up for that song.Unfortunately , the rest of the songs are just like `` Screaming Infidelities '' : off-key campfire singalongs with angst that one would expect from nu-metal . If you want to hear that song ten times over , by all means , buy this album . But as for me , I 'll take The Cure when I want to listen to depressing music .	-1
( really a 2.5 ) This is almost a 100 % acoustic release by Dashboard Confessional . The sound gets old , repetetive and somewhat dull . Lyrics are heartfelt at the LEAST . He sounds like he is pouring out his guts into the mic in every song . This is almost as dark as Pedro the Lion . It 's just sad , sad stuff.If you watched any of the Dashboard Confessional Unplugged , you can see that he used a full band . Unlike he does on this release . The rest of the band does make it sound better . Plus all the people listening to him look like they are all 17 . Which is exactly who will be listening to the this kind of stuff . Heartbroken teenagers.Dashboard Confessional needs to really work on getting the rest of the band involved in the music . Or just developing the acoustic sound better . `` The New Amsterdams '' which is the `` Get Up Kids '' led-singers side project . Do a much better job on the sonic approach . Dashboard Confessional does a good job on the lyrics . But the sound just gets old and boreing . You listen to this CD one time through . You will probably not be interested in listening to it all the way through again . It ... .just gets old.Best songs : '' Brillant Dance '' '' The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most ''	-1
Hi , I 'm Chris Carrabba , and I ca n't sing . I just moan like a banshee about made-up things that sound so terrible that I act like happened to me . Goodbye now . And buy my albums ! It 's the only way to escape the torment of reality ! I swear !	-1
Whine , whine , whine . Girls do n't like me . Moan , moan , moan . I get off on everyone 's pity . Gripe , gripe , gripe . Buy my record so that girl who broke up with me six years ago will be jealous.Buy a Nick Drake or Elliott Smith record instead .	-1
Ick ... Dashboard is everything I hate about music , he sticks to an image , writes the same song over and over , and he whines like he 's 7 and his mom wo n't get him that candy bar . Seriously you can buy much better emo cds than this , pick up some Onelinedrawing or some Sunny Day Real Estate or just skip to some real emo and pick up a few Fugazi albums . The sad thing is that I see Chris getting very popular in the near future ... .	-1
alright , i know this album is barely 30 minutes long , but i ca n't listen to the whole thing all the way through . ca n't you crybaby emo imbiciles hear that every song is EXACTLY THE SAME ? goodness . either way , i do n't like this album for that reason . the first song is bearable . the rest is whining . all of it is whining . i know that that is what emo kids want , but i dislike it . it 's time to start listening to another band after the first 3 minutes . i made the mistake of seeing this band when i went to see the anniversary . the anniversary rocked hard , but all the crap dashboard fans just stood there so they could cry about how crappy their lives are . waa waa waa , hold me ! i hate that . go somewhere else and give a band like the anniversary , which is actually good , some credit . and stop crying . bastards .	-1
I heard that this was a great acoustic CD to listen to when you 're depressed , so I bought it . After listening to the whole thing , only one word came to mind : `` ouch ! '' I 've never heard so much whining by someone about failed romance . Sure , I 've heard breakup songs by the Deftones , Far , Will Haven , and even Sunny Day Real Estate , but all of those songs occupied ONE slot on the record . This is the same concept repeated in every song on the album with slight variations ( eg `` I miss your bed , '' `` I heard about your trip and all the cute guys , '' `` You keep ignoring me '' ) . For God 's sake , Chris Cabbera , SHUT UP about your petty little breakup ! There are more important issues in the world than you going unnoticed again ! If you want to listen to good , emotional , acoustic rock , do not hesitate to buy either one of Neutral Milk Hotel 's full-length albums . Or , better yet , check out Daisies of the Galaxy by the Eels . But whatever you do , stay FAR AWAY from this crud !	-1
Do n't be fooled by a name . With all due respect to the additional musicians who contributed to this disk , Dashboard Confessional is hardly a band . Chris Carrabba stands ( or sits , on a stool ) center stage , sings everything , plays guitar , and writes and arranges all of the music , so it is essentially a one man show . The guy appears to have talent , and legions of devoted fans seem dedicated to letting him know this . Carrabba would be a pretty good songwriter , too , but he desperately needs a few new topics to sing about . If you 're twenty-five or under , and have a really , really bad broken heart , then you probably will not agree with me on this , but everyone else should take heed . This guy is stuck in a rut that I doubt he will ever be able to dig himself out of . You do n't need to be a $ 100 an hour analyst to recognize this , either . After a full CD of high-tempered whining , Carrabba 's broken heart grows extremely tiresome to all except the faithfully depressed.Chris Carrabba is the emo Dan Hill ( remember `` Sometimes When We Touch '' ? Yeah , him. ) . His songs are powerful , pretty , melodic , quasi-literate , and ultimately , banal . Every single track on Places You Have Come to Fear the Most is an expression of Carrabba 's pain . Ultimately , listening to this entire disk leaves the impression that this guy has nothing else to sing about except his own hurt feelings ; if he did n't have a broken heart , he 'd have nothing left to say . In this sense ( and he 's probably going to hate this comparison even more than my Dan Hill dig ) , Carrabba 's album reminds me of the first Melissa Etheridge album , where every song was about a screwed up relationship . He 'd be lucky if he was like her , though , because at least she was eventually able to stretch out a bit . Carrabba does n't yet show this much promise.With all of this whining , and so much yowling about his broken heart , Carrabba never once uses the word ` love ' to describe his own state of mind . So , if he 's not at all committal , what does he have to complain about ? Not to overanalyze , but this is music for people who are in love with the pain caused by self-pity . On `` The Best Deceptions '' , he sings , `` I 'd rather say nothing . I 'd rather you never heard my voice . '' Agreed . Instead , maybe I 'll ask him to listen to some unsolicited advice from me . Chris , find somebody nice . Fall in love . Get happy . Then , get a day job . Oh , and P.S . - After singing that title track , you might want to see a throat doctor , too . C Tom Ryan	-1
All these mixes and remixes are bad ... there 's nothing like the original versions if you know them . One of my favourite ones was Lil ' Homies but here , this track has been spoiled totally . Nevertheless , Tupac remains and will always remain the best rapper till the end of times ...	-1
I did n't buy this album . I downloaded several songs . It was produced by Suge and has mostly new material . The songs are boring though . The only classic is `` Until the End of Time '' .Do n't buy this album . Just download the songs you like .	-1
okay this does 2pac injustice , these songs are all bootlegs , we all heard them before , the producers remixed these underground classics took the rawness off of them and made pac go mainstream why ? i mean do anybody believe pac would have sampled journey do yourself a favor and get the bootlegs instead cause is the real one .	-1
DO NOT listen to any of the reviews by these 2Pac groupies . Until The End Of Time is just a bunch of badly produced 2Pac songs and just about every song has two versions of them on this album . Until The End Of Time is one of the worst post death albums that they have released from 2Pac and it is a prime example of why 2Pac did n't release these songs when he was alive . This album is NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
The repetitive drone of this album lulls my eardrums to sleep . I literally have forced myself to listening to this album about 5 times , in the hopes that the 'good reviews ' that I read for it would come true . I purchased it on BMG and have been dissappointed ever since.Jadakiss is a played-out , over-hyped sell-out . His music has boring concepts , hooks , and rhyme-styles . As he himself said , though , `` it 's all about the voice '' . Well , your voice is n't even that original , considering that Chace Infinite of Self-Scientific has a similar sound to his voice , yet he is able to say something INTERESTING , INTELLIGENT , and POIGNENT with his , yet all Jada REALLY talks about with his is `` how gangster he is '' ( which , he 's not , or he 'd be in jail ) , or `` how he 's got a gun '' .Admittedly , later in his career , Jada would put out a track with some political or social weight ( `` WHY '' ) , but even on it , he was outshined on a remix by EVERY OTHER RAPPER ON THE REMIX ! ! ! . If you like Jadakiss and/or the Lox , and you KNOW you like them , then this album is going to be something you 'll buy and probably love . It 's the same old s # ! t he 's been doing before . Boring hooks , boring verses , boring concepts , boring album . If you want to hear someone with `` the voice ( or at least a mellow , smooth voice remniscent of Jada 's ) '' that 's actually saying something to beats that wo n't put you to sleep , then buy yourself a Self-Scientific album ...	-1
No Jadakiss you need to quit or at least switch labels and get far away from one of the worst producers ever ... Swizz Beats . I waited for this album for so long and it was one of the biggest disappointments ever . This is in my top five wackest cd 's I own right next to Mase 's Double Up , Notorious K.I.M. , Amils Album , and Mack 10 's Paper Route.It 's wackness is n't feasible believable or reasonable but it is . The thing about it was that I used to like Jadakiss . Not after this scrait garbage album . It has one good song Kiss Is Spittin feat . Nate Dogg . and a couple other decent songs . Knock Yaself Out is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life and it got madd play ... ... ..unfortunately , the rest of the album is just the same horrible production that doesnt even allow you to listen to the lyrics . Horrid . IF he switches labels I will CONSIDER buying another one of his albums but this is a shame to his name and he needs to distance himself from the people bringing him down . He does have talent and potential but this album does not do him justice and should have never been released . I still like Jadakiss but this album is not good at all by any standards and I advise you to run away from it if ya see it in used section . Dont Say I didnt warn ya .	-1
For me this guy is one of many who ca n't rap , but he have occasion to recording his records , so he 's doing that . I ca n't stand his monotonous voice ( same problem with Loon and Fab , it 's terrible . Knock Yourself Out is tight , but only for the beats ! Other tracks are quite decent . Pointless record .	-1
Hey what can you say , its his first solo album . The problem is 9 times out of 10 any artist first album is their best.This is not what I expected . I really never felt Jadakiss and his style , but the young emcee has potential . Very skilled emcee with a nice vocabulary and word play.The production kills this album . The subject matter kills this album . The tracks are with half nice or half wack . The best track is & quot ; Jada 's Got ta Gun & quot ; but that is sampled so it really isnt the creativity of Jada.I have to say Jada let a lot of people down with this release . It seems this album was more intended for the female audience like 95 % of all other commercial hiphop albums.I dont think Jada will be around much longer . I would give him one more album and then he will be dropped . Its amazing to see that DMX hasnt been dropped from Ruff Ryder Records yet , or any of their artist for that matter .	-1
Jadakiss 's debut album & quot ; Kiss The Game Goodbye & quot ; is one of the best rap cd 's i own , but , the edited version is so bad that i had to give it only 2 stars . It 's not that bad on songs like & quot ; Knock Yourself Out & quot ; and & quot ; We Gon na Make It & quot ; where there was n't much cussing in the first place , but , on tracks like & quot ; Show Discipline & quot ; and & quot ; Put Ya Hands Up & quot ; it 's unbearable how they block out every other word.One of the worst parts about it is that they take out 5 whole tracks , 3 of which are skits but come on , 5 TRACKS GONE ! I 'm not dissing Jada at all , he 's an ill rapper and i think the cd is tight , it 's just the i ca n't stand so much editing !	-1
Typical wu.Man this is the worst thing ever . The only good track on this is the Da Brat/JD track which I got downloaded on my pc . And Cappadonna 's even bad on his part . Some psycho kid I work with at work told me to check this album out , and I knew immediclately that it had to be that smart wu-tang intelligent [ stuff ] only rich people listen to . And I was wrong , this **** ai n't smart at all . Infact , Cappadonndya 's got ta be the worst rapper I ever heard . Do n't buy this cd .	-1
The worst effort the Wu has ever put forth . Cappa has been digressing gradually since his show-stealing verses on Ice Cream and Winter Warz . The Pillage was good , but only because of great production from the RZA , not because of the mc rocking the tracks . The Yin and the Yang is not blessed with that production . It is just Cappadonna making very little sense to radio friendly beats and rapping alongside the likes of Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat . No wonder he was n't on Iron Flag .	-1
I 'm just gon na put it bluntly from the beginning : this album is not very good . I wo n't say that it [ is n't good at all ] because there 's a few decent beats throughout the cd . However , the first flaw is that there 's only 10 f'in songs and not enough quality to make up for lack of quantity . Second of all , I have n't been a fan of Cappa 's lyrics since his appearances on Ghost 's first album . I do n't know what happened to him but since then he just lost his flow . Unfortunately , it seems that he still has n't found it . In fact , most of the guests he had on the album ( excluding J.D . and Da Brat ) sounded better than he did and quite frankly made him sound worse than he already does . Overall I would n't recommend this album to Wu-fans or others .	-1
THIS CD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YIN AND YANG..ITS ALL BAD..IT IS THE WORST WU EFFORT TO DATE..WELL AT LEAST FROM THE MAIN MEMBERS..GET THE ACCAPELLAS FROM THE PILLAGE ALBUM AND PICK YOUR OWN BEATS IF YOU HAVE THE EQUIPMENT..THATS THE CLOSEST YOU COULD GET TO A GOOD CAPPA ALBUM RIGHT NOW..HE NEEDS RZA BEATS BADLY	-1
First of all his name is Lazy Bone , not L-Burna , why do all the rappers these days change there names , no one will even know who they are any more , Lazy was good in bone thugs , he is good in this to , but if he would just keep the name lazy bone it would be even betterL-Burna ? Damn	-1
I bought this album knowing that it would be Layzie Bone . The second best bone member , and all the other bone cd 's where tight so i thought this one would be good too . Even though he didnt work with bone on it . I was so wrong with this . At the very most there were 2 good songs on the whole cd . The lyrics werent anything what i thought they would be and just the over all tracks really made me made . I have listened to this cd a few times since i have purchased it , but thats about all . If you like any of the bone thugs buy it , if not dont waste your money .	-1
we 'll file this one away in the & quot ; not-bad-not good & quot ; category . there 's nothing wrong with this except that it 's boring ( no hooks at ALL ) and that it jumpstarted this poseur 's career . MAGNET even gave him a cover story a couple months ago , and that 's just ridiculous . this is easy , adultish-conservative , er , & quot ; morning after & quot ; music . and i 'll never listen to it again .	-1
I bought this album a few months ago . I liked the song on the radio . The 3 songs that will be released as singles are great , but the album is full of filler material . While I 'll say that this record is a lot better than most of the stuff on the radio these days , there are a lot of Artists out there that are doing what Pete Yorn is doing , and they 're doing it better.That aside , if you like this album try Duncan Sheik 's & quot ; Humming , & quot ; and especially Joseph Arthur 's & quot ; Come TO Where I 'm From. & quot ; Mr. Arthur is in a different league than most people .	-1
Sorry , but this self-described & quot ; important document & quot ; does n't really work . The first 12 or so songs ( the supposed lost album ) are decent . Actually , & quot ; It Always Rains on a Picnic & quot ; and & quot ; Dukes Up & quot ; are two of the band 's best songs , but both have long been available on the & quot ; Blue Cadet & quot ; 7 & quot ; . The last half however is pretty much-unlistenable in my opinion . Those songs were obviously not intended to be released , and they 're nothing more than tossed-off jokes . It 's incredibly harsh too ( as in trebley ) and it just grates.Really , the only previously unavailable song that could be considered essential is the unlisted track ( # 4 ) . It 's very nice . I also have a soft spot for & quot ; 5-4-3-2-1 Lipsoff & quot ; , as the & quot ; this Tang is delicious ! & quot ; line is about the funniest thing ever put to tape , but that too is available on the & quot ; Blue Cadet & quot ; 7 & quot ; , which is still in print and easy to find . At any rate , I guess I was expecting something like Pavement 's & quot ; Westing ( By Musket & amp ; Sextant ) & quot ; ; a fuzzy snapshot of larval yet obvious genius . That 's not what & quot ; Sad Sappy Sucker & quot ; is . It actually reeks of pathetic crassness : a shameless attempt to cash in on Modest Mouse 's success , something I certainly would n't put past K Records . Do n't fall for it !	-1
Where to begin ... .well for starters this cd is REALLY bad . I love Modest Mouse ( Lonesome Crowded West still being the most played cd of my collection ) , but this is bad . Listening to Worms Vs . Birds I thought 'This is pretty good ' then I heard the rest of the cd.I for one , do not see a brilliance here . There is one song that he just repeates Ping Pong ! Ok possibly funny for 5-10 seconds but its almost a minute long . Issac 's voice always is on a thin line of beautiful and intolerable ( I know sounds weird but really its the truth ) . The biggest problem is the overall lack of song stucture , not to say that it has to follow the same formula , but seriously ! Nothing holds the songs together , and the emotion for me just is n't there like it was in songs like trailer trash , or anything like LCW.Anyway , Sad Sappy Sucker , not even compared to LCW , is unlistenable at best . There are amazing Modest Mouse material , this however , is n't one of them .	-1
Ex-Poison Clan member , JT Money , drops a painful Blood Sweat And Years . JT Money starts off with the title track 's intro to prepare you for what you think may be a good release , but turns out to be a teaser . He gets right to `` War '' over a crunkified Cool & Dre production . It continues over to `` Hi-Lo '' with a more bounce affect . C. Tricky Stewart brings the average lyricism of JT out on `` Where My Thugs At '' featuring Lo . The most impressive with a different twist with positivity and direction on teaching his son on `` Father To Son '' . `` Spanish Climax ( Interlude ) '' has a distinctive beat that should have been used to uplift hopes . The features and good production did n't seem to revive this album without bleeding to death on this Miami emcee/rapper .	-1
The album is toooooooooooooooooo pop and i just could not get in to it but i can see how others would like it	-1
I can honestly say that Pimpin On Wax and Return Of The B***izer is Jt Money 's best albums especially after hearing this one . The only tracks that are dope are War , Hi-Lo and Father To Son . Both War and Hi-Lo might do damage in the club and Father To Son is a touching joint where Jt gives his son advice . Sosa On That Chocha is incredibly lame . Superb**** is instantly forgettable . Where My Thugs At and N****z Betta Run showcase the wackness of his featured guests . What Y'all N****z Want , I Like The Way and Bustas And Haters are weak tracks that border on cheesy . Lil Charlie is another lame dance record named after a lame dance and the skits on this album ( Pimpburger and Spanish Climax ) are unfunny and pointless . . Bottom Line : This is one Jt Money 's worst efforts . The beats were tepid , the guests were wack and JT doesnt sound as hungry as he used to sound . I 'm not trying to knock him down because I told you earlier that I felt his early works but this album is Project English bad . You can tell when an album is made to satify a recording contract before you leave when you hear it . Standouts : WAR , HI-LO and FATHER TO SON .	-1
This is not something Buddy would ever have done on his own . It is a phenomenal failure . The producer should be executed . I am a huge huge Buddy Guy fan ... and I was looking forward to a change from the overproduced superstar sessions of late . I also love the original Fat Possum versions of these songs . Buddy says it best in recent interviews ... he had never heard these songs before & amp ; did n't really appreciate them , but he said he 'd give it a try for the producer . Execute the producer . Save your cash and go get some of the old Chess stuff or Stone Crazy . Sorry Buddy ! You are still the greatest !	-1
The day this album came out I rushed to buy it . It was very exciting for me because Air are a favourite band of mine.I put it onto the stereo and began listing - I was delighted by the first track but at first the new synth voice was n't my cup of tea however I have become very fond of it . The next few tracks I must admit were not my sort of thing in fact they were not Air like I know Air . There are a couple of other great tracks on this album although I would n't recommend it to anyone who likes the proper Air .	-1
Look , this CD just ai n't worth it . I 'm gon na put mine on sale soon in the & quot ; used & quot ; section , get it , it 's almost brand new , I only played it once .	-1
The only redmption factor here is the appearance of KEN ANDREWS ( YEAR OF THE RABBIT , ON ) on a couple of tracks and even that does n't make it any better . This is French computer geek music . Sorry , way too European for me . This is a good record if you like DEITER 'S DANCE CLUB on SNL .	-1
... The most embarrassing tracks on this album ( at least 1,2,3 , maybe 5 , maybe 9 ) are full of jejune chord progressions , inane lyrics , and bad synthesized vocals that could be background tracks to a bad `` B '' movie . ... This should be titled `` 25,000 Hz Legend '' because then only dogs and bats could be listening . Unfortunately , you have interesting tracks such as 10-Do n't Be Light and 11-Caramel Prisoner which are worth a listen in their own right ( as are Beck 's pieces ) , so I ca n't be entirely dismissive of this effort . What was interfering with Air 's musical sensibilities early on in this album ? Beck 's supplying free pralines ?	-1
2 1/2Make no mistake , there are a couple beautiful songs on here ( or at least several which have beautiful parts inside the experimental electronic confusion ) , but for the most part people who slap the ol ' sophomore slump label upon Air 's much anticipated follow up to Moon Safari would be in the clear . In labored , pretentious , but shallow structural dabblings the French duo strain for an artsy depth merely hinted at with their spacey , more intuitive debut . Between the often stilted compositions and a few awkward genre leaps , 10,000 Hz becomes clouded by it 's own self-absorption . One hardly notices then , quite a few contrastingly solid ideas inserted into the bloated disc , hinting at the more complex , melodically driven approach that would usher in Talkie Walkie 's warmer reception .	-1
Air is one of many dance groups from france , but apart from Superfunk , Modjo and Daft Punk they are doing more slow relax music then electro kind of like Royksopp , nothing bad with that cause many songs on the album are exellent if you like that kind of dance but when they put Beck in the mix they lose all credability and respect from me . Some songs are as far away from dance as you can come , some decent relax music and a few exceptions are pop-dance , & quot ; Radio # 1 & quot ; is good , a pop-dance tune with good hook . I thought the album wuld be much harder , the title gives me the feeling of something more electronic , however it 's allright but nothing that will go down in history .	-1
Despite songs like `` Sexy Boy '' and `` Remember , '' `` Moon Safari '' 's greatest strength seemed to be its commitment to the retro-futrism of doing an electronic album that sounded dated by a good twenty years . Aside from those songs , it all flowed wonderfully , a tightly cohesive effort that drifted through the subconscious.On `` 10,000 Hz Legend , '' the duo decides , `` Screw that , let 's make a mess ! '' And so it is . A mess , I mean . They try too hard , succeed too little . They bring in Beck to little avail ( hell , the early part of his track is just , well , Beck ) ; they rip-off Radiohead for no good reason ; and they miss the mark by 10,000 miles on `` Radian , '' an overwrought , treacly little piece of refuse begging to be stuffed into a B-side collection that only hardcore fans could admire.That Air emerges on the other side with almost half a listenable album is a miracle in itself . That the listener is left with this as the follow-up to `` Moon Safari '' ( not counting the very good soundtrack for `` The Virgin Suicides '' ) is a gyp . This is what 's convenient about the digital age : not only can anyone produce sub-par electro like this any time they want , but the consumer can illegally download it , ween the four or five tracks worth keeping , and chuck the rest into the Recycle Bin.Best cuts : `` People in the City , '' `` Wonder Milky Bitch , '' `` Radio # 1 , '' `` Do n't Be Light ''	-1
10,000 Hz Legendis n't as bad as many people would have you believe . It 's definitely a change in direction for the French duo . That said , it 's not that great either . Tracks like `` Radian '' manage to salvage the album as a whole , but others , like `` Wonder Milky Bitch '' are just awful .	-1
I like George Benson . I think he 's a great jazz guitarist . However , this album fails to do anything but remind me of what a waste of tape this album was . It 's way too commercial . It does n't break any barriers or really has nothing to say musically that 's interesting . He might have been a great jazz guitarist during this time , but his songwriting is awful . Nothing deep about this music . I also have to say that his improvisations on this album are totally cliche of jazz at that time . What a disappointing album . He should have titled this album `` The George Benson Fake Book , '' because it 's like Columbia hired a `` fake '' George Benson to come in and play guitar . George Benson has done some great albums , unfortunately , this is n't one of them .	-1
Let the die-hards complain : this is merely monotonous , ham-handed , uninspired , well-produced , inconsequential metal for those who only have one taste in music : bad.The Cult circa & quot ; Electric & quot ; were a lot of fun , and they never took themselves seriously , so we never had to . We bit the bullet somewhat with & quot ; Sonic Temple & quot ; , which , although it had it 's moments , was rife with cliches and Zeppelin-aspirations . However , IT , and the follow-up & quot ; Ceremony & quot ; still sounded like the Cult , and were good for the occasional riff-up par excellence.Ian Astbury may have been blessed with a unique set of rock pipes , but he started taking himself and the band way too seriously , and there lay the downfall . & quot ; Beyond Good and Evil & quot ; starts off promisingly enough , but there 's no deliniation of tunes ; just the same , tuneless dirge repeated ad nauseum . There are no surprises here , and even less imagination.Worst of all though , there 's ( with apologies to Iggy ) 'no fun ' to be had here.There 's the ironic line on this album near the end , in & quot ; True Believers & quot ; , about & quot ; You got ta move on & quot ; . Sad , but true , and it 's true for the whole album .	-1
Both when it came out and now I hear some of the same baffling comments about this being a comeback , an important chapter in rock even sometimes . I gave it many chances then , and then now decided to give it another try . Whether or not some of this style was new for The Cult , it was nothing different from the sounds of the 90s metal and alt rock era . It was tired , very bland , boring , and tried to make up for that by being extra energetic and using a noisy harsh production . People for a long time now seem to think if it blares out of your speakers that they have a hard rock masterpiece . There 's not a single memorable song here ( being catchy is not memorable ) and I have no wish to dilute my standards by being kind to their efforts here .	-1
you should be familiar with the term & quot ; mall punk & quot ; by now . it 's the epitaph/fatwreckchrods/srv1 souding bands that are pretty much one band with a lot of masks . then people go to hot topic , by their cds and some big shorts , and claim to be punk rock . it 's pretty funny.okay , now imagine one of those bands trying to play weezer songs . it 's okay because they 're playing weezer , but it is bad because they 're being played by mall punks.it 's not that the songs on this cd are bad or anything , it 's just that they could sound so much better if played differently . weezer recently said that & quot ; pinkerton & quot ; was n't good bbecause it only sold 500,000 copies . it sounds like they want a # 1 album and will do anything to have one , including recording a bad album .	-1
Easily the worst Weezer album . The only song I liked on here was Photograph . It 's the only fairly decent song on here .

there are some really good songs on this.. but.. this is more of a cd single release.. i am a fan of weezer.. do n't get me wrong.. i love each of these 10 songs.. and that 's the point.. there are only 10 songs ! each one is 2-3 minutes long.. the total is less than 29 minutes ! in this day and age.. when a cd can hold 80 minutes.. there is no excuse for releasing something less than a half hour long.. and calling it a full release.. and more importantly CHARGING me for a full cd release ! why could n't weezer.. or their record company have put this out at a smaller price ? there are some decent releases out there.. the new Saliva.. and Cold.. that are priced in the 10 dollar range.. i paid 14.99 for this thing ! not worth the price..if you need the new weezer.. it 's got some great songs on it.. but.. do n't complain that no-one told you that it was this short.. cause i did . it 's a shame.. with even another 10 minutes.. i would n't have felt half as cheated.. but.. under a half an hour of music.. no.. i felt like i 've been robbed.. i wish i had bought this at a store that accepted bringbacks..	-1
yeah.. i 've been a weezer fan for some time , both previous albums are great in all respects . it 's like the law of the universe that everyone likes those albums . i was all about getting the new weezer and eagerly looked forward to this thing . i figured they 're the kind of band that just gets better with age because they 're all such great song writers/musicians.but no . i heard 'hash pipe ' and i knew , even then , deep within the recesses of my brain i could n't stand the song because it was horrible . i just really did n't want to admit what i really thought . i tried to force myself to like it because it was the first thing i 've heard from weezer in five years . then i bought the album , despite the awful bittersweet 'hash pipe ' . thankfully , hash pipe is the only song on there of it 's kind . as for the rest of the album , it is nothing but Rivers seriously trying to make up for the so-called blunder Pinkerton . he is just really trying to sell lots and lots of records with this one . simple , uninspired song structures , simple calculated riffs made to format the record comanies specifications no doubt.a very bad album from a very good band . let 's hope Rivers gets over what everyone but his fans calls a dismal flop ( Pinkerton ) and decides to start writing songs for himself , the band , and the fans.in the meanwhile , i am still looking forward to future efforts.still a fan . just let down and hanging around , so to speak..	-1
... but now I strongly DISLIKE them . Without further ado , let me state this clear fact : I used to own this album ( as well as the blue album ) when I was a teenager . I have listened to both from beginning to end a countless number of times , so that alone more than qualifies me for a review.Weezer used to mean something to me when I was younger , and therefore I was not yet as advanced or developed as I am now , in terms of the appreciation of more complex , sophisticated music , such as that which I have given favorable reviews here on amazon.com . Having been exposed to a plethora of hidden gems who have been around for as long as Weezer , or more recent , I have come to realize , especially with this album , just how dumbed down , generic , bland , derivative and simplistic Weezer really are . The short song lengths say it all . I simply can not take a band seriously if they do mostly short songs such as the ones on this album . They are really no better than the Jonas Brothers when you get right down to it . Sorry to make such a harsh comparison , but that 's truly the way I feel.I know some of you might be thinking , `` Come on , Hammerhead , there 's no need for music to be overly complex ! '' Well , I suppose that 's true ... . IF you like to listen to dumbed down , simplistic verse-chorus structured fluff like this . Sorry , but I have evolved past that way of thinking by now , and I am very proud of the way I have developed the ability to appreciate more complex music.If you are going to repsond to this , please spare me of any comments such as `` You 're just jealous ! '' or `` I 'd like to see you do better ! '' or `` How is it in your parents ' basement ? '' Those do not have anything to do with the matter at hand , and are just futile attempts to disarm me . Not only that , but they prove to me that you ca n't think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion . If you are one of those people who would say any of these things , then kindly leave . Thank you.I also wish to point out that arguments such as `` Oh , but you can HEAR what they 're singing ! '' or `` You can actually sing along and/or dance to it ! '' are simply NOT going to cut it . If you are going to defend Weezer , especially against a former fan such as myself , you 're going to have to do better than that . Those comments still do n't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself , be it vocally , lyrically , instrumentally , etc . If you have something of a deeper argument for me , I would be glad to take a challenge . ; ) All in all , I just HAD to get this off my chest . I used to like Weezer , I used to own this album , but now my world has long since turned and left them behind . If you like them , then that 's great . I have no problem with that . Thank you all in advance for your understanding . : )	-1
i remember when this album first came out : it was my sophomore year of high school , the cover was blue , they had a different bassist ... oh , wait a minute ... this cd is not the band 's best work . & quot ; hash pipe & quot ; is a relatively catchy song . however , if you have heard that track , you have heard them all : simple pop songs with just enough guitar bite to retain credibility , vocal melodies cleverly disguised as guitar solos , you get the idea.this disc is not as refreshing as 'the blue record ' was and its not as punk ( for lack of a better word ) as 'pinkerton'.weezer played it too safely this time .	-1
Weezer returns with a more polished sound and less energy than either of their other two releases . The Green Album is by far the worst of the three Weezer albums . Tracks like Hash Pipe and Island in the Sun are average , but it seems that Weezer was trying to return to the & quot ; pop-rock & quot ; formula of their highly successful debut album , but here they just do n't pull it off . Weezer definitely needs a more raw and rough production sound to display their power . The band has toyed with disbanding over the last couple of years and after hearing this I can honestly say that I would have been happier if they did . Their legacy will be Pinkerton and the Blue Album . Only hardcore completists should buy this . Also check out any of The Rentals cd 's with ex-Weezer bassist Matt Sharp , it 's some cool nerd rock .	-1
I do n't like this album or Emo . weezer and Emo are for suburban squares whose favorite movie is Ferris Bueller 's day off and favorite book is catcher in the rye . These guys should of quit 8 years ago .	-1
Despite the fact that I own three Weezer CDs , Im not really a big fan . I dont quite understand what people see in them . I bought them because my friend said they were really good , and sometimes they are , but I wouldnt say any of the albums were good buys , save maybe Maladroit . This was the worst.First of all , this is pathetically short ( 28 min ) . No Weezer CDs are really long , but thats just stupid . Second , this CD it too soft . The blue CD could be hard when it wanted to be , and even when it was soft it had impressive guitar work ( Say It Aint So ) . Maladroit isnt that soft at all . But this sounds pretty soft and boring all the way through . The lyrics plainly didnt involve very much thought , and the instruments arent anything special either . There was also a lack of stand-out tracks . The slightly dark single Hashpipe , Island in the Sun , and Simple Pages I can remember . The rest arent very memorable or catchy even while youre listening to them . Lastly , Rivers Cuomo appears to be a pretty lame singer . He might sound OK doing a solo in a high-school auditorium , but a professional musician ? He sounds , basically , really bored all the time . He certainly doesnt make the music any more interesting with his vocals . The 28 minutes almost seem to drag on sometimes . If you just want easy listening , this might be OK . But if you want any sort of good musicianship or depth of emotion or anything that makes up a really good band , you wont find it here . I wouldnt recommend it to new listeners or previous Weezer fans . I dont get what this geeky if sometimes catchy band has done to earn its large and devout fanbase.Closing Comments : Could we get something in the booklet besides a blurry concert pic ?	-1
Gone is the cleverness that made Weezer & quot ; special & quot ; . Now little more than bubble gum rock from from a bygone era . But there are little gems in this otherwise mediocre offering . Hash pipe comes to mind with it 's quirky vocals , and for some reason I think Island in the sun will appeal to all you Trashcan Sinatra fans out there.Smile is reminiscent of an Oasis B-side . Other than that , the tracks basically come together template style . Three chord , simple lyric music has been overdone overmuch as of late . I still enjoy this album because it 's not challenging in the least . A simple listen when simple music is in order .	-1
plastic ( plas ` tik ) adj.1 . Capable of being shaped or formed.2 . Easily influenced ; impressionable.3 . Capable of building tissue ; formative.4 . Weezer 's third albumWeezer 's `` return '' in 2001 was easily one of music 's most heartbreaking disappointments for me . Anyone who owns and loves the Blue Album and Pinkerton will tell you what a wonderful effect Weezer had on their life . On the Blue Album there were enough hooks , melodies , and emotion to fill three albums and Pinkerton was simultaneously blistering , angry , and catchy like nothing else . Both of these albums are among the best the 90s has to offer and are , simply put , absolutely essential.Then along came this abysmal catastrophe also known as `` The Green Album . '' This record is nothing but a mere shadow of the Weezer that once was . It is stale , polished , emotionless , powerless , and shallow . It 's obviously nothing more than an attempt to earn some chart success , produce a few cash-grabbing singles , and exploit Weezer 's devout fan base.The Green Album is the opposite of Weezer . BOYCOTT THIS RECORD.The only decent song on this monstrosity is `` Island in the Sun , '' though you 're probably already sick to death of it due to its radio overplay . But if you have that song downloaded , that 's truly all the Green Album that you need.Please , if you have n't heard Weezer 's first two albums , pick those up if you 're interested in the Weez and skip right over this harrowing disaster .	-1
Damn you Weezer ! Why abandon all the musical growth you present on Pinkerton , and replace it with THIS POPPY CRAP . Its the blue album WITHOUT THE CATCHYNESS ! ! ! every song drags you to the next one , no tempo or mood changes at all ... The new bass player sucks too . He plays every damn song EXACT the same notes as the guitar . I saw Weezer on the green album tour , and was not impressed too many Green album songs - NO PINKERTON SONGS AT ALL , and a lot of songs from Maladroit wich also sucks .	-1
I am a pretty big fan of Weezer . buddy holly basically defines the 90 's music ! I eagerly awaited the release date and rushed out to buy it along with the new REM cd . I put it in , and i was pretty disappointed . there just seems to be something missing from it . What i dont get is that it took them 5 years to put together 28 minutes worth of songs . i paid 13.99 for 28 minutes of songs with virtually no booklet insert . The songs are alright , some of them stand out while some of them sound like fillers . thats why im giving it two stars . but i was very disappointed , i guess i was just expecting more . check out the new REM album though , that one 's a keeper .	-1
Catchy , but then again ... so is NSYNC . Hash Pipe is the only original song on the album , and also the best . People like to think of Rivers Cuomo as this weird , tormeneted guy who has major problems in the head and therefore writes a bunch of really sicko interesting Weezer songs . Truth is , Pinkerton was a great album but was n't nearly as sicko a people seem to think , although compared to nonsense songs like Buddy Holly and & quot ; The Sweater Song & quot ; it was at least personal . Mostly it was interesting because it was a self-produced , experimental album with sincere , introspective songs . Not to mention the guitars had an edge to them , the lyrics were dark , the album actually had a title ... Now you 've got the green album , a short burst of forgettable pop love songs . Do n't Let Go and Knock Down Drag-Out scream sellout , while Island In the Sun is okay until you realize its meant to be taken sincerely . The end result is an album that 's ultimately nauseating , sort of like Hole 's Celebrity Skin but less catchy and with even less lyrical content . The fact that Weezer fans consider this album even slightly & quot ; punk & quot ; or & quot ; emo & quot ; astounds me . Maybe its River 's glasses that does it -- take them away and Weezer 's record sales would probably be cut in half . Until people start wanting to hear songs with a deeper meaning instead of lame tossed-off pop love songs , I guess we 're all just going to have to deal with Weezer having credibility despite its fakeness .	-1
After 5 years i think everyone was expecting a lot more but Weezer just couldnt match the myth that they had become . there are some good songs on this album but nothing too amazing . actually the songs on this album are kinda forgettable and bland . i would get maladroit over this album .	-1
So Weezer for several years sat around in each of their own computer rooms writing love letters via instant messenger to japnese women in of all places Japan , whom they would most likely never meet . Now Rivers being the smart guy he is , mentioned that he was from the band Weezer in order to score a date with one of them . The problem was , none of the Japanese girls remembered Weezer , so he had a dilemma . Should he not make another album that would sound stale and contrived compared to all his other material or make another album so he could , maybe , pick up chicks . Rivers had n't had a date for like five years so he decided to make another album . Now Rivers could n't get his original bassist to come along , Matt Sharp , who was off making better music with The Rentals . So Rivers replaced him with another nerd so no one would notice . They sat down and were wondering what course they would take with the new album , but Rivers , being the God he is among his fans , interrupted and said they should make a word for word ripoff of their fan favorite original album , lots of people would buy it and it would rock the house.Rivers was partly right , it did sell lots and lots of copies that were soon sold to used record stores across the country , for good reason too . There are two good songs on here , Oh Girlfriend ! and Island In The Sun , but neither come close to comparing with anything off the blue album or Pinkerton for that matter . The album sounds all pleasant too , which sounds all fake and stuff because you know Weezer ca n't be happy because their nerds and there is no way . They 're supposed to be all gloomy and doomy . Then they have all these lame RAWK songs like Hash Pipe which again are n't Weezer 's forte . Yeah , Weezer from here on out suck .	-1
From the minute you hear Sing you know Travis have n't changed a bit . They 're perfectly happy to remain the least risk-taking band in the world . I mean Sing is a very nice happy anthem to sing-a-long to but its not exactly the classic of the century . And I was n't really expecting heavy rock out of The Invisible Band , but they could have done a bit better than this . They now really do n't at all deserve the title 'Indie Rock ' or 'Alt Rock ' . I see the indie , I just about see the alt , but where 's the rock guys ? It not like The Invisible Band ever claims to be rocky , but with songs like Dear Diary and Safe ( which is exactly what the title suggests ) appall me . At least a few of the tracks are beautiful , unlike the re-hashed acoustic indie of The Man Who which abides on most of the rest , boring incredible by the end.This is wonderful as a lullaby album , but unfortunately not all of my life involves wanting to be sent to sleep .	-1
Since Sarah McLachlan has n't released any new material since 1997 's `` Surfacing '' , I suppose her record company felt the need to once again release a filler album in an attempt to satisfy McLachlan fans who are craving new material . Now that Sarah has recently had a baby , I do n't expect any new material from her until about 2003 . Anyway , `` Remixed '' just does n't cut it for this longtime Sarah fan . We 've heard these songs one million times before and these remixes do n't breathe any new life into them . The only ones I like are `` Angel '' and `` Hold On '' but the rest are silly and far too long . Unless you love dance music ( which is n't music to begin with ) try Sarah 's `` Remixed '' album . I think I 'll stick with `` Solace '' and `` Surfacing '' until she releases something new .	-1
I am not one to instantly disdain music revisions and curse them for not being clones of the original stuff I know and love . Hell , I still think thatUn-Led-Edby Dread Zeppelin is one of the best albums ever while I remain a solid fan of the Led ( in case you do n't know : Dread does reggae versions of Led Zeppelin songs while being fronted by an Elvis impersonator ) . So I do think that music can be revised and reheard.And here it is : the But ... But I think this remix disc seriously undermines the core strength of Sarah McLachlan 's music -- her voice.Odd to say , because for almost all of these tracks , the voice is all that remains of the original song . This disc is just another exhibit of a belief I have held for a long time , which is that electronic music is ultimately a very limited medium , and that the richness and variety of tones of media as ancient as percussion and the human voice will always outweigh electronics in spades ... unless the electronics are so intrusive and underdeveloped that even a voice as rich and multi-layered as McLachlan 's is put off-kilter by it.One track that stood out to me as a good example of the limits of electronic music is the Dusted remix of `` Angel . '' The rigid , limited rhythms of the electronic beats just ca n't come near addressing the more complex rhythms of McLachlan 's voice , and as a result , both of them sound out of place and a little silly ( one more than the other , obviously ) .It 's good to know that Sarah McLachlan is n't a purist or a separatist and does n't want to express in one area of music alone ( although , let 's face it , would L7 have been SUCH a bad choice for Lilith ? ) , but this particular effort set her voice back too much .	-1
Oy - I 'm getting too old for remixed dance music . This disk seemed like a good idea ( I purchased the import version about 2+ yrs ago ) at the time.Some of the stuff is good - but nothing is outstanding . But any subtlety or nuance that McLachlan uses in her standard releases is gone w/these mixes ( and is n't that true of most all dance/remix/electronic music ? ) .My biggest complaint is that McLachlan ( or more likely her record company ) reissues her music in multi-formats ( remixed or acoustic singles , 100s of compliations or soundtracks ) almost ad nauseum.I guess the company has to make a buck when it 's 6-7 yrs between original material .	-1
The White Stripes is one of the worst bands in rock n roll todayand this album is so dreadful it makes me sick , poor produced songs , stupid singing , and dreadful writingand their music video was horrible.Thank Goodness for AC/DC.At Least they are better .	-1
There 's no way these 2 pasty faced Detroit kids are playing just 2 instruments on this record and in concert ! ! Who exactly do they think they are , Local H ? ? I 've seen 'em on Letterman live , and there 's no doubt in my mind the song they played was pre-recorded . Only Jack Ryan 's voice was authentic in that performance.Nonetheless , they can hammer their instruments like pros . Part Zeppelin , part Sabbath , part Silverchair , the supposed `` brother and sis '' / '' ex-husband and ex-wife '' White tandem can jam hard when the mood strikes . It 's my theory that these 2 were just loafer friends who decided to put a metal band together . When they discovered they could n't cut the metal scene , they decided to be ultra-ironic , ultra-alternative , and the results are mixed at best.Oh well , enjoy the farce that IS White Stripes .	-1
Lem me just say , Jack and Meg , color coordinating does n't make you interesting OR inventive , nor does it distract me from the derivative music that you make . You are NOT the saviors of rock n ' roll ! In fact , Jack sounds like he 's trying to channel Robert Plant , and let 's face it boys and girls , Led Zeppelin are perhaps as tasteless as Phil Collins or Huey Lewis and the News ! To be fair , I wo n't deny that Jack and Meg are good musicians , but that 's certainly no guarantee for respectability . I do n't like ANY of their songs ; Jack 's voice is shrill and whiny and annoying ; his guitar work is more show-offish than anything ; none of his songs have a particularly interesting hook ; his lyrics are good examples of why dumb people should avoid attempting poetry ( that includes you , too , Jewel ) , and again , this whole fashion thing is n't clever . It 's a gimick , just like their & quot ; music & quot ; . I 've read that The White Stripes are even called a blues band . What ? ? ? They 're from Michigan ! ! ! Frankly , I 'd rather punish myself with a marathon of Dr. Phil than mess with this junk.For those of you that disagree , listen to the Immortal Lee County Killers -- now *that's* a good two-piece rock n ' roll band.And they 're from Alabama , so they have a true testament to the ideology of the blues .	-1
This one is a blatantly deceptive CD . I do n't see where their 'originality ' comes from ( recycled post-punk ? ) , but it seems that they are -like Andrew WK- the new so-called 'saviours of rock ' ( whatever . This means that they 'made it ' in the business : everyone , starting from MTV loves them ) . If you ask me , the only thing I would love from 'The White Stripes ' is the drummer , and not because of her drum playing . Sincerely , this is music destined to two kinds of people : A ) boyfriends whose girlfriends love Britney Spears ; B ) 10 to 25 years old pink `` Powerpuff Grrrrls '' ( see Kelly Osbourne ) . So , if you are INTO music , do n't waste your time on this . En fin , I gave this CD one star because amazon.com does n't let me rate it 0 .	-1
The slow songs are dreadful and indulgent . I wish people knew about the Gun Club .	-1
As somewhat of an amateur bass player , I simply can not condone any music that chooses to not have one . If I were to think of a classic artist - let 's say Bread , for instance - not having a bass player , I would think that band 's impact would be severely diminished . And do n't go telling me the Beatles never had a bassist . His name was Paul McCartney.The songs are pretty good , though .	-1
I first saw this Band on a Tv Show & was curious why all the Hype ? I was like what is the Big Deal about them & The Strokes ? ? but I have to Remember how things go in circles.the playing is alright the only thing that kinda makes them ok at best.but as far as Arrangements & Structure ? nope not here.I do n't feel the Vocals at all.it 's ok at best but forgettable in months as well .	-1
I 'm really starting to get confused here with the recent & quot ; return of rock & quot ; era which has brought so many out of country artists like the Hives , the Vines , the Strokes , the White Stripes , i mean what 's the difference , they all sound and look the same so why buy their albums ? The White Stripes might look and sound the same as others but at least two or three songs on the album are decent enoungh to hear . I fell in love with & quot ; Fell In Love With A Girl & quot ; the first time I heard it . & quot ; We 'll Just Be Friends & quot ; is pretty good and some of the other songs are alright.So , in my perspective , all the groups like this can just forget about having careers that last more than 15 minutes .	-1
OK , serious question here folks : is the critical and fan adulation for this band ( and Jack White in particular ) some kind of perverse in-joke by hipsters , kind of like the praise the French heap on Jerry Lewis ? It certainly ca n't be from serious admiration of the musicianship , songwriting , or singing , all of which are on the same level as a couple of teens who have just started to learn to play their instruments fooling around in their parents ' garage , or perhaps The Shaggs . I guess this is one of those phenomena like Captain Beefheart 's `` Trout Mask Replica '' , where people pretend to `` get '' it so they can think of themselves as cooler-than-thou , while all the time ignoring that the Emperor is buck naked .	-1
For about 2 years I waited for this lp . There was so much hype that he was holding it back to perfect it . To someone it may be perfect , but I have heard 95 % of all hiphop that is out there , but this seems to be average . Nothing really & quot ; perfect & quot ; about this album . I am a huge AZ fan , but this is nothing what I expected . I thought this lp was gon na be something on the same level as the classical illmatic . But unfortunatly it wasnt . Problems is a brilliant track along with At Night , but tracks with Joe ? That isnt the AZ I used to know . After hearing this album I lost massive respect for AZ . AZ if you are reading this bring it back to the streets where it came from .	-1
this is a suprisingly poor effort from a knowing rnb veteran like luther . he has strayed from his own reliable , solid team and brought in the talents of young , hip hop `` yo yo yo '' type gentlemen . it works well for the opening track `` take you out '' , a wonderfully simplistic and catchy song , but the remaining 15 or so tracks ... oh dear.he even talks about `` being a hater '' ( ? ! ) this is all very misguided . i love luther but the tunes on this album are not very enjoyable and do not suit his voice , its all a little too up tempo and it sounds very , well , ordinary . an unexceptional album .	-1
This cd was n't totally bad , just not as good as his previous work that I would n't have been born if not for his `` Any Love '' or `` Since I Lost My Baby '' but this cd ? Luther you can always come back . This overly pop cd is really not a good show of what Luther as one of the best r & b artists alive is capable of .	-1
Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie 's legacy , but lets face it , he really has very little talent , charisma , charm and just seems so dull , he is basically a male Paris Hilton , going around acting like the world 's biggest d1ck ny saying `` look people , I got money , arent I cool '' besides Biggie ( RIP ) , Bad Boy really is not great , most of the artists are poor quality , The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial . This album is basically not even worth printing or existing . It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV . I do n't know why people like Tupac , Biggie , Dimebag , Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths . So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve , a 1 star rating .	-1
It 's really not good . Very bad lyrics and weak Beats , that 's an awful Album . A lot of things have Changed with the Beats and Guest Rappers , but it has changed and it sucks ! Bad Boy Records is better in R'n'B than Rap now , with 112 and Dream , but in Rap they are behind all other Rap Labels . So if you like Bad Boy , buy 112 , and if you like Rap , buy Lil ' Romeo or Redman .	-1
Puff is now P. Diddy ... and the saga does continue.From wasted interludes like `` Smoke '' and `` Airport '' ... just stupid.The songs are horrible , this is worse than `` Forever '' his last effort . Puff ... P. Diddy ... .or Po ' Pity , is just a waste to this industry.The songs one to the next are just a slim slam of the same ole R & B ; rap [ crud ] .Recently I saw Po ' Pity on an interview saying due to his recent movie career with `` Made '' he wants to work hard to win ( 2 ) oscars ... that is his goal.Excuse me Po'Pity but being in this industry is about making good work for your fans , your self and your art not about winning awards ( that is icing on the cake ) , be lucky you are a millionaire , had somewhat of a career ( if that is what you want to call it ) , but I will bet my house , car , family , children , bank account that the academy will NEVER nominate you for a Oscar , further more a Golden Globe ... .but do n't worry Po'Pity there is always the Rasberry Awards , which I am sure you will win one year.As for this album it is a waste to the pop music industry , and is a waste of man made materials.Puff , P.Diddy or Po'Pity whatever you want to call him is just a JOKE , ... but he is laughing all the way to the bank .	-1
I Have not heeard this album but i do n't have to . If you are associated with Bad boy Records in anyway and your name is not Notorious B.I.G you are the reason the rap game is in bad shape right now . Where would Puff Daddy or P.Diddy or whatever his name is be without 2pac callin him out on his album 's . Puffy your nothing but a punk who is still rideing the Biggie Smalls wave . You are a untalented rapper who wants to be famous again	-1

For some reason about 3 years ago i used to like this b^tch for some f ! `` king reason , I bought this and played it on my cd player and for the whole 80 MINUTES ( yes 80 minutes of this sh % t ) I did n't like it . Yeah there was about one track I might of nearly liked but I have never listened to the whole thing since and i 'm planning on selling this sh^t . That says alot about the cd.Well there is about 25 tracks for P diddy and the bad boy family which was made in 2001 or 2002 I dont know but i dont like this . P diddy 's rhymes are weaker than a 2 year old and the production is just wack .

Puff Daddy or `` P-Diddy '' as he wants to be called now just gets more annoying and unoriginal with each album . I do n't understand how he consistently amazes me with his wackness and sell-out status . `` Diddy '' has got to be one of the worst songs ever in hip-hop history . Or at least up there somewhere . Just because you went out with Jennifer Lopez and sample a lot of songs does n't make you an emcee . And just because you dance around in your videos to try to look hip does n't mean you 're MC Hammer , either . At least Hammer had some dancing ability . Puffy is on Milli Vanilli level as far as being corny . `` Bad Boy For Life '' drove everyone completely insane over the summer , including me and my dogg Formally ( who also posts reviews here ) . His ego is bloated and it shows in his music , he should stay humble because sooner or later either no one will want to hear Puff Daddy anymore ( there are few who do these days actually ) or he 'll run out of songs to sample . And what 's with the shiny suit thing ? Is that supposed to make you think he 's a gangsta now too ? Man , if you 're a true hip-hop head , you already know , to stay away from Puffy or P-Diddy or P-Poppa , Pop-A-Diddy-Pop or whatever he calls himself these days ...	-1
This latest Bad Boy album is far the best Bad Boy Family album to come out but that is n't hard is it ... It still is n't good but he 's making progress 'cause if I listen to his previous & quot ; No way out & quot ; , damn , I just wan na poke out my eyes , it 's that bad ! This is slightly better though , but I think Puff has to try a little harder and hire some talented people for his crew 'cause they 're all wack exept for & quot ; Black Rob & quot ; ... I give this album 2 stars and not one cause I like the cover of the album , I like SOME of the beats ( wich are probably ripped off ) , Black Rob and & quot ; Child of the ghetto & quot ; wich is the only really GOOD song on the album ! Puff , why do n't you try a little harder ? It 's actually kind of sad to sea how such a great label , back in 1995 and all has gone pop ... but that 's just a part of the game I guess ... Well , I 'll probably give you a short summary 'bout this album for those who DO want to buy the album ! The best songs on the album are & quot ; Child of the ghetto & quot ; , simply the only ALL round good song and ... ... . that 's it ! BUT there are also some decent beats like & quot ; The saga continues & quot ; , & quot ; Bad boy for life & quot ; & quot ; DIDDY & quot ; , & quot ; Lonely & quot ; , & quot ; If you want this money & quot ; and that 's crazy is n't bad ... . but the rest of the album is n't really worth its money if you ask me ! But the choice is yours off course ...	-1
The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is becasue I feel the track with Carl Thomas and Faith Evans . As far as the rest of the average ... your usual P Diddy bs . If you feel this type of commercial hiphop then this may be the album for you , but if you into deep hiphop and you know hiphop then I would have to say dont get this .	-1
I do n't care what anyone thinks , P. Diddy , Puff Daddy , Puffy , Puff The Magic Dragon ( or whatever he 's calling himself these days ) ca n't rap ! He is definately one of the most overrated rap `` artist '' ( if you can call what he does `` art '' ) . I was a young white country kid when I first heard this dude ... and back then , I thought he could n't rhyme himself out of a wet paper bag . With this new album of his , I have n't heard much improvement in his rap skills . That 's my feel on the lyrical portion of the album . As for the beats : I was n't impressed at all . It sounds like he ripped off his beats from my kid brother 's Children 's Sing Along tapes . I hope for the sake of hip hop culture P. Diddy 's Saga does n't continue after this album .	-1
This album has to be one of the worst recordings of a time . Puffy used to be rap , but ever since '98 , he has been 100 % pop . If you want to pick up some real east coast rap , then check out & quot ; Reasonable Doubt & quot ; by Jay-Z .	-1
I 'm still wondering why I bought this stupid record . I should have known it was going to be bad since it was by `` P.Diddy '' . Every song on here is unbearable except for `` Let 's Get It '' and the okay `` Bad Boy For Life '' .The other 23 tracks ... are just pure junk . Skip this dumb and pointless CD and do n't even think of buying the remix version . Both were made for money and nothing else .	-1
Puffy ca n't flow . Rob is aight . G-dep is weak as hell.I would only buy if my brother shyne-po was on it but he ai n't . BadBoy Killa Shiney Suit Damager	-1
I am the biggest fan of lisa stansfield . Real Love was my favorite record growing up , and i still know every word to every song . She followed that one up with a pretty good CD only released in England , & quot ; So Natural & quot ; which had some great songs , but just couldnt live up to those vocals on Real Love . She finally tried to make a comeback in the US , but her self titled 1997 album peaked at number 55 and spent only 10 weeks on the charts . So , after 4 years of waiting , the record company decides to only release the CD in the UK . Well , the US isnt missing much . This is a total misrepresentation of Lisa . The album sounds like it was recorded in about an hour , with no budget or creativity . The lyrics are the weakest of her 's yet , and none of it is hardly as catchy . 8-3-1 has to be the best track , if any , because its the only track that hints what lisa can still do . Some songs have recycled club beats , while others are just syrupy love songs . If you want Lisa Stansfield , get Real Love . I just hope and pray she can pull a 180 with her next album .	-1
It is obvious that all concerned got carried away with the optimistism of this project . The song ideas are all brilliant at their very core , but the lack of a real rhythym section playing live ( as well as the absence of an outside production voice ) have prevented the vital essence that some honest critique in the production process would have lent to this effort . I felt myself wanting LESS songs , had they been produced with a live rhythm section and `` worked up '' . Also the album lacks those instrumental moments that make an album shine : even a SINGER 'S projects should employ and stretch a wider array of musicians . The overall effect of the production here equates to a very slick `` demo '' . Ian Devaney is a crackerjack writer , arranger , and producer , as well a REAL musician himself . One can only assume he was too amongst the trees to notice the growing forest around him.After some additional listening , I 'm softening my stance a bit with this edited review . Of note are the songs `` you can do that '' ( an affirming and sticky light groove that hooks the listener immediately and show 's Ian 's knack for sparing and effective horn arrangement ) , `` how could you ? '' ( a Bacharach-tribute arrangement with a bold dynamic jolt in the chorus ) , `` face up '' ( hypnotic and helpful mantra for those timid in love ... ) , and `` let 's just call it love '' ( an off-the-cuff techno groove that 's undeniably hip and spontaneous and keeps Lisa `` in-character '' despite new sonic territory ) . `` 831 '' should have been farmed-out to a teen act , where it would have sold lorries-full ! Lisa just sounds a little to grown-up to pitch it 's bubblegum mania . `` Wish on Me '' suffers from an under-developed lyric and would have been stunning in a more organic recording ; here it sounds too slick and registers as insincere . `` candy '' would be wickedly delicious if done in `` crunch funk '' style with a live R & B ; band.I can understand Lisa 's disappointment at the lack of a great reception for something she 'd worked long and hard on . I guess the point here is that a little less indulgence is sometimes a good thing . You will find at least 3 songs here you dig , more if you 're a Lisa fan , so I 'll not dis-recommend it , I 'll just say `` DIABETICS BEWARE '' ... . No matter what , Lisa 's THE universal songstress of her brit generation , watch her space !	-1
i see that many reviewers like this band and this album . i am not one of them . i thought the songs all sounded the same . the songs were weak and unoriginal . there is music that you listen to and instantly i am up alive and kicking . the music just hits you and wakes you up from inside out . this is NOT BTS . there are bands that you listen to and maybe you dont like them , first time around but you dont not like them either . they grow on you listen after listen . this COULD BE BTS but it is not.the songs are weak , badly written and mundane . there is nothing original or unique here . im sorry kids , but i see many of you like this band buy BTS are not the greatest band in amercia right now . ( there is no greatest band . any band i give , someone will always argue that ___ is better ) there is nothing of substance to move me either musically or lyrically.my take is to seek greener pastures elsewhere .	-1
Remember the part in the John Cusack movie & lt ; I & gt ; High Fidelity & lt ; I & gt ; where Cusack puts on that ` Beta Band ' CD to a head-bobbing reaction from the customers ? Well if you got the point of that scene , then you 'll hate the new Built to Spill CD , like most who enjoy quality music should . But if you 're in that majority who actually thought the scene showcased a great tune , then you 'll love this recording , and you have our sympathy . Glam-rock band Built to Spill 's latest CD ` Ancient Melodies of the Future ' represents what happens all too often in the music industry : a band starts off at an independent record label , gains a fan base then sell-out to a big record label , proceed to write five songs in a couple months and use five B-sides to make up a forty-minute record , release it , sell a million copies but it turns out to be amazingly bad , but who cares as long as the band and the record label make money , right ? But getting back to the actual album , Built to Spill 's latest offering has virtually nothing at all that 's enjoyable , or even thought provoking . Every song on the CD sounds the same as the previous one , making it feel like its just one overlong tune , not one song on the whole CD sounds original at all . The enormously dull `` You are '' shows this extremely well with its lyrics `` Everybody/Everybody/Everybody Knows/Everybody Knows/Everybody Knows That/Everybody Knows That '' which just drags on and on for four minutes . The band steals from great groups like Radiohead and Oasis , trying to recreate their tunes , but only accomplish falling flat on their face and failing miserably . However , the album is redeemed with `` Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss '' which goes back to their original glam-rock roots that made them so great in the beginning , and showcases what they could 've been . This is where we say farewell to the great independent band named Built to Spill , and welcome in the tedious , repetitive sell-out band by the same name .	-1
This has to be one of the most dissapointing albums i know . How come a dance group like Faithless with great hits like insomnia and god is a dj , make an album where 90 % of the songs are as far from that stuff as possible . The only song that really got the same sound as we remember from older days is `` We come 1 '' easily the best song on the album . If you like Dido there 's a song with here too called `` One step too far '' . Dido was a member of the group before she went solo . The way of singis is the same as before on the tracks with a chorus , but `` Mohammad Ali '' does n't sound like anything you previously heard of . There as some slow instrumental dance tracks too , but none of them are anything special . This album was dissapointing , i really thinkl they could make things better .	-1
I love Hey Mercedes . Farm brings that fire on nearly every track . But this collection fell a little flat with this former Braid fanatic . The syncopated drumming and angular guitar work are still there , but it 's just not the same . E for effort-but 1 star for quality .	-1
Yo this Cd is not nothing good or great at all . His first cd & quot ; It 's over now & quot ; is childish . Especially with the background singing . With the confusion of wanting to be from Philly to wanting to rep the West coast , He does have the skills to make a raw fusion between the two . This Cd ... . Maybe if it came in 1992-1996 , it would work but not now . Grab that Foxy , & quot ; Broken Silence & quot ; it is a classic . One	-1
I went out and got this album cos of the song its over . I thought all the songs gon na be as good as that . Guess what they all completely different.I cant believe it I thought this album would have sum west coast flavour but its just a a normal rap cd that doesnt stand out from the crowd.The only reason this cd been getting high marks is because people that have reviewed it are long time fans of kurupt . Well i just found out about kurupt from this album and im in a better position to review it from an unbiased position and from what ive heard im not going to bother buying another cd of his.Ok its over is a good track but thats it . Nothing else is making me listen to it and think wow.For me very ordinary and for me a album to be classed as good needs more than one good song on it.To sum it all up its very poor .	-1
I 've only heard one song but it was enough to know that Michelle Branch is being very over-hyped . She 's not that good . Her voice and lyrics are average , if that . Her hit song , whatever it 's called , sounds like it could have been written for any teenybop singer . I heard she writes her songs , though , so I have to give her that much credit . At least she has enough intelligence to write her own lyrics , however unoriginal they are . I guess our society is so accustomed to bad untalented pop singers ( Spears , C. Aguilera , J. Simpson , M. Moore , J. Lopez , etc . ) that when one of barely average talent comes along , they are held in much higher regard than they deserve . Michelle Branch is an example of that .	-1
Instead of saying `` you , '' she says `` you-a . '' Instead of saying `` everywhere , '' she says `` everywhere-a . '' Am I the only one who notices this ? I do n't get why she does it , but I find it really anoying . I do like the song `` Goodbye to You '' a lot but the one on the album is an acoustic version and it does n't sound as good as the radio version .	-1
Please tell me what is so special about this album ? ! I downloaded this and I listened to it for days trying to like it . Trust me , I really TRIED to like this album ! ! But there 's only a few listenable tracks ... and even those fade from your mind somewhat when this album ends . Five good tracks , to be exact . `` All You Wanted '' is great , along with `` You Set Me Free '' , `` Something to Sleep To '' , `` If Only She Knew '' , and `` Goodbye To You '' . The remaining six tracks are fillers . I especially ca n't stand `` Everywhere '' ! I hated the song when it first hit airwaves , and I still hate it now ! `` You Get Me '' is too bubble-gum for my taste . It reminds me of something from Mandy Moore 's `` So Real '' album ! And Michelle claims to be non-pop ? ! `` Sweet Misery '' starts out as a pop-rock number , but then when it gets to the chorus , the song is bubblegum pop ! The sudden genre change is what kills this song ! `` Here With Me '' is the exact same way , except for the verse is pop and the chorus is pop-rock . `` I 'd Rather Be In Love '' is just boring . I know that sounds uninspired and close-minded , but it 's simply repetitive with no interesting hooks or guitar chords . Now , `` Drop In The Ocean '' could 've been a great song . I love the lyrics , but the way it 's mixed with the heavy pop beat halfway through ruins the track ! ! It does n't go with the rest of the song ! The majority of these fillers would really be great songs if the pop beats were taken out !	-1
Really only half a star ... Michelle Branch pilescliche on top of cliche in this featherweight debut.I did n't think it was possible to create a sound thatsounded like watered-down Jewel ( since Jewel iswatered-down Melissa Etheridge ( Who 's watered downBruce Springsteen ) ) but she 's done it . Keep your money .	-1
Okay , I summed this up in my Avril Lavigne review ... I 'm going to say the same for Michelle Branch.Her CD is MEDIOCRE . Nothing special . She does n't talk about any real issues or anything ( although her CD was released before 9-11 , but it still does n't excuse her from writing about anything important to this world ) . The music itself is poppy , over-produced ... it 's very lackluster . She 's nothing special , simply put . I could have wrote those songs when I was twelve years old . Although I do give her a little bit more credibility than Avril Lavigne , because at least she 's not trying to be someone she 's not . However , she 's not all that great at singing , songwriting , or guitar playing.I gave her two stars because she 's not as bad as Avril.Face the facts . Michelle Branch does have some talent , but not very much . She is poppy . She is pop . Do you want proof ? Vanessa Carlton comes up with the same stuff . The only difference is the piano instead of guitar . The songs on her album are all made up of the same poppy stuff . They 're very identical to one another . The only real difference between & quot ; Everywhere & quot ; and & quot ; All You Wanted & quot ; is the tempo . And that 's it . She 's probably better quality pop than some other horrible stuff I 've heard ( like Avril Lavigne ) , but that 's not saying very much.And I do n't know why we always embrace people who have middle-of-the-road musical abilities and call them & quot ; sensational & quot ; in this society . But it 's funny that it happens most with women performers.I mean , sure , if you like that type of music , go for it .	-1
You have got to be kidding me . You actually think Michelle Branch is `` Awesome '' ? Tehehehehehe.This is just yet ANOTHER prime example of candy coated radio friendly garbage taking over our airway ! And anyone who would actually consider this `` sensation '' a good guitarist has musical issues . Michelle Branch is yet another example of massive musical decline.I could go on and on about how horrible this girl is , but anyone with ears would already know that . Music is dying and now you know why .	-1
When you read through most of the reviews , the & quot ; natural & quot ; conclusion is that Michelle Branch is the next best thing after water . Some people compare her to Alanis Morrisette . The matter of the fact is that , even if sometimes she sounds as her Canadian label mate , Michelle is not breaking any new ground as Alanis did back in the mid nineties . Her music ( radio-oriented as it is ) results entertaining indeed : songs such as & quot ; You Set Me Free & quot ; , & quot ; Something To Sleep & quot ; and & quot ; Goodbye to You & quot ; contain that something that characterizes pop music and appeal to a wide range of audiences , but they are far from original or deep.Now , the album does close with a song that shows what Michelle Branch is truly capable of : & quot ; Drop in the ocean & quot ; has a distinct feel to it , calm in the beginning and then on to an upbeat rhythm that still retains a special quality different from the rest of the album , also showing her vocal capability ( parts of this song actually reminded me of Madonna ! ) All in all , though , the album does n't help her enough . I would n't buy it : I am glad that I got a copy from the library .	-1
This music is pop . Pure and simple . At the time this cd came out ( 2001 ) it was a 'breath of fresh air ' compared to the likes of *NSYNC and Britney Spears . Michelle did n't prance around stage onstage in practically nothing . Her music was driven by guitar riffs instead of dance beats . So when you compare Michelle to say , Jessica Simpson she looks like a genius . But to compare her to any of the '90s female rockers ( Alanis , Liz , Tori , etc . ) is just laughable . Those women make Michelle Branch look like the brunette version of Jessica Simpson . Her lyrics are silly and trite , especially shown on songs like 'Goodbye To You ' ( goodbye to you/goodbye to everything I thought I knew ) . 'You Get Me ' is so bubblegum pop , it sounds like it could have been used on an early Britney album . You get my drift . I mean when Michelle came out , I was in love with her music . I thought she was the next best thing . But then I soon grew tired of her bland unoriginal music because it was ... everywhere ( no pun needed , ha ) . Avril , Vanessa , Lucy , FeFe , Lillix , etc . They all sound like they are singing each other 's songs . So if you want mature and empowering female music , listen to any of the female singer/songwriters of the '90s . They completely blow Michelle Branch out of the water .	-1
I got to hear this Album in full depth recently & I was curious after seeing She was on Madonna 's Maverick Records Label.I Give Her Credit for Writing & Playing . but overall thus far in the Game Her Material is fairly Safe.She has a Chance if She is Allowed out of a Formula Sound that appears alot on this Set.Vocally hard to say Where She will end up .	-1
I 'm not a big fan of women 's music , but this is ok. i also recommend Love , Shelby if you like this .	-1
I 'm being real . The fact that contemporary music listeners acclaim this CD as being one of the most deep and reflective albums in current Pop music shows how dumb we 've gotten since Britney Spears and N'Sync . This may be a notch up from Spear Britney and NStink , but it 's nothing to be acclaimed ; for Christ 's sake even the songs that hit the radio are hokey and overproduced , how long will it take listeners to again understand that there IS music past female posterchilds with one-hit-wonder written all over them ? No , i 'm not scapegoating anybody ! This is just uninspired , boring , and incredibly annoying . My female dog Missy has more true emotion and inspiration in her voice , and dog 's are probably the most emotionally shallow house animal there is . Stay away from this album , for God 's sake I 'd recommend Christina Aguilera 's new album over this.. I 'm Serious !	-1
how many more britney wannabe 's can we stand come on now , when will this pop stuff end .	-1
I was first exposed to Michelle on a late night `` live '' performance ... I first heard Everywhere there and it had punch , and the influction in her voice brought the promise of something really new and interesting . However , after hearing the cd after purchasing , I must say , the rest of the album scarcely resembles the song that is indeed , everywhere . There are highpoints , the vocals and production is layered appropriately however the cd just quickly devolves into `` typical '' . After `` Torn '' by Natalie and `` Taffy '' by Lisa Loeb I was hoping for more follow through as far as a `` complete '' cd . This is more a collection of chorus 's with the verses being more of an after thought than something solid . If you like lite pop this may be a good cd for you though if you are expecting something a bit more raw , alive , and down to earth this is n't it . ( ... ) you could do worse than the Spirit Room , but I ca n't reccommend it ( ** ) .	-1
I submitted a review/question for this album 2 times , it should be posted here by now . Please post my review .	-1
Historically speaking , John Coltrane 's final live recording from April 1967 at the Olatunji Center in Harlem is one of extreme significance . It was the next to last time Coltrane ever performed live . Within three months , he would pass away from liver cancer.The CD release of Coltrane 's Olatunji Concert is unfortunately only recommended for the utmost Coltrane die-hard . Musically , the concert is one of extreme power and great musicianship . However , the sound quality of the recording is way below standard almost to the point of being unlistenable . This reviewers theory is that this was the only copy of this recording available so Impulse Records had no choice but to use it.When listened to with the proper set of ears ( ie : if you can filter through the distortion ) , the Olatunji Concert displays Coltrane 's ensemble at their very best . Here , we get to hear Coltrane expand the percussive pallette by bringing in two percussionists to augement drummer Rashied Ali . Pharoah Sanders screeching tenor sax never sounded so violent yet so beautiful . Although he was obviously ill , John Coltrane himself was at his very best here as well . His multi-directional soprano sax work on the concert mainstay `` My Favorite Things '' is probably as far out as he has ever gotten . Granted , even if this was a high quality recording , it still would not be categorized as 'easy listening'.The essay that 's in the CD booklet is very informative offering an historical insight to the Olatunji Concert and its recording . There are many historic photos taken from Coltrane 's late period including one from the Olatunji performance itself.Because of the poor fidelity of this recording , it would have been nice if there were a warning label on the outside cover . Unfortunately , there is n't nor is there any mention of questionable sound quality in the CD booklet either . However , as mentioned above , this is an important and historical document that is recommended for the avid COltrane die-hard . For everyone else , this is definitely not recommended.For more historic live Coltrane recordings of this late period with more listenable sound quality , I definitely recommend the four-disc `` Live In Japan '' from 1966 as well as the double-disc `` Live In Seattle '' from 1965 .	-1
I got this CD b.c there was one song that came on the radio that i loved . I got the CD and that one song was the only one could take . its an OK CD but I wouldnt tell others to buy it .	-1
Look , I love the Isley Brothers ; I grew up with 'em , an ' I respect them for bringin ' new meaning to the term longevity , so for that reason there ai n't much bad I can say 'bout this album . I love Ron Isley 's voice an ' I love smoothed-out R & B ; , nice hooks , atmospheric an ' romantic background music an ' this album has ALL of those things . So why is this not an essential album to me ? Simple . These lyrics , while charming , sound like they comin ' from a young , thuggish R & B ; loverboy , NOT a mature , elder statesman who knows the game well . I do like the groove on 'Warm Summer Night ' an ' there are some even more solid songs on the set like the funky , guitar-fueled opener 'Move Your Body ' an ' the hypnotically soulful 'You Did n't See Me ' , both produced by the mos ' underrated talent in R & B ; Raphael Saadiq , an ' there are some hidden gems throughout like the monumental title track which owes the mos ' to their classic '70s ballads , but overall there 's jus ' not enough of that real , raw emotive grown-folks ' music I was in search of.Maybe Ron is tryin'ta relive his youth with this Mr. Biggs persona , maybe R. Kelly ( who , do n't get me wrong , I love as a singer ) HAS in some ways corrupted them , an ' then again maybe I jus ' do n't get it , but this style jus ' do n't work for me when it comes to the Isleys ' music . I 'll admit I like the bluesy flow of 'Contagious ' , an ' I 'm a sucker for this whole cinematic 'Down Low ' drama that Ron an ' Kelly have been playin ' out in song for the past few years , but they shoulda stayed on the musical path they were on from their '97 disc 'Mission to Please ' . THAT was grown-folks ' music , an ' THAS ' what I 'm lookin ' for in them ; I need my game to be backed up with some serious , uninhibited , classy romantic RELATIONSHIP music , not a cartoon character named Mr. Biggs feedin ' his ego an ' his appetite for sex.This album is the main reason , I 'm hesitant about pickin ' up their most recent album 'Body Kiss ' , 'cause from what I 've heard is ' all that this is an ' more ( or less dependin ' on how you look at it ) , so I guess if you gave this five stars , then you ca n't go wrong with it . But , me personally , I'm'a stick with their more substantial older stuff .	-1
if you love the man 's voice regardless of his lyrics , then this is a 5 star achievement ... but to me this album is lacking that special something that makes isley music so great . yeah , they have adult themes , but they just seem to be lacking the maturity level expected of romance and relationship music . try their BEAUTIFUL BALLADS CD or MISSION TO PLEASE ; those are both great albums .	-1
After & quot ; When I Look In Your Eyes & quot ; , expectations for a follow up ran extremeley high . With its sultry bossa nova rythms , cool down-beat jazz sensibilities ( the sort that would fit as easily into a James Bond film as it would fit at Carnegie Hall ) , & quot ; When I Look.. & quot ; stands as a masterpiece of contemporary music.So , when I learned that Diana Krall would be releasing her follow up CD in Singapore ( with an invitation-only party at the famous Raffles Hotel on September 10 , 2001 ) , that only heightened the anticipation . While Singaporeans do not consider themselves & quot ; exotic & quot ; , Singapore is rich with history -- ocean piracy , wars and conquest , commerce and trade , and [ most recently ] information & amp ; bio technology , to cite a few highlights . So in terms of melodrama , there was an aura of exotia surrounding this release . The song list on & quot ; Look Of Love & quot ; also promised a lot , and the release party concert performance was excellent ( Singapore 's main TV station was kind enough to broadcast it a month later ) .But the & quot ; Look Of Love & quot ; CD itself is a dud.The jazz is buried under languid over orchestration that makes cool jazz sound like bad classical music . THis is n't & quot ; torch singing & quot ; , it tortured ( or perhaps tortuous ) singing.While many songs start out with 20-30 seconds of strings , it often seems like several minutes . & quot ; S'Wonderful & quot ; and & quot ; Cry Me a River & quot ; start out promising ( no strings ) , but are quickly demolished by the over-orchestration.So , it is with some regret that I have to recommend that fans of jazz skip this CD and wait for future releases . Diana Krall needs to find a producer who understands what makes great jazz , and fire this one -- who thinks jazz needs to be murdered with mushy string overlays in order to make it & quot ; commercial & quot ; . I 'm not sure how much control Diana Krall has over her releases , but the mushy overlays of sweetening tracks is done so badly that I found myself questioning the technical , in addition to the aesthetic , competency of the producers & amp ; engineers.THere is reason for optimism here . The song selection is strong , and underneath the layers and layers of sweetening tracks and all the faux-classical mush laid on top , the core jazz band still sounds solid . And then of course , there are Diana Krall 's vocals , good as ever.If this CD is & quot ; the Look of Love & quot ; , then it 's clear Love can be painful .	-1
It completely amazes me that the jazz field is so zoned out today that it promotes a flat and lifeless singer like Ms. Kral yet ignores great talent like Carmen Lundy , Diane Schuur and Ernestine Anderson ! ! If you are really interested in great jazz singing check out the amazing `` Love Makes The Changes '' by Ernestine Anderson and `` Something To Believe In '' by Carmen Lundy ! ! These will both spin your head around and show you what great jazz singing is all about ! ! The production on The Look Of Love is superb but the vocal tracks are not inspired and bring nothing interesting to the great program of songs ! ! Now if Ms. Lundy or Ernestine Anderson laid down the vocals in this great production then we would have something to get excited about ! ! ! ! For now those of us who love great singing can only wish and hope for the day when the jazz world wakes up from its stupor and gets behind great talent . In the long run exciting artists create excited fans who rush to buy product that has something of substance to get excited about over and over ! ! ! I see tons of understock everywhere I go on the works of the overpromoted Ms. Kral .	-1
Diana Krall is a very talented artist , but & quot ; The Look of Love & quot ; is nothing new . This album shows no new design on the jazz world.Krall is a big name due to her packaging . Her very good looks with the talent of an amazing voice which in my book is in the same league as Shuur , Horne or any of the other women jazz afficianados.Kralls beauty is her beast . Though she is more commercially successful than her predecessors , she shows no soul in her music like Diane Shuur or Shirley Horne . Diana Krall is like Cindy Crawford in a way , she is there to put on a dress ( jazz music ) and make it look pretty.Though a good album there is no new material or sound here that I have n't heard before . Diana Krall is all dressing and no depth.She is the Britney Spears of the jazz world showing with her good looks and good voice that with mundane jazz music and proper packaging she can be a superstar ... .shame.With the wonderful talents of Diane Shuur , Martha Wash , Jill Scott , and other female artists that do n't get as much attention it is a pity we have to go as far as good artificial looks and pristine packaging to finally get this countrys attention on good music . i.e . Josh Groban who I think will be a opera superstar- but only with his youth and good looks will get the teen set to finally appreciate good opera music.Shame that this country is so shallow . For Krall & quot ; The Look of Love & quot ; is basically & quot ; The Look of the Same Old Thing & quot ; .Nothing new , with a pretty face , a good voice trying to make some extra bucks for a record corporation .	-1
It is sitting in my cd rack but it was not my idea to buy this album . I do not understand why artists that can not come out with their own songs have such a great success . At least , if she would have done those songs in a diffent style than the original songs , it would be a little more interesting and creative . Imagine a country version of `` The look of love '' , or the opposite , a jazz version of `` Sweet dreams are made of this '' .I find women have a lack of imagination in music . Singing is the big thing for them and that 's about it . When they touch an instrument , they do n't want to reinvent music and limit themselves in few styles . Sexy and good looking is another big thing that I would trade easily for woman with charisma . Would they venture to be part of a band instead of being the sole member ? Stupid as it is , I have a pair of shoes that I call my Diana Krall 's shoes , as if she was nothing else than a pair of legs on top of high heels. ( ... )	-1
With a voice as smooth and inoffensive as white bread soaked in skim milk and a piano style that rarely strays outside the cocktail lounge , Diana Krall has herself locked into a formidable market niche . But you ca n't really mistake this for jazz.She can continue to make albums like this as long as her voice holds out , and with as little effort as she expends on singing , that should be about for the next 40 years or so . She sings everything in the same formless , murky alto , creating the comforting sameness that executives need after a hard day at work firing people and cutting budgets so they can afford their salaries.This is a cruel and evil recording , slick , faceless , manipulative to the Nth degree , perfectly tailored & quot ; jazz & quot ; for people who know nothing about , and in truth probably would hate , real jazz.I have heard far too many people compare Ms. Krall with other great artists , but the one person she most deserves comparison with is Perry Como . But even that facelessly bland crooner pales in comparison with Ms. Krall 's emptiness . She is almost Zen in her absence of personality or style , but Zen is never quite as terrifying . There 's something of the android about her that chills the soul.As a marketing gimmick , as smooth muzak for the & quot ; adult pop & quot ; market , this succeeds , but you have to wonder how evil people have to be to create something like this and pass it off as & quot ; jazz. & quot ;	-1
After the immensely enjoyable & quot ; When I Look in Your Eyes & quot ; CD , I had high hopes and expectations for this highly-anticipated follow-up . Krall owes a lot to her & quot ; When I Look ... & quot ; CD , which converted more fans to jazz and Krall than any of her previous ones . Imagine my surprise when I plopped & quot ; Look of Love & quot ; into my player . Has Diana or her producers been listening to Lawrence Welk ? ? ! ! This CD lacks originality , purpose , or inspiration . It seems the record company was trying to cash in on one of their biggest cash cows ! ! I always thought Krall was one to play a bit too safe , but not THIS safe ! ! She should also fire her publicist for making her pose in that hooker outfit on the CD cover -- -what an atrocious picture ! ! I 'm sorry to be getting down on Krall , but I 'm sure as a fan , there are others like me who are very disappointed with this CD . What about her piano-playing , they do n't even get one song to show off here -- -it 's all muzak strings thru and thru.Please , Diana , next time go back to your roots and come up with something more original -- -- and please , put SOMETHING over that dress ! !	-1
I saw Diana Krall at Blues Alley in DC , which holds some 50 people , some years back . One of the best concerts I ever saw . She had a trio with her . She and the accompanyists played long breaks - 15 minutes of instrumentals and 2-3 minutes of singing . There was lots of well joined interaction with the bass and guitar in the trio.I 'm sure this CD will be popular with a lot of people . The cover and inside pictures show us a lot of skin and Diana in almost pinup poses . She sings a lot of slow ballads - I usually like ballads.I eargerly anticipated this CD . It is a profound disappointment . I have to say this CD is listless and energy-less . Diana sleepwalks through the perfomances . She hits a few keys here and there but there is little or none of the Nat King Cole style piano which graced her earlier albums . She is overwhelmed by a sea of syrupy violins . I ca n't believe she enjoys doing this stuff.Maybe she can make a deal with Verve . One album of schlocky orchestrated ballads followed by one album of trio work where she gets to play her sparkling piano parts and the singing is minimal . That 's what she does best and what she obviously enjoys.For much better Diana Krall with energy , buy & quot ; All for You & quot ; or perhaps & quot ; Love Scenes & quot ; .	-1
This is an okay two and half star disc but it most certianly is n't a disc I could find myself putting next to my portishead , hooverphonic or lamb CDs . This is not D n B or trip hop in any way , shape or form rather this is more on the likes of say kylie minogue or really bad euro pop stuff that you 'd hear on the dance floor of a gay niteclub . Not to say that this is bad or anything but it did n't float my boat as far as DnB or trip hop . Hardly dark at all , full of inane lyrics and the music at times is incredibly cheesy . 'demonstrate ' is a cool intro that i liked a lot but alas it 's only 26seconds long . 'hide u ' is pretty good as well as ' ( slip & slide ) suicide ' and 'i want it all ' . If you 're into supreme beings of leisure you may like this but raise the cheese factor to the nth degree . Maybe in a couple of years with a more refined and crisper sound production kosheen could be a bit better but for now I 'll stick to lamb and esthero . On a side note these guys are being compared to Baxter . Do n't believe the hype . Baxter is definitely on the order of hooverphonic and portishead , dark and twisted full of churning staccato drum beats and woeful lyrics . Check them out instead and borrow this from your friend with bad musical taste .	-1
I just want to make one thing clear , right from the start ... .I love John Hiatt ! I think he has some totally classic songs amoung his work for Geffen , and his block of albums for A & amp ; M rival any artist 's catalog . That said , Hiatt seems to be in a bit of a slump . It started back in '95 with WALK ON , his debut CD for Capitol , and continued in '97 with the abysmally bad LITTLE HEAD . Things did , however , seem to rebound a bit last year with the acoustic-based CROSSING MUDDY WATERS . Which brings us to THE TIKI BAR IS OPEN . Recorded , for the most part , before CROSSING ... .. , Hiatt still seems lost on much of this CD , unsure of where he wants to go and what he wants to do , grasping at musical straws and styles . It 's not that TIKI BAR ... is a bad album ; it just seems unfocused , and Hiatt seems to be dealing with the lack of focus by A ) tossing in every kind of musical style that he could think of and B ) using some of his lesser ( read : weaker ) material . I guess you could sum up THE TIKI BAR IS OPEN as The Good , The Bad and The Filler . Let 's go over The Bad first . The CD opens with & quot ; Everybody Went Low & quot ; , a noisy send-up that 's supposed to & quot ; ROCK ! & quot ; , but just ends up banging and bouncingall over the place . Next up is & quot ; Hangin ' Round Here & quot ; , a song with lyrics so trite it 's hard to believe Hiatt wrote them : & quot ; If I could go back to love 's first blush/Oh my Lordy it would be a big rush/But I know you ca n't go back/You got ta keep moving that 's a natural fact. & quot ; I mean , c'mon ! Then there 's & quot ; I Know A Place & quot ; , a song on which the singer attempts to be something he 's not . On this dismal track we are introduced to Muddy Hiatt ... ..or is that John Lee Hiatt ? ! ? Whatever the case may be , we 're subjected to some really bad blues , and in this case & quot ; bad & quot ; do n't mean good ! The CD ends on a down note with & quot ; Farther Stars & quot ; , a track chock full of sequenced vocals and loopy , quasi-third world mysticism that lasts at least three minutes too long . On a more upbeat note , tracks that seem more like standard Hiatt ( but still have holes in them ! ) include the poignant & quot ; Come Home To You & quot ; , the heartbreaking & quot ; Something Broken & quot ; ( both of these songs shine on TIKI BAR but would have been buried on side two of BRING THE FAMILY ... ..thus , the Filler ! ) and the title track , with it 's other-worldly groove . It 's got a great beat , and you can dance to it , but ... ... ..it just does n't go anywhere ! The same can be said about & quot ; All The Lilacs In Ohio & quot ; ; this track features some of the CD 's best lyrics ( & quot ; She 's the love story you speak of/When you talk to Sam at the bar/But it 's in the details that your story always fails/Yeah close but no cigar & quot ; ) , but the song 's magical prose is drowned out by an over-amped , jarring beat ; the instrumentation destroys any chance of absorbing these thoughtful lyrics . The CD 's best moments , however , come on three tracks where this is n't allowed to happen . First there 's & quot ; My Old Friend & quot ; , a thoughtful ode to the past . All harmonica and strumming guitars , it tells a story ( & quot ; I thought we were gon na make that bridge/What do I know/Me and my expectations/Was always high & quot ; ) about ups and downs and holding on to what counts . Next is the gospel-tinged & quot ; Rock Of Your Love. & quot ; Featuring some gorgeous guitar work from Sonny Landreth , this is classic John Hiatt . Rounding out the Top Three is & quot ; I 'll Never Get Over You & quot ; , with it 's haunted , pained vocal and fuzzy , almost eerie , fret work . So ... ... in summing it all up ... ... will I listen to THE TIKI BAR IS OPEN much in the future ? I doubt it . Will I give up on Hiatt , even if this musical mid-life crisis continues for two or three more albums ? Absolutely not ... ..he 's one of the most important singer-songwriters of the last two decades . I 'll probably just put on PERFECTLY GOOD GUITAR while I wait for things to ... ..settle back ... ..into a place full of stolen moments .	-1
Juvenile WHAT HAPPENED ? ? ! ! ! ! I really enjoyed Juvenile 's `` 400 degrees '' but Project English ... ... ... . I just do n't know what to say . Its ... ..garbage . { I hate to say it } Juvenile was the ONLY cash money artist I ever liked . But this album only had a couple of songs I liked , but being truthful here , I do n't recomend this album at all .	-1
not as bad as `` Juve the great . '' Set it off i like . it 's funny because it sounds like Sherlock Holmes . `` Mamma 's got a** '' is good too . sounds like a ride you 'd hear at a carnival ; carnival music . Still you can pass on this .	-1
Everybody who says that this is Juvenile 's worst album is on the money . Juvenile was about to leave Cash Money so he put out a halfassed effort in order to fullfill the contract promise before he left . This album is the end product . The album has two flaws : Juvenile doesnt sound as inspired as he did on Soulja Rags and 400 Degreez and Mannie Fresh 's production was already becoming redundant . The Good : Set It Off was an okay first single but the remix with The Hot Boys and Baby is somewhat better . My Life and They Lied are the best tracks on the album . Mama Got A** is Back That Azz Up part 2 and Lil Wayne saves What U Scared 4 from being a total waste . The Bad : H.B . Headbuster is unwashed crusty butt ! Be Gone with The Big Tymers is garbage plus how are you going to have a song on Juve 's album without Juvenile on it ? In The Nolia is a total waste and Get Your Hustle On is boring . The Ugly : White Girl is just plain awful . In Ya A** is trash and has the dumbest hook the Juve has ever put together . 4 Minutes sounds like a piss poor imitation of the old Doug E Fresh classic 6 minutes and the reggae-inspired Sunshine is bad enough to offend the Jamaican Community . Bottom Line : This was and still is Juvenile 's worst effort . Even though every album that came after it was suspect , this album still stands out as his worst . Juvenile just doesnt have the fire that he had when he first came in the game and he pretty much sounds like he 's just making tracks for the hell of it .	-1
