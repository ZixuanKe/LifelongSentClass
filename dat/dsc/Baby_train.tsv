Perfect for new parents . We were able to keep track of baby 's feeding , sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life . Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there !	1
This book is such a life saver . It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends , answer pediatrician questions , or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn . I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital . We went through all the pages of the newborn version , then moved to the infant version , and will finish up the second infant book ( third total ) right as our baby turns 1 .

Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work . It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need . I could n't be happier with this book .	1
I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn . This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine . When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work , it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go . When he was sick , it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated . The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk , etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work . Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son . LOL	1
I wanted an alternative to printing out daily log sheets for the nanny to fill out , and this has worked out great ! I 'm no longer searching my daughter 's bag for a crumpled piece of paper each day . It 's also nice to be able to look back on previous days and weeks for eating and sleeping patterns . I would have preferred a plastic-type cover , but it 's held up well so far .	1
This is great for basics , but I wish the space to write things in was bigger . A lot times I need struggle trying to read what the caretaker wrote in because the spaces go together .	1
My 3 month old son spend half of his days with my mother and half with a neighbor while I worked . I had them track his activity ( loosely ) in this which allowed me to get an idea of how his schedule was developing and how much milk he was eating . It was the best way to have some cohesion in his life while I was at work .	1
This book is perfect ! I 'm a first time new mom , and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings , diaper changes , sleep . Definitely would recommend this for new moms . Plus it 's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits .	1
The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available . You can track naps , feedings , diaper changes , activities , and notes . They 're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker , which tracks nights and days . It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones . Once I used up the entire book , I bought this Baby Tracker , which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now . Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day . It 's a great way for me to know what happened . Plus , it 's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends .	1
During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby 's feedings , urination and bowel movements . However , when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby 's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you ca n't even remember what day it is . The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time , could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding . It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician 's after hours on-call doctor . Looking at the tracker we realized a trend , the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements . This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk ( to see how much we get ) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in . The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for . In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk . For a while I was n't sure what was giving him horrible gas , so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy ( we have a peanut allergy in the family ) . We even write notes about his first smile , who came to visit , ect to keep in his memory box .	1
I use this so that our babysitter ( grandma ) can keep track of what goes on during the day . We 've recorded so many milestones since we received this . It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes . I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm , but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes . The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired , we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up . I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care . It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations . I 'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book .	1
This book is a great way for keeping track of daily changing and feedings . My only wish is that it was in a 24 hour format . But other than that it is great .	1
Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work . Nanny is able to fill it out easily ... .love it	1
Easy to use , simple ! I got this when my baby was 2 months old and love it . It makes it easy to track things and write down developmental notes in an organized way . I know moms who create spreadsheets of their baby 's nap times , etc . But I 'm not one of those people ! This book is practical and great !	1
We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month . It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough . Great book !	1
This item was extremely helpful , especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities . My husband of mom did n't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed . It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already , and even helped me note and analyze baby 's sleep patterns once he got a little older . Definitely a useful item to have .	1
I 've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital . We 're on the third one now . It 's useful for when the doctor asks how often she 's feeding and urinating , but even better for looking at and realizing , & # 34 ; Oh , she has n't slept in x number of hours . She 's probably crying because she 's tired. & # 34 ; But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule . I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern , then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day . It helps a lot .	1
Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby 's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went . What I really love about it , though , is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened . I knew that I would n't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning ( and sure enough I did n't even get it out until after 2 months ) , and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over . Life saver ! ! All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten !	1
I 've been using this since the day my baby was born ( 1 month ago ) and it is a life saver ! It is a great way to track when I breastfeed , what breast he ate from , how long , etc . Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers . Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day ... so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all . I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate , slept , or pottied . I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life !	1
I did n't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking & # 34 ; when was her last diaper ? & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; when did she eat and for how long ? & # 34 ; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones . I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes , you could just use regular paper , but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom : )	1
I have used this book since my son was born . It 's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper . Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor . This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I 'm gone . They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I 'm at work . Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age . I 'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old .	1
I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker . From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember , so I bought it . I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw . Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks .	1
I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it ! It is super easy to leave by the baby 's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day ( feedings , dirty diapers , nap times , etc ) . I also used it to jot down other important & # 34 ; mile stone & # 34 ; things that I would have quickly forgotten & # 8230 ; like outings , temperature readings , visits from friends to meet him , calls to make , when we stopped swaddling him , etc . I was able to use it as a resource when ( many months later ! ) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories .	1
We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful , especially when several people are helping with the baby ( ex : visiting family , etc . ) We loved it so much that I 've bought another one and have almost filled that one too . I like having the room to write things about our baby 's day and development , plus use the `` Notes '' section to write some story , etc . It also helps `` Dad '' see what has happened that day and feels more connected . I will be buying another one soon !	1
GREAT journal . We use this everyday to communicate feeding , medicine and other needs when I do n't have time to give my nanny the full rundown . LOVE it ! I 've bought two !	1
I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful . My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants . His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues , which I was also able to track in the journal . After weeks of sleep deprivation , the Dark Period , I could easily respond to the pediatrician 's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It 's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we 've come .	1
Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby 's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby .	1
Love this book ! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one . It makes life much easier knowing my child 's meal and nap times . Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day . Excellent for communication for when you do n't have your child . Even when I 'm at work , that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book . Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well . I recommend this to all new moms ! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you ca n't remember anything because you have n't slept much !	1
THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings , diaper changes , naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM . The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day ( starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right ) . It 's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance ( with your hands full , holding a baby ) . Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior .	1
I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old . I was having problems remembering how much she was eating , whether she was sleeping better or not . This helped me keep track of those things and more . I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she 's older . I kept notes about her moods , what she did during the day . It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work .	1
if I did n't suck at documenting . Not sure exactly what made me think that I could keep up with recording every feeding , diapering , and sleep session . I was able to keep up with it for about 3 weeks ... and then it fell by the wayside . I can really see how this would help with finding a schedule but I decided to let baby lead since we have a very flexible lifestyle .	1
Easy to track feeding , playtime , changes , naps etc . Very helpful when nursing and even when you move on to a bottle . I work F/T so it 's great to come home and peruse his day ( feeding schedule , play time ) as a secondary account after talking to nanny . Would highly recommend for those Type-A personas .	1
My husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift as our baby was due in February . This is a great book to have during your first month of having a baby . With the restless nights and the nights blending together , it & # 8217 ; s so easy to forget the last poopy diaper or what side and time you started feeding your little one . I used this book religiously for a month . After that , I just stored it into my newborn box . I will defiantly use it again for my next baby !	1
The layout of the hours are a little tricky but it does the job . The print on each page is a light grey , so trying to journal diapers , bottles , meds in the middle of the night is a challenge . It is detailed in slots to make notes and I would prefer a journal that does not take space for breast-feeding if one chooses formula only . I could use the space to make more notes and comment on something cute that day .	1
This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats , sleeps , poops , gets a bath , etc . It 's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on . I took this to all infant doc appt . And it 's a great gift !	1
Please , please take this to the hospital with you- you 'll thank me later . We did , but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO & # 34 ; out of it & # 34 ; dealing with my c-section , , etc . We had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby 's feedings and diaper output ( so crucial those first few days ) . We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful . Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room , we could n't find which paper scrap we 'd written it on . Frustrating and inaccurate . Once we started using the baby tracker , we could see easily all the info in one page , quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding , etc . I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control . I carry it around the house with baby , and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby 's needs and patterns . Ca n't recommend enough !	1
I find this tracker very useful . I 've been using it for my now 3mo son . I keep it by my chair where I nurse him , so I can stay on top of jotting things down . It has helped figure out his sleeping and eating patterns - great !	1
This has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins . They are four months old now and I have their care givers fill this in when they can . That way I have an idea of the schedule they are developing . I highly recommend this !	1
Inside is nice and clean . Columns for diaper changes , amount feed , comments , etc . The time intervals are :30 minutes seems adequate , though sometimes I wish it was a bit more detailed . Also would have liked a ribbon or movable tab/page to keep track of what page in the log book we are at . All in all , it does what is advertised and keeps us sane on what was done/changed when .	1
While I love the app on my phone ( Baby ESP ) for my husband and I -- it 's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app . Our parents , who frequently watch our baby , have yet to embrace the app world.So , we use this on days when we have help . It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you . ( How many poop diapers , how many pee diapers , how often are you feeding , how often is he sleeping , what 's his schedule like ) . We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we were n't at home .	1
I used this for my little on and it was really nice for me as a new mom to have everything so well organized . There was sufficient space for notes I did n't think , but all in all it was nice to have everything laid out . If you 're organized you could easily make one of these yourself and not spend the money , but when we had our baby I just needed one thing done for me and not have to do it myself and for that it was very helpful .	1
The Daycare workers were offended by the book at first but after explaining its usefulness they realized how handy it is becoming .	1
This is probably one of the greatest inventions . Before my baby was born , I purchased this and figured it 's a nice-to-have item.I did n't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple , but easily organized log book . When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time , you do n't know which way is up or down sometimes . It can be extremely overwhelming , especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours . This book is a life-saver . It literally never left my side for the first 6 months . ( I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done . ) I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind ( pee/poop ) , naps , and how long my baby nursed on each side . I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones . It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer ( which is also a necessity ) , I never really lost track ( or my mind ) . It 's also great for care-takers too , especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you ! One of the most useful items yet .	1
This product is awesome . It was so helpful to keep track of feedings and diaper changes in those early , sleep-deprived days . Would definitely recommend and will likely purchase again for our next baby .	1
Perfect way to keep track of the day for a little one -- this journal allows for detailed tracking of milk intake , diapers , sleep , and activity . Highly recommended as a perfect way to keep track and organize information in one easy to travel with place !	1
This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months . Being a new mom ( and dad ) we were exhausted and I ca n't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed , changed , etc . without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day . It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need . It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent ( or whoever ) . Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again .	1
I did a lot of researching on what baby journal to buy and settled on this one and I did not regret it even for a second . This book is perfect ! You can keep track of anything your baby does , from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh . I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer , like 6 months or even 1 year . I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby 's life .	1
I loved this tracker so much , I bought several more and used for the entire first year . It 's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules . In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count , feeding sides , etc . Once we introduced solid foods , I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance . I just purchased again for new baby 's arrival . I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms .	1
My son 's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it . He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down . This is one of his favorite toys and he does n't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys ( gets bored easy ) .	1
I really like these and so do my kids . They like to roll them around as well as nesting them . The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars . 4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to .	1
Both of my boys ( 1 and 2.5 ) love stacking and building . They also love cars . So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them . They both love these cars ! All of the cars have a little & quot ; surprise & quot ; ( the ladder on the firetruck & quot ; clicks & quot ; as it raises up and down , the siren on the police car spins , etc . ) & amp ; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older . They 're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest , bigger , biggest .	1
These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value . Ours have been scooted across the floor , cat 's tail , into walls , you name it and they 've always come back for more . It 's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it 's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys . I 'd buy them again for sure !	1
My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab . The bright colourful colours really held her attention . When she was sitting we played the & quot ; Mummy stack them , Baby knock them down & quot ; game and & quot ; peek-a-boo & quot ; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars . They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on ( especially the small green one ) when she was teething . At 2 , she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over . She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game ! Great for learning big and small , colours and numbers . Good value !	1
These are a huge hit with my one year old son . We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born . He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day . They are simple , durable , do not require batteries , and are easy to clean . We 've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and do n't take up much space since they nest . The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands .	1
I bought this last month for my 6 month old son , and it continues to fascinate him . It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting . When he does get hold of them , exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too , and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one ! He 'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof . It will be a stacking toy later too ! Great value for money ...	1
We bought these trucks for our 15 mo . old daughter and 4 mo . old son- We love them ! They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower . Perfect first trucks ! And they are n't too big- a perfect size !	1
This is a wonderful toy that is fun , educational , and affordable ! The cars are different colors , and each has a different number , 1 - 4 , to help a child learn counting and colors . They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other . ( The nesting feature is great for storage too ) . Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore ( e.g. , the small car is also a rattle , the large fire truck 's ladder moves , etc . ) The cars are also very sturdy ( as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together , ) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto . At 6 months of age , my son really enjoys looking at the toys , passing them from one hand to the other , banging them together , and , of course , putting them in his mouth . I imagine this toy will remain one of my son 's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor . I would highly recommend this item .	1
I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday . His aunt got him these . What a hit ! My son ca n't quite stack them himself , but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them . They also have the function of just being play cars , which is nice . I am amazed at how long my son will play with these !	1
For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars . They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new . Fun to stack , fun to roll . Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one .	1

I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest . Since I do n't know how to sew , I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site . I could n't believe the prices ! I found this and ordered it for my three kids ( 9 mos , 2 years , and 3 years ) , and they all love it . It 's pricey , but it 's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others . Great book , and I love that all the pieces are attached !	1
This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time , and I like that it 's washable . It has a good number/variety of activities in it , especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies , but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it . My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off ( they require a little extra & # 34 ; elbow grease & # 34 ; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page ) . There are also some & # 34 ; older & # 34 ; activities , like the clock , or tying a shoe.Overall , good purchase .	1
I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories ! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items , such as the shoe laces and snaps . But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice . Overall it 's an item that he can grow into and it 's super cute !	1
my 3 and 4 year old love this book . we take it to church to entertain them and each week they are excited to get it out	1
I really like this book . You can show your baby shapes , teach her how to use buttons , zipper and snaps , tie a shoe and tell time . My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time , but she already loves to play with this book . I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future .	1
I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter hoping it would be a nice activity on a plane trip . It is well constructed and attractive ( though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler ) .The activities are : Page 1 : Shape matching , different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments . The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2 : Clock - the hands move freely , well constructed ( my daughter is n't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers ) Page 3 : Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons ( this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors ) Page 4 : Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5 : Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6 : Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky ! Page 7 : Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8 : 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older .	1
I got this quiet book for my 11 month old - for his 1st birthday coming up . He has n't been able to play with it yet , but I was very happy going through it . I think he will have years of fun with this book . It provides several activities , which will help him practice skills he will be learning . It 's also got bright colors and fun shapes that he is sure to enjoy . Ca n't wait to give it to him ! Thanks .	1
My son loves to chew on things and is still awaiting his first tooth . His older brother had the strawberry vibrating teether but I prefer this one because it does n't look so feminine and it is also less expensive .	1
My son loves this . It took him a few tries to get the hang of it but its real simple for him to use . When he bites it and it vibrates , he starts laughing and the tears disappear .	1
While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies ( my little guy HAS to have it vibrate ) , this was a life saver for me when both my kids ( one 4 years and one 6 months ) were/are teething . And for my youngest , it 's just about the only thing that works .	1
This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it , it would vibrate . It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it ... ! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat !	1
My daughter likes this one . She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion . I believe this is for babies that are a little more older . I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth .	1
my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy . it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort . i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums . great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby .	1
Our teething little five month old girl ca n't really make it vibrate , but the eight month boy grandchild does . He likes it OK .	1
It is a great toy for them to chew and play with , but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on . The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting , but it does not seem to bother my son a bit .	1
Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it , its so much fun.he loves the vibration , the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it !	1
My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in . I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet , she loves putting things in her mouth .	1
The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He 's already figured out how to activate the vibration . It is soft , yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums . I think baby gives it 5 stars ! ! ! There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT . So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us , they do not appear to be replaceable .	1
Great toy for teething ! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums . It did n't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action . She 's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago . No issues with it ! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething .	1
I am so glad we invested in this product ... .at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver ! ! !	1
thought would be a great idea for my almost 1 y/o ... however , she really does n't like it . perhaps if i knew about it/introduced it to her when she was smaller she would be more apt to use it ... she does like the rattle aspect of it and i vibrate her tummy , lol . so it 's not a complete waste	1
A must in addition to all the teething toys . Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite . I . Do n't really know if the vibration massages . His gums , but he does enjoy biting into it a lot !	1
This is a great teether . It is very easy for the little one to stimulate the vibrating action , making it a huge hit !	1
I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile . The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide . It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out , at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other . Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her . But do n't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy .	1
I like this product a lot , but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process ... the product vibrates great , the colors are attractive to her , and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab . However , its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment . Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better . But overall I really like it .	1
The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it . easy to hold on to , can easily hook ( Via rings or carabiner ) to a diaper bag etc . Both my kids loved it while teething .	1
Our son 's occupational therapist recommended this for our aggressive teether . She thought he was using teething as a way to stimulate and calm himself . He liked playing with it more than he liked teething on it .	1
I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between , he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting , he goes straight for this toy.Also , it 's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring ' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes .	1
My son is obsessed with this teether ! ! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it , he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part . I do n't know what I would do without this one , I think it is a must have ! Not only a teether but a toy as well : )	1
It is somewhat difficult for my daughter to get it to vibrate , but when I help she seems to get one relief . Cute toy snd she seems to like it even when it is n't in her mouth .	1
This toy was our go-to when my daughter was teething . It really soothed her and calmed her down . When her two year molars started coming in we got it back out for her and she still loved it . We will definitely be buying another one for our next baby !	1
Both my daughters loved this teether . It made them happier than any other product on the market , including a certain rubber giraffe .	1
This works well to keep a baby busy . It 's just too bad you ca n't change the battery . The battery has n't run out yet though . I did buy this previously for another baby and I do n't recall the battery running out for a long time .	1
Initially , my baby was not able to cause it to vibrate on his own because he just was n't chomping down hard enough . But now , he can do it . Now , he 's able to see the cause and effect of using this . I like that . Plus , I think it feels good on his gums .	1
Bought this based on the reviews . My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old . My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough . This has allot to do with her age . I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration . She LOVES it , I only wish it had an on/off switch so I did n't have to hold it for her . She actually cries when I try to take it away from her .	1
At first my 7 month old could not initiate the vibrating on her own . However after only a day or two she figured it out and seems to enjoy it but still seems to prefer Sophie over anything else . Actually her favorite thing to chew on ( she 's just now getting her first tooth ) is my little coach wallet- I guess she likes the leather or something but she is quite obsessed with it ! This massaging teether does keep her busy in the car seat though .	1
My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth . He also shakes it like a rattle . This product is good quality .	1
At first he was unsure about it , but now he likes to use it . I would say it 's more a fun toy to chew on and not actually providing teething relief	1
I 've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones . The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting .	1
Both of my kids have loved this during the teething stage . The one complaint I have is that they have to really bite down hard to get it to vibrate so I often found myself squeezing it for them as they pulled it to their mouths	1
If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby , it would be this one . The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy . The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold . We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends .	1
Baby loves this teether . Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there . The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate , she still has fun the with handle the spins . Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around .	1
We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one , there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture ( bumps , ridges ) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I do n't know if she favors one for the other . It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands , feet , cheeks etc . We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It 's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner .	1
My son really likes this teether.He likes the bottom as well as the vibrating side.My only issue is that it is a bit large and a bit heavy , and he tends to slam it a lot ( often on my hand or leg ) when I am holding him . Overall , a winner	1
I have two and the batteries have n't died which I find impressive . These are well made . A year later , my son still likes these and likes the green spinner on the end a lot .	1
We bought multiples of these , just so we 'd have them . It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it ! He never took a pacifier , but this toy is the closest thing -- sometimes when he 's screaming , this toy is the only thing that 'll calm him down . So glad we found it . Definitely worth the money .	1
The product is great . I would push down the edges to make it vibrate and hold it against my baby 's gums and he seemed to like it . However , the reason I gave it four stars and not five is because he does n't bite down hard enough to make it vibrate on his own , and so he lost interest in it fairly quickly .	1
This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers , but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves , so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them . This is not a huge deal , and I 'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage , but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby . Having said that , when we do hold it for them , they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so . Also , it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it , they do n't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else . They actually seem like they feel better , so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing .	1
Everyone should buy this ! Such a soothing gift . My granddaughter liked to just explore with it as well , Not necessarily just to sooth gums .	1
Our teething baby absolutely loved loved this product and would seek it out to sooth his sore gums . Its lasted a year now with no issue or wear and tear .	1
My daughter loves to chew on both ends of this teething aid . She also likes it because it has some weight to it and she can really throw it pretty far ! I would recommend this teething aid if you 're looking for a vibrating teether .	1
A favorite in our house !	1
I bought this for my 2.5 year old with special needs , on the recommendation of her occupational therapist . It sooths her like nothing else . We put it in her mouth and she immediately relaxes and even falls asleep with it . Unfortunately , from all that use , they do n't even last a week in our house . I 'm still buying more .	1
My daughter is 6 mo and loves these . No funky smell , bpa free . Just dont kneel in them ! The star has rounded edges . So far so good .	1
This is a great toy for teething babies ! The colors catch their attention while the different shapes keep their hands and mouths amused . The size is just right for them to actually hold on to it too . I 'd recommend it to any parent of a very young child- especially for the price !	1
My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time . It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well .	1
my daughter likes this a lot . its more like a teething ring than a necklace , though . i read some complaints about the star -- the edges of the star are rounded but if choped at a bad angle , I think it could still be an issue , but i watch my daughter with it .	1
I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing ' , I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love . It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so . So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you . It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she 's 18 months now . She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry . Hands free is the way to be ! The sling I was given was a bit large for me , and I 'm not a tiny person 5'3 '' 135lbs . Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I 'll try a sling that comes in sizes .	1
I got this carrier before my son was born . I was a nanny and have tried many carriers with babies of various sizes . This is the most comfortable and versatile carrier I 've tried yet.The downsides are that it is a little challenging to use . I have had to learn quite a few different ways to carry my son , who is just 3 months old . If you do n't adjust the carries you use as your baby grows , it can be very uncomfortable for both you . It is also very bulky . It does n't even fit in an empty diaper bag . My next carrier will be unpadded .	1
My son loves this . He likes the & quot ; kangaroo & quot ; position best . He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way , and stopped immediately . DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video , though . At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags ( returns ? ) without the book and video . They are a must . The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone are n't good for their developing bones . Slings keep the baby in more natural positions .	1
I love these sheets because they are a thick and durable material . They fit on a standard pack-n-play too which is nice . Definitely worth the price .	1
fitted co-sleeper sheet , exactly like the one that came with the original bed . no shrinking in wash. shipped fast . will again in other colors .	1
I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper . There really are n't a ton of places you can buy these , so I was n't too concerned about the price . All told , Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price , including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit , I was perplexed by the 'button ' holes on the under side of each corner . Ca n't imagine what those are for . That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall , quality product .	1
The color is a close match . It is a good quality sheet . I would recommend to anyone who purchased the co-sleeper so you can change the sheet after spit ups	1
My daughter loves this but like others have said it does n't fit on the Graco Quattro Travel System . I have gotten it to work but sometimes it gets in the way of latching the snack tray on the front . I still love it and so does my daughter .	1
it 's bright and colorful , and is great for babies who are starting to reach for things . i do n't think it was worth $ 15 though . it 's not the most durable stroller toy i 've seen , but it 's cute .	1
I was a little nervous because so many people wrote that this adorable product did not fit Graco strollers well . I am thrilled to report , however , that it fits the Graco Metrolite stroller perfectly and looks adorable ! Wonderful product !	1
my daughter loves this for the past four months ( she is 9 months now ) . Still will play with it . only reason i did n't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily .	1
you could n't ask for a better diaper pail . one reason is , that you do n't have to use certain bags inside the pail ... can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over , you do n't smell the dirty diapers . great product !	1
This is a fantastic product . It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers , and yet there is little to no smell . You know when it 's full because the plunger wo n't go down all the way , and you ca n't return the handle to the other position . When you take the garbage bag out , you can tell just how much smell you 'd be in for with any other container . I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this , instead of having to buy special ones . A good buy .	1
I originally had another pail and it broke after about 9 months of use , so I got this one . I love it ! It is very easy to use and keeps the diapers away from little hands . It has a large capacity and cuts back on frequent trips to the trash can . I keep a stick on air freshner in the bottom and it helps with lingering smells . Also no expensive refills to buy ! Great pail .	1
Turned out to be a total stink bomb . Read my new review . It absolutely reeks after 16 months . Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK . It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket ( porous ) to keep the stink in . Not a good design . [ for laughs , I will leave the old review here ] We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers . We did n't end up cloth diapering after all , but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ : *1 ) Cost- no specialized ( expensive ) bags . This takes any mid-sized household trash bag . *2 ) Effectively controls odors . We 've put some really eye-watering , throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell does n't sneak out- even over time . However , sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag . That smell can bowl you over . *3 ) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with . Many of the `` grown-ups '' in my world ca n't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them . I 'm thrilled they ca n't figure out how to open the DC . As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened , I 'm happy they ca n't figure it out . I think this lid will confound any toddler , but it 's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own `` payload . '' I 'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot .	1
Before my first child was born , I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ . She said that it did a good job and I did n't have to buy any special bags . So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags . My son is now 4 months old , and so far it is working great . It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all . I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells , and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors . So far this has been a great product . The lid is definately tight , but it does not bother me much . Hopefully , it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly ! But so far so good ! !	1
I love the Diaper Champ ! I have no problems with odor at all . And you do n't have to buy or use special , expensive bags ! Any trash bag will work and it 's great . I like the odor shield bags and they work like a charm . Easy to use one handed ! ! Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed .	1
I love this product ... My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter , and she has a diaper genie . She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges . So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive , in the long run , the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive . Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper . With the Diaper Genie , you have to twist the darn thing and it 's hard to operate . My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house ... she ends up cutting the bags . When she 's at my house , she ca n't go wrong , just flip the handle ! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner ! ! ! !	1
Diaper Champ is great . But just to let you know that I 've been breastfeeding and the poop does n't stink as much as formula poop . So I ca n't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !	1
I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I can not talk enough about it . I just live it ! ! ! It is odorless ( so far ) and very easy to use - and only with one hand , so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby . It 's very easy to change the bags , which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy ! ! ! ! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag , to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ , you will not regret it ! ! !	1
It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags , more cost effective . It is easier to use . There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old , well `` hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers '' . Makes sense . . but still use it for wet diapers . Hopefully potty training will happen soon ! : ) The only down-side , is that babysitters are so `` diaper genieized '' they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way . But the good side is , it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable . I highly recommend it to anyone !	1
I like the Diaper Champ . My little boy 's room does n't stink from dirty diapers . I empty it once a week , when it is time for trash pick-up . I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags . I do wipe it down a couple of times a month . I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside . I highly recommend this product . It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers .	1
I 've had this diaper pail for 3 years now , and it 's been through 2 kids ( both in diapers for 18 months of that ! ) . I love this diaper pail ! My favorite feature is that it does n't require special refills -- it can use any trash bag ( we just use a tall kitchen trash bag ) . My 3 1/2 year old still has n't figured out how to open it , but it 's easy enough for me to open quickly . The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail . Even then , these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail , this one receives 5 stars from me !	1
In registering and purchasing products for my baby , I did a lot of research . This included reading reviews , asking friends ( lots ) about products that did and did n't work for them , and actually trying to use some of the products . I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption . In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it . I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires . The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags . I have NEVER experienced an odor problem . If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following : -Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags ! ! ! I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing ! ! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes . On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors . Toddlers eat solids , their poop smell very adult like ! We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets , the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly .	1
Works great ! NO smells and holds lot of diapers . Uses standard kitchen bags ! What a great product !	1
So far we love our Diaper Champ . We have been using it for 3 months and have had no problem with smells . We liked the fact that you could use regular trash bags instead of special refills .	1
We 've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it ( except when we open it to change the bag ) . We use plastic trash bags from Target , we pay I think $ 4 for 100 bags . It 's a deal and works great . I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one .	1
i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged . so i decided on this one and glad i did . it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out . and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills . just use the bags you have in your kitchen ! easy to replace when full and it just works ! ! !	1
I love these pails so much that we have two of them doing diaper duty ! ! It 's odorless , effortless , and holds many diapers ! I also like the fact that you do not have to buy special bags for it and can use ordinary trash bags . A great invention ! !	1
I bought this pail before my son was born . First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail , but it was broken , and the store was out of stock when we returned it . I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use . My husband did n't even want a diaper pail because he did n't expect them to hold in any odors at all . Now that we have this one , he loves it . It 's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper . No twisting till your wrist breaks . At first we were using scented trashbags , but I 've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well . I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags . My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers . The only problem we 've had is that if you do n't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail . All in all it 's been a great buy .	1
I have three children . For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky . I would not recommend buying that one . My second child I did n't get any . Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out . I have to say that I am very happy with it so far . I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it . I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements . It 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers . I have n't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market .	1
I love the Diaper Champ ... you do n't have the need for expensive refills and there is very little odor . The main odor is revealed when it is time to change the bag . You almost want to change the bag outside ! I find that if I keep a small air freshener in the bottom , it does help ... ( like one for a car ) . So easy to use , definitely recommend ! ! !	1
This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size . I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target . No complaints at all ! Very easy to use and seriously , you do not smell any poopy diapers !	1
We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we do n't have to buy special bags . I love that you can use trash bags . I have n't had a problem with the bag not being full enough . For one , when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full , but is also very heavy so you would n't want anymore diapers in there anyway . The only problem I 've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit . Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though . So overall I love the Diaper Champ !	1
I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1 ) You do not have to buy bag refills . You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending . The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2 ) Traps in stinky diaper odor . We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3 ) Easy to use . You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle , the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag .	1
My husband and I decided to get this one over the Diaper Genie because like most people , we did n't like the idea of having to buy special bags . We went to Costco and bought a big thing of garbage bags to use that seems to be lasting us FOREVER . Our daugher is now 4 months old , and we never had a problem with this . No odor or anything . Extremely easy to use , no assembly required .	1
At only 3 weeks old , my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day . We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it 's been great so far . ( We 'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky ! ) It 's so easy to use and you do n't have to buy the special bags . We 've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us . One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag . Overall , I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat !	1
We 've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now , and have had NO problems whatsoever ! The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus ! We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week , and we 've have had no problems with smell . I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag , but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water , and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out . So , I called Baby Trend ( Diaper Champ manufacturer ) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings ( which I did n't even ask for ) for FREE ! The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out , usually after about 6 months . Overall , I am very pleased with our purchase .	1
My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did ... dirty diapes and soaked diapers ... ..I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag . No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty ... even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! I use the scented bags and even if I do n't no smell ! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space .	1
We did n't want to spend a fortune on a diaper pail and refills , so we opted for the Diaper Champ . We absolutely love it . We have used it for three months now and have had no problems with smells of any kind . Best of all , you can use any kind of bag , including reused plastic grocery bags !	1
I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl . I heard great things about all of them , but wanted what would be most cost effective for us . When we decided on the diaper champ , we won ! 1 . No refills to every buy . you can use a standard trash bag and you do n't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2 . I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full . However , there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3 . No stinky smells in my home . Even though my daughter is only 2 months old , she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt ! But , there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4 . I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh . Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week , it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict : Get the champ ... .it will save you tons in the long run ! ! !	1
This is one of the things I ca n't live without . There are no bad smells until you open it . Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers ! Plus it can also be used as a trash can !	1
you can use any ol ' bag with this . go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags . they fit it perfectly . you put the diaper in the hold in the top , turn the handle , and pop . byebye poopy diaper ! it can hold quite a few . we only need to change the bag once a week . it really does hide the smell . the diaper champ is the best !	1
I absolutely love this diaper champ . I was first drawn to it because no special bags were needed . It is so easy to use - one handed diaper disposable with the quick flip handle and so easy to empty . This item is a MUST HAVE ! ! !	1
The diaper champ is such a great product . I keep it in my baby 's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors . I love that I can use regular trash bags with it . I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks ( since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs ) . But , even going that long , it does not smell . I would never use one that required refills , what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly ? !	1
I have used this for 11 months and I love it . What we did was after the baby started having odor in his # 2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree ( 100 for $ 1 ) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags . So easy ! Never an odor problem . And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it , so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead . I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it !	1
I love my Diaper Champ . My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it . It 's simple to use and is cost efficient . The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want . As far as some people saying it smells , I have n't had a problem . Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away . I highly recommed this product if you want a clean , simple , and convenient diaper pail !	1
the diaper champ does it 's job : it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink . of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time ( which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores ! ) , but i never had any issues with smell , unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway . what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others , is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it , meaning grocery bags , trash bags ... nothing fancy . as a new mom ( or new parent ) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on ; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags . no complaints from me on this diaper pail .	1
I love this product . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers , and it does n't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers . It lasts me about 2 days ... . 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor , other than when you open it , but that is inevitable.Infact , the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their & quot ; mother 's room & quot ; . That seems to say alot ! And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run ... no special bags to buy ... what a pain that seems to me . I use plain old garbage bags ... or even very large shopping bags.Great product .	1
ALL DIAPERS SMELL , no matter what you put them in , especially once your kid starts solid foods . Get over it . This pail is fantastic . We use it for our dogs ' poop bags , and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags ( we use vanilla , they also have lavender , and they are cheap ) . There is no smell , except in the summer when it is hot ( and that 's only because the pail is outside on the back porch , the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning ) .	1
I agree it 's better than the genie . I own the genie and served us well . But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store , I was so impressed . It 's very easy to use , and it seals out the odor as well . I wanted to get this for our use , but my genie is still in good use . Too bad , the champ came late , or we should have gotten this instead .	1
love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store . way cheaper than others . have to change regulary ( 2 times per week ) when the baby gets on solids though .	1
I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius ' diaper champ did not smell at all ! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later ! Sounds gross I know but that 's how awesome it really is ! AND it 's super easy to use and you do n't have to buy bag refills . Need I say more ?	1
The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal . We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted ( 2 sets of refills every month ) . The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags ( we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies ) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate ! Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle ! The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that 's it ! Drop and flip ! No twisting , shoving or cutting like the Genie . And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it ca n't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it 's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well ( unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans ) ! Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no `` blades '' involved . I just did n't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery . The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening ! This is not a worry when it comes to the champ . Just simple , clean , odor resistant , in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe ! I 'd recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it , you wo n't be sorry !	1
What I liked : Contained the smell . Ease of use . Takes regular garbage bags ( saves money ! ) . Great capacity ( empty it out once in 7 days or so ) . Sturdy . Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I did n't like : Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position ( could just be a problem with mine ) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it . ( I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend 's place - did n't like it ) .	1
This is a wonderful product . One suggestion to the manufacturer -- the blue piece that holds the bag in place -- perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out . Right now , it 's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it .	1
We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital . When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ . We LOVE it ! ! ! The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell . . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce . He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it . In addition , it 's very easy to use . Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag . Could n't be simpler . We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ .	1
This is a great pail . It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag . We buy the generic tall kitchen bags . We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days ! Additionally , it really has a one-handed operation .	1
It holds odors pretty well . Its great to be able to use any kind of trash bag you want with it . I do admit , older children 's diapers are a bit too stinky in the diaper champ , but I never said this product was a miracle worker . I 'm really happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends and family .	1
We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers . It holds a lot of diapers so it does n't need to be changed every day . Highly recommend this .	1
Diaper Champ works great ! You can use your regular garbarge bags with it . No need to buy re-fills .	1
Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags ( others are not ! ! ! ) - wo n't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use .	1
I love this diaper pail ... you can use any trash bags ... I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch ! It 's so easy to use . I did n't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months . Once she started eating more `` real '' foods , her diapers became much smellier . She 's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ . We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers , but I think it 's a great product !	1
I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie . The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers ( I used three : Diaper Genie , Easy Saver Diaper Pail , and the Diaper Champ ) . I did n't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore , it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail , and it 's really easy to use - drop a diaper in , flip the handle over , done ! I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing . I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it , and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future .	1
It is so easy to use . You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag . I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it .	1
I love this diaper pail . Yea , if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and do n't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows , or if you have older children watch out . The handle system fascinates little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in , flip it and it disappears , which is good when it 's a diaper , bad when it 's , , , your keys .	1
Easy to use , easy to clean , cheaper to use , not bad-looking either . Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail . The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it . But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open !	1
Let 's face it . This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces . One can not expect that it will be odor free . Mine certainly is n't . It is my fault , though . If I emptied the bag more often , there would not be a stench . But alas , I am lazy . So when I do change the bag , I also spray some lysol . Works for me . I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product , I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing . But that was my own fault . I did not have it on the floor . When opening the lid , step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this . What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags . Thanks , but no.All in all , I really like my Diaper Champ . It 's also taller than the genie which is good for me , I do n't have to bend over so much to flip the lid .	1
This is a fine product and I am happy with it . I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now , I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad . My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag . My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to does n't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning .	1
Stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags . What a waste of money ! Even the `` new and improved '' Diaper Genie ca n't compare to the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills . I ca n't imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail , when a simple trash bag is all you need.As for the `` smell '' issue . Let 's face it - diapers stink . And regardless of brand , ANY DIAPER PAIL WILL NEED TO BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS . I really think some people do n't realize this . When I first had my son , I bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom 's house . When my mom used to change him , she 'd dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ , but did n't change the pail . After about a week she complained because it started to stink . I had to explain to her that it was n't a `` magic pail '' , it was still just a covered trash bin . ( honestly , how did she raise 2 kids ? ... ) Now , mom 's back on track and loving her Diaper Champ.As far as the odor issue goes , I have seen no difference in odor control between the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel , but neither are odor proof .	1
OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in , but he does n't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all . ( I know that 's mostly because he 's responsibile for those diapers now , but it 's still a great product ! ) We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere , not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband 's friends ' wives gets pregnant , my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ , AND THEY ALL LOVE IT ! We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie . Also , they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie , the stench is unbearable . There is n't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ , because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper . Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition , and whatever is going on in there , you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week ( it gets full that often , anyway ) .It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL . Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues , too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time , hassle , and money.I do have one friend who `` retired '' hers to the back porch because of odor . Her daughter was nearly two years old by then , and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant 's diapers .	1
I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby 's R Us . It 's fabulous ! We 've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it ! We save $ $ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great . We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can ( because they do n't smell ) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL ! ! A few times I 'd forget to change it ( I change it , my husband takes it out to the trash ) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days , it does begin to smell , but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days . So I just change it once a week and it 's the best , no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS ! ! : -D I 'd recommend this to anyone !	1
This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry . I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money . Then again , it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table . One , its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom . Two , no mess . Three , its very easy to use ( all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper ) . Well , my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED : 1/9/06At first I said it was great . But now I 'm saying it stinks . It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself . Such a hastle right ? I think so , so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP . It 's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS ! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room . I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full , you will throw the trash away . Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars .	1
To put it simply , this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags ( tip -- can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom ) -easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky	1
I wanted this product because i did n't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended . The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment . The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight . I ca n't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it . That would be my only complaint .	1
This diaper pail is excellent . No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months . I am very pleased with it . I do have one word of caution : Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder . They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside . Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out . I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower ( no receipt ) and the repair would take six weeks ( how I 'll never know why ) . Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less . Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly .	1
My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it does n't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag . The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers ( I have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are . I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop does n't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that 's many many months down the road .	1
My son is almost two , and let me tell you , little babies just do n't produce the smells like the older ones . Probably any diaper pail will do until your child is about six months old , and then none will work that great . Yes , you do have to air them out once in a while , and clean them frequently ( yay for Lysol ) , but the plastic does absorb odors no matter what . Our Diaper Champ has reached its limit , and we are going to buy another one.Why another Champ , when it still lets out smells ? All diaper pails smell ! ! Every mother of a two-year-old that I know is going to drastic lengths to air out their pail , no matter what brand they bought . No one will be reusing theirs for a second child.So I 'm getting another Champ because I like these things : - I can use it with one hand and can keep the other hand on my baby- I do n't have to buy special refils ( I do use odor-fighting garbage bags that really help ) - I do n't have to explain how to use it to babysitters.That 's it . Hope that helps .	1
I love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it does n't cost an arm and a leg for refills . The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared .	1
This is another great baby purchase . When I brought it home , my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a `` gadgety '' baby thing that we did n't need . He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked ! First , it really keeps the odor in . I 'm pretty sensitive to smells , but this one does a good job of containing odors . Just to play it safe though , I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so ( you could probaby go longer ) , and I spray it with Lysol as well . Keeping with that practice , I have n't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly , its economical -- its not expensive to buy , and its not expensive to maintain . Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain -- -I definitely recommend this product !	1
This diaper pail is great and even better that you do n't have to worry about running out of bags . You can use just regular trash bags which is awesome . I have three complaints , the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste . The second is that it does n't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells . The last is that it 's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it does n't fall over but it can be done . That 's the only time it smells though . My baby is breast fed so the smell is n't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean . These minor details would n't make me change my mind . I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings , and it does keep the smell out which is what it 's supposed to do .	1
We are 1st time parents & amp ; I read all the reviews on diaper-disposal products . Now our baby is 1 month old & amp ; I 've never smelled a poopy diaper ( and we formula feed ) in our nursery which is in our master bedroom . We are both clean-addicts & amp ; love this product . ( NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED ! ! ! ) We empty it twice per week & amp ; have NO ODOR problems ! Update at 7mos ( July04 ) : We managed to get BabiesRUs to let us exchange the DiaperChamp for a DiaperGenie and we were equally dissapointed with it too . DiaperChamp was great until about 3 mos . & amp ; then just smelled all the time . Diaper Genie was no better - even with toddler-strength refills . I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway ( both Diaper keepers required emptying every day & amp ; would still smell ) . I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily & amp ; those things are just a waste of time , effort and money . Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $ 30-some bucks for the canister . Dissapointing - wish it worked !	1
Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well , so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it . It works easily with one hand , which is important . Also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock . While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets .	1
Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie , but invest my money in the Champ . What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags , nothing proprietary . As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier , we do have some odor problems , but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible . If we changed it every couple of days , there would probably not be an issue . When we smell something , we change the bag ; problem solved . My only *real* problem with it is that , now that my son is walking , he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear . I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I do n't catch it !	1
My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad . She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ . Boy am I glad ! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle ! ! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS ! ! ! I do n't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing ... it 's sealed up like Ft. Knox . You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it . The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag , thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail . I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS ! ! I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ , will eat out of every other garbage can in the house , but ignores the champ . a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger , but totally worth the money ! ! ! also , a bit of a pain to clean ... either outside with the hose or in the tub . No refills and odor free..ca n't beat that ! !	1
This one is the best and a must have ! Do n't waste your time or money on the other ones . The Diaper Genie is way too complicated . It 's a trash can so it should be simple . I should n't have to read directions on how to use it ! This one is great because it is so easy to use , I never smell any odor , and it uses normal trash bags ! Why spend money on special trash bags ? I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $ 2.00 . They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes .	1
My girlfriend recommended the diaper champ over the diaper genie so I put it on my registry . It certainly seems to contain the odors . It 's great that it uses regular garbage bags - no expensive refill bags to purchase . The only small problem I 've noticed is that it stops working before the pail is full because it stacks the diapers through a narrow hole . Also , when it 's time to change the bag , wear a nose plug .	1
Diaper Champ works well for me . It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags . I use tall kitchen trash bags . I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it 's nothing that I can not handle . I just use that as a sign to empty it , spray with Lysol and replace the bag .	1
Love this product - no smell - easy to change the bags - I do n't have any complaints .	1
This is a good product . It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers , wipes , etc . and does not require any special bags . Unlike other reviewers , I have not had any problems with it getting stuck . It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it , but I ca n't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor ! ! If you change the bag regularly , you should not have any problem with odor .	1
We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners . The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated , but at a certain level of the room ( usually nose-height when you 're sitting on the floor ) you can still smell poo . It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole . Overall , we are very satisfied .	1
I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one . I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives . Now , owning one myself , I agree . I do n't have any problems with oders ( uless I 'm changing out the bag ) and I do n't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags . You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up ! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags ... .I have two very small complaints which is why I did n't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars . First , I think that it could have been made a little larger so you would n't have to change the bags as often . Second , you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags . The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you wo n't be really happy . It probably happens to everyone at least once . Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there .	1
I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced . We 've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us . No smells , change it out once a week , easy to clean . Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part , so I pulled the rest of the foam out . Big mistake ! ! ! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we 're looking for a replacement . Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces . I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out .	1
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags . It works great . I ca n't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ) . I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs . It 's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan . The reviews were definitely right .	1
If you really want to save money , but still get a quality product , buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me , and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor . When it came down to it , I could n't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills . Every time you have to buy refills , it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail . Let 's face it , babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should ! ! ! I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags , but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it ! If I had it to do over again , I would still buy the Diaper Champ ! I think it is great !	1
This is a great product ! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and do n't have to buy special ones . You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand ! I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while ' if the bag is very full , I may notice a slight smell . But it is truly worth buying ! I love mine !	1
Works well as diaper pail , but it 's awesome as a bathroom garbage can . No mess , no smell . Very easy to replace garbage bags , you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift , and was very skeptical about it at first . ( It 's only 100ft to the garbage shoot outside the apartment ) . That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up . Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day .	1
I initially planned to get a Diaper Genie . I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags . I 'm glad I did n't buy it . We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom . I do n't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag ... .which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers . We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor , which helps . I do n't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids , so I give the Champ 4 stars . I 'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can . I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends .	1
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills . Not only can they be a pain to install , but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of ? I mean , with babies it 's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula . I could n't picture myself yelling to hubby , `` Honey , I know you have sixty other things to get ... can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail ? `` The Champ works great . We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags . We 've never experienced odor from the pail . It was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion . I also love that you can flip the device with one hand ... Highly recommended ! ! ! Makes life easier and keeps baby 's room smelling like baby , not dirty diapers !	1
We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it . We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail ( the other popular pail ... one that uses its own brand of bags ) for free -- and we are VERY glad we did.Here 's what we love about this pail ... *holds a LOT of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! ! ( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! ! *holds the odor in nicely ! ( every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol ) *easy one-hand use*impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pailEvery now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag . Spraying down the inside of the container ( and letting it air out ) periodically definitely helps . We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers .	1
The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home ! ! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs . I originally chose this one , because it does n't use costly refills . The lid is quite heavy , so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags , but that 's the only concern I 've had with it . When you do open it to change the bags , you may want to do so outside . You 'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in .	1
Yes , it does develop a smell after a while . However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem : SmellAnswer : Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags , and it does keep the smell out . After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing , when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it . Empty the champ at least twice a week , if not more . We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we do n't empty it out on a regular basis.If you do n't want to spend the money on the diaper champ , try a regular diaper pail with a lid . You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out ( plus regulare maintance ) , and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper : Safety 1st Diaper Pail : 8 gallons it 's a bit small $ 9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail : 13 gallons bags @ Target $ 16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail : 8 gallons $ 14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I ca n't honestly review them . These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative . I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars . It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor , no expensive refills . Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use . The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle . It is enough of a detterent . You get the hang of it .	1
I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing , mostly because of the odors ( anyone with me on this one ? ) As much as the odors wo n't go away during changing time , they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ . Put it in the top hole , roll the top with the handle , in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor ! As if this were not already great , there 's a big plus to this product , when you compare it to its biggest competitor , the Diaper Genie by Playtex . Although this one costs $ 5 the first time around , it wo n't require special bags as the Genie does , which cost $ 15 per set ... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco , BJs , Sam 's or your local supermarket , so rejoice ! ( for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in ) ; and do n't spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task : make sure you get your Diaper Champ !	1
I LOOOVE this diaper pail ! Its the easiest to use ! after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use . I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it ! No more refills , it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage ! And it holds alot more ! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie . This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills ! I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them ! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed . Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle , its sooo easy ! And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top . It is a little bigger than the other pails , but it holds alot more ! I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail ! ! ! ! !	1
My son is four months and this product is perfect . No smells at all ! Holds a decent amount of diapers , my husband empties it once a week . No down side , all pluses here ! Especially no special bags to buy . And when your child is out of diapers , you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in .	1
I like the fact that you do n't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product , but can use any garbage bag . I have to say , though , that after my daughter started solids , the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently .	1
You can not imagine how much money you 'll save and it does n't smell AT ALL ! ! ! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag . IT 'S WONDERFULL ! ! !	1
I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it . I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they 're nuts ! ( no offense ) My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant . His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week , every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week . I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby 's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me . They 've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned ... if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do , and you get poop on the pail , it does need to be wiped off . A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe , every week or two does n't hurt either .	1
I LOVE this product . My sister ( mother of 2 ) recommended this to me and I am so grateful . It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better ! This is a must have for any new parent !	1
It holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you do n't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work . At first I had a problem with some smell , then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty . I second that you just need to fold up the diaper ( with wipes inside ) neatly , but that is not a big deal . The latch is n't terribly difficult , and I would n't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son 's room .	1
This is one of the items that I absolutely love , something I 'd rather not live without . The only time I 've ever noticed a smell is when you leave the poopy diapers in the pail too long.Love it !	1
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ! MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED . WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT . WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS . IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY .	1
We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed . I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells . We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect ( it does n't in the kitchen anyway ) . The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective . Would definitely recommend	1
THis is the only one I have ever used , and i have to say I LIKE IT ! It is easy to use , i just put in a white trash bag and dumped the diaper down the shute . It holds a ton of daipers , and the smell is not bad at all . I did notice now that my daughter is 15 months her poop is stonger and i dont put those in there , due to the smell . But diapers with pee only do not smell at all . The only bad thing is you need to ensure you dont get # 2 on the shute or if you do it will stick there . It is really easy to use , and does n't take up a lot of space .	1
The Diaper Champ is a life saver . We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of . We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything . Once it 's sealed shut , no stench whatsoever . No complaints about the Diaper Champ , especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there .	1
The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together ! The design is simple , yet brilliant , and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed . Our baby 's room never smells ! We did n't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous . We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags , but if you 're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ ( although you 'd need to change the bag everyday ... BUY IT !	1
I love this product . You can use any regular trash bag . So far we have noticed NO odors . It is easy to use . It fills up somewhat quickly , but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ . The price is very affordable as well .	1
We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do . We hated that thing ! The `` new '' design still needs lots of improvement ! The bags never fit right and then it never spun right . And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes . We decided we had to have something so we started researching . The Diaper Champ is the best we found ! There are no specail bags to deal with or buy ! We use the cheap $ 1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around . There is also no trick to it . No spinning it or anyhting ! Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone ! Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !	1
I 've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one . It is easy to change the bag , uses any trash bag , and does a decent job of containing odor . I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands . I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning . Let 's face it ... .no diaper pail is perfect , but this one is the best that I 've used .	1
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it ! I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie . It was such a pain to use . We all hated it . The diaper champ could n't be easier to use . And the biggest plus is that you do n't have to buy any expensive refills . It takes regular trash bags . I generally put kitchen size bags in it , but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch . And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !	1
This is a great diaper pail . There is no odor and it is very easy to use . ( You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) Also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the Diaper Genie ) . And it 's the largest diaper pail I 've seen without taking up more floor space .	1
This is a great pail except for the heavy lid . Be careful when changing the bag so it does n't come down on your hand . The seal did come out , but it does not affect the odor . This really does keep the smell in.With having twins , we change the bag every couple of days . I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail ! ! !	1
At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins . We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work . A garbage can would do just as well . We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house . We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home . We are SO HAPPY we did . They are so easy to use . You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over . At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy . Ive had no problems of getting them stuck . With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great ! ! ! There really is no oder with the diaper champ . We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time : ) , but even when their is a `` dirty '' diaper there is no smell in the room . Sometimes if we have a very `` messy diaper '' we just take it directly to the garage . All around we have had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama . We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs . We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs ! All around its a great product . It really is hands free , which means less mess , and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with !	1
We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie ... .and we definitely prefer our Champ ! Not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $ 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity . Only problem ... it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full . The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .	1
This is the most convenient on the market considering you do n't need specific refills ! ! ! I strongly recommend it .	1
Let me just say this ... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all . This one is really great . I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did . I just knew all along what products I would not use , but was undecided on the actual one I wanted . Well the Champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! ! We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month . The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $ 6.00 and they work great . We just recently had to buy another roll of bags . SO $ 6.00 for a year of bags- ca n't beat that ! ! We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems . Would reccommend to anyone and everyone ! !	1
We just could n't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills . This pail is great . I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail , to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom . It is not difficult to open , and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things , which will be soon ( she 's 8 months old ) . We change the bag a couple of times a week , and the nursery smells fine .	1
I love the Diaper Champ ! Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved . After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ , I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did . It is easy to use , keeps odors contained , and uses regular trash bags ( much cheaper than diaper pail refills ) .It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I was n't sure how the latch worked . Also , be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down .	1
I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie , since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills . Definitely reduces the odor ( just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag ! ! ! ) and is easy to clean . Love it ! ! !	1
The champ is great because you do n't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie . This one uses regular bags ( I use 32 gallon bags ) . I did have some problems with the odor , but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that 's inevitable ! Here 's some tricks for this Champ:1 . Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders . And the obvious , change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell ... do n't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses ! 2 . The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together , otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3 . If you 're like me , you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around . Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers . Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps !	1
My husband and I love this product . Several friends of ours recommended it , and I 'm so happy that we purchased it . It 's large enough to hold many diapers , and it really does keep our nursery odor-free . I really like that we do n't need to purchase expensive bags to use with it . We just use regular kitchen garbage bags . My sister had the Diaper Genie , which is tough to use and too small . This product is much better .	1
This diaper pail is a wonderful investment . While other diaper pails require the use of thier own bags this pail uses any bag ... including old shopping bags . This save alot of money . When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps . I highly recommend the Diaper Champ .	1
We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because ... who wants to buy special bags ? ? It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag . We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down , and I was worried that it would smell . Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it 's time to change the bag . And sure enough , the lid would start `` sticking '' right about that time , which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it ( instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in ) . Since we are new parents , we 'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in , but it 's SO easy to clean . Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table , and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere . Piece of cake .	1
Love it , love it , love it ! I love that you can use regular plastic bags and do n't need to buy refills for it . Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there . Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes . My daughter is starting potty training and I 'm still using it . Great buy !	1
The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler ( or your foot ) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper . ( Now that my baby is older and stinkier , I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it , but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag , or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom , or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there . ) And practically speaking , stratch another item off that long baby shopping list -- with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink .	1
I thought the idea of keeping dirty diapers in the house was just gross , so I decided to make 20 trips a day to the trash . Boy , was I misguided in my thinking , because this diaper champ is a Godsend ! You really do not smell a thing ! I heard the diaper genie was a huge mess , so I did not even attempt to buy it . Get this and limit those trips out to the trash !	1
This product is wonderful ! It is very easy to use , refill , and move around . My only complaint is that it could be a little bigger to hold a bit more . It keeps the smell OUT completely ! The fact that I can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus to a mommy with a small budget ! I highly recommend this product !	1
I love this product ! With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones . Plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great . No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !	1
I registered for this diaper pail as opposed to a Diaper Genie because I did n't want to have to purchase refills . So far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all . It contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside . I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it . I do n't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far I have no complaints and I 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .	1
I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research . This is the best for your money ! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails , it also works the best . The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag . I really love how you do n't have to buy bags for it , and that it takes perfectly good trash bags . That will save you a bundle of money alone ! It works really great for us and we would n't use anything else . I wish it would hold more diapers but I really ca n't complain . Do n't buy anything else !	1
I have never bought any other diaper pail , so I am not sure how it stacks up , but the Diaper Champ has proven to be a good product ! I use odor-reducing trash bags & the smell is very minimal . One little downfall is that it seems to fill up fast ( by 3 days ! ) which makes it hard to turn the cover . It 's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby 's changing table . Overall , I am happy with this product & do recommend it .	1
This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms ! ! ! ! The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags ... ANY Garbage bags will fit . The Diaper Genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you do n't have to spend ... This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers ... .FANTASTIC !	1
We 've used this Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and it 's worked great . No problems or odors at all . The best part is you use regular kitchen trash bags , no expensive specialty bags to buy .	1
The Diaper Champ is excellent . I have experienced no issues with odor , in fact I keep this in my baby 's closet . No special bags are needed ... what a savings ! Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy ! Great value for an excellent product .	1
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact : NO REFILLS NEEDED ! You use any type of bag you want , and I love this idea . The refills for all the others are so spendy and they do n't hold that many diapers . I 'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home . It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can ! It 's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well . I think it 's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money .	1
Unlike the Diaper Genie , the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers . We have two of them since we mostly use cloth , but occasionally need to use a disposable . It 's great , and very easy to use , but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers . It 's so easy to use , my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun . She 's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail .	1
We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [ I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time ( not just wasting the money on the refills , but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with ) ] .Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate ! When my daughter turned one , she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed ! We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly . [ We 've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we 're now using them with daughter # 2 , replacing them once a week ] . We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp , and we 're still using the one that we purchased in 2001 ! It 's virtually indestructible , easy to wash and operate , does n't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it , and it DOES NOT SMELL ! I would highly recommend this product to anyone .	1
I chose to register for the Diaper Champ for convenience . You can use a plain ole garbage bag instead of purchasing something separate . What busy mom has time to run out to get special bags ? In 5 months I 've had one instance of a terrible smell and it was just a really bad diaper - we all know those . : ) It 's very easy to clean and so easy to use .	1
We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we did n't want to buy special bags . We have now used it for a year and it has been great ! We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we do n't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that . We change the bag almost daily , as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier . When it gets hard to turn , it is time to change the bag ! The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up , we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone .	1
I like the Diaper Champ because it does n't use specific bags . I do n't like how easily it gets backed up though . I have to frequently push down the center to get it to rotate , much before it needs to be changed .	1
Love the Diaper Champ . I had planned to get the Diaper Genie , but after I read the reviews , the Diaper Champ won out ! I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag , and you do n't have to purchase specific bags . That 's way too much of a headache and expense that I do n't need . It 's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table . It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag , but that , too , is easy once you figure it out . We have n't had a problem at all with the smell , but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure . This is one of those baby items I would n't want to do without .	1
I 've used the genie in the past and much prefer the Diaper Champ . I 'm all about practicality when it comes to baby products and the Diaper Champ is right in line with my views.Very easy to use , ( my senior citizen parents figured it out ... lol ) , controls odor well and USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS ... woohoo ! Who wants to spend money all the time for `` fancy '' trash bags . Buy the diaper champ and save the money for something fun for baby .	1
PRO'S1 . Does n't take up too much space2 . Very easy to use.3 . Very easy to empty.4 . Can use regular trash bags ( saves money ! ) CON'S1 . There is a slight smell when my son delivers a REALLY stinky muddy diaper . ( other than that there is no smell . I just throw the `` bombers '' in the trash outside.FYI1 . Do n't let it get too full , otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty . And once it is open ( stinky ! ! ! ) you do n't want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house.UPDATE : Our son is now 9.5 months old and it just stinks . No matter if there is a diaper in there or not . We have cleaned it , sprayed it , bleached it , put dryer sheets in it , well you name it and we have tried it . THE THING STINKS ! ! ! We have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ . It is going out I am sad to say . But we did get several smell free months out of it . Also just a note . My son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad !	1
I love this diaper Champ . I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends . This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends . As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad ( I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change ) . I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud . Overall , Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it .	1
No special bags to buy ... change at least twice per week ( especially in the summer ) and you are good to go . Remember this thing contains poop , so if it is not changed often , it will smell .	1
The best thing about this product is you do n't have to purchase their bags . It does certainly reduce the odor but the bag still needs to be replaced regularly otherwise the odor will sneak up on you .	1
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail . I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie , because I did n't like the idea of having to buy special bags . Too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER ! ! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM ! No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . ' In fact , people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems , here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1 . CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY ! ! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week . For those who complain that the pail gets stuck , that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL ! ! Also , making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2 . YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING ! ! Hello , it does house dirty diapers ! ! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes ( takes about 10 seconds ! ! ) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two . SIMPLE AND IT WORKS ! Also , for those that complain that the Diaper Champ is n't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : AS BABIES GET OLDER , THEIR DIETS CHANGES ( aka SOLID FOODS ! ) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS ! In talking with other parents , I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers , ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful . Again , this is because as their diet changes , so does the consistency and odor of their stool , in other words , it gets stinkier ! ! ! All in all , this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .	1
I love this ! I was hesitant to buy too since the `` sheet '' is expensive and hardly a `` sheet '' at all . But once I used it , it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy , letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off , it is soft to lay on , absorbant and waterproof . If baby 's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet . You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats . We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it . This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change -- - at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers !	1
Here 's what I like about this product : it 's easy to change , and it provides a leak-proof barrier between the baby and the mattress . Here 's what I do n't like : the snaps are not a great fit for my crib and sometimes come undone ; one snap stopped working altogether ; and the sheet wrinkles and is difficult to smooth out.All in all , the good outweighs the bad . The sheet is particularly handy for newborns who might leak during the night , requiring sheet changes when you 're half asleep . I only use it now when I know he is prone to leaking , such as when he is between diaper sizes . Otherwise , I use regular sheets . Put it on your registry .	1
It 's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet ( and never having to change the crib sheet ) , but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight . Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this , it got a bit easier . It 's not super fast to unsnap and snap on , but better than replacing the crib sheet ( esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out ) .I have 3 of these so I do n't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough . Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric , unfortunately .	1
It 's a nice thick pad and seems comfortable enough to use in place of a sheet everyday , but it 's too expensive for a sheet and because it has the rubber bottom , you ca n't really put it in the dryer without harming it . It takes a long time to hang dry . If it were less expensive , I 'd get a few more . So I use it as a water proof pad and put a sheet over the top of it , but that takes away from the ease of putting it on the mattress , since It gets tucked in the fitted sheet .	1
I have been using these sheets for 6 months . I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets , and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping , I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet . They are machine washable and dryer safe , which I LOVE , considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week . Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle , so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks . It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet . I leave baby 's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size : Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer , but it is not a problem at all . They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material : The top side is a breathable , soft cotton layer . The bottom side has a soft , waterproof plastic feel .	1
works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry . It also is good enough to be used without a cover , my daughter doesnt mind it . Its practical and good for the money paid , recommended .	1
My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly ... . I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used ! This is the best thing ever ! we put one on , and have the other one for an emergency . It is soft , the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute ! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night	1
These should be in everyone 's registry . It 's something you do n't think about , but will save you when you 're totally exhausted and your baby spits up in bed . Just unsnap , throw in the washer and go back to bed ! Soft , waterproof , love these .	1
Really they should hand these out at the hospital . Ever tried to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night while your kids has either puked or peed on it . No one is happy , everyone is crying . This simplifies all of that and still lets you have and see your adorable sheet set you overpaid for . The snaps are so much easier to deal with and the sheet is super absorbent . We have two so if there is an accident - one gets replaced while the dirty one is washed .	1
These sheets have survived numerous washes without fail . We keep one on the crib ( or folded over in the pack n play ) at all times . They 've saved us many nights of wrestling to change sheets , we just change these !	1
I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided . This is a really great and easy to use product . It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I 'm glad that we will have it around for our second child . Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings . This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash , some of the snaps would break off . also , on a side note , as cheap as these are from Amazon , I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price .	1
When my son was a newborn , I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy . Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it . Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily . I do n't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib . This makes life simple and cleaner . You can use it anywhere .	1
I really like this sheet ! It keeps the rest of my son 's crib sheets dry , so easy to take off and clean . I have two so I just wash one and use the other . Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed !	1
I thoroughly enjoy this product . It covers the full top surface of the crib , give or take an inch . My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months . The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture . I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet , another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet ( since the playpen pad ca n't be easily washed ) , and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently . I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it . The snaps work well on small crib rails . They may not fit around larger crib posts . I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib . At 3am , I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress .	1
I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift . The mother had requested a couple of these . Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her . Great idea for a baby shower gift .	1
UPDATE : After washing them only a few times , the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy . I now call it a `` disposable sheet '' and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review : This sheet is a fantastic idea . Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet . Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet , all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place . Then you put another one on ... the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes . I have three , one for the hamper , one on the crib , and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting !	1
I absolutely love this sheet ! Changing my babies sheet is effortless , thanks to this great invention . Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient , especially for those middle of the night changes ! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time , but it 's no big deal , and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby !	1
I registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet after reading reviews in books and online . All the praise is accurate ! ! ! It 's better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress - not just one part . It snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds ! I keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only ( matches bumper and skirt ) - baby never actually comes in contact with it . Get two or three Ultimate Crib Sheets for easy changes - SO much easier to change than the regular sheets ... removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming . This product makes cleaning up so easy ! The only drawback is that it only comes in white , but since it can only be seen looking INTO the crib , it not a big issue for me .	1
These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son 's crib . I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress , and I 've never taken it off . I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets . I have three ; I would recommend that number . I ca n't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets ... this is just SO EASY snap , snap , snap and you 're done ! I never dry mine in the dryer . I hang it on a drying rack and it 's usually dry after a few hours . I want mine to last , and using the dryer tends to wear them out . I 've never not had one on hand , with 3 total .	1
I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple . Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib ... such a chore ! I started using these and have n't had to change the cute sheet since . It 's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else . It 's a soft sheet on top , an absorbent layer in the middle , and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through . I 've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops ... it washes up great with my baby 's normal laundry too ! I highly recommend these sheets .	1
We have something similar to this leftover from when my daughter was a baby and I wanted another , I was n't ablt to find exactly the same pad but this is doing the job .	1
When your little one spits up , vomits , or leaks in the middle of the night , this is a LIFESAVER ! Ok , I am exaggerating , but it sure beats getting the mattress out , taking off the fitted sheet , and then putting another on . Just snap the buttons off , throw it in the washer , and put your little one back in the crib . I have never had a problem with it shrinking but then I 've never thrown it in the wash .	1
I love this sheet ! I have 4 of them ( 2 for each child ) . It is super absorbent and stays in place ! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu . I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore . I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top . Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet , pull it off , and put a clean one in its place . This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these ( you need a spare ! )	1
This is such a helpful product that helps keep the baby 's sheets protected . I love how it has saved me from changing the entire crib sheets off of the mattress . It 's saved me money since it protected the crib sheet so well that I have n't bought any new crib sheet . I 'm still using the ones that I received during my baby shower . The elastic snaps definitely serve a purpose for safety so I use them but they are a little tiresome . If there were a better , yet safe , alternative for the snaps I would have given this product 5 stars . Overall , I 'd highly recommend this product .	1
They are so easy to put on ( or change when you 're half asleep ) and really protect the baby 's sheets . I have three of them right now ! You need to be careful with them in the washer and dryer ( the washer sometimes ripped the backings on them and the dryer sometimes broke off the snaps ) but they are so worth it !	1
The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby 's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet ! It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet ! Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics . The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical ! Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these ! ! ! Update at 7 mos ( July04 ) : I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item ! Do n't go without ! ! ! !	1
This is the BEST crib sheet out there ! It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it.My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion , the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $ 120.00 , so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home .	1
I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed . Believe me , when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet , you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on . Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain ! These are super soft , hold up to repeated washing , stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby . Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you wo n't regret it !	1
Reality is ... you do n't have to have this , but it really helps simplify your life if you do . You do n't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet . Instead , you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress . I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty . I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it 's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it 's washed ( Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer ) . Also , they are expensive . I have two of them and it 's worked out just fine .	1
I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us . The snaps make it a breeze to change , I 'm so glad I do n't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time ! The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups . The only reason I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps do n't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it 's a little wrinkled and off center , but my baby does n't seem to mind .	1
So easy to use , it 's the only one I ever used !	1
Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib ... ... but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess . Well this is the answer ! So much easier ( since they snap around the crib slats ) to get on and off ! Waterproof ! ! What else should i say ! Perfect gift ! ! !	1
This is a great product ! Buy two and put them both in the crib . When your little one leaks in the night , just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside , and you 'll have a clean one underneath . As far as the snaps falling off , my son had pyloric stenosis ( severe vomiting requiring surgery ) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks . Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall ( there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I do n't even use ) . I even washed and dried on the normal cycle ( not gentle ) in warm water ( not cold , as is recommended ) .	1
A must have with babies . Buy at least two of these . Easy to wash and can be used anywhere , not only crib . Remove the elastic tabs and put it on the livingroom floor for baby to play or sleep .	1
I ordered two pack . One of them was an open item but the sheet looks fine and does n't seem like have been used . I 'm okay with that because i bought them for less than $ 4 !	1
I love this item . It is much easier for those middle of the night diaper mishaps , to just go in and unsnap the top sheet and put baby back to bed . I have washed and dried the sheet and had no problems what-so-ever .	1
I have never changed the sheet on my daughter 's crib . Instead , I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between . I ca n't tell you how awesome it 's been . In general , they 're easier to change than regular crib sheets . In a pinch ( ie , diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night ) , they make life SO much easier . Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess , take it to the laundry room , snap the new one on , and you 're good to go.I 've read reviews that said they did n't like this sheet , but I love it . You do n't need any other mattress pad with it , either .	1
I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet ... ... which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began ! I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution . This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews ! I tried one out and absolutely loved it ! Changing sheets is a breeze ! They stay one very well too . I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up . Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up !	1
These only work if you crib slats are a certain size . Our slats are too wide and the sheet would not snap around them . We had to jerryrig the crib by adding plastic hooks that the snaps could fit around . This wo n't work for us as baby gets older . I do like that the sheets are easy to change , clean well and allow you to keep the crib safe without having to add a lot of bedding . This product works well with the Halo Sleep Sacks .	1
Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him . Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets ! I ca n't see the sheets underneath really well , since it covers the entire top of it , but it keeps it clean and dry . The top is soft , while the bottom is lined with plastic .	1
Love this . I dont ' have to keep washing the crib sheet . This makes it easier to keep my baby 's bed clean .	1
Try to change those sheets on a heavy crib mattress in the middle of the night after your kid has an accident and then try jus changing this pads . You will never go back ! ! So easy to put , so easy to change , maybe not visually appealing but I go for practical not just looks . Best gift for a mom to be , well besides a prenatal massage : )	1
The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product . It protects the sheet , eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up . It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom , especially in the middle of the night . It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface . It seems to be waterproof and yet does n't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails , there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out . I like it and would recommend it .	1
Lifesaver for this middle of the might diaper leaks ! It 's always a pain to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night , but this makes it so much easier . I just put it on top of his regular sheet ( which is over a waterproof mattress pad ) . He occasionally has a diaper leak . When he does , I simply unsnap the ultimate crib sheet ( there are roughly 10 snaps to keep it in place ) and let him sleep the rest of the night on his regular sheet . The snaps can be a little tricky to remove with one hand ( say when you 're holding a baby ) , but I generally start unsnapping while he is still in the crib .	1
Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby . Had one during her first year . Now having a second baby and ordered three more ! They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier ! Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby does n't mind and it still serves it 's purpose .	1
When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper , changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper , manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad , then reverse the whole process after washing and drying . The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that : just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash . It 's soft and durable , and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry . In hindsight , wish I 'd had several of these on my registry .	1
Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer . We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner . The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners . No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side . So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but does n't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue . If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it does n't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions . We 'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs .	1
I bought these because a good friend recommended them . They are awesome especially when kids have runny noses etc . It saves me from having to change the crib sheet . The only downside is you ca n't see the pretty design on the crib sheet but for me that is really no big deal .	1
This pad has worked well for my son . He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night . It 's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident . It has never leaked and it 's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality . The only reason I took off one star is because it 's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first . He got used to it and now it is working fine .	1
Started potty training and this has been our best purchase . Rarely my crazy sleeper will roll to a part of the bed thats not covered and pee but usually this pad protects the sheets and saves me from having to change all the sheets . Stays put . Washes well	1
Accidents happen with little kids , this is a really easy way to make sure the bed is kept clean and dry especially if you have a loft or bunk bed you do n't want to climb up to , to tear apart .	1
The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and did n't allow for pull ups . ( It worked well ! ) About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue . I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it , that is when I found this . Turns out my daughter was sick at the time , but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed . I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training ( for nap time and bedtime ) . It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too . I now have this off of her bed again , but I ca n't say enough good stuff about this product .	1
For a Training pad these are super easy to use , wash and make acceptable with your kid . Have 5 of them now as we braved no diapers at night early on .	1
I use this along with a water proof mattress pad , to minimize the number of times I have to launder EVERYthing , and it is fantastic . It does exactly what it is supposed to do , without problems of any kind . And my kids do n't really even know it is there .	1
This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training . It 's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks . It 's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off .	1
We are in the process of night-time training our 4 year old . This has saved us a lot of sheet washing . Considering the disposable pads run about $ 1 a piece , this quickly paid for itself . I am considering getting another .	1
I absolutely LOVE the Handy 's Plus Pad . I purchased 5 of the full-size pads for my son over a year and a half ago and I think they are GREAT . My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2 . These pads really work ( no leaks ! ) , are comfortable and wash-up well . I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps are n't quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress ( although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight ) AND 2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to `` curl up '' after several washings . Despite these complaints , I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one . The reason that I own 5 of these is that , if you truly want `` full '' coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping , you need to use 2 with some slight overlap ( so , 2 to use and 2 for back-up ) . I also use one ( full-size ) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa . The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa . I think this is a `` must have '' product for parents of toddlers that do n't want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to `` wash '' a children 's sofa that really is n't meant to be washed . ( fyi ... If you like Basic Comfort 's Ultimate Crib Sheet , then you 'll also like their Handy 's Plus Pad . The Handy 's Plus Pad is basically the Ultimate Crib Sheet with side flaps and without the snaps . In fact , the pad portion of the Handy 's Plus Pad - Full size is almost the same size as the Ultimate Crib Sheet . )	1
I got this because it used regular trash bags and you do n't have to worry about a huge long twisted snaky thing unraveling when you take it to the trash . I 've been using it almost a year . I do use those cheap Bowl Fresh toilet deodorizers instead of ordering the disks . I clip the hanger off and break it in half ( while it 's still in the plastic ) and add half or both , just depends . The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it 's cheap ! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag . Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom . I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose .	1
We have used this pail for 3 years , and 2 kids . The advantage is that this pail does n't require any special bags . We change out the bag twice a week . You save a lot of money if you get sheap bags at Dollar Tree or Big Lots ( works out to about 10-cents a bag ) . It does get stinky sometimes , but all garbage pails do and every child has an extra stinky diaper occasionally . Roll with it and save money when and where you can .	1
Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point , diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it 's going to emit odors and smell bad . Then , when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one , especially for the middle of the night diaper changes . Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags . We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product . Odor-Less - No . We empty it as needed , usually once a week , and realize it 's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail . I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor .	1
Purchased this unit to hold adult size large briefs and have been pleasantly surprised . Holds approximately 8 soiled briefs with virtually no smell emitted ( except when adding more to pail ) . I wish it held more but I 'm so happy to have something that helps with this & quot ; unmentionable & quot ; problem that I really am not concerned by the small-ish volume . I 'm having trouble finding replacement deodorizer disks though and may have to use a stick-on unit or something when a new one is required .	1
I really like this diaper pail . It helps with odor control , but is certainly not odorless . As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper . I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery . There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky . This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors . It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor . It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload , but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags , it is worth the money . It is n't very expensive to begin with .	1
Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs ( ie : tv , chest freezer , etc ) It works very well and is extremely secure . I actually have a very tough time getting into this . The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords . And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only . I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through ( the surge protector and chest freezer cord ) . I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily . When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover . Recommend this just for thin plugs , no adapters . Good buy for the price .	1
My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble . We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that is n't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he could n't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked . They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house . Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things . He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal . But I do n't have to worry about the plugs anymore ! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents .	1
I bought these to help baby proof my house . My son gets into everything ! ! These covers are fantastic . They are sort of hard to get open when installing them . There is no way my son will be able to open them ... .he 's tried ! haha . Only problem is , it does n't prevent him from pulling on the wires . So you still need to be vigilant : )	1
These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to . I 'm not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them ... they are hard enough for adults to disconnect ! I was n't sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product ( seems to be hit or miss with this company ) , but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers . And the price is great for a 2-pack .	1
This things install quickly and easily if you 're running standard cords ( for lamps , etc . ) though the holes . If you want to run something thicker ( like the wire on one of my power strips ) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit . I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them . I 'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I 'd want access to all the time , and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away .	1
These work great to keep kids out of the plugs and are easy enough to remove by an adult . We use them in our nursery .	1
These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in , such as lamps or alarm clocks , so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves . And that 's exactly what they do . We use several in our home and have had no problems . They 're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open ( which is completely the point ) or that it only holds `` small '' ( aka standard ) plugs , which should be obvious from the description and picture , so they 're not really being fair .	1
This thing works but it 's very tricky getting off . If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off . Do n't get discouraged like I did . Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure . Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp .	1
I have 18 month old twins , and an older child with cerebral palsey , she has a hospital bed downstairs where we all get together during the day and evening and the babies are always getting into the cords , pulling them out of the wall , came on amazon ( found this ) and it goes over even the thick cords for the hospital bed ( 3 prong ) so it is well worth the money as the babies have now completely given up on the cords : )	1
My 2 year old has n't been able to figure them out yet , so naturally , we 're sold ! He pretty much ignores them now . Yay !	1
I gave this product 4/5 stars for a couple reasons : Pros - mostly keeps fingers away from the plugs and sockets but only because they ca n't reach the sockets with little fingers , durable , hard for a child to take apart , completely kept our first son away.Cons - harder for an adult to quickly put together and take apart , does n't keep little extremely curious fingers out of the top hole area ( though they ca n't reach the part that would shock them ) , and does n't stop our son from unplugging the cord since there is space for the cord to be pulled upward so that the plug comes out of the socket . The plug wo n't come out of the box easily , but it can still be unplugged , and since it 's harder for an adult to get fingers in the top part to plug it back in , it has to be taken apart to be plugged back in.Overall , it 's done the job very well , but it is big and is n't perfect ( though I doubt anything is ) .	1
I love this item . I got two for my apt . My kids are no longer turning the lights out or pulling cords . I absolutely love this item .	1
I love this thing . It fit our large power strip easily . Also very easy to use . I would highly recommend .	1
They are as shown , and work great so that kids ca n't pull out the many cords that we all use easily ! I would recommend it to anyone with young tots !	1
I love this product it keeps my son safe . I enjoy how I can reach my skinny fingers into it unplug one thing and still leave it in the power strip cover but my son can still not get into it at all . It has been great to have especially now for all the Christmas lights we have going on .	1
this helps from letting my daughter play with the actual outlet and plug in , but she can still pull the cord out of the plug in the inside . so it does protect her from being electified , but she can still unplug the tv lol	1
This cover was alright , the hole does seem a bit large and it was n't quite long enough for our biggest power strip , but I have yet to find a cover that is , so I ca n't dock any stars for that	1
I ordered this some time ago . I finally started using it last week . It was very difficult to figure out how to use . But , once I ready the instructions a few times I got it . My 8 month old loves all electric cords . I needed something to protect her . For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it . I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it has n't presented itself as a major problem yet . I would purchase another one of these .	1
This is a perfect baby proofing tool . The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips . There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it . It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places . It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes . Overall , best power strip cover I 've seen .	1
We have several surge protectors throughout the house and these covers fit them well and protect the plugs and open outlets . They do their job well.I have not tried to wall mount .	1
So far , my 2 year old has been able to pull the cords out , but has n't been able to get his little fingers down near the outlet , which is really the important part . One nice plus is it actually neatens the look of the power strip , instead of making it look tackier .	1
What a great idea , to protect your power strip . Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner .	1
We used this behind the tv for all the connects and cords . It works well and keeps all the cords from being pulled .	1
Does the job ! It 's huge . But , it has to be to fit everything in there . I 'm just grateful someone made something like this to keep our kids safe from electrocution . : )	1
This is the best power strip cover I have found . We tried the Mommy 's Helper cover but it does n't shut very securely and does n't fit some larger plugs .	1
My 2 year old never cared about the power cord under my computer ( that powers the router ) , but once she discovered the entire family 's reaction to pressing that red button , she sure loved sneaking down there . This stopped that instantly .	1
Nothing special ... it does the job of covering what it is suppose to . Unfortunately it still draws the attention of a 9 month old baby ... .but nothing gets past them anyway ! It is safer to just have no wires/plugs anywhere that babies can see them but if you cant this at least makes it impossible to get to outlets .	1
This has been a life saver ! It has kept my now 18 month old son out of the plugs and safe and I could not be happier with this product !	1
I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it does n't fit iPhone/iMac chargers . This one does . And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to . Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it 's true , it 's surprisingly wide , I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to , rather than opening the whole thing . So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you do n't want him/her to ? Sure , but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets . Bottom line : treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid 's playing with power cords .	1
We have a in floor outlet under our love seat that we have a power strip attached to . We did n't want to get rid of the power stripe because it runs my husbands laptop and the table lamp . This is was the perfect solution . It was easy to install and so far my 7 month old can not get into it !	1
Easy to use !	1
I got this for my son 's room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside ( for example for the wipes warmer ) . If you are plugging in standard sizes only , it should work great . We ended up not using it .	1
Great option for covering your outlets from little fingers . Easy to use and store away . Adjust to different lengths by pressing the buttons .	1
I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom . This cover is n't the most attractive thing , but works . They can not reach into it or access anything , ( not sure what hole people are talking about ) , and have left it alone . It 's about the size of a one liter soda bottle , and slides together/apart to extend the length . It is tall enough , but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip . It still works however , and is the best solution I 've found . Would recommend .	1
This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure . It also covered as well as the other plugs : ) Easy to use and sturdy .	1
I bought this `` neutral '' color ( off-white ) cover ( UPC 5218110409 , model 10409A - I do n't know how that differs from model 10409 ) andMommy 's Helper Power Strip Safety Coverto compare the two . Unlike that item , this cover is expandable from 9 '' to 13.5 '' in length . The roughly-cylindrical compartment is about 3.5 '' wide and 4 '' high . The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 5/8 '' -1 '' wide and a maximum of 10-3/4 '' long . When closed , the hole for the power strip cord is 1-3/8 '' by 1/2 '' . Holes are provided in the base for wall mounting , but no accessories are provided.To open the thing , you press two tabs on the inner lower cover , then slide off the outer cover , then lift the inner top cover . Place the power strip into the inner lower cover , then replace the inner top cover , then slide the inner cover into the outer cover.The plastic is stiffer compared with the Mommy 's Helper model , but it also seems more brittle . I do n't like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half-disassembling the thing . It can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the Mommy 's Helper model by about 3/4 '' in either direction , which is nice . Buy this from Amazon.com !	1
I believe that this product would prevent a child from tampering with a power strip , but the plastic is quite thin and I was worried as I used it that it would break . As I was installing it I tried to be very careful as it seemed as though the plastic was quite thin .	1
Fits all of my cords ( even my Apple cords ) perfectly . Works exactly as advertised .	1
This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips . It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like . The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together . For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together . Other than that it 's a decent little contraption that does its job .	1
So far this has worked well for us . It 's not pretty but it is effective . Will update this is my son figures out how to take it apart .	1
Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips ? I could n't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it was n't quite long enough . Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though .	1
This cover works well for my power strips -- all the ones in my house fit . Also , I like that it does n't matter how big the plugs are that you have in the power strip , it holds them ( those large converter plugs that wo n't fit is so many child proof products fit fine in this one.My child is 10 months and has n't messed with these yet , so I ca n't say how they will hold up with a larger toddler . However , I was concerned she 'd try to put her hand in the slot that cords come out of and that has n't happened yet . You still have to manage how the cords coming out of this cover are child-proofed . There is some space to roll up excess slack and stuff it into the cover .	1
Essential if you are in the process of baby-proofing the living daylights out of your apartment/house , as I am . This product not only makes the powerstip safe for kids , but it also allow your chords to be in a neat casing and not all over the floor .	1
This is a little bigger than I thought it was gon na be , but it does the trick . It 's big enough to hold my my chargers for phone , bluetooth , ect . I did knock off one star due to the hole where the cords come out of is juts a little too big . My son who is 18 months can fit his hand in this gap and can almost reach the outlet .	1
My little one looooves plug ins . This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices , from trying to plug things into the power strip , and from flipping the power strip into the off position . It keeps my child and my electronics safe ! My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended . The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully . When extended , the cover can wiggle , and if wiggled enough , little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces , thus gaining access to the power strip . In an effort to avoid this scenario , I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it , so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended , however , because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location , my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position . Furthermore , seeing all those cords , outlets , and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments , she would happily turning it on and off , unplugging things , and trying to `` plug '' foreign objects into it . So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons , plug ins , and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible ( ie : out in the open ) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless . It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product would n't need to be fully extended .	1
Functional and easy to use . They do the job . They are n't the prettiest thing , but they work to keep my son safe , which is the most important .	1
There is no perfect solution to window blind cords , but I think these do well . I actually used this kind years ago for pets . I do usually have to open and close them to unwind , but that is okay . What is important is that they put the cord high above a child 's reach . I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows . However , for the kid 's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around , so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling .	1
We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house . I did n't want to spend a fortune , but needed a quick fix . These did the trick , easy to install , and keep the cords just out of their reach . They do pop off from time to time , but are easily replaced . I 've purchased several different brands , and they are all about the same . I would n't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type .	1
This device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle ( fortunately , phew ! ) . I tried a different lock prior to this one , which I returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open . This one does NOT have that problem . It is easy to install , and works in areas with tight clearance too .	1
I was kinda exceptional when I saw it and the the adhesive pad idea was n't that appealing to me for your oven door , but I got ta tell , it works and it works surprisingly good ..	1
It 's pretty hard to find a great oven lock . This one had terrible reviews , but was the kind we needed for our new oven ( a side lock ) . We 've been using it for 9 months , and my toddler ( who is now almost 2 ) seems quite safe . She 's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times ( and we 've told her `` no '' , which she seems to accept most of the time ) and the lock has stayed put . She 's tried to operate the lock a few times , and has not been successful at that either . I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out , but she has been easily diverted from it.It 's held up great , and I do n't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven ( which is pretty often - I cook a lot ) . I have no complaints .	1
We love this oven lock . It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well . It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it 's hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go . It does n't get too hot to touch when the oven is on , which is great so that I can have it locked while I 'm cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out .	1
Does what it is supposed to . Basic and easy too use and little ones ca n't figure it out .	1
My husband yanked hard enough on the oven door to pop this off . I do n't think a baby or toddler could have managed it , though .	1
These locks took some time to install , however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly . The time now was well worth the ease in the future . Plus , after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode . This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again . Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door ! Definitely a wonderful investment .	1
I LOVE these things ! They work great and I love that you ca n't see them or my child can not get his fingers stuck in anything ! They took about 30 minutes to install and they are amazing !	1
These locks just can not be beat . They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place . They can not be opened at ALL by the child , unlike many of the other items out there . You have to not only have the key to open the door , you have to know how to manipulate it to open . If you have chemicals that you have store within a child 's reach , there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe . I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING ! Trust me , you wo n't be disappointed . Regarding the installation , my husband is not a handyman - he 's a musician and if he can figure it out , so can just about anyone else . Buy them !	1
Love these . Not the easiest to install and they may take a little getting used to , but so worth it ! They are really secure and do not interfere with the appearance of your cabinets . Would recommend in a heartbeat !	1
I read the directions twice then installed taking less than 15 minutes and I am pretty clueless with putting things together . One thing that should be changed is it says on the outside that a drill should be used but the directions says not to use a drill . The screws are small so a drill would be pointless . I like that it comes with paper guides so you only screww once and it is where it needs to be the first time instead of trial and error making many holes in cabinet .	1
Even though the Tot Lok is a bit pricey , it 's well worth the money.My daughter 's room has a cabinet that has 2 doors with an open shelf space between them . We did n't want her to have access to the cabinets , as we store her nicer books in the cabinets . We tried several different methods of keeping her out of the cabinet doors . I could spend several minutes rigging up what I thought would be a kid-proof barrier , only to have my daughter get into the cabinets within minutes.I found the Tot Loks one day when we were looking at child proof products , and boy , do I wish we had found them sooner . These things are great . After a lengthy install process - my hubby is a do-it-yourself handyman type and it still took awhile to install - our daughter can no longer get into the cabinets.I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs to keep kiddos ( or even pets ) out of cabinets . Just do n't lose the `` key '' or lock it inside the cabinet !	1
We have these locks installed on our cabinets in our home . I 've tried other brands without success.. my kids always figure a way to get in . With this system , they can try all they want but they can not get in . Sometimes the doors require pressing to open , but after I figured it out.. I never have an issue opening the doors . This will be the system of choice in any additional homes we buy later on ... I do n't think I 'd ever want to change after having such a positive experience . I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member , without hesitation !	1
The locks are great . The only tricky part was installing them b/c if you do n't drill far enough , the magents wo n't line up when you use the key on the other side and it wo n't work . I also could not flip the red bar to disengage it . I would recommend these b/c they work and with the key ... they 're almost even adult proof .	1
As with everything about being a parent , locks are more complicated than you 'd have thought ( or would like ! ) : SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS : The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install , especially on drawers , but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure . Still , most people may want to try the adhesive locks ( see below ) first , to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros : + Very nice & secure once installed , especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is , on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open , for when no children are aroundCons : - Complicated to install , especially in some situations . So you might not get around to installing them , given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part , plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock , to keep from drilling through the door ; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while , and want a finished , secure set of locks , the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note , if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS : The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots , but it 's still a good lock to try first , for a lot of people , because it works well ( in the right situations ) and is easy to install . Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets . Once you 've tried a few , it 's a lot easier to see where 'll they 'll work or wo n't work.Pros : + Quick to install , after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required , so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons : - Only installs horizontally ( along the top edge of a door or drawer ) , given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount , no additional screws , for some furniture we did n't want to drill holes into . They seem to be strong enough so far , especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it wo n't open , they lose interest . I do n't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS : The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type ( like theMommy 's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock ) is that the hooks have a lot more play ( they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock ) . So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer , but they will make a racket . Maybe OK in some situations , but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS : Slide locks ( such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock ) are very quick and easy to install , if they fit . But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock , so if they are within reach they are n't much of a barrier to older kids . And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors . However , they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS : Flex locks ( like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock ( see reviews ) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack ) are strong and easy to install , and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure ( unlike the magnetic locks , which are designed to be out of sight ) . So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink ; or use them when you travel . And as a bonus , they are so secure that even some adults ca n't open them ! ; - ) ( They do take two hands to open . ) Not attractive , but they do the job if you keep them tightened .	1
We used other types of latches , such as the ones that you push down and the ones that you squeeze and pull apart . Not toddler proof ! We bought these magnet latches to put on our drawers in the kitchen and what a dream ! ! Another reviewer suggested two keys . Definitely . We only have one and are going to purchase another . Small price to pay for security . The thing I like about these is that if your little one is out of the house for the day , or they outgrow them , meaning they are old enough to be safe around knives and such , you can fix them where they do n't require the key ! One drawback : If you have a double-wide or single-wide mobile home , you will have to do some modifications to your drawers to get them to work . My husband spent an entire evening working on three drawers due to the modifications needing to be made for them to work correctly for our drawers . After it was all done , it works perfectly . Also , a small price to pay for the security of my little angel . Do yourself a favor and invest a little money and get these latches ! ! ! !	1
This product is great . It 's not super easy to install ( each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door ) . If you take your time , ready the instructions , plan it out , and execute ; it works great . You have to be patient . Each door took me 5 to 10 minutes . In less than 1 hour I was able to unpack , read instructions , plan , get my tools , and have it done in 4 doors . I think it wo n't work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.I love how it 's hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it . The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time .	1
I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock . We on the other hand love these locks . We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child . One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too . I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets . They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again . We prefer to leave our on at all times ( even when our children do n't need the cabinets locked anymore ) because they are easy to turn off ( just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet ) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home . We have never split a cabinet and we do n't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks . You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one ( s ) will be protected . It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either . If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open . We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink . Good luck whatever you decide .	1
After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks ( we have a cat that likes to get into things too ) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors ( better than getting at chemicals or whatever , but still ! ) , our pediatrician recommended these to us . They were easy to install , and he ca n't get the doors open at all , so no pinched fingers or getting at something he should n't . They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position , like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot , or the kids are older and you do n't need them anymore . I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost , or locked in a cabinet by accident .	1
This is simply a great product . It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front . The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago . They open easily when the magnet is put near ( do n't even need to touch the cabinet door ) . We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience , but piece of mind it gives . They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door , but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made . These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes .	1
These locks are fantastic , but wow , what a pain to install . The directions are all but useless , so it was kind of trial and error . My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside . It 's worth it for those .	1
We installed these to keep the kids out of the knife drawers . They worked well at first but had a learning curve . Visitors to the house found it impossible to work , because we had to have the magnet positioned just so . That is actually a good safety feature , because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out , it worked well . I 'd say it 's been in our drawer for about six years . We no longer use it and it has n't worked well for about a year or so . The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we ca n't get into the drawer.This is a good lock , but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets . It takes work for people to learn . I think it should have lasted longer than five years , but maybe that 's all most people need . 4 stars for the fact that it does what it 's designed to do but not 5 stars , because it has issues .	1
I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington . I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time , so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again . They are really not hard to install , I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know . I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there , most other child locks do not have that feature .	1
Love these , my son can not open anything now . Everything is totally safe in our home now because of these	1
I am sure we will use these in the future , but I wanted to post saying that our doctor recommended an emery board to avoid the risk of cutting the skin of a newborn because their nails are so close to it . Just wanted to let new moms know what I have learned .	1
I really love this set of clippers . After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love . The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails . My baby 's grow quickly so these clippers are used often . I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip , that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails . It will not work for big people nails , which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need ! I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers . Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too !	1
Ordered before baby was born . Now started to cut the nails already . Nice clippers , easy to hold in the hand .	1
No brainer , makes it easy to cut my children 's nails.Does n't get lost easily . Easy to clean . Great grip .	1
These are n't bad . A little awkward to use the clipper lever - it is very small even for my small hands and tends to slip . But I 'm guessing this is just the case with all baby clippers . It 's fairly easy to see what you 're about to clip and you do n't need to press very hard to cut the nail . My handle was green , unlike the white in the photo .	1
Easy to hold and easy to use , we love it and it helps stop our son from scratching his face up at night .	1
Very nice it 's was exactly what I expected . I will defiantly recommend it . I will be buying more in the future .	1
The extra add-on is awesome for long-fingered parents ! My whole family have ten mile long limbs , which includes incredibly long fingers so having that extra knobby thing attached to the nail clippers to hold onto makes it much less scary to bring a sharp object to your babies fingers.I suggest you ALWAYS cut their nails when they 're sleeping , though . Haha	1
So the baby nail clippers are TINY ! and hard to hold , but this is great , it fits into the palm of my hand and I get my newborn son 's nails clipped much easier . If I could , I would change the material on the grip to a rubbery texture so it would n't slide around in my hand at all . My hands are always very dry and it slides around a bit , but nothing like how those tiny ones fall out of my hand . I would recommend this product .	1
I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift . It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper , similar to this one , but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee : Sassy : Bumble Bee Nail Clippers . It was terrible . I could n't see my baby 's finger nails at all and it was n't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother 's house . It was so much easier to use than the other one . The size is perfect for her little fingers . I could easily see my baby 's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her . The handle fits nicely in my hand . And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip . I bought one for myself and it 's the only one I 'll use now .	1
I know they make these with a huge bulb on them now , but I still use the pairs of these I had from 10.5 years ago when my son was born . I clip my 10 and 4 year olds ' nails with these and they are steady and perfect and still clip fine . Just bought a pair for a new mom-to-be friend , and have gifted them in the past . These are all you need ! And maybe some reading glasses and good light !	1
I 'm FTM and just used on my 5 days old baby-works perfectly . Not bulky , sharp and great quality . Highly recommended .	1
These are comfortable to hold and make it easy to cut my baby 's nails without cutting them too short or struggling to hold onto the tiny clippers .	1
We had the Summer Infant clippers first . They came in a two-pack , with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper . Neither one worked well . The larger of the two did n't work at all . These Safety First clippers cut every time . For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby 's nails , you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut . AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH ! These work every time .	1
Honestly , I do n't just use these for babies . In fact , it 's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids . They wo n't touch the metal ones , but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails . The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails ... but you ca n't beat the ease of clipping with these things !	1
Clipping baby nails is one of the most stressful things . This nail clipper is small , but handles very well and the thicker handles make it an easier process . Well-made ... we have been using ours for over 2 years without problems .	1
This is baby nail clipper # 4 that we 've tried , and our search is finally over . It 's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold . What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers ? The losers : - Safety 1st model 49539 ( has the holder for emery boards ) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless . The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper ( the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring ) - has the safety guard so you do n't catch the baby 's skin in the clippers , but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail . Plus , it 's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness , but something about the way it 's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby 's nails.Search ends here , thank goodness !	1
I know that every doctor says an oral temperature does n't count , you have to take a rectal one . But seriously , I hate taking my sons rectal temperature . It is gross , he is squirming around . Yuck . This is so much easier . You pop it in their mouth , couple of seconds later , you have your temperature . I have found it to be really accurate , unlike the ear one , which reads completely different on each ear . Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag . Super convenient !	1
It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant . With this product , given that the infant would be used to a pacifer , works wonders . For all of my friends expecting a little one , this is a must .	1
When I bought this item , I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby 's temperature . I use this thermometer only on occasion . It 's convenient , but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached . It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long . It 's getting harder for my baby to accept this `` pacifier '' , now that she is on the larger , 6-month-plus sized pacifiers . Also , check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings : our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life .	1
My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting . It is n't as spacious as the tub we use at home , which is a little smaller than most tubs , but it folds up nicely , and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all . I use both tubs in the big bathtub , so leaking is n't a problem for me . My son seems comfortable , but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds . This tub is great for grandma 's house , or if space is tight .	1
This tub has proven very handy . My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old . I admit , that was a little tricky . However , in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere . Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor . I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter , since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom . I also like the little section in the front . That 's where I put the soapy water . It 's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can . The tub has been great , but now that my son is 17 lbs . it 's getting small . I will be looking for another bath aid soon , but I 'll miss this handy tub .	1
I like this tub , it fits in my sink well , it folds up nicely . My daughter is 4 months old and still fits in it .	1
We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks . Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital , as well as at home . The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges ( ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear ) . We use our tub in the kitchen sink . Leaks , pinches and mildew have never been a problem . Oddly enough , we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards ( once she could hold up her head ) . This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair . We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby 's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold . Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months , but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months . Our baby loves bath time ! - Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds . We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub . This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us !	1
I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one . I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it . A must have .	1
I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath . At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it . I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded . I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty . After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet . I also have a newborn to toddler tub , which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking . As long as you do n't overfill it , it works just fine . I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones . The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub , but at $ 12.99 , is that really such a big deal ? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it . If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one .	1
MY HUSBAND AND I LIKED THIS TUB BECAUSE WE COULD FOLD IT UP AND PUT IT AWAY IN THE LINEN CLOSET . IT DOES TEND TO LEAK AT THE HINGES THOUGH CAUSING THE WATER TO GET COOL VERY QUICK . WE USED TO KEEP THE WATER RUNNING INTO THE TUB THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE BATHING OUR SON AND THIS WORKED OUT GREAT . THE WATER WAS ALWAYS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE AND OUR SON LOVED THE SPLASHING FROM THE FAUCET . I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH LIMITED SPACE FOR AN INFANT TUB .	1
This tub is incredible for a newborn . It 's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place , and it 's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby . It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink . However , after a couple of months , we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more . I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn !	1
I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby 's legs . This was okay - soft all over , no problems like we had with the four stage , however because it folds the hinges tend to leak . Also , you ca n't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined . The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt . We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way .	1
We have limited storage so this works great & fits in the sink perfectly . Never have a problem with leaking either .	1
My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born . We have used it since she was able to take a bath , and she 's 4 months old . I liked that it could be folded , but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily . It does leak at the hinges . My daughter is very comfortable in it . Since she was born in the winter , I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm . It does fit in the kitchen sink though . I still give her her bath in the bathroom , and just sit her tub in the big tub . It uses less water , her head is elevated , and she 's a little higher . She has n't outgrown it yet , and has plenty of room . It is a great tub , and a great price !	1
I used this tub with my son and boy do I miss it ! We have the newborn-to-toddler tub with daughter and it 's bulky , takes up tons of room and is no different than this one other than it does n't fold up . I would much rather have the fold-up than the one we have now . They both work and get the job done but for space reasons being able to fold it and put out of the way is much nicer IMO ...	1
I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year . Living in an apartment , this tub is great for small spaces . I use it in the big tub and when I am done , I just rinse it and leave it to dry . When dried , I fold it and put it in the cabinet . The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping . But considering it folds for storage , that was not a big issue . It 's a great tub otherwise .	1
I 'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product . Many complain that it 's too small for their sink ... hello ! ! ! It was n't made for a SINK . Anyway , ... I love this tub . I would n't want any other one . It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect= , and now that he 's sitting up , ... it 's even more convenient . Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product . It may be the only tub you will buy in you child ' early stages .	1
I have n't had problems with this tub ... . I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months , and that tub became too small , so I purchased this one . I 'm so glad I did.At 3 months , my son was large for his age , but unable to sit up yet , so this tub was perfect.I 've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store , and it is bulky , but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though . Once it is completely extended , there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It 's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money .	1
We love this tub . We have been using it since our daughter 's first bath . It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version , but that tight fit means it wo n't leak . If you do n't pop it together right it will leak . We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it 's not really taking up any vital space . Our daughter seems to like the sling . She 's four months old now and did n't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We 're now using this tub on child # 2 . Still no problems . This child likes it too . Between the two girls we 've been using this tub for 22 mo . It has never leaked , not once .	1
Unfortunately , I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere ( ( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago ) . It is great ! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and does n't go under water . This blue gear is awesome . I do not understand why it is discontinued . I do not care if it is leaking . I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub . IF SOMEBODY HAS IT , PLEASE , I WILL BUY FROM YOU .	1
It 's been 5 months aleady and we 've had no troubles at all . It leaked the first time we used it because I did n't snap the locks into place all the way . My boys are quite big for their age , and they love to kick their legs and splash around . There is plenty of room for that . In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter , but when they started splashing water all over the place , I put this tub in our regular bath . I do n't use the sling anymore , but it was n't a problem when we did .	1
I registered for this bath tub and recieved it as a shower gift . Everything on the tub works well . My son does slide down the sling and I do have to put him back . But I do n't think it 's possible for that not to happen because he 's so actively moving the whole time . I 've never had a problem with it leaking . The suction cups do get stuck on very hard and I really have to pull to get it up so much that I pulled one suction cup off last time ( It went back on very easily ) . But theres a reason they stick so much to keep my son safe . So I am glad to have this tub and would recommend it over all the others .	1
My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough . This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted ! The newborn sling is nice , and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed . Our baby did n't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself , and at that point this bath tub became a necessity . Baby loves to explore the tub , and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place . He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way , too ! I especially like it because I do n't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something . We had a problem with leaking at first , too , but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely , we have n't had a problem since .	1
Great product for our little one . We put the baby tub in the big bath tub and our little one loves to take baths . The first time we used it I had a hard time locking it but once I got it locked there were no problems . I like the whole set up especially teh suction cups so it doesnt slide around , the sling to keep the baby laying on an incline is great too the perfect height to keep the baby happy . It also has a removable bath ring , that she will be using when she can sit on her own .	1
Not sure why this got bad reviews . There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position , if you do n't snap it in right , it will leak . But once we figured that out we had no problems . We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem . Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe . Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub , great value !	1
i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub . i had two different tubs before , and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old , she 's now one year old and still uses it . granted , i never tried to fold it since those few inches do n't seem to make much of a difference storagewise , so i do n't know if its difficult to do . i 've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub , and the suction cups still work great . the bathring works great , and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone . although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time . it 's been 7 months with this tub , and nothing ever broke , or got worn . i think this tub is great ! ! !	1
I bought this tub without reading any reviews ( I research everything before I buy ) and this has been the best tub by far ! So far , in my 7 months of motherhood I have been through four tubs ( this being the 5th ) . I had a little sponge bath when he was first born ... I knew it would not work for any extend about of time but it did the trick when we were waiting for his belly buttons stump to fall off . When he out grew that I bought the Safer Bather by leachco based on reviews and I was not all that impressed ... My little guy got to cold and it just was not that great . We received the four stage bath system and it was horrible the baby just did not fit in it right . Therefore , I upgraded to the leachco bath ring ... once again nothing but disappointment . I was resolved to washing the baby in the sink , but at 7 months that was just too hard for me to do alone ; he was slippery and squirmy just wanting to play ! I happened to be out at Toy 's r us and they were having a sale so I picked up the tub thinking what the heck lets see if this works . So far , it has been great . No leaks , he is very secure ( obviously , you stay with them ) and it is so simple clean . My only issue is the tub is large and we have a small bathroom . I am 5 months pregnant with my second and can not wait to use the sling with the next baby . By far this is one of the best baby items I own ! Five stars from me !	1
We bought 2 of these , and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room , and to block off the 7 ' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house . We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable , they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over . At least once a week , my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over . So if you intend to use this fence as a corral , either indoors or out , this is a Great Buy . If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening , pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate . you ( and your toes ) will be much happier .	1
When our son started rolling into chairs , we knew we needed something to keep him safe . This play yard fits great in our living room , yet there 's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions . Also , I like that it 's see-thru . You can see your baby ( and he can see you ) from across the room . I do n't care that it 's not the most attractive thing . It was affordable and it does the job . And when our son starts crawling , we can completely close it and know that he wo n't be able to sneak off . One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom , about six inches high . My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time ( NOT very comfortable ) , and when I move him away from it , he wakes up . It 'd be nice to not have to move him .	1
We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside . She loves it and plays well . It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds . Best of all , is that it is very light and easy to carry , as well as having an excellent carry strap .	1
Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment , providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play . It is n't a very large gate- even when fully extended , it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen . But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids ( and their toys ) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems . It is very easy to clean and to transport . The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still . The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness , so do n't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space . It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this , the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age . As children get older , they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down , making it impractical as a containment device . But the shorter height has one clear advantage : It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over . There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly . The gates can not be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner . Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy . Placed in a straight line , the gate can not resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers . With the limited space , some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate . Depending on the number of toys your kids have , one child might be all that will fit . This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit . This kit consists of two additional panels and while this does n't sound like much , it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall , Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment . I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use , marketed solely to take our hard earned money . But now that I own the Superyard , I can not imagine life without this containment device . It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected , giving parents some much needed peace of mind .	1
This product is a godsend ! I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant , so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets , small objects , etc . I am also planning on getting an extension , to make her play area even bigger . The 'Superyard XT ' is also great for puppies , and more humane than crating them for hours . My only complaint , and it is minor , is that the gate that opens ( so you can get in the 'Superyard ' ) is awkward and somewhat difficult to work . There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing , so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area .	1
This has system has given me peace or mind . I know my grand daughter is safe while she is entertaining herself . Great product , very study .	1
I recently purchased this yard when my twins ( ( now nearly 8 months old ) ) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house , but I have super-yard'ed the family room ! I have it shaped as a square , and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside , to protect my carpet . The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes , and be able to play with many of their toys ( ( rather than being confined in a pack n play ) ) . It is pretty sturdy if used properly , I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it , obviously it would collapse . It DOES fold , but not at all compactly , and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it ... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard , look else-where . I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area , or even remove/add panels ( ( sold separately which we did not buy ) ) to make it larger or smaller . Also , due to it being plastic ( ( very well rounded I may add , no sharp edges ! ) ) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving ! I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to `` gate off '' 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room . My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ( ( with the full hole , not the 1/2 hole ) to either side of each door frame , and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate , that it will work . Of course , this will do damage to our walls , but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ( ( please note that these are NOT meant for stairs , or doorways . They are NOT baby gates ... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention ) ) . And , one of my friends owns one , and used it to surround her christmas tree last year , which I thought was an AMAZING idea ! I think that once our boys master crawling , and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now !	1
We purchased this the moment i saw my son fell and landed flat on the floor hitting the bottom corners of our entertainment center & computer table . It gave him a bad bruise on his forehead , and worst of all a very traumatic cry of his life at 8 months . Now that we enclosed our entertainment center along with our computer table with this gate , we not only protected him from some more bad falls , but also kept him away from other stuffs ( cds/dvds , remote controls , powersurge outlet and so on ) we do n't want him to play with . Definitely , a very sturdy gate that wo n't just fall apart when pulled or tagged by my son , now 14 months . It does n't even encourage him to climb up on its diagonal shaped railings , no matter how much he tries to . I say , its much cheaper too to invest on gates rather than on childproofing device with adhesives that do n't actually work , and other devices that are not only childproof but adult proof as well . A great investment for a lifelong use .	1
This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation . We bought it over a year ago ( with the extension ) and have used it every day since . When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement , we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas . She is not a climber yet , so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is . It will tip over , the circular formation is the sturdiest . We have n't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily . Highly recommended .	1
We now own two of these gates/yards . We originally purchased the yard to wrap around our stone wall/fireplace . The wall was too `` freeform '' to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding , so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we 'd pretty well babyproof the whole living room . Currently we are using one gate to block off the bottom of the stairs and one at the top ( we 're in a rental home and can not bolt the sturdier ones to the wall ) . We use them as a deterant and NOT as a `` babysitter . '' Our daughter is always supervised , but it 's nice to have a `` split second accident preventer . '' In other words , it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it , by which time we would have caught her red-handed . Our first gate made it through a cross-country move with `` Break and Dent Van Lines '' with no issues ... if only all our items would have been so durable . Anyway , well worth the cost for a variety of uses !	1
We bought 3 sets ... family is buying them also . Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space , our twins love being and playing in it	1
This is a stay-at-home mom 's lifesaver ! As my little boy ( now 9 months ) has become moremobile , this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard , in the children 's playroom.He never gets tired of it . He can play with his toys , while I check my email , do the laundry and watch him at the same time . He loves it ! He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays . It 's great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in . It never hurts to have extra , in case one breaks . Great product ! We have great fun playing in it together !	1
We got the superyard ( or , as I call it , the & quot ; Steel Cage Death Match & quot ; yard ) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working . This is our experience . Your mileage may vary.Plus side : The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable . In it 's four or five sided form , it 's very stable , even against toddler rage ! ( & quot ; Attica , Attica ! & quot ; ) The sides can be taken apart , to make smaller areas.Minus side : the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff , and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up . So far it 's not too much of a problem . The whole system is pretty heavy , and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you . Also , it 's pretty clunky and large , so once it 's up , we keep it up . The major downside is the price . Ack .	1
I got this from a friend whose son had outgrown it . It has been wonderful . We use it both indoors and out . Outdoors it 's good for keeping and busy infant or toddler in one place so you can do yard work or relax without having to chase them around . It is especially handy in the backyard since we have a pool . I just put a few toys inside it with my son and he 's happy for a while . We do n't have a playpen so we use this inside as well when we need to make sure he stays out of harms way for a few minutes . We even use it for the dog when she sleeps inside at night because otherwise she chews on everything in the house while we 're sleeping . It folds easily and stores great under the bed .	1
We love this thing . I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to & quot ; unravel & quot ; but it was n't bad at all . I expect a new product not to just pop right into position , but it formed a hexagon rather easily . That 's the key -- -no assembly required ! My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back , she occasionally bonks her head on the & quot ; wall & quot ; of the pen . She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the & quot ; hinge joint & quot ; part of the pen that concerned me , but it would n't be very effective if it was n't sturdy . The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them . To remedy it as best as I could , I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners . I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house . She does n't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us . And we can keep an eye her as well . It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys . We bought a second one for upstairs and we 're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions .	1
I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua . It 's great in the sense that it contains him very well . He is very active and likes to jump very high , but he can not jump over the gate . He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move . The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over . It contains his crate , wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in . I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs . Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids . One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in . But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside ca n't get out .	1
It did exactly what I purchased it for . My baby never actually stayed in the enclosed area ( absolutely hated it ! ) but I was able to use it for other purposes which was great , such as enclosing the fireplace . The floor stickers , or whatever they 're called , to keep it in place left sticky residue on my hardwood floors which took some effort to remove though .	1
I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough . Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere , but we use it to gate off the `` band area '' of the basement . It does n't need to be connected to itself to function well . If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape , it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism . My husband has no problem with it at all . It 's very versatile , and I recommend it .	1
My son is getting around pretty good now and I wanted to be able to contain him a little . I put this with the extension kit around his Laugh and Learning Home by Fisher Price and he is able to play while I get a few chores done . It is open enough that he does not feel too confined and seems quite content to play in it for a while . A good purchase that can be used in multiple ways .	1
It holds position nicely . I feel comfortable that my 10 month old isnt going to tip the whole thing over due to it being substantial in weight.But when it comes down to it , I dont know if I would buy it again for more than 35 $ .	1
Welcome to the toddling/scootching/crawling years , where you ca n't ever get a break unless you have some way of keeping junior from getting away.The SuperYard is a foldable rigid-plastic fencing system for creating what we called back in the day a play pen . It 's designed to be reconfigurable for a given area , so that the enclosure can be made to fit odd spaces . It works for indoor and outdoor areas , and the optional extensions can be used to make rather large enclosures quite easily.We bought this as a replacement for the Pack-N-Play type portable play yard . Our son , at 10 months or so , had clearly outgrown this smaller type yard , and was quite unhappy at the limiting horizons of its opaque blue walls . The SuperYard has been a very good , albeit not completely perfect , solution for providing some portable play space that requires somewhat lighter supervision than a freeplay in an open room . Our son 's now closing in on 14 months and this has been useful for that purpose.It 's not 100 % easy to set up and reconfigure , and there 's a reason for that . The extra difficulty with piecing the `` end '' sections together means it 's nearly impossible for a tot to open or close this by their lonesomes . It takes some strength and adult wile to open the sections and bend the connectors at various angles to thus reconfigure the overall shape . There 's a slight trick to negotiating the opening mechanism in a panel , but once you `` get it '' , it 's easy enough . I suspect many of the comments about difficulty of set-up were written by those who had just set the thing up for the first time or who do n't move it around a lot and who have forgotten `` the trick '' . We 're on our fourth month of using ours , and it 's very easy now to open and close the corral , as we call it ( perhaps in part because we do it frequently ) .One of the big advantages of this type of arrangement is the shape of the enclosure can be changed . I think some of the comments about this being unstable are either from those who are unrealistically expecting a completely rigid structure , or those who may have assembled it in a way that the shape is unstable . If you put a 120 degree angle at each of `` joints '' and form at least a hexagon ( with the basic model ) or an octagon ( with the model plus one extension ) , you get an incredibly stable structure . I can demonstrate this by putting my full 200+ lb weight on the edge when it 's open , in which case there 's considerable flex , versus when it 's closed in an octagon shape , in which case it barely gives and I can practically do a push-up on it.Of course the whole thing can slide -- it 's made out of plastic and it 's not attached to anything ! Your little bruiser may be able to push it around a bit , but your average baby is n't going to get very far . If the structure is set up in a way that it 's got some sort of limiter ( a wall , for instance ) keeping it from moving too far , this really ought not be a problem . The idea is for creating a play yard you can set up easily an in a variety of places , and anything that 's fixed permanently is not going to serve that purpose . That 's your trade-off with this type of yard versus a smaller crib or similar yard.The expectation for this should be as a semi-temporary safe play area . I would recommend it for creating a `` safe '' play zone in an otherwise unsafe area -- an unchild-proofed room or outside ( where we use it from time to time ) . It is not to create an undersupervised area , except perhaps for a quick deposit of your tot while you go to the bathroom or answer the door , etcetera . We use this in the room that has our computer -- despite our attempts to childproof this area , it 's pretty impossible given the requirements of computer cabling . The SuperYard has at least made a part of this room safe enough.As for being able to climb over it -- there may be some prodigious children who can scale this using the lattice work as foot-rests , but I strongly suspect they can scale other things as well . Our little guy can pull up on the frame , and it occasionally slips a few inches , but I do n't know a lot of toddlers coordinated enough to know how to climb a fence AND who have small enough feet to use the rather small lattice openings . ( If you want to be extra sure , just put the kid in some shoes , which will make it impossible to use his toes to grab the lattice holes . ) I do recommend getting at least one extension , as the extra two panels nearly double the available surface area options , and if you do n't need them you can literally just fold them over without having to detach them.The portability has been excellent -- once you get the knack of how much pressure you need to collapse the sections , it folds up like an accordion , and there 's a carrying strap that doubles as a restraining strap to keep the folds together while under transport . Folded up , it takes up about as much space as the smaller Pack N Play but at about half the weight.Where this has been less than ideal has more to do with our kid than the product . He does n't like being left alone in it , but neither does he like being left alone in any of his other confinements ( e.g . crib ) . The fact that he can see out the SuperYard is a big help ; with the old Graco PackNPlay , the opaque sides meant he could n't see a parent even if quite close . So while he objects to being set down alone , a little distraction with a forgotten toy and the reassurance of being able to see the parent through the `` wall '' usually suffices to make us both happy .	1
This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked . I was working from home , and most days I was upstairs and on the computer . Once she could crawl , she started crawling toward everything dangerous . The litter box , the stairs , plugs , you name it , she found a way to get to it . I bought this and it was great ! We even purchased the extension kit , so she basically had the whole room , yet was contained . My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never & quot ; lonely & quot ; .I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months . My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety , yet not have her confined to a play pen !	1
We bought this play yard when our son was 2 months old and we LOVE it ! It keeps his toys , books , blankets , etc . in a clean space away from our curious doggies . It 's a great , roomy size and not too hard to put together or take down . It can be configured into different shapes and easily moved .	1
We bought this instead of the Playzone because it was cheaper . We bought the Superyard XT to use as a playpen area for our son . The Superyard is fantastic when it comes to size and it very sturdy if you mount it to the wall or bolt it into the floors but we prefer not to put holes all over the walls or into our concrete slab . So we did not get to enjoy the gates fullest potential.The Good:1 . Very tall2 . Has options available to make it sturdy and permanent in placement.3 . Able to see though the gates , great for both parent and child.4 . Easy to fold up ( with some elbow grease ) 5 . Very Very easy to store away.6 . White color , very nice can match just about anything.7 . Somewhat easy to wash ( not like the plastic walls on the Playzone - you just wipe clean ) , we had to take the gate into the yard and rinse it off with the water hose.8 . If it is not bolted into the walls it is quick and easy to take down for more space verses other products such as the Playzone are pretty permantent once in place ( they are just too big and bulky ) All in all I gave the Superyard XT 4 stars because it has options to make it as sturdy as the more expensive ones out there , but the more expensive ones do not require screws , or holes to your home to complete the job . If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way . If you are buying to use as a Playyard , then buy the Playzone if you have an extra fifty bucks .	1
I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl . It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby . As she grew ( and the number of toys as well ) , I purchased an extension to make the area bigger . It was great for both indoor and outdoor use . We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover . Now that winter is here and she is running about , we are using it to block our wood ( pellet ) stove to prevent any accidents . We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year . Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up . I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily . Well worth it for it 's versatility .	1
I began using this when my first daughter began to crawl . I liked that it was bigger than any playpen or playyard and could accommodate my growing daughter as well as her toys . It is easy to put together and I purchased an additional section to make it even larger . We have used it at home , at the beach , in the yard and as a barrier for both the Christmas tree and pellet ( wood ) stove to keep our little ones safe .	1
This gate is an indispensable thing in our household . We have twins and it seems to keep our kiddos as well as all their stuff in one place . They ca n't stay in here for too long , but it 's great for when we need to cook and ca n't have them by our side . This is the best gate ! !	1
My baby seems to really like this cube . He loves watching the flashing lights and hearing the music . The reason I did not give it five stars is because the instruments do all sound very similar and a bit electronic sounding , but other than that not that annoying of electronic toy .	1
I wish there was a volume adjuster because it is a little louder than I imagined and that the music would last a little longer .	1
We bought this when our baby was sitting with support and initially she was into the soft edges to chew on and later on she found interest in hitting the cube for playing music . It 's been many months since we bought this and baby is still interested in it . This is probably the only toy she reaches for over and over , and she never seems to get tired of it . Worth the $ $ .	1
Our 11 month old really loves this toy , he loves swatting the sides to make the music turn off/on . Its very sturdy and well made , but the one we received stopped working for no apparent reason after about 2 weeks . Amazon quickly replaced it and so far all is well with the second toy , though we 've only had it a few days .	1
Both of my twins LOVE this toy ! I really like how you can add/subtract the different instruments as the song plays . I did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like . I think it 's a good way to start to introduce them to music .	1
My daughter is n't quite a year old , and she can control this toy . It 's easy to press the buttons , and she loves the music . I think this is a great buy !	1
I did n't buy this for my son because some reviews said the sounds were n't true to the instrument . I 'm a very musical person , so I 'm picky about these things . I am SO GLAD someone bought this for my son.My son is 5 months old . He is entertained by this toy ( so am I ) . He does n't get the concept of the different instruments , and adding/subtracting the instruments . But , he does press the buttons himself . The lights just add to the experience.I do n't think the sounds are that far off . It 's a baby toy remember . I like the choices of instruments - violin , piano , harp , flute & French horn - partly because I play three of those.It cycles through 8 songs ( not all Mozart as implied by the name ) . Unfortunately , it will only cycle through the songs by pressing the Orchestra button multiple times . It would be nice to cycle through them only using one instrument .	1
My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months . She did n't quite get it at first since she was so young , but through the months she 's enjoyed pushing the buttons , watching the lights go on and off , hearing the music , and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things . My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly , but I guess that comes with every music making toy ! I like that it 's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments ( mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers ) as well as the simplicity of the toy . Hopefully she 'll enjoy it for a few more months !	1
great item , my baby loves the music , i love it as well pressing all the buttons , i would def . recommend this item .	1
It 's a bit on the loud side , yes , but my baby loves this toy . She smacks it , turns it around , bites the corners . It has kept her entertained for several minutes at a time , which is a lot for my very squirmy , active little one . Very happy with it !	1
Seriously , we have a top 5 list of must bring/have with us when we go anywhere , and this is one . My MIL freaked out when it ran out of batteries . It 's that good . I 'm not even sure why , but the baby becomes obsessed with the different instruments and the sounds . And it plays a lot of tunes-excellent purchase .	1
I bought this for my 4-month old son . He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube , he loved it . The best sounds he liked were the flute , piano and the Orchestra . The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby 's musical skills.Cons : The battery did n't last long . We used it for 30 days , for about 10 min each day and the battery died down !	1
My 6 month old LOVES this toy ! I was thrilled when he went for it immediately in his playpen and was tap , tap , tapping the buttons - he knew the music should come from this tapping , but I had turned it off ! I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents . But the music is really pleasant , unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic , and I think that would be my only complaint . I 'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it 's very electronic.However , the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities . This is a great way to make music fun for kids and I think all would enjoy this toy .	1
Bought this as a gift because we love the one we own ! By far the least annoying music making baby toy . We received a used one as gift when my daughter was 9 months and it has held up great over the years . Both of my kids love it too .	1
My 10 month old daughter loves this toy and we also like the music it plays . The music is soothing and not annoying like many other toys . Also , it is a great size to travel with for road trips . Definitely a toy we recommend . We have also given it as a gift and the one year old loves it .	1
We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old . At first , he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music . But as he got older , he learned how to play with it more . He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones . He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear . I love that he loves this toy !	1
This toy is great . Not annoying and definitely a plus that there is an on/off switch . My 7 month old figured it out pretty quickly and loves to bang , roll and chew on the thing . She even gets excited when the music picks up and wiggles around . Well worth the money .	1
We like this toy . The corners are very soft and it is very easy for a baby to turn on and off . He loves moving it around the room . A few of the sounds could be improved . But I would buy this for a friend .	1
My 9 month old loves this musical cube . It has a nice selection of music . It does not have a volume switch so it can be rather loud . Overall , I 'd recommend it for your little one .	1
Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out . Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding .	1
This is just the biggest hit with the grandchildren and their parents probably thanks to Mozart . The children love it and it is so simple and unobtrusive . The music is pleasant . The on and off switch is easy . It stack and stores !	1
I love this toy , and so does my 13 month old son . He got it for his birthday , and he plays with it every day . So far , we have had no trouble with it , and the batteries have n't even needed to be changed yet ! At first , he would just roll it to the orchestra side and hit that until it started playing . Then he learned that if he hit it again , the song would change . So now he plays one song after another . Lately , he has also started experimenting with the different instruments , both alone and together . He plays with it for hours . I do n't get tired of hearing it either , because there are several different songs , and the sound quality is not irritating . It 's electronic , but much more pleasant than many of his other music toys . Also , the tones of the instruments fluctuate a little bit , which makes it sound more like real instruments than electronic tones.Long story short , this has stood up to ALOT of play already , and we like it just as much now as we did when we first got it .	1
I got this for my granddaughter 's first birthday and we both love it ! We both keep pushing the instruments to hear more music . I see why it is one of the most popular infant and toddler toys . Grandmas loves to play with it too !	1
I do n't know what the `` old '' magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned , and yes it 's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds . I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound . I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as far as the sound . I 'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it does n't bother me that the sounds are n't completely authentic . ( I 'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one , the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion . ) I love that you can hear each instrument 's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together . My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys , and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he 's doing to start another song then go back to playing . As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts , they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy , although after several months of play the 'harp ' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason .	1
Buy it ! Buttons are nice and soft enough that baby can activate them . She carries this around everywhere . Just watch the toes as it is a bit heavy .	1
I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus , she is not that into it , I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years . I was going to buy it on Amazon , happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $ 20 .	1
My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas , which was too early . She was n't strong enough to push the button herself , so she did n't really like it . Around 8 months or so , she started liking it . The more she figures out how it works , the more the likes it . At 11 months , she plays with it all the time . Now she 's strong enough to lift it , so she hands it to us to play .	1
Hands-down one of the best purchases we made . My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2 . The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect , and then how to combine melodies . A really fantastic gift .	1
I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music . A piece of advice : it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song . Before I figured this out , the same song was driving me crazy ! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button . It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower .	1
My 9 month old son LOVES this toy ! It 's not too loud and lights up with pretty colors . He goes back to it time and time again but never gets tired of it . I highly recommend it !	1
The buttons are easy for the baby to find and the music is n't super annoying for the parents . Definitely a good toy .	1
The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy . It 's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with . He has always loved music from a young age . He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around . It also can take lots of abuse . My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well . Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers .	1
My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy . It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds , so even very young , uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise . As she gets older , she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors . For now , though , she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy . It is actually very difficult ( and maybe impossible ) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy , and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches . Eventually , we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy , where they still are ( and we hope they stay there ) . There seems to be no way to remove them entirely .	1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube.Nice music , interesting concept ( one instrument per side ) . Baby ( 7 months old ) loves it . Good quality .	1
This is a great transitional toy . We 've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant , he liked to look at the lights and colors . At 18 months , he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons . I do n't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet , so once he figures that out , we 'll have many more months of fun with the music cube . The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution , if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs . : ) We love the music cube - highly recommend it !	1
This toy inspires me . I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound . Now he gets the full functionality of the toy . It lasts for years , offering various entertainments to various ages of kids . Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones , so we love this . Warning , it 's very heavy . Do n't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma 's ( we learned this lesson ) . The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety . We 're never giving away this adorable musical toy .	1
My husband , son and I all LOVE this toy . My niece had it before , so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already . I love that he ( 1 year old ) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him . He loves that it all lights up ( when the buttons on any side are pressed ) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes ( pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song ) . An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an `` off '' switch . : ) SO key , even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys ... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great , fun toy . : )	1
The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend 's daughter when she was an infant . From a very early age , we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music , obviously recognizing changes . We could see the pleasure on her face . As time went on , she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor . She loved to play with some more than others . However , she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older , the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated . This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music ! She is beginning to talk now , and I feel certain that her first words will be , `` GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW ! ! `` Love it !	1
My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him . While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic , the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece .	1
This item has been a life saver for me ! Not only does my child love it but it 's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him ( he apparently HATES putting sweaters on ) . I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child 's head . My child loves it because it 's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music . The music is good and there are a lot of different choices .	1
My son loves to dance to music now . He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit . He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old .	1
Our 8 month old loves to & # 34 ; bang & # 34 ; things so this is perfect . He moves it around , bangs on it and lights it up with music . Great buy !	1
My niece absolutely loved this product and its not at all annoying ! She loves playing with the lights and mom and dad do n't have to listen to annoying music !	1
Love , love , love this cube . My 8 month young daughter loves it too . It never gets old and it 's so much fun to hit all the different instruments , then listen to them all play in sync . Great buy ! !	1
My daughter got this when she was 3 months old and it was one of her favorite toys . She 'd kick her legs to turn the music on and off . At 3.5 she still loves it and she sits and plays with it along with her 9 month old brother now .	1
I must say I 'm guilty of purchasing anything that has & # 34 ; Mozart & # 34 ; in the name , since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer . But this is the best toy ever . When I bought it my baby was a newborn , so mostly I played with it . But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it . Whenever he is fussy , I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once . Best toy ever !	1
I bought it for my love , it 's very nice as the description , my girl loves that a lot . it 's a good toy .	1
This is a great musical toy . I think it 's very well made and should last a long time . It 's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new : o )	1
What a GREAT musical toy ! I highly recommend it . Our kid loves it , plays with it all of the time .	1
My 13 month old son loves playing with this . He enjoys switching up songs.2 complaints , 1 ) its pretty heavy 2 ) all the instruments sound very electronic	1
Fine toy , nice sound . Much better than most other musical toys . But I ca n't give it to my son yet as I ca n't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy . They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I have n't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested . You should n't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging . Obviously the manufacturer did n't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging . I even took out the screws that access the battery pack ( which I am quite impressed with as well ) , hoping to access where the wires are stuck . No luck . If they just used regular string , it would easily come out , but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them .	1
This is a great toy . My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends . There is one significant flaw in its design ; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud . If it were 1/2 this loud , I 'd let me daughter play with it all the time . As it is , I usually limit her to playing with it with me , so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume , I 'm giving it a 4 star review , instead of 5 . Otherwise , it is a great , great product .	1
After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying , off-key or obnoxious , we discovered this . Plays several songs by Mozart ; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing `` orchestra '' or one at a time . Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time . The instruments are clearly synthesized , but still , the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time . I have yet to be annoyed by this toy . In fact , I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly ! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it 's a little bit loud . I wish there was a volume control .	1
My little one loves this toy ( and my nephew loved his many years ago too ) . It 's easy to turn instruments on and off herself , and she loves hearing the different instruments ( and combination of instruments ) play the same tune .	1
I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept ... but she is getting there and lives to play with it , and so do I ! Not annoying but very good tones . Love it , bought one for my nephew and cousin too !	1
I bought this for my 19 month old son based upon the reviews of others . Well , the reviews were right -- this is a great toy . The music is great , the sound quality is surprisingly good , and the ability to add/remove instruments from each piece being played is very clever . In addition , it seems to be well made , with rubber bumpers on the corners . My son loves this thing , and becomes very involved when playing with it every time he uses it . Highly recommended .	1
Why ca n't manufacturers put a volume control on all toys or at least err on the side of being too quiet ? this toy is a great concept and plays great music , looks great , but is too loud . espeically when my baby is playing with it right next to their ear.Unfortunately many other toys are too loud too , so this one is probably worth recommending to friends/family . but it could be better .	1
All the grand kids loved it and do the parents . It 's a great gift for years . Durable and practice , a must .	1
My 6 month-old enjoys staring at the toy and listening to the music if I turn it on for him , so I probably enjoy this toy more than my child at the moment , but I 'm sure that will change . The problem for a young baby is that this toy is very dense , and the buttons require a significant amount of force to push . If he kicks one of the buttons , that will be enough , but he does n't really have enough force just from swatting at it ( he 'd probably have to lean onto it ) . It 's also too heavy for him to pick up.The music quality is very nice and I do n't find it to be at all annoying ( like many other electronic baby toys ) ; the flute is probably the nicest sounding of the instruments . The corners are also rubbery , so you do n't need to worry about sharp edges . I 'm still giving it 5 stars because I think it will be a toy he 'll enjoy more and more as he grows and becomes more able to interact with it on its own , but for a younger baby , you might want to look atBaby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Orchestra Musical Toy , which has a similar conceit .	1
Santa gave this to our 6 month son for Christmas . Both he and my 2 year old LOVE it . It is wonderfully sturdy , and has many music functions . My 2 yr old will announce each instrument as she adds them into the melody . My husband is a music educator , and he gives this a big thumbs up ! Thank you Santa ! Would buy again and again .	1
I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and ca n't believe how anal people are . This is a baby 's toy for $ 20 . It 's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $ 600 Bose music player , like some people are expecting.Since this is a child 's toy , I think it 's serves it 's purpose well . The music is clear . The lights flash when the music plays . I think it 's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that 's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.My daughter loves the toy . It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she 's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy was n't designed for their enjoyment . The toy was designed for children . And , in my opinion , it 's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which , in and of itself , is a blessing .	1
This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild . She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating . She has gone from just looking and listening to it , to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own . It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift .	1
Sturdy toy , fun to push all the buttons . Sings 8 diff Mozart tunes and lights up . No assembly required just open the box and turn it on .	1
I was a little skeptical at first . But this cube is a lot of fun ! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song . You can have a piano solo , and then add other instruments on top . Well built cube , should last a long time !	1
This toy keeps my 4-month old 's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me ( and if it seems loud to me would n't it seem loud to the baby as well ? ) , and I wish it were n't quite so heavy . It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up , for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she 's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out .	1
My daughter loves this toy . She 'll sit with her books and press the on the box for the pleasant tunes . My husband and I really enjoy the music . It 's ten times better than the average music played by other baby toys .	1
my son has special needs . he is blind and cognitive delays . this is n't nearly as annoying as most toys . it only gets annoying bc he bangs on it for hours on end . he loves it	1
I think a lot of kids these days have this toy . It 's quite popular . All my friends with babies have it.It 's a toy providing light entertainment.I 'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor . Trust me , for a toy it 's totally fine . You can still tell the instruments apart . You ca n't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well . It 's safe . I 'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds . I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby wo n't hurt herself.I 'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it 's nice .	1
Plays nice music that isnt to loud . Item is smaller than I expected , but that is not a bad thing as it makes it easier for little ones to hold/carry .	1
This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained . The flashing lights are very attractive . Though I have to say , the sound quality is just so-so , but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying , so that 's all that matters . I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy . My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry ...	1
This is such a great toy . I have to knock one star off for volume control , it is entirely too loud and as I can see this has been a complaint before I ca n't believe they have n't adjusted it . There is no way to put tape over any place to quiet it down due to it 's construction so we use it during loud times as opposed to & # 34 ; quiet & # 34 ; times .	1
My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter . He could n't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this . I was a little put off by the price . ( I paid a bit more than it is here ) but it was worth it ! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together ! I 'm sure as she gets older , she will really enjoy how interactive it is . Such a cool toy . And the best part ? Unlike many other toys that make noise , this one is not annoying at all ! The instruments sound so realistic that it 's enjoyable to listen to . I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future .	1
I hesitated to buy this after reading some of the reviews comparing it to the old Embryonics version . You see , I bought that version at a secondhand store back when my three-year-old was a baby . It was a great toy , but the battery compartment was hard to take off and put on without breaking it . One day we brought it to a friend 's house , and someone else 's kid somehow broke the battery cover in such a way that my attempts to fix it with super glue were futile . I went back to the secondhand store to find the other one I had seen on my initial visit , but I did n't find it . I was bummed because I had really liked it ! I came to Amazon to discover that Munchkin now made the music box , but the reviews comparing the old one to the new one kept me from buying it.A little while ago , I decided I still really missed the toy , and I now had another baby who might enjoy it . Thus I bought it because I figured we could return it if it was really that bad.I honestly think that it is better than the old one ! It has nicer colors , an improved battery compartment cover , and better synchronization of the instruments.The Embryonics version was purple and yellow and , in my opinion , kind of ugly . As you can see in the pictures , the Munchkin version is all different colors and visually appealing.The sound quality is just as good , and the batteries get used up a little more slowly in the Munchkin version . The battery compartment cover now has two screws ( rather than a screw and a tab that put stress on the cover every time you had to put it back on ) plus a pull-out box that contains the three batteries.On the Embryonics version , sometimes the instruments were out of sync . We had this problem from the start . It just seemed that one or two instruments were slightly behind the others . We 've used our Munchkin version plenty but have n't yet run into this problem.I 'm not sure why some other reviewers are knocking the sound quality ( whether or not it 's compared to the Embryonics version ) . This is n't an orchestra ; it 's a child 's toy . It introduces them to some new music plus some musical instruments they might not encounter otherwise . Do the individual instruments sound like the real thing ? Kind of . But again , it 's a child 's toy . The sound quality does tend to suffer as the batteries start to die , but that 's to be expected . It gets quieter and flatter , like the instruments are slightly out of tune.I 'm generally not a big fan of noise-making toys , especially ones that play music because the music tends to be very annoying . I do n't find the music from this box annoying ; in fact , it bothered me so little that I sought out this particular toy two years after throwing out the original , broken one.My only complaint is that I wish the box had a lower volume setting . The music can be a little loud , especially when it 's got new batteries . That would probably help retain some battery life , too.Overall , my baby loves this toy , and my 3-year-old , who loved it as a baby , still loves it . They actually play with it together , which is rare . The older one recognizes the instruments and likes to show his younger brother what they are.Oh , and if you 're like me and hesitated to buy this because it 's supposedly crappy compared to the Embryonics version , fret not and just order it . You 'll be glad you did , and if you disagree , pack it back up and return it .	1
seems simple , but both my 6 month old and 3 year old enjoy playing with this toy . the sounds are also pleasant and not as annoying as most musical kids toys .	1
My ten month old loves this toy . She is just learning to turn it over and press the different buttons to get the different sounds . It is quite heavy for her little arms though , so she does get frustrated at times . I find the music to be a little but too high-pitched for me , but it is better than many other musical toys we have had . Overall a great purchase .	1
My daughter loves it and I love it too.Its a fun fun fun musical toy ! ! ! Well built toy ! ! ! The edges are carefully covered with smooth soft plastic . awesome buy !	1
This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby , my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music does n't seem too loud to me or out of tune , perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer ? My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons , I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more . However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too . IT looks fantastic !	1
This is one of my son 's favorite toys . He 's been watching/listening to it since he was born . Now that he 's 5 months old , he 's still very interested in it . Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music ( as do I ) . This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come !	1
Got this early on but the baby appreciates it more now that she is six months . Music is more pleasant to adult ears than most other musical toys . At least I think so .	1
I purchased this toy for Christmas for my daughter who was 10 months old at the time and she loved it right away . She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it . Now at almost 16 months old , she has figured out how to play with it more , understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking . I find myself playing with this toy , as do many of my daughter 's young playmates and their parents too ! Some of her older cousins , who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play . So far , this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I 'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago , but the product I received is pretty good too . The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds & # 34 ; tinny & # 34 ; , I did n't find that to be the case at all . I 'm no music expert , but to my ears , each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me ! I 'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too . I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that 's the case , I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy . The instruments sound lovely , the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do , and most of all , this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many , many years to come !	1
My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months . He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music . It 's great for adults too because it 's classic tunes , not annoying like some of our other toys . This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that 's saying something .	1
My son has this cube ; i bought this as a gift for my sister 's son ... it is great . 6 decent songs and you can listen to individual instruments ( and they only play their parts ) or you can listen to the whole orchestra . Great for little ones that are learning `` cause and effect . ''	1
Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months . He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him . He now plays it himself ( 13 months ) . I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come . The quality of music is very good , not mechanically computerized like some toys . It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument . That is pretty neat . Baby likes it . The only problem is that there is no volume control . Batteries last a pretty long time in it . The songs are nice too , jazzy and complex enough to be interesting . It seems really tough . It has withstood some hard knocks . It has a very solid feel , which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it , but no injuries . The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery . It 's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around .	1
I bought this for my 9 mo . old daughter for christmas.I love this toy . There is an orchestra button on one side that starts a song or switches to another song . Each song is a classical music track . When a song is in play you can push the other sides of the cube to add or subtract instruments . I think this is a fantastic toy that will get toddlers thinking about music.The best part of this toy is quality of the toy . It is clear that the programmers put a lot of thought into creating it . The instruments definitely sound true to what they should be . You can very clearly tell the difference between the sound of the french horn , flute , piano , harp , and violin . Each of the instruments plays a different part of a song and each instrument is playing a part `` true '' to what the instrument does in a real orchestra . What I mean by this is that in an orchestra , a tuba does n't just sound different than a flute , they perform different musical functions . I love that this cube respects this concept . The result is that the music is worth listening to and I am always happy when my daughter plays with this toy over other toys with less-pleasing music.I highly recommend this toy .	1
I bought this when my baby was less than a year old . He loved it . While it is not the highest quality music , this is a toy that was meant for children and they seem to really enjoy using it . It is easy for their uncoordinated hands to use and interesting enough that they continue to explore it . It has bright lights and different musical instruments to select from or to blend together .	1
The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song . It 's great for your kids learning to hear different songs . It also lights up and plays very nice classic type melodies vs the standard children 's songs .	1
baby got this at 3 monhs and still loves it after a year , so many ways to play with it and the sound is really fine ! great buy , andone which travels with baby easily	1
My six month old grandchild loves this even though she is still somewhat young to fully appreciate it . This is a great toy for infants and toddlers . Here is why:1 . This cube stimulates touch , sight , and sound in a creative way . Each side of the cube has a different instrument and a different color : violin -- yellow ; harp -- pink ; french horn -- orange ; flute -- purple ; piano -- green ; orchestra -- blue.2 . When your child touches a side of the cube , it lights up and the instrument starts playing . Touch a second side , and the second instrument plays in sync with the first one ( which is still playing ) , etc . If you want to hear everything at once , just hit the orchestra button.3 . There are no sharp corners . Instead each corner is rounded and has yellow , purple , green and red colors.4 . There is an easy on/off switch to conserve battery power when the cube is not in use.5 . As the name indicates , the cube plays music from Mozart . I have read the most negative review complaining about the sound and that this cube is not as good as the original Embryonics cube . While I have not heard that cube , I have played Mozart pieces on the piano and also have CDs of various of his works , so I am familiar with his music . For a toddler the quality of the music on this cube is just fine , so do n't let that negative review discourage you from buying this product.Bottom line : This is a well made quality toy.Update May 20 , 2012 : My now 16 month old granddaughter still loves to play with this .	1
I really like this magic cube . Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot . The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great . We enjoy it .	1
I bought this magic cube about 2-3 months ago and at that time my baby was n't really able to play with it . But now he 's 6 months and he plays with the cube longer and longer . This is one of my baby 's favorite toys now !	1
Our little one loves this toy and plays with it over and over again , starting at 4 months and still now ( 6.5 months ) . I 'm sure he does n't grasp the concept of it yet , but the lights and music hold his interest .	1
I only wish it had the real drum-snare sounds also added to it . This is a good buy . Recommend buying	1
My five month old loves this product . She uses it to support herself while sitting up and explores the buttons with complete concentration . Considering most toys only hold her interest for 5-10 minutes , the 15-20 she gets out of this speaks for itself . The sounds of the instruments is artificial and tinny , but not so much so that I ca n't stand to hear it . My only complaint is that it is quite loud , I wish it came with the ability to adjust the volume . Recommended .	1
I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product . This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old . The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and , as he grew , he played with it more and more . I keep it in his playpen and it 's easily his favorite toy ( besides his exersaucer and jumperoo ) . It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it 's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners ( so , if baby falls on it , no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on ) .I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there . And , with the click of the `` Orchestra '' side , the song changes.So glad I bought this ! Update 6/10 : My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube !	1
Based on the myriad of reviews here , I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old . To be honest , they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months . At that point , they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it . All of a sudden , they took great interest in it . It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted . They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have `` figured '' it out , the toy is a little less appealing . I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint , and it is a minor one , is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected . While not bad , it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys .	1
I bought this for our grandson for his 1st birthday . He loves music and he loves his magic cube . It is easy for him to push and he figured out that each side makes a different sound really quick . It is very sturdy and the music quality is good for a toy . I would recommend it .	1
My 8 month old is n't too impressed with it . It is nice and well made but just not for my kiddo.Personally I like the different instruments that play the songs . Hopefully when he gets older he will appreciate it more .	1
My kids enjoy this toy , however it 's a little heavy and not easy to turn because the corners are mad of rubber and are a bit sticky on our wooden floor . I do enjoy that the music is Mozart .	1
bought this as a replacement for my son 's first potty seat , this one is much better . not as padded , which means it wo n't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria . my son 's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part , this one does n't at all , it 's perfect	1
I really like this potty seat , but it does n't quite fit well on our elongated toilet . It works well enough , and the colors are n't as bright as they appear in photo nor is the design exactly the same . It 's o.k . for the price . My daughter really wanted a red potty seat , but if I could do it again I would buy her a different brand .	1
Seat comes off the plastic handle-and-holder . Colors are nice and seat is soft and easy to clean . It is light and my 18-month-old can lift and place it ( albeit not always with the right fit ) on the toilet seat . Guard is useless in my mind since my LO ca n't climb over it , but otherwise a steal and saved me the trouble of getting a potty .	1
We bought this potty seat to leave at her grandma 's house , and she loves it . She wouldnt go potty on the training potty for the longest time and as soon as we put this one on the big potty , she went # 1 & # 2 and is well on her way to being potty trained . I would put 6 stars if i could !	1
It fits the toilet seat very well . It does n't slide from side to side . Easy to use , it 's light . Made in USA .	1
This does fit on an elongated toilet seat , but it slides around . It would n't dump my kid in or anything , but the slipping might startle a child . I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers . I did not bother with the splash guard , I just threw it out . It looked flimsy and unnecessary . My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme . I 'm not so fond of the vinyl seat , as my daughter 's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up . But , it 's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in .	1
I transitioned my daughter from the potty to the regular toilet . I wanted something that would draw her attention to make her want to sit on it and this seat did it . Day1 I thought she would be scared but she said & # 34 ; Dora & # 34 ; ! And sat on it with no fight . Great seat !	1
We have 3 of these ( 1st was a gift ; subsequent others purchased from Amazon after successful use ) . It is comfy padding ( I presume comfy - the padding is quite thick and has some squish to it ) . The handles are great for keeping my daughter 's hands busy instead of touching other things . While it does slide around on some larger toilets , I 'd say it fits well to about 75 % of toilets we 've used it on .	1
I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live . They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there . I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat .	1
I bought this seat because I ( bad mommy ) forgot my 2 year old daughter 's potty in a hotel while we were on vacation . She absolutely loves this potty seat ! She loves that she can take it off and put it on another toilet if need be . She uses her little step stool to get up on the big potty and she feels like a big girl . The fact that is Dora is a huge bonus for her . She uses this every day .	1
Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick . It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora .	1
I have a boy , so the little guard cup was useful until my son learned to pull it out . After sitting on the toilets for chunks of time ( waiting : ) he got bored so he would pull this out & # 8212 ; not very helpful ! I wish it was permanently attached to the seat . Other than that it 's fantastic , soft , stable , easy to sit on and clean .	1
I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive . The seat is cushioned so it 's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats . It 's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go . For boys , it does come with a splash guard . The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding . It stays in place most of the time , but it is easy to misplace . I would have preferred it to be permanently attached , but aside from that I am happy with this purchase .	1
Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house . Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty . He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool ( Thomas the Train logo on step stool ) .	1
What can I say about a potty seat . It fits , his butt fits it , he likes the characters on it , it 's easy to clean . Buy it .	1
My daughter is having some hard time with potty training , especially number 2 . The doctor recommended that she sits twice a day for ten minutes in a row in the potty , and we decided to buy this toilet seat.Well , two weeks using it and we are finally making progress ! ! She LOVES her Dora , super pink , flowery potty , so sitting on it is a delight . We were using the potty before , but I thought if we were going to train her for good , it was better to train her in the toilet . And it is very difficult without a toilet seat , because she is not stable.The handles are great , toddlers use them all the time . And the size is just right . Very sturdy and easy to clean ( you can separate the cushion from the plastic , to clean separately ) . My toilet is not exactly the same shape ( the potty seat is somewhat rounder ) , but it is sturdy enough so it is not a problem.We love it and I highly recommend it . There are other designs for boys as well , but the pink Dora one is great for girls this age .	1
I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield , which many do n't . I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl . It says it has one and the picture shows it . However , the actual product does not have one . I opened the package , thinking it might be inside the wrapping , but no , it was n't . Now , I 'm out $ 15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later : I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars . After I wrote the above review , amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund , even if I wanted to keep the item . I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer . Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better . I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it . Thank you , amazon .	1
This is colorful , soft , and makes lots of fun sounds babies love . I would recommend it to anyone for their baby .	1
I know the dimensions are listed , but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is . Because it is not like a big stuffed animal ( long and thin ) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold . He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it . He 's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another ... it is still big for him . So I can see how for the next few months , he 'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it . my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play .	1
This little worm has been great for my little one . She loves that that head and tail rattle while she can squeeze the red and blue to get crinkle noises . The squeakers are two different pitches which is also fun . I just washed mine for the first time and aired it dry . Still works great . We are very happy with our purchase	1
My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars . On amazon the price is right as well .	1
We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I 'm not sure where the & # 34 ; crinkle & # 34 ; part comes from because our product must be defective . There is n't any crinkle but we can live without .	1
This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing 'N Lock . This gate is so easy to install . The only problem was we have baseboards and could n't use the template . SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked . We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it . I will not fix it now since I 'm sure I 'll have more to fix later . I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position . Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat . This makes it so secure . I do n't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out , I 'm sure if it was installed WRONG . Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even , level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out ! I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times . You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there 's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates , ouch . Will remember not to do that !	1
We purchased this gate almost 2 years ago when my daughter started crawling . She 's now 2 1/2 years old . I 've been meaning to write a review on this gate since it is one of the best gates for the stairs . We have mounted it at the top of the stair . My husband used small pieces of 2x4 's for extra security to mount it on the side of the stairs that has plaster ( as opposed to a wooden post ) . This gate is very strong and is holding up very well ( minus the fingerprints : ) . A few times , I have caught my daughter standing at it shaking it or trying to stand on it , which I make her stop . Fortunately , there are no vertical bars , just horizontal , so climbing it would be a little difficult . I 'd done quite a bit of research on baby gates before purchasing this one at Babies R Us , but in trying to save a few dollars , I first went to Wal-Mart and bought a metal top-of-the-stairs gate , but I decided to take it back since it had a raised `` platform '' ( for lack of a better word ) piece at the bottom . I think that platform was meant for extra sturdiness , but I saw it as an accident waiting to happen . I returned that gate before we even installed it . This gate does n't have that `` platform '' and it is still very sturdy . Another nice feature about this is that you can just slip the gate out of its brackets to remove it if you are having a party or have to run up and down the stairs without needing to swing the gate out of your way . And when you are ready to put it back , just line the gate up with the brackets and slide it in place . Really nice feature for us when we were moving our daughter 's furniture from one room to the other and downstairs , we did n't have the gate in our way since we removed the swing arm . Overall , we are very pleased and would buy this gate again if we had to .	1
This gate could have easily been 5 stars , but there are a few points that need mention , where the gate needs some improvement . If 'Evenflo ' addresses these , this gate will easily merit a top score . Let me start with the positives . The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood . It works well and looks great , IF the install goes well , and as EXACTLY specified ( included paper template is great ) . The mechanical 'lock latch ' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it 'click into place ' , which gives one peace of mind . Of course , one hopes that 'Evenflo ' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not 'easily defeated ' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for ( 6 months to 2 years ) ! Thankfully , it does seem like it is up to the task . I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into , thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate . Way to go 'Evenflo ' ! The negatives about the gate are as follows . In many typical installations , there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle . It did in my case , even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor , as specified in the assembly directions . Thus , I was n't able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw . I had to thus cut ( with a hacksaw ) that portion of the latch receptacle , and 'modify ' it for my installation . I then was only able to use 1 screw ( although a larger and longer one than provided ) , instead of 2 , to install the bottom latch receptacle . Thankfully , even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood . 'Evenflo ' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor . Besides , MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding , and mine was only 1/1/2 '' high , hardly anything large . Lastly , the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top , and which on the bottom . They are NOT the same dimensions , as one is thicker than the other ( top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one ) . Of course , the aforementioned 'latch receptacle ' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation , especially if you do n't have floor baseboard molding . In summation , this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT , and a good value . PLEASE , just make sure you do install it correctly ( as per the instructions ) , and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised . These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision , and never as a replacement for .	1
My 18 month old can not break this no matter how hard she tries . And she has broken pretty much everything else that she can get her hands on . It was very easy to install . I drilled mine to the door posts because I did n't want to take any chances with my little one . My 7 year old niece could n't figure out how to open this gate , much less the baby . Peace of mind without breaking the bank is what this provides you .	1
We have this gate at the entry to the hallway , which is at an angle . It keeps our 100 lb dog out of the cat litter , and it will keep our 6 mo old boy out , too , once he can crawl and walk . It was easy to install , and it serves it 's purpose perfectly !	1
We have two of these gates and we could n't be more pleased with them . They took a little time to install ( it was a snap the second time around ) , and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get . We do n't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps . We know it 's not going anywhere . The gate is so simple to open and close . A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though . The gate 's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift . We 've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite .	1
I have four different gates in my house , and this , by far , is the most secure and stable . Therefore , it 's at the top of my stairs ... the most important place . I feel like I could even sit on that gate , and it 's no going to budge.When we have guests over , they have trouble opening it , because you have to squeeze really hard , but I like that I have to squeeze really hard ... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day .	1
I actually love having this gate at the BOTTOM of our stairs ! My 15 month old daughter rarely climbs the stairs now , but we often have other children over that do . With hard tile at the bottom of the stairs , a tumble would be bad . I wanted a gate at the bottom of the stairs , but not an eyesore that was in the way all the time when not in use.We tried the soft and wide gate and another pressure-mounted gate , but those are a pain ... it takes a lot of time to get them in place securely ( kids are rough and can knock or pull them down easily ) and then if you want to go up the stairs once you have it in place , you have to climb over it all the time ! Not practical ... What I love about this gate is that it slides right off of the hinges and stores away in the closet when not in use ! The wall-mounted parts are very small and hardly noticeable when the gate is stored away . Then , when I need the gate , it takes less than a minute to get it out and slide it back into place.This gate is a life-saver for play group days ! I highly recommend this gate .	1
We love this gate ! We purchased two , one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs . Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1 . You can take the gate part off when not needed , yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2 . Even 5 year olds still can not open it . All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3 . You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4 . It 's so cheap ! These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate . Give it a try .	1
We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual . I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase . It works great ! I love that it slides to the side as well as opens . Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount . No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe ! The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses .	1
Our house is a front to back split . We have a lot of stairs . 5 openings to stairs ! These gates have been great for my sanity . At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs . I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day ! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby . Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls . I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it . These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier . I like that they slide back and forth ; it 's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we did n't have to drill into the post of our railing . I highly recommend this gate .	1
I bought this set for my almost 3-year old son . He likes them okay , I 'm thinking we 'll get more play out of them later . The mat is pretty small , but cute ( it 's just a plastic sheet ) , and the assortment of dinosaurs is adequate . I like having a storage container for the set so I do n't step on dinosaurs !	1
I bought these for my 2 yr old for Easter , and he loves this set ! It 's a great deal and comes with a ton of dinosaurs ( and love that the name of the dinosaur is printed on the belly ! ) . The & # 34 ; mat & # 34 ; that it comes with is a cheesy piece of plastic and not to scale , and we rarely use it , but a great value just for all the dinos and the storage bin .	1
Round about December 22nd , my three year old daughter started telling everyone she was asking Santa for a dinosaur for Christmas . This was a surprise because A- she 's the most feminine child ever , and B- I had long since finished my Christmas shopping and was n't planning on buying another thing . However , I did n't want her to lose faith in Santa and ended up searching Amazon to see what I could come up with . This toy got my attention because it was a whole host of dinosaurs with a mat for them to & # 34 ; play & # 34 ; on . My daughter loved it ! For weeks she would get it out on a daily basis to arrange the dinosaurs on their & # 34 ; terrain. & # 34 ; From a girl 's perspective , it 's really cute in that there are small versions of the big dinosaurs included , so kids can group & # 34 ; mommy & # 34 ; dinosaurs with & # 34 ; baby & # 34 ; dinosaurs . She does n't get it out quite as often now that it 's been a few months , but when she does she 's every bit as delighted . And the dinosaurs are such high quality , I know my ten month old son will be enjoying it in no time .	1
So the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it 's own organizational container is very pleasing . The bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of . I use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play . These are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that . They are made of hard durable plastic . I think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones . Overall , I would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination . I only give them 4 stars because they are slightly expensive .	1
Purchased for our 2 year old grandson and he loves the dinosaurs . He does n't have much use for the plastic play mat or the rocks , but plays a lot with the dinos and trees !	1
My son loves to play `` dino world '' just about every day ! ! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things . We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play . The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day . But that 's no reason to not buy this.Like others , we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it .	1
Comes with 20 dinosaurs , 12 small rocks , a large volcano , a medium sized volcano , 6 trees , and a play mat . This set is great . I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks , but oh well . It is still great . My three and a half year old loves playing with this set . The play mat is actually pretty cheap , but my son does n't seem to care . It is made of really thin plastic and does n't stay open all the way since it has been folded . Once you put all the dinosaurs on it , though , it stays down just fine . All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together . Just for size reference , the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall , and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set . I 'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs . I was worried that they were going to be kind of small , but they are a perfect size .	1
As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set , since I had it at the top of the closet . He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day . He had a few more , big and small ones that he just added to this set , so it is pretty amazing what he does when he 's playing with all of them . The quality of the mat is awful , but you really do n't need the mat for this set .	1
My daughter is now 7 months old and loves this . She started going in it about 3-4 months . She is all over the house , and pushing the buttons . I would reccomend this to everyone with young children . This is a lifesaver for me , I put her in it when I hop in the shower in the mornings and she stays in the bathroom rolling around in it , or just sitting there playing with all the buttons.. I love this walker ! ! ! !	1
No complaints about this one . Baby loves it . We love it !	1
My son has used this walker sense he was 4 months old . We love it . Yes it is a little loud , but we taped some of thoughse cotton wipes from the hospital over the speaker and now it is perfect .	1
My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy , but gets frustrated that she is `` trapped '' and ca n't roll easily on carpet .	1
as soon as my son was able to sit up this was his favorite thing to be in . he could spend HOURS in this . i could give him snacks by removing the activity piece and he could run around the entire house snacking.there are rubber stoppers on the bottom of this so that if you have stairs they cant go down them even if they tried . this was great for when he was outside with it . we have a concrete steps walkway and he couldnt go down it and hurt himself , something i was not expecting but very useful ! my son learned to walk @ 1 so this did not delay him developely . also when he used this in the house he couldnt get into a lot of trouble with it ( like touching outlets , opening cupboards ) because he could n't reach . this never frustrated him and i could get a lot done because i didnt have to watch him like a hawk.my son played with this till he was a little over 2 so we got a TON of miles out of it . he still found it fun at such an older age because he would get a running start in it , then lift his legs for fast back and fourth travel around the house . GREAT GREAT BUY ! i dont know what i wouldve done without it !	1
My daughter is 12 months today . We have had this walker for 2-3 months . She still loves it . She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean . OF COURSE , I would n't leave her alone in it . She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb . I do n't think she could ever climb out of it , but I 'm not going to chance it.We have n't had any problems with it ... safety or otherwise ... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews . The main reason I bought this one is , reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn . This one is very easy to turn . My girl spins in circles , even on the carpet and on our wood deck ! Yes , it is bulky , but have you seen a walker that 's not ? They have to be so that they ca n't be tipped over ! The only problem I have with it is ... there is not a volume switch . It is not too loud , but when you 've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy !	1
I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully . The wheels move great . Very loose . If you get one and the wheels are tight , call Graco and have them replace it . It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch . It takes 3 `` AA '' batteries . It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo . old son loves it . I love it . When I go to the gym , I throw it in the back of the truck . Then just take it out of the truck , put the boy in , and roll him right into the gym . He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he 's in it . Very handy .	1
As the mother of six grown children , I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment ... we ca n't watch them every moment . I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter . I ordered this to use at my own home , and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house . The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation . The playpen is also a good size . Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best . 5 stars*****	1
Completely amazing play pen . Eazy to pack up and great for playing ! We love the toys on the sides and the cool colors . It is a great size too.The only improvement I could even imagine would be more padding on the pad .	1
Good size ( 36 x 36 ) , durable , sturdy . Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition ; that 's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen .	1
How FUN and AWESOME ! ! ! Got this for my grandson and still ca n't get over how bright and playful this is . Even I want to get in it and play ! The built in activities on the side are the best . The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby ... but the other toys are super ! It was so so so simple to put up ! ! ! Love the bigger size , while not being overwhelming ... those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most ...	1
I am so happy with this play yard . When I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled , I kid you not . The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38 . However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36 , still plenty of space though . I only paid $ 49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products , so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT . Thank you Amazon and Graco !	1
I bought it for my 4 month old son and he loves it . I had doubts regarding the big size but it has turned out the best of this because I feel I have him free but secure at the same time . Colors and decoration are fun and keeps my baby busy and happy .	1
I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it . I could n't be happier ;	1
I bought this playpen to use at my house when I babysit the grandkids . My 10 mo old grandson seems to like to play in it . It will keep him entertained for about 30 mins , which is enough to get dinner started or take care of his older brother . It 's really colorful and large and I like the toys on the netting . He sleeps well in it too . Just a great playpen .	1
I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small , so I decided to take a chance on this one . I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled , looks beautiful and is big and very durable . Ca n't beat that.I hightly recommend it .	1
I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did . It is the most colorful out there , easy to assemble and travel with . My baby is very particular , but she loves this playard . It may to be obvious at first , but each of the walls has a bug with some functions . for instance , the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the , m . The other bug , when squeezed , makes a sound , the third one , has rattles in its wings , and finally , the sun is a mirror ( not a great one though ) . Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued , I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market .	1
I finally had to break down and replace my 9yr old playpen ( that has been used by 4 children ) . I was happy to find that Graco made a square playpen , not only the smaller rectangular Pack N Play . It arrived today and my daughter loves the bugs and the soft playmat . I 'm happy that it folds up for travel and storage . Amazon had the best price as well .	1
I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time . It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom . It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs . The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief . I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service . I 'll positively be back .	1
I had a rectangular GRACO before , with all the bells and whistles , which I returned because the changing table could n't hold the baby 's weight . I bought this one and I am very happy . Baby is safe , has a lot of room to rollover and she loves to look at th bugs . It is just harder to find sheets but you can find them here at amazon . Easy to set up . I just wish it had wheels to move around the house .	1
I have a standard Graco pack and play that does not have much room . I bought this pack in play several months ago because of the bright colors . I love how much room it has compared to the standard size pack and plays.Like the other pack and plays this is easy to fold up and store against the wall . I hav to do so every night since I live in a smaller house and have a cat that might like to jump in it while we are sleeping and make it his new nap spot.The colors are vibrant and have kept my now 13 month old interested and intrigued . She loves to play with the butterfly wings and hit the squeaky toy . It is a generous size without taking up too much room on the floor . I like that there is more space for kids and their toys . She has fallen asleep in it many times.Not recommended but I have sat in it with her and it is very sturdy , It is very level . I have had this for about 9 months now and it still looks like new . I think for the size it is highly recommended . I trust the Graco name too .	1
I love this nice , big playpen . Lots of room to practice/learn crawling . Lots of things to look at : primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with . Mat wipes clean and does n't absorb fluids ( pee , drool , drinks ; you just wipe them up , do n't need to wait for mat to dry or anything ) . It 's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily . I think it 's rated up to 30lbs ( or when the child can climb out , of course ) .Potential drawbacks : -Takes up lots of floor space ( worth it to me for the extra crawling room ) .-It has built in noise-making toys on walls : a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee . Neither are very loud , but still , they are n't detachable & might bother some people . It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I do n't think a child could squeak it on their own ; in fact my preschooler knows how and is n't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak . It has to be squeezed from both sides -- so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it , but that 's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it 's assembled it 's not simple to move . Apart from the four corner feet , there are four support feet ( for a total of 8 feet ) and no wheels on any of them . ( But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you do n't move them much either . ) -It 's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room -- so big and so brightly colorful , it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL . I think it also comes in black , though . The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins , I 'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much , but they were a bit of a surprise . I 'm still very happy -- it 's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available . As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA `` toy '' for other youngsters . ; - ) UPDATE : We 've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT ! We have an always moving one year old baby . The high walls keep him from climbing out , the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps , falls or flops down with all his might . The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape ( I 'm still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak ) . It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in .	1
I love this pack n ' play . I bought my son the pack n ' play in rise n ' shine with a bassinet . What a waste . This is the best pack n ' play . My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself . He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors . Also , it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n ' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older . I definitely recommend this .	1
I 'm a grandma and this is the shape of playpen that was in use when my children were babies except that they were a bit larger ( about 42 '' square play area vs the current 36 '' square play area ) . I find this shape to be less confining than the usual playpens now available that are basically the same thing as putting the baby in a bed.Playpens were n't this cute back then , but every bit as handy . It is not only a perfectly safe and controlled area in which babies can learn to play and quietly make sense of their world , but it provides great peace of mind for parents and grandparents to be able to put the baby down in a safe place while talking on the phone or doing something that does not allow for hands-on and undivided supervision . This unit is well built , stable , portable , and easy to fold ( once you get the hang of it , it 's not exactly intuitive ) .How could it be better ? I would like the padding to be a little bit thicker , I would like the play area to be a little bit larger ( so two babies could play there comfortably , like in the `` old '' days ) , and I would like a removable and washable cover to the pad instead of having to make my own.But , this review is based on it being the best that is available now and it living up fully to the product description .	1
I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up ! Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out , and kicking . We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit . He also takes naps in it , we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon ... will let you know how that works out .	1
I recently bought this for my 8 month old daughter after researching a lot of playpens online and talking to several of my mommy friends . This exceeded my expectations for a travel crib.This is the perfect balance between being spacious enough for an active tot without taking up your entire living room . I like that it is self contained ( i.e . has a base that sits above the floor ) and that it has some built-in toys . It also is very easy to fold and unfold . We bought a Graco Travel Lite portacrib for my daughter when she was three months old for traveling with and while it was great when we could use it as a bassinet , as soon as we put her down in the crib section she HATED it ( tough `` mattress '' , very small - but exceptionally light & lt ; 20 lbs ) .We usually stay somewhere that has a crib , but if we took a car trip I would definitely bring this with both for sleeping and playing.I agree with the other reviewers that I wish this came with a sheet ( or that Graco even made a sheet for this ) . That being said , it only took me about 10 minutes to make a fitted sheet for this on my sewing machine ( it looks something like a large European pillow case ) .	1
I researched what I wanted in the way of a fun playpen for when my grandchildren visit . This is the one I chose , easy up and easy down and easy to put away , plus being fun for them is an added bonus . Thanks !	1
Just got this playpen a few days ago . It is awesome ! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes , and I 'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge . It 's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys , though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space . Baby loves the bug toys on the sides . She 's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head . I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym ( placed on the carpet ) and was very upset . With this I know if she falls back she wo n't get hurt . It 's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it . Great purchase !	1
let me state at the onset that this pack n play was a little above my price range . I was hoping to pay for something around $ 75 at the most . I had a pack n play from graco with the changing table attached . I basically have it solely for that purpose - the changing table . With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected , I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY . I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays . I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors . I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute . NOW THAT 'S WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT ! I 'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated . My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult . I think it took over an hour to put together with another person . The review I read was dead on . I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes . My 9 month old baby loves it . it is VERY ROOMY inside . She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today . The bottom is fairly quilted and I do n't think she will have a problem with napping in it . She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too . The bright colors are great . I 'm sure we will be using this for a long time .	1
Love it ! Baby gets plenty of entertainment and the product is big enough for him to really move around .	1
Perfect , i love the fact it is bigger then the pack and plays but folds up just like a pack and play . Awesome toys ! ! !	1
Set up takes less than a minute and great as a portable playard . The toys on the sides are a lot of fun for baby . The colors are bright and cheerful . My 6 month old loves it . A little heavy to carry ( I 'm 5'2 '' ) but still highly , highly recommended !	1
Still using this ... its big and he does n't mind going in it for me to shower . We also have used it to help him calm down , if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out . Works well , just walk away and he calms down without an audience . Then we get back out , also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in . So he definately does n't mind . He likes the toys in it too , wheres the baby ( the mirror ) was a favorite .	1
This blanket is wonderful . I got it for my husband who is a Penn State grad and there is more than an attachment to his alma mater with this one . The blanket is one of the thickest ones you can get , very durable , super soft , and extraordinarily warm . I highly recommend it over the other Penn State blankets . Basically look for the ones in the `` stripes series '' by Raschel .	1
We have used it only once to travel , it was easy to asemble , the parts seem to be of really good quality , the colors and decoration are nice . Our baby slept and played in it during our 3 day trip , I was able to move it around the house were we stayed with no problem . The mat seems to be a little thin but a couple of blankets wrapped around it made it seem much more comfortable to sleep in it . Because is larger than the average our baby was very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around , the downside is that it makes it a little heavy , not a big deal unless you 're planning to hike mount Everest with it . Fits well in any SUV trunk leaving plenty of space for luggage . Disassembling it was a breeze and packing it was pretty straight forward . I 'll recommend this product .	1
We love this playpen . The colors are great and the attached toys are engaging . It folds up and unfolds easily and the case that comes with it is really going to come in handy when we go on vacation . = )	1
When I was first looking for Playards I was becoming pretty dissapointed because all of them made it clear you could only use it with 1 baby . I was asking my Sister in law about it and she said both her kids still play in theirs and they were 2 & 5 years at the time . She said they are really rough in it at the same time and nothing is wrong with it at all . I think they just put the guidelines to be OVER safe.Anyhow , this was the biggest one and had so many good reviews I decided to get it . I actually bought mine used and it was like new . I took Clorox Spray anywhere and cleaned the mat , the bugs & the top rails . It wiped right off & the fabric was n't even wet , it is sort of water resistant.I started putting both my twins in here before they could sit up on their own . I also always put extra toys in there for them which they love . I used to keep this set up in our living room but now we keep it in our van to use when we visit people . It is so easy to set up and tear down and my girls love playing in it . I think we 'll be able to use this for a long time . Both my girls are 11 months old right now and can pull themselves up just enough to chew on the top rails.So if you 're looking for something to use with twins , definately buy this . It is perfectly safe to use . I would not recomment the `` twin '' playard . It has the double on top but your babies will outgrow it pretty fast and then you 're stuck with a pretty small playard for twins .	1
If I ever have to contain a potential bio-hazard , this is what I use . Quick to set up and easy to put away or take with you , this little baby has enough room to give your baby some play space in the middle of the most hazardous locations .	1
I think this playpen is great ; it 's spacious , sturdy , and colorful . My 10 month old thinks it 's a prison . She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time , which is fine because it buys me some time where I do n't have to worry about her safety . I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old . I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening , but she was fine after I put the sheet on . I 'd hoped she 'd grow to spend more time in the playpen , but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile .	1
This is a great for play . I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However , I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep . Unfortunately , the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets ( must be purchased from company other than Graco ) cause the pad to be a little lumpy . My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it , it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do . I am happy with it .	1
It gives my 2 girls ( 1 & 2 years old ) enough room to play when I need to keep them somewhere safe while I shower or cook . I use their other Graco Pack and Play as storage for their toys since it seems a little too small for 2 kids.Although the bright colors are fun for kids , I 'd like to see more neutral versions of this so it does n't stick out so much in my living room .	1
Fantastic product . Our child loves playing in this pack 'n play . Even if we do n't put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child . The sun has a mirror ( plastic kind that sort of warps images ) , the butterfly has crinkly wings ( fabric with plastic inside for noise ) , another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker ( which is really hard to use ) .It 's all one piece so no & # 34 ; assembly & # 34 ; ever required . The sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side . The ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole-assembly together when folded up . And there 's a light-plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case . It packs up into a long rectangle , probably 1x1x8 feet.Pros : - Pack up or unpack in under a minute , no & # 34 ; assembly & # 34 ; required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller.- Sturdy build , child wo n't be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself.- Soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but ca n't stick fingers or small objects through mesh.Cons : - This is a minor complaint : the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak - you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it 's sewn so tightly- As a side-effect of the sturdiness it 's very heavy . On the plus side of that , it is made of sturdy materials .	1
My husband and I like to just try to figure things out and read instructions only after we are dumbfounded . It was kind of funny for about 90 seconds , then we had to read the instructions , which , it turns out , work . The only tricky part is the release button being hidden inside the four top bars under the fabric . I kept trying to squeeze it but there is a button on the underside that has to be pushed up into the handle . This pack n ' play feels plenty sturdy to me . It 's nice that it has a carrying case with strap . We used this as a place to stash twin babies at home when they were too small for bouncy chairs and swings and such . They got their tummy time and social time in it , although the pad is a bit slick for them to try to push with their feet to turn over , so a towel helps . We also use it as a pack n ' play when traveling for them to sleep in . I wish it was just a bit smaller when folded , as I thought it would fit on the floor of the passenger seat , but it has to go in the trunk .	1
Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time . WOnderful colors , great toys ... Love it till every little bit of it .	1
I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children . The other pack and plays are too small . I do n't understand why they do n't sell these in stores all the time . I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years . No one would ship to Hawaii . When , I saw it on Amazon . I was amazed and decided to try to order it . I was really shocked as I was going through checkout . And , amazingly they were letting me order it . The shipping was really cheap . And , I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday . How , wonderful . My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction . He is only 6 months old and loved it . Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product . And , of course shipping it to me . I am going to order one more . Just totally LOVE it .	1
I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute . It is very colorful and the toys are very cute . I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them , but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors . The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much . I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though . My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour . This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room . IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom . I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it . There is noting about this that I do not like . My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom , but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up .	1
I like this pack n play . The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter , it is tough for them to balance b/c it 's slanted in towards the center . But the colors are pleasing and I did n't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play . That was a nice little surprise . My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them .	1
My grandson thoroughly enjoys it , even though he is still very young . He is fascinated with the decor , even the butterflies on the bottom . My son and daughter-in-law are very pleased with its functionality and ease of set up . A great place for my grandson to learn to exercise his limbs safely .	1
My baby loves to stay inside to play with bee and lady bug when she was small like 6 months old.Now she is 17 months old , sometimes I need to get things done so I put her in and give her some toys she still can play by herself , of course she sometimes complaints by yelling since she wants my attention , but I love this piece it helps me to get things done while she is in my sight , since I can fit this pc in my kitchen	1
I love , love , love this play pen , its money will spent , it roomy and colourful , would defin . recommend . it makes noises as well .	1
Although this is n't the lightest thing to carry , it is very serviceable ! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson , it has been used every weekday . It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m . It still looks as new as the first time we used it . I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail . Also , you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down . And , it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line .	1
why do I love this play pan ? Very simple:1 . Great quality material ; sturdy and safe2 . Large with lots of space ( my grandson crawls around ) . Can fit two kids ! 3 . Very easy to assemble ! 3 . Very colorful ! Bright beautiful colors . My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4 . The colorful patches around it are toys ! The toys are : a ) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound ( he loves it ) b ) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc ) A sun with a mirror ( safe for babies ) d ) A bee with playful wings , which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan ! My daughter has another one , not Graco , that is half of the size . It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny !	1
I bought this last summer for my two year old when traveling . He had outgrown his regular pack and play . I was looking for something larger but still had the sides . I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try . I love this bed . It does take up some room but it was amazing when we were traveling . I did put down dome padding because the mat is n't that comfortable however I would definitely recommend .	1
Graco Tot Block with Bugs is a pack and play that features figures of bugs on each of the sides for added fun . Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different . The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved . The butterfly 's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled . The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child 's enjoyment . Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in , they are always there . There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys , the other reason kid 's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors . Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing . This pack and play , however , offers combinations of bright yellow , green , red , and blue . Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens . They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive , built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays , Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage . You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen . Once you have the playpen folded , it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place . Once the pad has been wrapped , the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut . This is simple enough , but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up . It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use . But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen , there is one possible disadvantage : It could keep your child from falling asleep . If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play , then the added stimulation will be an asset . But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap , you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys . These toys can not be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age . If your child is older , then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out . Most kids age two or under , however , will be small enough to use this playpen . Also , even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device , I think it should be limited to two . Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall , this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child 's favorite playpens . The colors and interactive , built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up , it still makes a good choice for parents of small children . The interactive toys ca n't get lost and the unit 's bright colors make it appealing to children and adults alike .	1
I have three kids . The first two did n't need a playpen , but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet . Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies , little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper , anything . I 'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie , or something will fall off of a counter , and he will get it . He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him , so we have them bungie corded to the table legs . Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam , but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer . Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes . He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer . We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued . So far he likes it . He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail . I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh . I 've checked out two of the sides . One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror . They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house . They have a dog that chews his toys ( and the baby 's ) to bits . And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays . It is essentially the same thing . It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play .	1
Buy this Pack N Play ! ! All pros and no cons on this . It was so simple to assemble , it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up , and some of that time was to remove the tags . Only three parts , just the frame , the folding padded floor , and the carrying bag . It is roomy , has plenty of padding , and has 9 legs for a strong and even base . It is great for sleeping away from home , and great for playtime , because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him . You can purchase sheets for sleeping , but you wo n't need extra padding or an extra mattress , it 's soft enough . It 's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare ! In my opinion , this is the best on the market .	1
The playpen is large and spacious , perfect for babies to roll around and play in . My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there 's no way to wash the entire thing , just spot clean . To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface . Sheets are hard to find , and expensive to purchase and ship . But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble .	1
Our family loves this product ! We used it from infancy to over age one year . It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time . Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble . It has very easy to clean fabric . Just wipe it down . Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat . The size and height of this product is just perfect . Large play area inside . This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new ! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car . Also , we found no safety issues w/this product . I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards . I highly recommend it .	1
it is a wonderful play pen . bright , safe , sturdy and soft at the same time . my son loves touching/looking at the pictures and shapes of the sun with mirror , butterfly with wings that make sounds when you touch them , the ladybug with rattle wings and a squicky ladybug . my son loves playing there and enjoys looking at the images even if he is out of the play pen . thank you , it is a great item !	1
LOVE this pack n play ! ! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors . There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment . It 's very easy to put up and take down .	1
I fancy myself a & # 34 ; stylish & # 34 ; mom ; expensive nursery set , shopping at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn Baby . We got the black and grey pack 'n ' play that goes well with our home decor , then my parents picked up this pack 'n ' play for their home . Our daughter hated the pack 'n ' play we had and loved theirs so we ended up getting one too . She loves the colors , and playing with the items on the sides . I love it because it is a square and much larger than the plain one we had . We HIGHLY recommend .	1
We love it . Great for the patio or when baby needs to be confined so gma can powder her nose . Keeps the dog and baby apart .	1
I ca n't express how much I love this play yard . My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now . The bright colors , designs , and toys caught his attention right away . When I put him in other play yards we have , he wo n't stay in it long and wants to come out right away , but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys . There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy . I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma 's house . I would definitely recommend this to anyone !	1
Just like so many other reviews , I highly recommend this Playard . It is easy to set up and take down . The bright colors are exciting for little ones . It is a decent size and the quality seems fine , so it should last awhile . I bought a sheet made to fit the square playard , so we can use it for resting too . The bright colors can be a distraction if you intend to use it for napping . For play time , it 's great .	1
I love this product in all respects , except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat , once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design . AND , it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up , and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place . Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps , and you will be all set . Otherwise , I do like the sturdiness of theside rails , and the bright primary colors . Not the best for napping , as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys . Some of the toysrattle and crinkle , and once baby finds the party , they will not want to laydown to nap . But I still love this playyard so much , I bought two of them !	1
I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play . I 've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one ! ! ! It also folds up easily and stores nicely . It is a little heavy , but they all are to me . It is sturdy and I think it will last . Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey , though , as it 's not the average rectangular shape . Other than that , it is perfect ! My daughter loves it and so do I !	1
I read all the reviews on the pack and plays and found that the reviews on this one were all great . I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently ( every other weekend ) . I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play . With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles . He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep . He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly . He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play . Set up was a breeze . Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers . What a pain to put together and take apart . Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over . And take down , you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes . With this pack n play it takes a minute , parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play . The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I 've seen but fits perfectly . The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen . It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly .	1
This is large enough for a bigger baby which is why I bought it . My daughter is long so it was perfect . I have n't had her in here during the day but I 'm sure she 'll love the cartoons printed . I bought it as a second bed for when she 's at her grandma 's knowing that she 'll be able to fit in it for a while .	1
I love this one ... .. it 's bright , comfortable , adorable , easy to use . love the size and i use it all the time ... my baby boy loves it too.Anyway I 'm going to purchase it again for my newborn niece	1
This play pen is great in that it is so much more roomy then my childs standard size one . it has the great colors and added toys on it to keep him happy and busy .	1
If you 're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta ( Novel ) playard . I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup -- they both take about a minute to put up . The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness -- the graco feels lighter than the Delta ( a good 5 lbs+ ) , but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up , and seems slightly more durable.Shape -- the graco is very squared off , and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape . This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress -- the graco has a very bright , colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it . It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable . The pad also lays flat , but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while . The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler ' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides . The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco , but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco . Even though it 's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier . No dip in the middle , and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh -- -they both seem to have equally durable mesh . The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh ; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price -- the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice . I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for . If it 's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare , etc . I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use . If you are using it to bring around with you places ( hotel , camping , on the back deck , grandma 's , etc ) . then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around , and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with . The graco also seems sturdy and durable ; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments ; that 's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing ! ! Wish I had bought one sooner ! We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other .	1
This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves , it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up . And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean . When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it does n't soak in . And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live .	1
My son comes to work with me and I keep him in here when he 's active - sleepy . I 've had it now for almost a year . What a great buy .	1
I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old ( not at the same time of course ) . I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens . You would think they are the same , but they are not . The pack n plays are great for naps , ( I would say 18 months and younger ) , and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies . I have used those strictly for naps , as they are not that stable or large enough for play . This square playpen is ideal ! ! ! It is so sturdy . Easy to set up , take down . Perfect for when you need to get something done . It keeps those walking and crawling confined , but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys . The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it , whereas the pack n play , he hated it . Could n't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done . Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys , he does n't mind it . Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping . In my honest opinion , the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib , but foster services states you have to have a crib , not playard for sleeping . I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors . It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular . It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far . But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays , and you could transport it to a grandparents house , or babysitter , or the park . Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays . This has been a lifesaver ! ! In my opinion , works better than using those portable plastic pens . I tried that , did n't last long . Would n't go back to that , and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat . It is very substantial and seems to work fine . However , I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house , it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room . These square ones do not have wheels , so if you needed something really portable , you might want the rectangular . If you are using for both play and sleep , I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen , so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement .	1
Highly recommend this to all parents with Infant and Toddlers . This is such a great playpen to have in your home as an alternative to the crib . My son loves to play in it and also sleep in his playpen which we put in the living room . We bought this together with some fitted pack n play ( Graco Square Play Yard ) from SheetWorld on Amazon ( if anyone is interested ) and the sheets totally fit the square pad that comes with the playpen . We also made an extra padding cushion so it would be comfortable for our son to sleep in . You can also fold this up nicely and make it compacted for traveling if need to . This is a great purchase ! : ) You will not dissapoint .	1
I saw this playpen and thought it was adorable , bright colored , and fun . But I already have another pack and play and I read it was big and cost 100 dollars so I placed it on my private wish list . Well , to my lovely surprise , my mother had also independently seen this playpen on Amazon and bought it for my little baby boy . It is truly awesome and my son loves it ! What I love about it ? Well ... ... .it 's so nicely colored , screams cuteness all over , and it 's very easy to set up and take down . I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too ! They say mothers know best ... .. and in my case ... . that was true ! Buy it , you wo n't regret it .	1
Once my little one started crawling and the little snugabunny gym was no longer safe , my husband reminded me we got this at our baby shower . Baby likes the colors and all the noises , he has plenty of room to move around and he is safe in it . I love that it 's made well and expect to use it for a while .	1
this playpen is just way too adorable ! its colorful there lots of stuff to look at and touch , it has a mirror , crinkly , squeaker and a rattle on the inside my daughter loves this great buy !	1
I love the size and sturdiness of it ! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen . It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it . She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer . We have n't traveled with it so ca n't comment on the transportability . The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet . Overall a great buy !	1
I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use . We have it by our pool ( baby gated ) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time . It is very convenient . I do not like the cleaning issues . It is hard to clean and though it is billed & # 34 ; PACK N PLAY & # 34 ; like it is the & # 34 ; umbrella stroller & # 34 ; of play yards , it is hardly that easy to just fold and run .	1
I bought this for my granddaughter and another one for second child well made hours of fun easy to use and love primary colors and designs on it entertaining	1
I 'm an older mom ( 40+ ) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big , square playpens used to be like ... not the cramped , rectangular things everyone has now . This spacious pack and play is wonderful ! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food ( cases where , for obvious reasons , we would n't want her underfoot ) . She can see us , we can talk with her , and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges ( and falling on her bum on the padded floor ) . When she was younger , she loved playing with the attached toys ( especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings ) .It 's sturdy , easy to set up and take down , and packs away neatly into its carrying case . An all-around great product !	1
This playyard is amazing ! It 's such a good deal for the money . It makes the other playyards look like a joke ! Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby ca n't see out and therefore wants to get out asap . This playyard is really bright and gorgeous , and the mesh is clear so baby can see out . It looks inviting and fun to be in there ! Also , other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors are n't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor . This playyard has a really thick , high-quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on . Also , this playyard is really big- huge ! - which makes it way nicer for baby . I am so glad I found this playyard online !	1
Amazing , adorable , colorful , safe , and giant ! Folds up easily and not too heavy to carry around if you want to take it . The ideal playpen .	1
LOVE this pack n play . nice bright colors , great roomy size for bubs and an absolute breeze to set up and take down . takes literally 30 seconds ! great value for money too . we were intitally given a second-hand one ( used at our home business ) and loved it so much we bought a second one for home.reason for only 4 stars - i just wish the floor had a little more padding . but after researching , this is the best play yard i could find .	1
Love this playpen . We put toys in there and our son love being in there . The toys that are attached to the playpen are great and our babie always tries to touch them . It 's pretty spacious compared to typical other playpen	1
I have had this pack n ' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it . We use it for quick corralling , not prolonged play time . He likes the toys on the sides , and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I 've seen , granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness . My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit . Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice , too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this , only a height limit . That was a major deciding factor for my big boy ! Overall I think it 's a great product for the price .	1
We got this for my baby when she was about 7 months and getting mobile so we needed somewhere to put her if we needed to do something without holding her . It is the standard length of a traditional playpen , but the width is the same as well which gives babies much more space to crawl around in and play than the typical playard . It is very simple to put up and take down . My baby has only slept in it one night and it was fine for her . It is very sturdy and the bottom mat has tabs that snap into the base of the frame for extra stability . The colors are bright which is good for the baby but does n't exactly fit into my home decor . The sides each have a toy- a mirror , two rattle butterflies and one squeek lady bug . The squeek is really hard to press so I often hold my hand on one side of the pen for stability and press on the other side but that is only an extra feature so I 'm not really disappointed . This is the most affordable by far of the larger size playpens and I 'm very happy with my choice .	1
I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking . It is perfect . The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area . The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it . The toys on the sides are great , she loves to play with the butterfly . I am very happy with this product .	1
Hard to find a pack & play this large anymore and with the twins coming it will be great to have .	1
OMG ... .this play pen is a life saver . My son crawls around like crazy . When I 'm in the kitchen cleaning up or fixing dinner I ca n't always be watching him so this is perfect . He hangs out and plays or stands up and ( tries ) to talk to me . I do n't keep him in here for a long period of time because I feel that he needs to be a kid and crawl around too . It 's easy to pack up too . I took it to the park with me . I shoved it in the bottom of our UppaBaby Vista stroller . # NYCMom**KEY NOTE*** the middle part has to be up for the sides to bend down .	1
Superb ! It 's a `` must have '' . She is able to play independently and you do n't have to worry .	1
Very big and roomy . Folds and sets up with ease . My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad , the cover on it is not removeable or water proof , so there is no way to wash it and feel like it 's `` clean '' . There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately , but they are n't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof . So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress , or your toddler has a barf-fest , good luck trying to get that smell out . You can `` spot clean '' with a warm rag , but lets face it . Poop and puke requires the washer . And you 're not able to do that with this pad .	1
Needed a safe fun place near my home office and this was perfect . Also plan to take it when we travel.Some features our 8 month old granddaughter find entertaining . Easy set up and seems sturdy , well constructed.Love Graco .	1
We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back . Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in . He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh , he loves playing with wings of two butterflies ( rattle and crinkle ) and tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them . At 7,5 months old , he enjoys up to an hour in it playing there on his own ( he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels . I read some reviews that the floor is not too even , but I did not notice it with mine .	1
I like it for the size and all the colors . Bugs on the sides are somewhat entertaining with rattles and squeaks .	1
I bought this for my nine month granddaughter when she comes to visit . She loves it ! It 's practical , sturdy and so easy to set up and take down . The colors are bright and cheerful and the attached & # 34 ; toys & # 34 ; are so cute & # 34 ; .	1
This is a great play space for our son ! We have a sizable great room , which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house . But once our son started crawling , we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen . We had a regular pack-n-play , but it seemed cramped . This is perfect ! It 's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys , and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries , cook a meal , or do a load of dishes . Everyone 's happy !	1
I totally recommend this especially for big babies as well . We took this whenever we go on a trip and my son just loved staying here . Its mesh walls give nice breeze while my little one was sleeping . Totally recommend it ! ! !	1
Fantastic piece of baby gear ! Our 7-month-old loves the toys on the mesh walls , and he has plenty of space to scoot around . We 've found that the Carters jersey knit crib sheets can stretch to fit over the floor in this Pack 'N Play , which gives us the option of having a washable surface . The bright colors do n't exactly blend with our household decor , but we 'll live . So happy we made this purchase , and what a great price from Amazon !	1
Very cute and bright gender neutral play yard . Easy to put up and take down . Nice and roomy , she does n't mind going in to play . Very sturdy . Will be handing down to my sister for her new baby . It is very durable and well made to last . Which is nice when something lasts and you can use for more then one baby .	1
I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl . It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour ! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place . The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these . I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby 's development .	1
extra space , entertaining and fun ! little over priced but it 's safe and durable so we enjoyed it while it was needed .	1
I like that this has more room than the standard rectangular Graco Pack 'N Plays . It 's easy to set up and works well .	1
I love this pack n play ! The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us ( and they were twice the price ) ... . It was the one with a changing table and bassinet . I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger , boxier and roomier . My son hates restraints and being boxed in , but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play , and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time ( a record ! ) . And he is 2.5 now , so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere ... .	1
This was perfect for traveling when my child was under 2 . She loved the decorations on it and she was able to play with them . It is larger than an average pack n play , which was nice when she slept .	1
This is a nice , large playpen with bright colors and activity items on the sides to entertain baby . The corners are perfect for a baby to learn to pull up to stand , and the sides are tall enough to keep the child safe inside . ( Apparently , the sides are also fun for teething babies to chew on , but what is n't ? ) I have no tested the portability of the playpen since we use it daily in our living room when baby has quiet playtime before bed .	1
Bought this play-yard to be both a place for my 7-month old grandson to sleep during his visit as well as a temporary 'holding pen ' for putting him down for a moment . He slept comfortably at night , and was fascinated by the butterfly and other adornments on the mesh walls of the play-yard when awake . I recommend this product . Its made well , easy enough to open and close , and definitely worked out well for me .	1
When my daughter started rolling , it was time for a little containment -- but Grandma bemoaned the fact that none of the standard play yards had as much space as the playpens of my childhood . ( You remember , the massive wooden ones Moms would schlep from house to beach to park ? ) So looking for roomy containment plus the convenience of a portable play yard , there was only one viable candidate : the Graco PackNPlay Bugs . There 's room enough for my 7-month-old and a hundred toys , it folds easily into its shoulder bag , cleans up in a snap and the price is great . Best of all , and unlike most play yards , it 's FUN ; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls ( all make sounds ) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror . And as a play space , it 's a happy medium between a tiny play yard and a huge Superyard .	1
I was looking for something for my 7 month old daughter to keep her safe when I need to leave the room . I wanted something large and that I could travel with for her to sleep in . I think for the price this is well made . The pad it comes with is good and the colors and extra toys on the side are fun for her .	1
We have this one and love it . My son typically does n't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long . But , it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and do n't want to have to sit and hold your child all day . When my son was a little baby , we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours . My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along . We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly . It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel . He likes all the animals on the sides . Not to mention , what a dream to put up and take down . We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down . This one is so easy ! Highly recommend .	1
After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours ( unbeknownst to us ) , my wife and I decided we wanted another prison -- I mean `` play yard '' -- for our son to roam around in because apparently we 're terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and , through my sleeplessness , thought the dimensions were 9 ' x 9 ' -- sounded like a steal for $ 90 . We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n ' play . Like probably most other parents , we already have the obligatory pack n ' play . It 's small and cozy and our son likes it fine . I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed : another pack n ' play she did not want . ( She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9 ' by 9 ' , but that 's another story . ) Well , we could have returned it with the free returns , but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in , we were hooked and so was he . Here 's why it 's ten times better than your average pack n ' play:1 . The colors are so vibrant -- reds , blue , green , yellow -- as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n ' play.2 . Each wall of the pack n ' play has a different feature : for instance , one wall has a ladybug that squeaks ; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles ; another has a bee that also moves and rustles ; and another has a sun with a mirror on it . Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I 've ever seen , it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3 . It 's sturdier than any pack n ' play I 've seen , and the walls do n't budge when he stands up in it , but it 's also squishy enough to withstand falls . I 've seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it , and he has n't seemed bothered . Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4 . Though not 9 ' x 9 ' , it 's bigger than any pack n ' play I 've ever seen . ( Note : I 've heard this can cause problems if you 're using it for sleep , because it can be harder to find sheets that fit , though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets. ) 5 . Our son actually likes going in there , unlike his other pack n ' play ( or -- god forbid -- his North States Superyard play yard -- you 'd think we 'd sent him to Guantanamo Bay ) .Overall , it really just looks like a fun , happy , and bright place to be in , and it 's well made and looks like it will last for a while , and perhaps most importantly , our son does n't fuss when we put him in there , and , to state the obvious , putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home . So although I do n't think you need TWO pack n ' plays , I 'm not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake , because this particular pack n ' play is awesome.To sum it up , if you 're going to buy one pack 'n play , buy this one , because it 's the clear winner .	1
This is a great product for both Non-breastfed and breastfed ( suggest use after about a month so baby is used to nursing and milk supply is established ) babies . This unique system works best for eliminating excessive air from the bottle therefore preventing excessive gas ! The nipples are a little larger than some babies may prefer but are closer to the breast than most other bottles . Without a doubt my favorite bottle for our son and we will be sure to use it with our next child !	1
I 'm gon na start by saying I really love these bottles . They work great for me and my baby . She does n't get all that gas she used to get with other bottles anymore and she seems very comfortable with the nipples . Plus the disposable liners make cleaning so much easier and faster . I love the way the cap compresses the nipple so you can be sure there will be no accidents while mixing formula , except for the orthodontic nipple which has the little hole on one side , but we do n't really use that one , so it does n't matter to us.That being said , I must warn you IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE EASY-FEED BOTTLE like the description says and that 's the main reason I got this set , otherwise I would 've gotten the prettier ones . Apparently they do n't make the easy feed anymore.I still gave this bottles five stars cuz they 're the best we 've tried . Helped a lot with our little colicky baby and they are a blessing when it comes to cleaning . We have a zillion nipples and just a few bottles so we only replace the nipples on the nursers and we 're good to go .	1
These are one of only a few brands of bottles out there that has a variety of nipples so if your baby does n't like one nipple , you can try the others . Most other bottles only offer one nipple and if your baby does n't like it , you have to buy a completely different set of bottles.These bottles are also interchangeable with the Playtex Premium bottles , so you can have a variety of colors and designs.Get an extra box of liners for each size.These are easy to clean , just toss the liner and wash the bottle in warm , soapy water . Not scrubbing with a bottle brush to get the lump of formula out of the bottom . : c )	1
I like these bottles better than the Premium Nursers . Here 's why:1 . They do n't break as easily when dropped ( or thrown ! ) 2 . The caps are more streamlined and work for all different types of nipples . The clear domed caps on the Premiums do n't work with the orthodontic nipple , and that 's all I use.I would have rather received 2 of these sets instead of one of the Premium sets I got .	1
Ok , my 3 yr. old should n't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT , I have really put these bottles to good use ! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these ... .they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE , LOVE , LOVE the ease of use ! I do , however , wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I 'd be in bankruptcy ... Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive !	1
We used Playtex drop-in bottles and my son loved them . He was able to hold them by himself when he was three months old . We started with the slow flow nipple very early and he had nipple confusion . Later we moved on the Y-cut nipple which is great because it does n't spill like the medium and fast flow .	1
The drop in system is all we use for our daughter and I just love it . I will keep on using it and recommending it highly . So far we have not used the 8-oz bottles but maybe in the future . These nipples are far superior in my opinion because they 're such a natural shape .	1
since my 1st child to my new grandson , I do not remember ever having a bottle be more easy on the stomach and prevent colic.Even my colicky babydid the very best when I used these . Nothing else has ever done better and these are less hassle in the cleaning area and while you have to keep buying the inserts , they are affordable , I bought the others but they are just ideasMD 's helped develop , does n't mean they work as well , 'cuz they do n't ! ! ! I 'd go with Playtex every time .	1
I like these smartly-designed bottles a lot . They have reduced my son 's colic and gas discomforts dramatically by reducing the amount of air he takes in while feeding . My son is primarily breastfed , but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula . The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene , which is a BPA-free plastic . The liners are also BPA-free although I 'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from . Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry , Playtex Baby is serious about customer support . I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance . If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you , I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart . They sell trial bottles for under $ 4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners . Unfortunately , the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers , which are made from polycarbonate , a non-BPA-free plastic ( this is n't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate ) .	1
My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in . He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best . Even my husband is able to feed him with ease ( breastfed babies are picky ! ) . I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk . I recommend this to everyone . It would make a great Baby Shower present !	1
I used these with my first daughter almost 7 years ago ( although they were not BPA free back then ... that was before it became a big deal I guess ! ) ... and exclusively breastfed . I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college . NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion , etc . Gas was n't a big problem either . They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners . Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring , but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher . Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing . After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too . But these Playtex bottles are my go to bottle as they are SOOOO easy to clean and that is very important when you have a young , hungry , crying baby to take care of ! : )	1
Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles . Quick cleanup , quick fill up . Love the nipple variety too.Because of the liners , it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces , etc.Would highly recommend .	1
I was mistaken when I registered for these bottles ... I thought I could use everything in the box for my baby when she was born . However , I did not realize ( being a new mom ) that this was a sample kit with various nipples ( one of each ) for older and newer babies , teething babies , nipples that helped encourage latching of the breast and nipples that just plain resembled the breast.I actually would recommend that if you 're a first time mom , register for this box and also pick out ( seperately ) two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow silicone ' nipples for younger babies and two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow rubber ' nipples for younger babies.First test the silicone on your little one and if your baby does not like it , does not latch on well or has a problem with silicone , try her on the rubber nipples . After that , you 'll know which nipples your baby will need and can purchase more *nipples* to go with the rest of the bottles in your kit.I would suggest you do not use the nipples that come with the kit at all ... new babies should either be on silicone or rubber slow-flow nipples for younger babies . Once you 've found the typle of material he/she prefers - stick with it . And around the age of 4-6 months , switch them to older baby nipples in that same material.Hope this review helps you ! Good luck with your little one . : )	1
My breastfed baby took very easily to these bottles . They 're sturdy and durable . The only times I 've had difficulties with leaking is when I 've failed to properly use thePlaytex Drop-Ins Disposable Bottle Liners , 8 oz , 50 Liners . I wish Playtex was n't phasing out these bottles because they feel much sturdier than their Premium counterparts .	1
I 'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system . It is so easy to use . I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze . Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple . The selection of nipples was nice to have , though my guys would take any of them-he is n't picky . I have n't used the tall liners yet though , maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding ? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go !	1
These are the only bottles I can get my son to take . He hates the silicone nipples , so these are great alternative .	1
Before I had my baby , I was thoroughly confused by all of the bottle options available . I started doing research & this one came highly recommended . Now I know why ! ! ! ! Hardly any cleaning ! ! ! ! ! If you 're not a complete germ phobe & not super messy while making the bottle , you rarely have to wash the bottles or rings . Just change out the drop in , wash the nipple & you 're set . I 've only had to wash the bottles or rings when I 've accidentally gotten the formula on them . My only complaint is the `` leak proof '' lid . I only tried it once . Put the lid on the bottle & put the bottle in the outside side pocket of the diaper bag . Bag was n't jostled or knocked around or anything & the bottle totally leaked . So , the `` leak proof '' tops are not leak proof . Still , I would n't use any other bottle .	1
Great set , but you 'll need more nipples . At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow , which I did n't use until my baby was 8-9 months old . The nipples are like $ 4 for a 2pk , so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that , I love these bottles ! I do n't have a single complaint about them . I do not use a bottle warmer . They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright , but I store mine upright , so that 's a non-issue .	1
When I bought this system , I was concerned if it would be compatible with the pump I chose ( Ameda Purely Yours Ultra ) . The answer is - only if you also buy the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit . The kit comes with the adapters that you need.With respect to the nipples that come with this set , our baby eventually got used to them , but it took a few days .	1
My daughter was n't drinking out of the bottle . The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes . Its soft and is the most like a breast . But I did n't know why she would n't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk . It had gone bad . So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it ) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh , and baby eats while i 'm at work . There is no better feeling for you ( and grandma whos watching her ) when you know that shes happy while you are at work .	1
I knew from the beginning that I would be using these bottles . What I love is the convenience . No bottle washing , just toss out the liner and wash the nipple . It 's especially nice when you 're out and about or a long trip and can not necessarily wash a bottle after use . What 's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types ( latex and silicone ) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately ( this is good because of my complaint below ) .I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles ( refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits : http : //www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm ) . With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits , you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles , though : ! ) As I mentioned , it 's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half ( refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex , Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone , and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow ) .2 ) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner , but you learn to estimate more or less . When you 're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways . If you 're really anal , just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3 ) Although convenient , the disposable liners do create a lot of waste . This would be my biggest complaint.Overall , happy with product because of the convenience .	1
Not a bad price for all of the items included . I wish they gave more nipples though . They give several drop-in liners , 4 oz and 8 oz . But for the price , its worth it .	1
Last year , in preparation to our son 's arrival , we bought several leading , what I will call `` bottle feeding systems '' ( You are not buying just bottles , but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand , so they are systems ) . The ones we chose to try were : -Dr. Brown 's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex , although in concept very appealing , we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted . Also , it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see . We stopped using these very quickly . Although , if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk , these might be work much better . Plus , Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like , so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good , and we ended up using them a lot . Also , we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump . The setup works great . The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring , the milk will leak all over your child . With the ring in , we never had a leak . We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4 , and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr . Brown 's bottles are probably the best out of the three . Like the Avent , we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4 . With its design , it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces . We have never had these bottles leak . The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded . We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher . After about nine months of use , some of the markings are slightly coming off , not a big deal . Also , the number of parts ( 6 vs Avent 's 5 counting the lid ) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas . All of them reduced some , but not all . Likewise , our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these , although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle , so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands , it would be Dr. Brown 's .	1
We got this set at our shower and have n't needed any other bottles . My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles , but the set includes three larger ones , which is great . The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they do n't include the medium flow nipples , just fast and slow . My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast , so we had to purchase the medium ones separately . It 's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts , but it does cut down on the dishes .	1
This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you 're looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole . We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up , although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred . We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter , who has just reached her first birthday . Of the two , Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding , although neither has caused the dreaded `` nipple confusion . '' In both cases , we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type . This is how the two compare:1 . The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with . Throw out the old liner , pop in a new one , fill it up , and you 're ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby . No bottle brush or hot , soapy water needed.2 . The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples , which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding ( more control over the milk flow , and thus less gagging and spitting up ) .3 . Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves , we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak . However , the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down ( and baby WILL turn it upside-down ) . This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4 . Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles , but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire . She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air . The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider , and if she falls asleep , the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets , and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both . For convenience and fast clean-up , the Playtex Drop-In system wins . For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy , the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote .	1
Several weeks ago I left a 2 star review for these bottles due to the cost of always having to buy liners with twins ... as you can see I have since changed my mind and deleted that review . Why ? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old , we bought some other bottles that do n't use a liner . After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them . They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles . Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies . When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths . I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once ( the more bottles the merrier ) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths . I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners , that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner . Since we 've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles ... and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS , what a stinky mess . Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean . With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review . I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned . NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins . Except for water or juice , cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins . It might cost more in liners but you 'll be Thankful in the long run . My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners , we 've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner . Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up . Make sure you have plenty on hand so you do n't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners . I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls . You can use different brands of bags for these as well .	1
I only used these with my first child , now 7 years old . I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty , will use these again . Why they are amazing:1 . The liners are so convenient . You use them then throw them away . No bottles to clean ( build up of disgusting old milk , especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer ) , and you do n't need a lot of bottles , I had two of each ( 2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles ) .2 . After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk , simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out ! This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3 . Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it , but after I talk about the Platex system , they are sold .	1
These bottles always worked out for my daughter . Easy cleanup with the bags , and less gas . She 's down to just her night time bottle now .	1
Okay - I was one of those new moms who had no clue about which bottles of the many types to use for my baby . I read all of the online reviews and decided I would get a couple of each type and try them all . I have the Avent bottles , Dr. Brown 's , Gerber , you name it , I have a ton of them.I exclusively breatfeed my baby and everyday he gets a bottle with his medicine in it along with the bottles I pump for when we will be somewhere that 's difficult to breastfeed . In my opinion , this system is HANDS-DOWN THE BEST.Here 's what I like : The liners are sterile so you can always be sure your baby is drinking out of a clean bottle.Nothing to wash but the nipple and ring . Its so quick and easy , especially when you are in a hurry or in the middle of the night when its harder to think straight . When he 's done , just toss the drop in and wash the nipple and you are ready for your next bottle.My baby did n't struggle with swallowing air using this bottle like the others I tried because you push the air out . It worked much better for him than the Dr. Brown 's bottles . Using these , he did n't struggle with gas pains afterwards.He switched with no problems from a very early age between the breast and this bottle type . It comes with various nipples to try and the breastfeeding nipple works great for him.Here is the only downside : You can not pump directly into the liners - but that is not a big deal to me . I pump into the Medela CSF bags and store those . When I am ready to make a bottle , I pour it out of the CSF bag and into the liner . It became routine and its not a problem for me to take that extra step.Good luck in making your choices about bottles for your baby but from a new mom whose tried them all , these really are the best all around .	1
It 's super convenient . Everything 's light so they are easy to carry around as well . It 's even better because the liner is recyclable .	1
These bottles are fantastic in reducing gas . My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried . I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work . I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance . The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy . It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle , the bag , the water , and the formula all separate . Futhermore , they do n't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it . I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown 's , Avent , or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up , they should try these .	1
This is a great set . The Playtex breast milk storage system is a VERY easy way to store breastmilk in the freezer , and works well with Medela pumps . I 've pumped at work for about 2 months and it 's gone pretty smoothly . I use a mix of these and Medela storage bottles.I especially like that the liners are BPA free .	1
I love these bottles and I reccomend them to everyone I know . First off you drop in a liner and that means there is less to clean up , no scrubbing the inside of the bottle . Second after I put the cap on I pinch the nipple open and gently push up on the liner and all the air comes out . That means the bottle wo n't give the baby gas ! I also used the natural action nipple which the baby loved . I was also able to wash the nipple , the bottle and the ring in the top rack of the disheasher in a speacial nipple rack I bought at walmart for $ 5 . No fuss and minimal clean up .	1
My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them . I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used . I ended up switching out the older nipple design ( square top ) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better . It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling . I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too ! My daughter suffered from mild gas , but nothing major . I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months , the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast . I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more . It worked fine ! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that 's because it was n't seated right on the rim of the bottle . Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins do n't hold a full 8 ozs . and they are correct . To solve this problem , I simply stuck with the standard liners and I do n't buy the Playtex brand . I buy the Parent 's Choice ( PC ) brand at Walmart . Another thing to be careful of is the measurements are n't always correct . I bought the Target brand 4 oz . liners and realized ( after several bottles ) that the 4 oz . mark on the liner was only 3 ozs . The PC liners are correct ! All-in-all , I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners . I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child . I 'm really liking what I 'm reading about the Dr. Brown 's , but will possibly try a couple other brands as well . I 'm realizing that saving tons of money is n't always what 's best for my daughter . We 'll see !	1
These cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle . They should do the trick for those using cloth diapers . They also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers .	1
The cute , fancy little burp cloths on the market are no match for babies that spit up like mine do . These wash well , are absorbent , USUALLY cover enough of the shoulder/arm to prevent clothing from becoming a mess , and are very soft . We could not make it without these !	1
This is a great value pack and so soft and thick in the center panel which also makes them great burp cloths instead of using more expensive and also narrower and thinner cloths actually marketed for the burp cloths .	1
Good diaper cloths ! Been using it with my first born and now with my 1 month old baby.Will help you prevent diaper rash . Tiring to change everytime the baby wets the cloth though and time consuming to wash but worth it than having problems with diaper rash . It is really hard to use cloth diapers for the whole day so use cloth during day time and then disposable at night for longer sleep .	1
These are by far the BEST burp cloths around . I got several different kinds at my baby shower . I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin . These are fabulous . I buy them for every baby shower I go to now . The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom . I highly recommend them . They are worth the money .	1
I purchased these to make burp cloths . I washed them , then sewed fabric to the center piece to customize them . We used the burp cloths for months !	1
I love these cloth diapers . I use them everyday to care for my newborn . I mostly use them as burp cloths and as extra protection for the changing pad during diaper changes . They wash up great . I would highly recommend these cloth diapers .	1
I used to work as a nanny while I was going to college and I am buying lot of baby products for my best friend ( she was my & # 34 ; student loan & # 34 ; - and that 's how I am paying her back ... buying the baby products , anyway ) ... she know I had over 7+y of experience taking care of babies and the items I 'm buying for her are things I used during my sitter years and I know they 're practical and they work great .	1
I got 2 of these at my baby shower ( one for upstairs and one for downstairs ) and I absolutely love them ! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it . When baby 's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge , grab the little flask of water that 's attached , pour it in , and press the button . I 've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it 's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet . Oh , I only do 2 oz . bottles for now .	1
I have to say I have not been disappointed with this warmer , other than it should not be used with the Playtex inserts bottles ( which is why it gets 4 stars ) as it can not sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and does n't shut off . My best advice ? Read the directions ! I was shocked at how little water it uses and thought I was reading it wrong . Do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size ! It is correct , and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time . All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it 's done . I honestly can not understand how people could say they read the directions and it still did n't work , but hey that 's just me . Definitely recommend ! If you have the inserts , you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in . A must have for when baby is home with daddy , grandma , or anyone else that does n't have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle ( esp . breastmilk ) .	1
I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes , its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles , I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm , works great for me . I never had a problem with scalding my baby 's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby . Overall , I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings , I definitely do n't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle , the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need .	1
My wife love this botles.Is for a better way of feeding our new born.I cant wait to use them .	1
Our nursery is on a different floor as the kitchen , so having this has been great for night feeding of twins . The little ice bottle is kind of lame , it really should be Blue Ice which stays frozen longer . Otherwise great product , easy to use , easy to clean .	1
This is an awesome product ! Once you get used to using this product , it is a huge timesaver . It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature ( not too hot , not too cold ) . Before going to bed every night , we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section . When the baby woke up , we transferred one bottle to the warmer . It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper ! You may want to order an additional ice pack so you 'll always have one ready in the freezer . This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible !	1
I ca n't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer . Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle , warm it , and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now , all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment ( complete with ice pack ) , and place it , with a capful of premeasured water , in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby 's diaper , the bottle is warming , and I am ready to go . This equipment has been a godsend . Actually , I ca n't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer .	1
We have tried many bottle warmers and this is the one we currently use . I liked it because it had a section to keep bottles cold as well . This feature sounds good , but in real life , does n't work as well as it sounds.The bottle warmer works ok but the heating action is inconsistent even if you get the water level on the meniscus the same everytime . This is n't good for breast milk . Also the heating plate accumulates gunk from time to time.It includes a jar food holder to heat food , but we have never tried it.All in all a decent bottle warmer , but you have have to compensate with a re-heat or cold water sometimes .	1
This is a lifesaver for late night feelings . We just pop a bottle or two in the cooler before bed , and within 5 minutes of baby waking in the middle of the night bottle is ready to go . We keep in it in the bedroom so we do n't have to even leave our room for late night feelings .	1
This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy . I love it . It warms the Avent bottles great . It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great . You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful . It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water . It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles . I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway . The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day . We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much . I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well . This is definitly worth the money !	1
We have two of these - one for upstairs and downstairs . We 've been using this for a month and it works ok . The warmer is a bit of a crap shoot as far as the bottle temperatures ... but it 's never under-heated a bottle . At worst some bottles come out too hot . That 's easily remedied by running the bottles under cool water for a minute or two . Also - when I first got the bottles I would heat my plastic bottles in there . They seemed fine and did n't melt but I quickly switched to using only glass bottles in the warmer . It just does n't seem right to be heating plastic on a heat source ! Now the only down side to this is the cooler . It does keep things cool - but it 's not impressive . It will keep things cool for up to 8 hours - but do n't mistake this for being refrigerated cool . My medela breast pump tote came with a better ice pack - and that 's what we 're using to keep the bottles cold at night . One other trick ... keep the cooler portion away from the heating portion if you want things to stay cool all night . If you keep it on the unit your bottles will warm up.All in all - this is definitely a good purchase and I 'm not sorry I bought this .	1
We are using this every night since we bought it . It takes some trial and error to figure out the water requirement but that 's OK . It 's easy to use , look good and works great ! I use to warm breastmilk . Cleaning/descaling is the only issue .	1
We love it . Once we figured out how to use it for bottles and bottles of baby food . Very convenient .	1
I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water . The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use , so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error . Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that . I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I 'm happy with it .	1
If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver . We 've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it . It 's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled . If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I 've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle . As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it 's never been a real problem . Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles ( especially Dr. Brown 's ) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element . : )	1
When we first got it I thought it was complicated ... but it really is n't . You freeze the ice pack and when you 're ready to head to bed , you just bring the ice pack and two bottles , place them in the cooler and fill the two measuring water holders and slide them on the side . When your baby wakes up take the water holder off the side and pour into the warmer , place the bottle and then press the button in front to warm . While you 're changing your baby the bottle will warm up and be ready by the time you 're done.It takes practice , at first you 'll probably either overfill the water holder or not fill it enough . For a 4oz warm Dr Browns bottle we usually filled it to the 6 line , 2 months later we 're filling it to the 7 line . 5oz bottles vary between the 7-8 line . It seems this warmer gets weaker with use and requires more water . You also have to be careful not to spill formula/bm on the warmer or it will get sticky and wo n't warm the bottle as well . Oh and if you move the bottle more towards the front of the warmer it will warm up quicker.If you put too much water , the bottle will be too hot so if you 're not sure start out with the 5-6 line and go from there.There is no nightlight and they should n't list it as a feature , the 'nightlight ' is the button that glows orange when you press it to warm a bottle . It shuts off after a couple of minutes when the bottle is done.I love this thing because it makes night time feedings almost a breeze but it does have it 's quirks . If you have two floors definitely get a bottle warmer , and if you 're on a budget this is the best .	1
I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter . It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack . Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours . The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long . I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time . I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle .	1
Great product . I use it at nights . It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly . Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator . Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate . As soon as I pop it in the chamber , by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go . I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle does n't overheat . One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles . So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes !	1
I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house . We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night . Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool . But ... I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown 's bottles were too wide for the warmer . The taller Dr. Brown 's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler . I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown 's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit . My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit .	1
I purchased this to use on the nightstand or for keeping breast milk out . Unfortunately I ended up having to feel formula , so I used this as a bedside bottle keeper at night . Two bottle fit in a cooler compartment and one fits in the warmer . I had absolutely no issues with this item , did what it said .	1
We bought this because I work 2nd shift at a hospital so on the days I work , I do n't get home until midnight and my husband has to get up with the baby . We exclusively breastfeed , so it 's not like we can just put warm water in a bottle and mix it with formula . Living in a two story house , it 's not exactly fun to get up in the middle of the night , go downstairs , warm up the water , then the bottle and go back upstairs to the baby . This system alleviates all of that ! ! We just put it in our upstairs bathroom with a bottle of breastmilk in the cooler part and when the baby gets hungry , just put water in the wamer and warm the bottle . It 's quick and easy , which is always good in the middle of the night ! ! Some people said they had problems with temperature , but we did n't have any problems . Just read the instructions for the type of bottle system we use and it worked fine ! ! !	1
So glad I bought his bottle warmer . Late night feedings have never been easier . Easy to use . No complaints yet .	1
Easy to use , cooler works well to store 2 bottles . I 've been using it for 5 oz medela bottles so I pump at night , cap it and store it in the cooler and warm as I use it . Works great !	1
Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water . I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome , saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly	1
We had this warmer with our first child , but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child . We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child ( because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her ) . After only a few months , I have gone back to this warmer . I love that it has the auto-off feature ( which the TT one did not have ) . heats the bottles very quickly and you do n't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer . Overall , I love this warmer .	1
ahora la familia descansa mas gracias a este calentador de biberones ya que el tetero se mantiene caliente toda la noches o hasta que el bebe la necesite , no hay necesidad de prender la cocina , solo meterlo en la boca del bebe y a comerrr ... .	1
Could n't ask for a better pump ! Does everything I need ! For my daughters first month of life , she could n't latch on correctly so I pumped and fed her via bottle . No problems with this pump . I love it .	1
I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it . As a first time mom , I found it very comfortable and easy to use . I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine . I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable . If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump . Overall , an efficient pump , no complaints .	1
This pump says it 's rated for only occasional use , but I used it every day for six months . The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation . My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack . I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child , but it 's much better to buy this one twice for $ 80 than to buy one for $ 350 !	1
I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom , but this is really handy for when we go out and ca n't schedule around his feeding times . I did n't have any problems with let down . It does make noise , but it 's not noisy . I only pump at home so it does n't bother me . I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever .	1
I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm . As recommended by our lactation consultants , I pump once a day . I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other . I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting . When I pump w/o nursing at the same time , I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins . Being a sahm , I can not justify spending the $ 200 for a double pump when I just do n't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long . I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings ( if giving once a day ) .	1
This little electrical pump works well . It 's only problem is that it 's really noisy . I have twins and this pump works just fine .	1
I received this pump as a gift . I like it because it is electric . I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading . For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis . However , there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump . This works great . It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples . Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples . It is a pretty good buy . It does n't work any better than a manual , but it is more convenient since you do n't have to work as hard . I would n't have bought it myself , but since it was given to me , I am glad to have it . : )	1
I have the larger , double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home . I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full . It 's small and light and perfect for travel . I 'm now onto baby # 2 and use this occasionally since I 'm now home full time , but this works so well when I need it . It 's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand ! I would n't recommend this if you 're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump , but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me .	1
I love this pump ! It 's the best single pump I 've tried , and I 've had a few different ones .	1
Awesome product , a little loud but overall does the job , we rented a machine from the hospital tht did the same for twice the money we paid for this , after realizing we needed additional time and they required additional fees , we opted to purchase this and keep rather than spend it on rental , great choice we made , highly recommended .	1
I 'm pretty sure I first bought this pump when I had my first 6yrs ago . I only used it a couple of times then - we never got the nursing thing to work out . When my second came along , I pulled out this pump and used it regularly for almost a year . ( expressing away from home , helping with engorgement , pumping extra for more supply ) It works great ! ( Especially if you may be on a budget ) Yes , I know the motor is loud , and it took a little while for me to get used to it - but if that is something you can get past or it just does n't bother you , this single breast pump is fantastic for the price . ( if you want a quiter one , look at the Medela Swing , but you also pay more ) It only took only 15-20 minutes to pump what my baby could nurse in the same amount of time.I mostly used the AC adapter , but I have taken it on the road and away from home quite a few times with batteries ( 2 AA if I remember ? ) and it worked just as well . I have never had problems with burning through batteries , they always lasted a long time , so long that I started using batteries while at home too so I was n't stuck in one place.If I still had this laying around , I would also use it with our 3rd , who is expected in 2 mos . But I have no idea if we gave it away to someone else , or where else it may have went to over the years . I do plan on upgrading to the Medela Swing this time , and only for the noise factor . My kids are 4 and 6yrs now , and with the activity level in my home now , I think a quieter model will better suite everyone 's needs .	1
This pump is very good . I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life . During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital , but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump . I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump . I only used the electric plug , never batteries . It is a handy pump to have . I do n't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point , even if its for cereal when they start that . Medela is definitely the best pump to get , and do n't even think about a manual one . I never pump now since I 'm home with my baby , but I am so glad I have this pump . It is definitely loud , but putting a folded towel over it helps . If you have to pump a lot , and can afford it , a double pump is the way to go though ... it takes half the time , which is very important when you have a baby to take care of .	1
I found this gate hard to set up - the instructions were n't as clear as I would have liked and did not mention to remove the vertical bars before trying to adjust sections . ( I am a minor DIYer ) .It 's great once it 's in place , though ! It is very sturdy and the gate is easy to open if you have a free hand .	1
This gate is grate especially if you have pets and stairs . The only thing I did n't like about the gate is how hard it is to bend/configure each panel of the gate .	1
We have a soon to be 5 month old and he is not crawling yet but we wanted to be prepared . Our stairs needed a special gate and this is perfect for us . We especially love the fact that you can take the entire gate off when not needed and it 's easy to put up and take down . Thanks to Little Folks and Amazon !	1
This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24 & # 34 ; extension . It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she is n't allowed . My husband said it was very easy to install . The stay-open and auto-close features are great . I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it .	1
We needed a gate for a really wide space between our family room and kitchen and this gate works perfectly . It does n't look terribly cheesy . The gate is easy to open and close , but not so easy that our toddler can figure it out .	1
I 'm quite happy with the gate , although I had to spend $ 250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs . I removed the left 24 '' panel , replaced with an 8 '' extension , then inserted 3 more 8 '' extensions on the right . The $ 30 8 '' extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think ( and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box ) .Like many Kidco gates , the instructions could have been better . And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8 '' drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister ( rather hard wood ) . While it may be obvious to some to do that , others might not know , or might not know what size drill bit to use . I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach . Only when I used a 1/8 '' drill bit did it go in .	1
We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den , marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in . I was worried that the length would make it insecure , but it does n't : Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight ; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns , using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern . Then hang stuff like toys , instruments , and mobiles from it . Our lil'guy loves it ! : )	1
We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen . We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased ! ! ! We put it together in about 30 minutes . It 's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need . For us , we were hesitant to drill into our walls but did n't have another solution . Now that it 's installed , we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls . I definitely recommend this gate ! !	1
We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area . We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.The elongate was to cover an area of 84 '' . The elongate can only go straight across and opening . It 's extension are screwed together and have an overlap . So the gate is not actually straight across . We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates . Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall . Took us over an hour.The Configure gate is on the pricey side . We almost did not buy it . But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need . We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.It was so easy to add the extension piece on . You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece . You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on . It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes . It was very sturdy.I highly recommend this gate .	1
I love this gate ! We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level . This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you , which I like . The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates , about an inch . When the door is closed it is secure , much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you . The entire system spans 72 '' and is very stable , even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money .	1
It 's pricy , but very sturdy . To open and close gate is little tricky though . I purchased Northyard gate also . I like it better .	1
We have two landings where we use these gates and they work really well for them . The first one was a little tricky to install but the second was much easier to do . I love the magnetic latch because I know the gate will close every time . It can be difficult to open sometimes but I 'd rather that than have it open too easily and have my child sneak through .	1
We 've had this gate since late 2007 when our oldest started walking . Fast forward to home # 2 and three running , half-heathen boys . The gate has stood-up to our abuse , the elements ( having been outdoors since first acquired ) , and the dismantling and ressembly due to a move.We 've never had a problem opening or closing the gate and find the opening more than adequate . My larger friends due as well.We did buy another Hearthgate to section off our family room from the rest of the house and yes , the mounting screws are coming out of the walls . but , I 'd like to preface , that is because I did n't use drywall mounts to attach the gate to the walls . I desperately needed a gate ASAP since our new house had a narrow , metal spiral staircase with a gate which didn ! t latch ( yes , we immediately rectified our spiral staircase gate sitch and now have a key lock on it ! ) .. So As soon as I got the gate home , I installed it . After almost two years of dogs nosing it , kids hanging on it , people pushing on it , the screws are finally beginning to come out of the wall . Tomorrow , I 'm headed to the hardware store for some drywall mounts.After all the gates we 've been through , I still think this gate is the best . Installation for both gates was a breeze.Customer service was great as well . I installed it while kids were napping . I had to call the company after We received the wrong extension piece ( wrong gate piece in extension piece 's box ) Oh , FYI : even after all these years , our original hearthgate does n't show any signs of rust .	1
We have a row home with very low banister . I purchsed the Kidco Configure Gate along with the extension and it fits perfectly and wraps around the area nicely and does n't take up too much room . For the purpose I gave it 5 stars , but I did feel both the gate and extension were a bit pricey . The gate is crafted well , easy to install , and the peace of mind is well worth it .	1
This is a great gate , and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces . It 's pretty sturdy , the kids shake it sometimes but it has n't ever opened or torn from the wall . The downside ( or upside , depending on perspective ) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version . The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close . I got the extension , and it still stands pretty sturdy . No regrets on the purchase.BTW , this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play . We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt . It 's nice because he feels included with everyone else there , but does n't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos . Highly recommend for that purpose . Looks ok , good if you have white for trim , but ultimately , its a baby gate and looks like one .	1
We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all . My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago ! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs . The gait opens easily with one hand ( the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit , which we did n't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions . This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but ca n't lift the gate to open it by herself ) . The gate is also fairly wide , allowing us to pass through it easily , even when carrying things . The gate automatically swings shut , which is convenient , but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees . Would highly , highly recommend this gate !	1
This kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space ! We needed to block off a hallway in our basement , but had uneven walls , and this gate works perfectly . The installation was a little bit involved , since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls , but it only took about 20 minutes and we had it up.Some tips for installing the gate:1 . First , read through the entire instruction manual before you start . The way the manual is structured , there are instructions in several languages in the front , and then reference pictures in the back . If you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start , it makes the installation go pretty smoothly.2 . Try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls . Since you can configure the gate to any length/angle by changing the angle of each joint , try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall , so you do n't have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out.3 . Try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a 10 degree angle . If you put them straight across , the gate will flex a little bit . It does n't really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls , but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionOverall , this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and I would highly recommend it !	1
I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I 've used and it is my absolute favorite . I have 4 different baby gates . We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive , too ! I do n't feel like I 'm keeping the children `` trapped '' like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2 . However , by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she could n't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate , which I love for my 12 month old climber . She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway .	1
We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around . Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great ! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a `` landing '' at the top . We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair , with a baby in your arms , to open or close the gate.It is easy to open , but not for little ones . My 3.5 year old still can not open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat .	1
We have been using this system for about two months now . We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room ( now play room ) . We used 4-5 extensions as well . We bought this new , and it was easy to set up . Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing . Kidco is pretty easy to work with . They sent me free `` templates '' for the wall and I bought some screws ( for another gate ) .I LOVE this system . The quality is great . I recommend it and would purchase another if needed .	1
This item was a LIFESAVER when I brought my son home from the hospital . The sounds were so soothing they helped him to sleep longer at night . For anyone who has read Dr. Harvey Karp 's book , The Happiest Baby on the Block , they will understand . The only thing is this is better for smaller babies . Once my son was bigger , I bought the Fisher Price Aquarium and that works well for older babies .	1
We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born . We do not use the heartbeat or music setting , but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented . ' I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already , but it took seven weeks to do so . ( That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off ) Overall this is a great product and very useful .	1
The voice activated feature is great ! ! And for what it offers , the price is very attractive.Four sounds , light , etc . - you will be glad you bought it.Our daughter ca n't sleep without it now : )	1
My daughter is now 11 weeks old , and we have used this since she was born . We usually use the ocean sound , but once or twice we used the rainfall and she seemed to like that , too . It 's true that the lullabies sound mechanical , so we just do n't use it . We did n't buy it for music , anyway . We wanted white noise to soothe her and block out other noises.We always use the voice-activated mode , and when we first put her down , we just go `` shh '' into it or snap fingers to start it , when it begins to play for about 15 minutes , and then whenever she cries . It does take a pretty decent sound from her to set it off , but that 's okay -- her softer noises are usually in her sleep anyway . She only sets it off a couple of times a night -- I think ! The biggest drawback is batteries . Despite only using it on voice activate mode , when it 's only on for 15 minutes at a time , we seem to have to change batteries about every two weeks . We switched to rechargeables , and they seem to die even sooner -- but at least we can recharge them . The unit runs through batteries even quicker if you use the night light -- even for only a few seconds to check on the baby . This is hard for me to fathom , considering that our swing runs much more , and since our daughter was born , we have NEVER had to replace the batteries !	1
I would n't rate this as a baby necessity . It was nice to have at times , but our baby was never really addicted to it . I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant , but not all the time . I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and would n't sleep any other way . The light was very helpful . I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions . It is very dim , so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby ( or you ! ) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around .	1
When I first had this product , I used it on my daughter 's crib like it is intended . Then I realized it could also be placed on the side of the carrying handle on most infant car seats . I found it worked great if my daughter was fussy in the car . She loved the soft sounds and musical melodies . It helped lull her to sleep . The added light is also a great feature to peak on her rather than turning on the bright overhead light in my car . Just make sure it is placed securely on the side of the handle to prevent it from falling .	1
I was a little woried about buying a metal crib , but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one . I love it and so does my son . We have had it for over a year . It hs traveled with us , Surved as play pin , and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib . I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust , although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe . Should offer maybe 1 mor hight ? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable , the description does n't say that .	1
The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment , so I asked them to ship another one ... the second one was also damaged ... I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one ... It is a great crib ! It folds up and can be rolled on it 's wheels even when folded . It can be assembled very quickly . So I rate the item very high , but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up !	1
I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one . She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination . When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib . This one is great because it is very sturdy . The folding locks take a bit of getting used to , but they work well . The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $ 20 . I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great . My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it ! It does fold nice and flat , but it is still large for the average car . We can put it in our Suburban . It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage , but no one does ! I love this crib .	1
I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib ( at three months ) . My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow . It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $ 80 that it costs . It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it . We bought the malawi set for it , which looks adorable . I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining .	1
great crib , easy to assemble ( it was pretty much assembled when it arrived ! ) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it , but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he would n't roll into the cold metal ! I am not sure how long he will fit into it , but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib . And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart .	1
I love this changing table . This changing table has lots of space for keeping babies things handy . You can put everything you need like diapers , rash ointment , powder , wipes tee shirts , burp cloths on one of the shelves and still have room for a few toys . It has ample room to change and dress the baby without any problems . You may want to get a thicker changing pad though . I have never had a problem with this and I used it for two kids .	1
My husband and I bought this changing table in the `` cherrywood '' . It was n't hard to put together -- my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so . It provides ample space for diapers , burp clothes , blankets , and other items you may need on it . The table comes with a simple foam mattress , which is easily wiped off with a cloth . We 've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months , and still good as new . No problems encountered at all .	1
I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store ( shop around for the best price ) . When they arrived , my husband and I set up the changing table first . It was very easy for us to set up ( although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do ) . I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times , as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws , but it held up in the end , and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box . Are there nicer , sturdier products out there ? Absolutely , but you 're going to pay for the difference . Overall , we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price.However , as a side note , the oak crib did not match its `` matching '' changing table . The changing table is a nice reddish oak , while the crib was very blonde . We took the items back to exchange for a matching set , only to receive another unmatched set . Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set .	1
This is a good solid dressing table . We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop , so I ca n't comment about other reviewers ' concerns regarding assembly . The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who do n't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table . We did n't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib , which is really the focal point of the nursery . The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies . I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers , etc .	1
this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers ... which is a nice pad along with our changing pad ( which we whip clean before use and after use..over the pad its self ( which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on ! )	1
I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up . Washes well and never shrunk for me . If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high ( hot water heater ) so that may be causing it to shrink . I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new . Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped ... maybe expecting alot from terry cloth .	1
The softness of this cover makes up for the fact that you have to stretch it a bit to fit your changing pad . At least once you have it on , you know that it 's a snug fit and wo n't pop off !	1
My son is three weeks old , and I am using this pump every day to express milk for his middle-of-the-night feedings . It is so much easier to use and more comfortable than the Medela pump they had me using in the hospital to increase my supply.It seems very complicated to put together the first couple of times , and it took me a little practice to get to where I had the pump ( and myself ) positioned properly to get consistent suction . But once you get the hang of it ( give it 3-5 sessions to get used to it ) , it works great . I can pump enough for an entire feeding in 20-25 minutes.It does occasionally lose suction when I am using it because the soft plastic massaging attachment comes loose from the hard body of the pump . This requires me to stop momentarily but is n't a huge deal , just a minor annoyance . And it seems that the more I get used to the pump , the less this happens.This morning , I was even able to hold my fussing baby on one arm while pumping with my free hand . Talk about convenient ... .The lactation consultant who taught my breastfeeding class said this pump is so popular that Medela is now trying to copy the design.Considering the price , I 'd rate it an outstanding buy .	1
Recently , while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my Medela Pump In Style Breastpump , which are vital for operation . The spare parts were safe at home , and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament . Unable to nurse , I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth . I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply , not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts , so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle , 4 oz , 9 oz or disposable . I am amazed by the comfort , control and power this little hand pump provides . In addition , I enjoy the convenience of not having to be `` plugged in '' and the reduced amount of bottles to wash . I found this pump to be great in a pinch , or for a weekend away . However , for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy , the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed .	1
I bought this pump because I am an at home mom and do n't need anything quicker . I saw no need to spend the extra money to save time when I have plenty of it . Plus , once your milk really start to come in and your baby has been breast feeding for a few months , the milk really flows . It was n't especially useful for the first few months because expressing was just not feasible yet without a hospital grade pump . Now that it is , I love this pump . It does n't hurt my nipples , and the small breast milk storage containers fit right on the pump . My daughter still only drinks about 3-4 ounces at a time so I mainly use those . I bought the disposable one because it came with the storage bags and the bottle to hold them . I thought they would be useful for when I need to have more than 4 ounces . The bags hold 7 and are very easy to thaw . This breast pump is definitely worth the money .	1
I have been breastfeeding my son , since he was born , and now he is 9 months old . I could n't have done it without this Avent pump . As a first time mother , I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child , but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be . My son had trouble latching on in the hospital , and so , until he could breastfeed consistently ( I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders ) , I was pumping my breast milk for him . At the hospital , they provided me with a Medela manual pump . It was PAINFUL . I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump . So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis , and I went for the Avent , a much more economical buy . This pump is so comfortable , it really imitates the suckling action of the baby . At first , all the parts might seem overwhelming , but when you put the pump together , it 's a breeze and washes easily . I chose the disposable system because I thought it would be more convenient if I traveled to take the pump , however , I find I use the reusable 4 oz bottles a lot more frequently . Whether you 're taking the pump on vacation , to work , to extract milk for an occasional bottle or to mix for cereal , this pump is a great buy . Now that my son is older , it is harder for me to pump so much milk ( the let-down takes a little longer , and he drinks less , so I do have to pump a bit ) , but it 's so convenient if you have to go out and run an errand , or freeze your milk so that you 'll always have supply on hand for the babysitter .	1
This pad makes our 1 year old daughter 's Colgate classic mattress not feel so hard , but at the same time it is thin enough and seems safe for younger babies . I 'm very glad I bought it !	1
I own two of these mattress pads and I love them . They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son . They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress . It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads , but in my opinion it is worth it .	1
This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . We did n't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . The crib sheet alone was n't enough to keep him from sweating . This pad is also not too bulky so it does n't cause a safety concern . Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety 's sake . We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it .	1
Unlike many other pads on the market , this one is very soft and durable . It holds up great to washing , fits my baby 's mattress perfectly , and appears to be very cozy for my little one .	1
This mattress pad is waterproof . That is all I need . It goes in the washer and the dryer . Not only that it is thick and fluffy , like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed . I only need one . It 's QUITE a necessity .	1
This fits well and is so soft . I have n't found it to be the best with waterproofing , though .	1
Fits the mattress well & Holds up well in the wash . I actually bought this b/c my toddler 's new bedding set showed his mattress design too much . This was my solution and he seemed to love it too ! : )	1
I love it ! It keeps my sons mattress dry and it washes easily and comes out great . He has peed through his sheets twice so we have washed it 3 times and it is still in as good condition as when we bought it the week before he was born 9 weeks ago . I will be getting another one soon .	1
these bottles proved to be better than any other bottle . myb baby gets much less gas from these than any other on the market . its definately worth the price . i have bought and wasted money on so many different brands of bottles . dont waste your money and just go exclusivly with these .	1
and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion . I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck , and that is only because of the gas issue . They are super easy to break down and clean . And yes , I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first . However , after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle , I have n't had the problems since .	1
I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them . They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly . You HAVE to remember that . When you overtighten the lid , the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken . My husband and others in the family have had this problem . It is probably always helpful to test for leaks ( when you test the temp of the milk ) BEFORE you give it to the baby , just to make sure.I like the plastic they use . It has always felt extremely sturdy . They are easily to hold ( thanks to the curve ) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean ... .and you are pretty sure they are clean ! ! I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set ! ! All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it . I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too .	1
In the midst of all of my bottle testing , I was against Avent , mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles . I thought that I could test a bottle and cup , to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable . Well , they are . They also have more nipple selections , depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle . I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz . cup holder , these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these , couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts ( have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one ) .	1
These bottles are a good choice if you 're breastfeeding , but have to introduce a bottle . My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also , after months of frequent use , I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers . I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either . I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks .	1
My wife chose Avent on recommendation from a friend and we glad we did . These bottles worked perfectly for us . They also fit right into Avent bottle warmer , which we also have .	1
I would n't use any other kind of bottle for several reasons:1- they work great with the avent breast pump.2- They have wide mouth openings and this makes it easier to clean the bottle as well as dump formula or breast milk into the opening.3- The nipples are silicon and this is very important to me since I understand from my research silicon nipples are less apt to cause breastfeeding nipple confusion.4- The nipples seem to mimic a breast more than any other nipple on a bottle I have seen . I was concerned about nipple confusion for the few times I wanted to bottle feed instead of breast feed and I understand that these are some of the best available that mimic a mother 's breast.5- We have noticed that our children have less gas when they use these bottles rather than a normal , cheap type bottle . ( maybe it 's our imagination , but we think that this is the case . ) 6- the whole avent system makes for easy growing with the child- there are different nipples for different ages , including a sippy cup nipple . Great.These bottles are great . My husband sometimes screws a lid on wrong and gets shaking it and formula leaks out the sides . This is only when he does n't screw the lid on correctly . I have never had this problem.We would n't use any other type of bottle . They are well worth the money .	1
I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars . I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak . After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these . When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different . Oh , wow , what a diffrence . Baby is 4 months old and no leaks . The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar . Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks . The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content . I tightened it as tight as I could and it did n't leak a bit . The new nipples have the words `` Extra Soft '' on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom . I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned .	1
After trying Dr. Brown 's , Playtex , and even the cheap bottles , Avent bottles have come to my rescue . First of all , they have many different flows with their nipples , which is a huge plus in my book . The Playtex have 3 - slow , fast , and tri-cut . Avent has newborn stage 1 , stage 2 ( slow ) , medium ( +3 months ) , and fast ( +6 months ) , plus a tri-cut . I have NEVER had a problem with the nipples clogging , even after putting them in the dishwasher a few times ( I had this problem with all other nipples ) .My 3 month old daughter can finish a 6 oz bottle in 10 minutes instead of the 45 it took with the other bottles . Also , I have never ever had a problem with leaking , I think many other moms who do are probably not reading the directions or using common sense . If you tighten ANY bottle too tight , it will leak . And the nipple has a special seal that you can hear when you turn it , so that will prevent leaking.There 's no extra parts to wash like Dr. Browns , and they do not give my daughter gas . In fact , my daughter will burp better now than with her other bottles . She also prefers the wide-mouth shape and I know it gives her mouth the needed motion to widen her palatte ( which is one of the reasons breastfeeding is recommended . ) We ended up selling all the other ones to our local baby consignment shop and spent the money on more Avent bottles .	1
I give 5 stars to all Avent Products . I have had no problems , whatsoever , with Avent .	1
I purchsed these bottles on a recommendation from a friend who was breast feeding as well . The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better . When I first had my daughter , we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal . She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly . The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast . The nipples are not supposed to be shaped as the breast but force the baby to latch the way they do on the breast . I swear by these bottles ans will not change to any other bottles for her !	1
These bottles are great . The entire line works together from breast pumps , to sanitizers , to storage containers , to sippy cups . Also , my son had no problems with colic . Not sure if this says anyhting about the `` anti-colic nipples '' , but whatever.Here are some of the major comments I have : LEAKING-They only leak if you do n't dry them completely or put the lid on wrong . They have leaked on me b/f but only occasionally when they are wet . I love these bottles.VARIABLE FLOW- There are several different grades of nipples . I love that there are slow flow , medium , fast and then sippy tops . They even have variable flow nipples so you do n't have to buy three sets . A friend of mine uses different ones that only had two different flows and was envious of my choices ! GROW WITH ME- The fact that the whole set is interchangeable is great . You can use these bottles from newborns to toddlers . You can convert your bottles into sippy cups ! ! ! There are screw on handles and sippy tops you can buy . Fabulous . To me , this also justifies the cost .	1
These are the widest bottles that I have seen available . They are well made and easy to assemble . I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers ( a problem with another make I tried . ) or discolouration of bottles . They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups . The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids ( my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks ( with Doctors approval ) because he is so big ( 90th Percentile ) and was so very hungry . The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose . What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us . They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric .	1
These bottles are absolutely fantastic ! They are so easy to use and they cut down on gas wonderfully . I just can not say enough good about them - well , here 's an idea . I have 8 of them ! The nipples can be a little pricey at times but check out the stores and babies rus - they 're on sale at different times in the year and you can save about 15-20 % on them . I would n't use anything else . Target puts them on sale as well . The silicone nipples are so much nicer than the rubber ones on regular bottles , and if you nurse and use bottles as a supplement , these are the more like yourself so the baby has an easier taking it . The bottles withstand hundreds of washings in a dishwasher without the markings being washed off . By far , the best bottle on the market in my humble opinion . I received one in a gift set and my husband immediately ran out and bought a week 's worth - they 're just so much easier to use and they fit so well on the fridge shelves , plus those huge plastic caps that fit over the nipples are easy to remove and makes you feel like everything is cleaner . Highly recommend !	1
We bought this because this is a good brand to use . We love how big these are and they are so easy for someone to mix formula in .	1
I have had 3 children , all formula fed from birth , and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously ( Canon Babysafe ) .Yes , they are more expensive , but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money 's worth . I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems . But I know some mother 's who had babies that just would n't take this teat and they had to switch brands . I guess with everything to do with babies it 's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in . I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops . The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think .	1
i have zero complaints about these bottles . wish i had bought them in the first place ( i started out with the playtex nurser system ) . they may be pricy compared to other bottles , but , you do n't have to buy liners for these bottles . my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from ( besides slow and fast , where fast for playtex really just means not so slow ) , so i put them away and got more of these , and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about : if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak . this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag , and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on , you 're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps !	1
I loved these bottles . Never had one problem . No leaks , nada one . I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump . I only use these for baby water now , since I use larger bottles . 5 stars	1
In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market . The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it 's convenient for Mom 's on the go . My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day . The bottles are designed to reduce gas , and seem to do the job . The one slight annoyance with the system , you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples ; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I . - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended , but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby 's nose to adjust the flow . This makes sense of course , but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little ' detail .	1
I had and hated the VENTAIR ! Stupid leaky valves ! This bottle feels nice in the hand to feed and my husband like them too . The placement on the babys face with the nipple is perfect too .	1
I decided to breastfeed my second son , when that did n't work out , I used playtex nursers . We often fell asleep while he was eating and would wake up SOAKED in formula . Not a good thing because formula stains and then you have to change baby and you in the middle of the night ( and pretreat clothes and wash them if you didnt want to end up replacing them ) .I decided to try these after seeing an add in a magazine . THESE WORKED WONDERFULLY ! No more buying and changing liners ( which by the way would always break even if i was being VERY careful when i `` burped '' the bottle ... its hard enough to burp baby without trying to BURP a bottle ! I never had to burp my avent bottles . They never leaked for me . And I rarely had to change the nipple which hold up very well to repeated dishwashings ! If you think about it these really are cheaper then playtex nursers as you dont have to buy the liners and worry about them breaking and getting formula all over yourself in the mall and then having no formula and having to leave anyways ...	1
My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week , she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend . I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks . I do n't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking . I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks , thats why I gave it only 4 stars .	1
Our baby seems to drink the best from these bottles . I like them because the wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean . I 've noticed leaking a couple times and just rescrewed the cap and it was fine .	1
These bottles are pretty good . The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby . She makes quite a mess while drinking from these . However , the bottle is nice and durable . The nipple and caps fit snug . Also , they work great as breast milk storage containers . You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage . I like that . My daughter does n't get a bottle often , but when she does this in one of the types I use .	1
Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby . We tried and used both bottles with our boy . The real deal between the two is the nipple . The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles . When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles . He just could n't get comfortable around the nipple . We switched to Dr. Bown 's and he took to it with little problem . As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents . Why did we switch ? Cleaning Dr. Brown 's bottles SUCKS ! There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles . Plus , the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just do n't seem to pack away as well . However , if your baby is picky there is n't much you can do . For expecting parents , I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other . Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with .	1
I like the bottles . Have only had trouble with leaking a few times when I had the cap to tight . You just have to take off the lid and start over . Good system .	1
The Avent bottles are great if you breastfeed , but I would caution you not to put them in your dishwasher . All of my 9oz bottles have cracks in them because of the dishwashing detergent ( according to Avent ) . I called Cascade and they told me the manufacturer of the dishwasher is to blame . On any account , Cascade and Avent both recommend using a gentle , not antibacterial soap on these bottles . If you notice star like cracks on your bottles call Avent 's customer service .	1
THEY HAVE A GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE , IN MY COUNTRY THE BUTTLE AVENT ARE SO EXPENSIVE , I LOVE TRADE AVENT	1
These bottles are Great ! I 've never had a problem with any of my bottles leaking . My daughter loves these bottles she 's already strating to try to hold bottles herself while I am feeding her . I love them too since they are easy to clean and handle . I highly recommend this collection of bottles .	1
Ever since the day my daughter got home from the hospital she has been using the Avent bottles . For a few days even the Stage 1 nipples were a little too fast for her , but she got used to it . She loves the nipple shape which is so much like my breast . In all actuality i like the bottle , but my little Aliya loves it . After introducing her to Avent she rejected most other bottles , she would n't even take the new Ventair bottles . A great product !	1
I bought these bottles before my daughter was born and have never regretted it . I have NEVER had a problem with the bottles leaking and my baby is very happy . She does n't have gas problems or gas pains . She loves drinking from the bottles and refuses to drink from any other bottle . These bottles are great !	1
I absolutely love ALL Avent products ... their bottles , bottle-warmer , pacifiers , etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles , and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one . Yes , sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking ... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle , and breaking the seal . So , when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle , take the nipple out of the ring , rinse the nipple and ring , and then the problem 's gone . These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me , and have n't discolored with age of anything . ( Although , old nipples do discolor . ) It 's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side ... what a pain and mess that must have been ! ! !	1
I went through 4 different bottle systems ( and a lot of $ $ ) - and I 'm sticking with Avent . Easy to clean - easy to use - no problems .	1
These are the best bottles ever ! They are a little `` pricey '' , but they are worth every penny . My baby gets very little air in her belly since we started with these bottles . They are heaven sent - my baby has a full happy little tummy !	1
I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often . When I get the chance I 'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump . I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this . One thing that all Avent users should know ... if you read the directions carefully for the pump , the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products . Doing so can cause the plastic to crack . I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer . That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work . Yes , they cost more than most bottles , but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results .	1
I admit it : I am impressed with Avent bottles ! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink . Example : microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes , pour a stream of recently boiled water ; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes . Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them , but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market ( the ones that best mimic the nipple , thus giving your baby the least gas , if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth ) . No wonder they 've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row !	1
I have been using these bottles for about 5 months now . I really like them . They do leak on occasion for me , usally when I do not have the top screwed on right . I find that if the seal between the nipple & the bottle is not right , then you will get a leak . I solve this problem by just unscrewing the nipple/lid and then rescrewing it on SLOWLY so I know it is getting a good tight even seal . This always works !	1
Wonderful bottles , as our daughter wo n't use anything else . Wish they were more narrow so she could hold them herself . Occasional leaking when shaking milk around or mixing a bottle of formula .	1
I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type . If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues . But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries . I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent . The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis . If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent . Only way to go .	1
This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement . It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me . I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle . And it has worked wonderfully -- my baby girl will feed from both without any problem . I love the shape of the bottles -- very comfortable to hold -- and they are extremely easy to clean . Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own , one of them has a leaking problem , but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap . My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple , as one person reported . These bottles are great !	1
Unlike a couple of reviews I read , the only times I 've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong . Otherwise , they are perfect . We were told that there may be & quot ; nipple confusion & quot ; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we have n't had a problem whatsoever . These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine . ( His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth , like the breast . ) I also use ( and love ) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple . It could n't be easier .	1
These bottles are superior to any on the market . One of my daughter 's had severe reflux and used the variable flow nipple so that she could have cereal in the bottle . Avent is the only bottle company that offers this specific type of nipple , which was a life saver . I tried using the Soothie bottles with my other daughter , because they were cheaper and she has no signs of reflux and I figured what the heck . Wrong decision ! She ended up with a soaked face and bib every time . Mind you , my little one is a health , full-term newborn with no latching problems . So I switched back to the Avent bottles . Feedings are now mess-free and pleasant ! As for the leaking issue , people should just take the time to read the directions . Avent clearly states in their directions that if you over tighten the nipple ring onto the bottle , it causes the nipple to wrinkle and the bottle leaks . The nipple ring just needs to be tight enough for the nipple to grab the bottle and seal . It is specifically designed to do this . It 's not product error , it 's user error .	1
I have had these bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old and his now 4 month old little brother . They work great and are very durable . These have been dropped , sterelized , boiled , thrown , kicked , bitten , EVERYTHING and they still hold up ! If you use the bottle correctly there are no leaks and it is very simple . They also work wiht the Avent Isis Breast Pump . My sons will only take to the `` natural '' nipple , and avents got it ! The flow is not too fast , nor is it too hard to get it to come out ! The available covers work nicely for carrying them and making sure the nipple is sanitary . The wide-neck allows for easy cleaning too , I never spend more than 2 minutes scrubing a bottle . They also are great for the `` Magic Cups '' , those are sippy cups with a soft spout that are no-spill , ( made by Avent ) , my 2 1/2 year old uses them and I dont have to buy a whole set of sippy cups because that top fits on any avent product ! These bottles also fit very well in almost any cup holder ( unlike the playtex ) and greatly reduce my little ones gassy problems . I love these bottles , and the ventair is second , but a VERY far second , Avent is deffinatly much much better and actually do what they say they do , REDUCE GAS ! What a lifesaver	1
I am breastfeeding but feel the need to have a back up plan in case I need to leave so I tried the Avent bottles on the recommendation of my sister . My 5-month old daughter took right to them . No nipple confusion ! They are the best ! Now I can be assured that she will be able to eat without me there !	1
I used these bottles with my son and loved them ! This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out . He took right to them as a newborn and I did n't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash . The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time . As my son got older , I had other bottles I would use for him , but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about , so I do n't know much about that . But there was absolutely no leaking here ! There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well , including sterilizers and breast pumps . Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her .	1
I absolutely love these bottles ! ! I 've been using them for about 4.5 months now and I 've NEVER had a problem with leaks ! ! ! ! I have also never overtightened the bottles ! ! I love how they are designed . Because of their width , my daughter was able to hold them at 3.5 months ! ! I also love their 'wide-neck ' , which makes it very easy to fill the bottle while holding a squirming baby ! They are also EXTREMELY easy to clean ! And they are interchangeable ! ! I plan on buying the sippy cup spout in a couple of months so that my daughther can learn to drink from a sippy cup using the same bottle ! ! ! My daughter has also never had colic ! ! I LOVE EM ! ! ! I LOVE EM ! ! ! I LOVE EM ! ! ! I also have the breast pump and microwave sterilzer which all fit the bottles perfectly ! !	1
I love these bottles . My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them . As for the leaking issue , it is Not the bottle , it 's the user ! Bottle use de-mystified : you MUST make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well ... ..then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal . If either are wet or have milk on them ( like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle ) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed . Motto : `` IF you do n't hear a squeak , it 's gon na leak '' . Good luck .	1
The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product . For those experiencing leaks , it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly . I have had no problems using these bottles , and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I 'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly . These are well worth the price paid . I have tried both Dr. Brown 's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these . Highly recommended by this mom ! Update March 06 : one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple , so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups ! They are leakproof , and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do . I have found them in Toys R Us , since my local Babies R Us does not carry them . Still a great product in my book !	1
Avent bottles are one of the best out there . Handy and easy to clean . They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats . But if your baby is really gasy and has colic , I recomend you the Dr brown bottles . I suggest you buy or register for both ( avent and dr brown ) so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent , and if not , you use dr brown ( at least for a while ) . You will notice the difference in a few weeks . But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies , so if you dont want to invest too much money in bottles , avent will do great .	1
these are wonderful , they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets . no other bottle compites with avent !	1
We think these bottles are very durable and easy to use . The markings did n't come off in the dishwasher , even after repeated washings . Also , Avent makes a long-spouted sippy top that fits on these bottles . Using this helps switch from bottle to cup .	1
We 've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old , and they work great . He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast . We 've had no problems with leaking , and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the # 1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby , since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you . So wait before buying # 2 & # 3 nipples , because you may not need them !	1
I bought these after trying the Dr. Brown 's system ( do n't waste your money there . ) I love Avent bottles and so does my daughter . Easy to assemble , wash and use . My daughter likes the easy to latch on nipple and I like being able to purchase faster flow nipples as needed . Good quality bottles , do n't leak and have easy to read oz./ml . measurements .	1
A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me . I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more . I did n't want to hassle with the disposable liners . I feel my baby does n't swallow as much air . A lot of babies are gassy and I would n't blame it on the bottle . I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow . I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down ; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer ( the first years ) excellent choice !	1
I was told that Avent bottles were the bottles to get and they were the only ones I ever gave to my son . I was very pleased with them right off , so I never bothered to try any others . He took the nipple right away and did not have any nipple confusion during the time I was both nursing and giving him a bottle . I have not had any problems with leaking . If the nipple is screwed on correctly , not a drop comes out while I shake it to mix up milk or formula . The wide mouth makes the bottles very easy to clean . I just use a bottle brush with warm , soapy water , then put the bottle , nipple and ring in my Avent steam sterilizer ( which I love ) . I have been using the bottles for seven months now and they are still in great shape.I have a friend who said her baby would not take the Avent nipples . Since Avent bottles are not universal and ca n't be used with other brands of nipples and rings , you may want to keep this in mind before you spend much money on a lot of them.I think that most babies start eating more than 4 ounces during their second month , so you probably wo n't need many of this size . I had seven bottles and that was the perfect amount for us . Although my son uses the 9 ounce bottles now , I still use some of the 4 ounce bottles to mix and store formula that I add to his cereal .	1
I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby 's life . Yes they WILL LEAK if you do n't pull the nipple all the way through . But that is an easy fix ! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast . And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old . I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups . They are very durable as well and so easy to clean . I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them .	1
I bought this pump mainly because were always out and about . I am actually a stay at home mom but this came in handy in MANY ways . When my daughter was first born she was re-admitted to the hospital at 3 days for jaundice . I had read that breat milk can increase or worsen jaundice so I pumped to save the milk for when she got out of the hospital . The ice packs were definatly a plus and so was the cooler bag . I had frozen just the bag to keep it cooler along with the ice packs and that really helped keep it colder longer . The bottles that comes with it are ok . I do n't recommend Avent bottles for feeding but for storage they 're perfect . But if you prefer Avent you can just pop a nipple on the bottle and wha-la , ready to feed . These bottles can go from pump , to fridge/freezer , to warmer , to bottle with not problem.As for the pump , once you get used to assembling it its a breeze . It 's also VERY comfortable to use with or without the & quot ; petals & quot ; . I NEVER had a problem with not pumping ( or producing ) enough milk . This also came in handy and quickly reduced engorgement for me . All I had to do was pump for about 5 min on each side and it was instant relief and baby latched on better.I highly recommend this pump for everyone . It 's comfortable , efficient , whisper quiet , and easy to clean and put together . A must have .	1
This is a great pump ... forget about spending over $ 60 on something you are not sure you are going to use too much ... NOT TO MENTION - now that I use this pump daily - I am still happy I did not spend the $ 260 for the 'Mack-daddy & quot ; - this is comfortable and fast and easy to work with .	1
My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life , and then the special care nursery the next few days , so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk . i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it . It HURTS my nipples . My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it . I LOVE it ! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old . I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze . It doesnt hurt my wrist ( as one might think . ) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night . It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump ! I LOVE IT ! Oh , and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other ! ! !	1
I mostly use the Ameda electric , but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume . I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks : it can be tricky to get the suction going , but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it . Also , I 've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I 'm done with the Isis . It is a little higher maintenance to clean , but I still recommend it .	1
It 's a great manual pump , but it 's just a manual pump after all . Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk . It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day . However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies ( like the time I forgot my other pump at home ) or for out-of-office meetings ( because it 's small and discrete ) . It 's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while . I 'm giving it 4 stars because I do n't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job .	1
This is a great pump . I have n't had any issues with it . I pump constantly as my son is very finicky as to when he wants a bottle or a breast in his mouth . Easy to use and clean . The carrying case is great for when I go back to work and it can also be used as a carrying bag for keeping milk/formula cold when you go out . While I love the pump I am not happy with the Avent Bottles . They can leak easily if you over or under tighten the bottle . Let me tell you at three in the morning you dont ' want to worry about that stuff . You want to get a nipple on and feed . I recommend the pump but not their bottles . Sometimes if I put down the pump on the bed and it tips a bit I get spillage from where the pump connects to the bottle .	1
I am a first time mother and a stay at home mom . Since I am not working I wanted a hand pump rather than electric for occasional night out so I got Isis . The first time I used it ( 1 week after giving birth ) , it took me 45 minutes to pump 1 1/2 oz ! I thought it to be terrible ! So I bought a Madela electric.But as months passed I got a little bit more experienced in breast feeding , I realized that if I knew how stimulate a `` let down '' that the Isis would have worked for me . It took me 45 minutes the first time I used Isis because I never had a let down . Unlike Madela which simulate a baby 's sucking which then stimulated a `` let down '' , with Isis it is up to me to get myself to `` let down '' .Isis would work great for any mother if : 1-you pump while your baby is breastfeeding on the other breast or 2-if you know how to stimulate your breast enough to stimulate a `` let down '' .My Isis did squeak when I used it , so beware if you plan on pumping with this in public if this sort of thing embarasses you .	1
This isis breast pump set is great . The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private . Besides that , its very conviencent to use and easy . I think , since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump .	1
I bought this pump after seeing the success a coworker had with the ISIS pump . I 'm back to work full time and it has been working very well for me . I started pumping at about 3 weeks , and was very fustrated at first . It was tricky to figure out the timing and how much suction to use to get a good let down and milk flow . After a few calls to the Avent customer service line ( who were wonderful , very helpful and patient ) , I was getting much better results . By the time I went back to work I had a very nice supply of milk in the freezer and was comfortable pumping at work.Why I like it - 1 ) it 's discrete , you can pump anywhere without the noise of an electic pump and the black case looks like any other professional bag a woman would carry 2 ) it 's portable , It 's small and light to carry around - even with a few bottles of milk . 3 ) it 's easy - not only to pump with but assembly and cleaning are a breeze . I know a few reviews state that there are too many parts and it 's hard to put together , but I can do it in 15 seconds flat 4 ) it 's comfortable - I think any breastpump may be awkward to use at first , but compared to an electric pump I tried my nipples and breasts were much more comfortable with the ISIS pumpI think for the price , you ca n't beat it . Also the realm of accessories available is impressive . Avent has thought of every possible need you may have .	1
I am sold on the Avent Isis Breast Pump -- it works great for me . I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months , and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him . He never really took on the bottle , but that 's a different story . Anyway , I just could n't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump -- maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding , I probably would have . But I was a stay at home mom and just used the pump to express every now and then . I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes , and it did n't hurt either -- it actually felt comfortable . I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child -- now that one was very uncomfortable -- it felt like it was sucking the life out of you . Maybe it was me being a first time mom , but I swore off that pump . I still nursed my first child for 13 months but not exclusively -- he got both breastmilk and formula.Now , I am on my 3rd child . I figured after having such an easy time breastfeeding my 2nd child , it would be a piece of cake the 3rd time around . Well , it was n't . She did not latched on properly and I got really sore within the first couple of days . But I did not want to give up breastfeeding , so I purchased another one of the Avent Isis Breast Pump , because I wanted to help increase my milk supply . It worked and I got to breastfeed again exclusively -- my baby was n't getting frustrated anymore because my milk supply increased . Then when she was 6 weeks old , I had to leave her ( unexpectedly ) to attend my father 's funeral in California . I could n't take her with me -- she was too young . I was gone for 3 days , and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down , so this pump helped a lot . I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone . And then I pumped while I was gone -- I did it on the plane restroom and airport restrooms very discretely , and I was done in about 15 minutes at a time . And because it is manual , I was able to express whenever and whereever I needed to . This helped me keep my milk supply while I was gone so when I got back , I just continued on like I was not gone . Thanks Avent .	1
Although I have n't been using this pump for very long , I 've been able to get very good results . Of course , pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners . It is very easy to set up and clean ... making it easy to take along . I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy ( and clean ) . I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day . I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side . I definitely recommend having a manual pump , even if you plan on or already have an electric .	1
Being a stay-at-home Mom , I do n't need to pump frequently , but when I do pump , this item is terrific ! Easy to use . I 'm able to pump a 4 oz . bottle in 5 minutes . I suggest using it without the let down massage cushion . It works better for me without it . Easy to clean and case makes storage easy .	1
I borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome ! This is my third child and I have breastfeed all three . I have tried them all and this one is great . The one-hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping ! I am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean ! What a great investment .	1
The Avent pump in this kit is very good . I also like the carrying bag , which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However , the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn ( when I tested the milk on my wrist , I did n't get a drop - it squirts ) . There are better bottles out there too , that keep the baby from getting too much air . Instead of the Avent bottles , I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser ( the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent ) . This has worked fine for me , though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit . Since I pump at work , the insulated bag is helpful .	1
I used this product briefly and found it to be great for the price . I used the electric Medella pump in the hospital and found this pump to be very comparable . I actually think the Isis may have been more comfortable . I would recommend to anyone who is considering breast feeding .	1
I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy . The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert , so I took that out and it helped a little bit . I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my `` let down '' and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I was n't pumping , while I kept pumping and answered phones ! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish . I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009 .	1
After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back . I could not control the suction with the electric pump and , however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total . The cushioning made the pump very comfortable . And my hand never got tired from manually pumping . I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child . I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up : My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump . Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers .	1
When my son was put in the NICU , he immediately stopped nursing . I 'm assuming it was due to the stress . While I was at the hosptal , I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump , but at home , I was pumping full time with this pump . It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides , which can be very upsetting , especially if you 're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get . You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright . Do n't tilt it at all ! I did n't have any problems with creaking , and if I did , I 'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container , but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out . Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it ( full time ) for a month and a half . The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle . I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips ( great customer service , by the way ! ) . They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar ... and viola ! Problem solved . If you use it as much as I did , the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly , I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag . It takes talent , I tell you ! My advice is this : Remember how it was packaged in the first place ! Before you take it out of the bag , take note of how it 's arranged . After several attempts , I finally got it all back in.All in all , it 's a great pump if you do n't want to invest in an electric pump , or if you 're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues . In those instances , I 'd definitely recommend it ! I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well , and overall , I 'd suggest paying the extra money and get an electric if you 're working or having to pump full time , or you just want more convience.I hope this review helps , as I wanted it to be my best , considering all the experience I 've had with so many pumps !	1
I received this as a shower gift and boy am I thankful ! After I returned from the hospital and my milk came in , boy was I engorged ! ! I had n't expected to have to use this until I actually went back to work , but I was hurtin bad and was so greatful I had this already . I do n't know what I would have done if I did n't have one yet-probably exploded ! I went back to work as my son turned 2 months old . I wanted to continue breastfeeding , and this has helped me do just that . I work in a small office with nothing but a handful of men ... with one bathroom ! So I did n't want an electric one where everyone could hear an odd humming sound coming from the closed door . With this one , I can discreetly pump in the bathroom for about 10 minutes . It expresses the milk pretty fast in my opinion and it does n't really hurt . Maybe because my nipples are toughened up now . It 's great to store the milk in if you need to or for the ride home . It keeps it at a good temperature until you can get to a refridgerator again ( I do n't use the cold packs ) .All in all , this is a great breast pump set in every way.Something else that is great is that I own the Avent Microwave Steam Sterilizer and it has slots especially for the Avent pump to click into-and Avent bottles . It only takes 4 minutes in the microwave to have everything sterilized . Awesome all the way around !	1
Two of my friends used this one daily and recommended it to me . One of them went back to work and bought Medela just for pumping at work . I simply got this set to use both at home & work , and am I glad that I did n't need electric pump to express milk quickly - with ISIS , I can get 1 oz foremilk in less than a minute ! Of course it takes a little longer for hindmilk because the pressure from the breast is less by then . On average it takes less than 10 minutes to pump 4-5 oz.I was back to work 2 weeks ago & have been using it twice a day . Before this I used it 1-2 times a day to pump a ounce or so foremilk for 6 weeks , and it works very well for me . All the parts are sturdy . You just have to make sure that you do n't turn the connecting `` neck '' while pumping , else you 'll drop the bottle ! The numerous parts are a little daunting to assemble in the beginning , but you 'll be an expert in no time . Just be careful with the little white valve when washing the parts , without it the pump wo n't work . But the kit does have extra valves.The insulated carrying bag is attractive and discrete . There 's even a non-transparent drawstring pouch for storing breastmilk-filled bottles in the common fridge at work where everyone keeps their lunches ! The included bottles , nipples etc represent extra values.I 'm extrememly pleased with this Avent product and have also bought Avent Microwave Express Sterilizer in which the ISIS pump parts can be sterilzed.Jan 3,2003 : I 've been working full time and nursing for the past 4.5 months using Isis exclusively . I 'm so happy to report that it 's been working great for me without any problems at all . My now 6.5 month old daughter is at a healthy 65 percentile .	1
I love my Isis . A friend bought it to me as a gift and I use it everyday . First it was a little hard , but it was only because my milk was n't coming out at all . But after my production started , the pump started to work perfectly . Highly recommended : )	1
it 's THE best item you can buy ! practical , easy to carry , easy to store.maybe , it should come with 3 9oz bottles and 1 4oz , instead of 2 and 2 ; becuase babies rapidly start needing more and more ... also all mags that come with these items are great , with great tips , some of them are not even included in m. stoppard 's book ! very useful.i STRONGLY recommend this item !	1
This pump is comfortable , easy to use , and affordable . I wish I could find replacement parts more easily - my only complaint .	1
I pump just as fast from this pump as I do from the electric hospital grade one that I rented for the first month ! Of course , you can only pump one side at a time , but I actually like haveing the other hand free to read or email.The AVENT instructions say that some users can use the pump without the `` cushion . '' I did it this way first because when I was putting it together I did not see the petal cushion . It worked great . When I later found the petal cushion , and tried it - the pump did not work as well for me . So if you are having problems with the pump try it without the cushion . I think it has something to do with your size and the suction as to which works best . The hospital grade electric pumps did not have cushions , so that was what I was used to anyway.My only complaint is that the star vaulve is annoying . It sometimes falls out - while pumping and suction is lost and you have to take the whole thing apart to put the star vaulve back in . For this reason , I like the cheapo Medela hand pump a little better.But for all you out there deciding between electric and manual - I am one user telling you that I get EXACTLY the same results with this manual as with an electric . ( 4 to 6 ounces in 15 to 20 minutes )	1
I have been using this twice a day since going back to work almost four months ago . With it I can express milk discreetly and quickly . I can get between 7 and 10 ounces in 10 minutes . I have never used an electric pump so I ca n't compare but if you are looking for a manual pump this one is perfect .	1
I bought other more expensive racks . This one is the best . Simple and goes with all kitchen decor , love it .	1
I was looking for a small drying rack for Sigg water bottles and this is perfect . It has two different sized adjustable arms so that you can arrange it to suit your needs . Also , not pictured , is a little attachment for tops and lids .	1
This thing is pretty good for a bottle drying rack , comes with a little shelf for drying nipples , Sturdy , drains well , allows you to make different configurations in consideration of your bottle sizes . I like the size because it is n't huge butcan dry several bottles . COmes with a kinda flimsy bottle brush , will be a back up . Good product .	1
Using it for all the baby items - pacifiers , nipples , etc ... Holds the items well , easy to put them on . Wish it could fold up and fit in the cupboard when we are n't using it , then would give it 5 stars .	1
This is small , sturdy , and great for the price . It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some . I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones . It does the job well .	1
I wanted a small rack to dry my granddaughters bottles and accessories - and this works nicely . Holds the right amount , drains right into the sink and also has a small hook on tray for drying items that wo n't fit on one of the & # 34 ; stems & # 34 ; . Just what I wanted .	1
Sticks well and comes with a bunch of additional adhesive stickers .	1
This a necessary item . I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof ( I even avoided it for a while ) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed . It came with the corners which is great . The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put . My baby has tried to pull at it and it does n't come off.This color is light enough that does n't call too much attention in my living room .	1
I have purchased what feels like 100 ft of this stuff to protect my son who is quite a climber and runner.Overall I would say this is the best stuff but loses on star because sometimes that double sided sticky tap does n't stick right.But you ca n't go wrong and should buy this to give yourself some piece of mind	1
These edge guards come in handy in a number of places . They stick very well , even on uneven surfaces . They are easy to cut and to mount exactly where needed . The variety of colors is also nice to try and match various types of furniture or hazards . I 've deployed them in some areas for my own protection too ... I 've stubbed my toe one too many times on my bed leg in the dark heading to change a diaper ... put a piece on each corner , and saved several swear words as a result ! They 've saved the day in several spaces : - Fireplace hearth ( even on uneven red brick they stick well ) - Underside of dining room table edges and corners- Edges of dressers and furniture- Edges of bedpostThey include 3M adhesive that sticks very well . My only complaint is that they provide the adhesive in strips rather than a roll . So you have to pull of many pieces and join them together on a long strip . For best grip you need to put it on each side of the inside & # 34 ; L & # 34 ; of the protectors . A roll would be much faster to apply .	1
I have only owned this for a few days but I love it so far . It 's very cushion-y and very soft . It has already prevented my child from a scrape . It comes with a bunch of different sizes of tape as well . Its double sided and seems to be holding up .	1
So easy to install too ! I did the corners first so it was easier . You have enough tape for every square inch .	1
I would have been okay with just the table corners . I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table . There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though . It 's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also , my niece is still crawling so the guard was n't necessary . Even when she stood up , she could n't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair .	1
This item , it is so good . it protected my 10 month old son from many bruises . Baby crawls without looking what is ahead , he hit the coffee table edge mostly , but I have this on the edge ... It is very helpful to have it on the sharp edges . I wanted to tape all the corner of my house .	1
I have used it on both a glass-topped table & wooden crib . It was easy to put on & has been very durable , despite the best efforts of my very active 1 year old ! Very functional & economical .	1
i reviewed similar product from this company before . it is a good product which can absorb force well so all in all it serves it purpose well.One thing it can improve on is the adhesive glue used for bonding . Currently it uses 3M tapes , which is okay but over time a child 's curiosity will grow they will pick on it and over a period of two months of picking it may come off . But they give you plenty of 3M tapes , so you can put it together again .	1
Easy to apply , stays on , and is perfectly cushioned for protecting little heads ( and also great for teething ! ) Make sure your table is clean , you might even want to go over the edges with rubbing alcohol . If your table is dirty , it wo n't stick as well ! I 've seen some reviews saying that it 's not very attractive ... of course it is n't ! That 's not what it 's made for . We love this , and highly recommend it !	1
With an adventurous and slightly clumsy baby , these have gone a long way towards avoiding bruises and bumps while she learns to walk and run . The ability to cut the padding and included double sided sticking tape with scissors make it easy to pad sharp furniture edges of all lengths . However there are a couple of things we have found that help us optimize its usage . We learned to make sure the ends of any piece were very well stuck down and did n't jut out otherwise our baby would pick at them and start peeling off the padding - to avoid this , it helped to put double-sided tape all the way to the end of the piece on both inner edges . Also we did n't use the precut edges because we found that our baby managed to rip them off pretty easily and then tried to eat the backing tape.Just be aware that if your baby is teething , the spongy texture of the padding makes it tempting for them to bite on . I 'm not 100 % comfortable with that as it is fire retardant-treated despite being labeled non-latex and non-toxic . For now I just wipe them down several times with hot water and dry well or try to put other more tempting teethers within reach .	1
Nice bumpers . Very soft and easy to place . The only down fall is that they may be too soft . My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up !	1
This is pretty simple to put in place and not too much of an eyesore as childproofing goes . I 'd recommend it .	1
I like it . It is nice . It sticks nicely . and soft . Not worried about baby 's head hitting the table anymore . Thank you .	1
I gave it only four stars because the item arrived with some of it missing , that was however resolved.The product does what it is supposed to .	1
My crazy bruiser has made this probably the best baby purchase I made . Does n't come unstuck like the crappy clear one I tried before.sticks to my wood coffee table and glass trim on tv stand.Have n't tried to take it off yet so I do n't know what that 's going to be like but it was def worth it .	1
I bought thisPrince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners , Greyin hope of protecting my son from bumps on our coffee table . Well i procrastinated and did n't put it up till this week . My son is 10 months and is full blown running so it was time . problem was i could not find the adhesive to attach the thing to the table . So i improvised . We measured the foam and cut accordingly to make it a tight fit . we then attached the corner pieces to the cut out parts using gorilla glue and then clear packing tape to re-enforece the hold . finally we put it on the table , it has just enough give to put on and off but not enough that LO will pull it off easily and huge plus for us ... no damage to our pottery barn table ! once i get so me photos i will attach but for the moment it is serving its purpose and we are very happy ! another plus we had about 6 inches left over that we used to cover our desk pull out keyboard thing . ca n't beat that .	1
We LOVE Prince Lionheart products . We decided to get the edge guards . This are awesome around our coffee table , end tables and entertainment center . The are soft and fit perfectly .	1
Great Idea and has helped out alot as our son seems to always be bumping his head on stuff in the near vicinity of him . However the glue on this device could be a little stronger because soon after applying it to what ever you need it on , our son figured out how to pull it off and now it wo n't stay on !	1
I used this product on our fireplace to cover up the sharp edges but it does n't stick very well to natural stone . So occasionally I have to re-stick it once it comes loose . Other than that it looks great and helps protect my baby from injury .	1
I just put this up yesterday and was glad I did . My daughter been using the coffee table to pull her self up to stand and also been crawling through it to play with the stuff underneath . Just right after I put it on she was doing that ! She even bumped her head on the edge ! Thank god this was on so she was fine ! Not sure how it would work on a walking/running baby into corners/edges . But this seem to be doing well . It 's nice and thick.The tape that came with it is n't that sticky though . It makes it easy to stick and restick back on so you get it on good . But at the same time , I fear my daughter would figure out that she can pull it off.I 'll see how that goes but so far I 'm content with this.Cutting the roll itself seems a bit annoying . because I ca n't seem to get a STRAIGHT edge using a scissor .	1
Very cushioned . They stick fairly well , but a toddler could peel them off if motivated . I 'm not wild about the brown color , but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense . We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck . The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed . I 've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more .	1
I think my daughter would pull off any table corner I put on , but this one at least seems the most sturdy and is easy to put back on when she does pull it off . The chocolate is the closest color we could get to our espresso tables , nothing is going to look great , but this at least looks decent and clean .	1
Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore ! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners . Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible !	1
This a great product . Also it would be good if you could buy plastic cover for the top of the crib railling .	1
This edge and corner set is a great value . We started with just corners and found we missed a lot of other dangerous areas , including a knee-high tall toy chest with thick drawers . This set was perfect to secure the entire thing . It was easy to trim and apply . I prefer the gray to the chocolate for lighter woods . Its sort of a cement tan color . Its very dense foam , so if you press down pretty hard you still wont feel sharp edge . Good product .	1
People seem to have unrealistic expectations of products sometimes . They want it to stick like crazy YET not hurt their furniture . There is a balance there that you have to have . You ca n't have everything . I bought this to try to cover some of the worst corners . You ca n't cover everything , but we have to make an effort since our 10 month old is scooting around now . He has n't paid any attention to the padding nor tried to pull it off YET . And we have n't had to remove any to see if it hurts our furniture . It does n't make the furniture look great by any means , but it is what it is . I care more about the safety than the aesthetics of my furniture . The padding should be sufficient to stop minor bumps and bruises . I 'm satisfied for the moment ... I 'll update if that changes.I deducted a star because I ordered beige and got chocolate ... not worth the hassle to return it . On a second order , we did get the beige but it is darker than they make it look in the photo . Neither was a HUGE deal to us , but I could see this mattering to people wanting to match their furniture more .	1
We have used this edging and corners on several pieces of furniture . It serves it purpose well . However , our son just started pulling the trim off so we have had to replace the adhesive a few times . Overall a good product .	1
I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that : ( I was hesitant to buy this , though , because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile . It sticks really well- we 'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile . It really does n't look cheesy at all . We 're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I 've already checked the color there too . Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood , but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper . This stuff gives a perfect fit since it 's cut to fit . The expandable thing does n't fit the sizes listed ( no way it will work on a 90 inch table ) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s .	1
We have a raised stone hearth fireplace . It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby . It is super easy to put on , works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears , bumbs , cuts , bangs , etc . if this wasnt on our fireplace . We 've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well .	1
Sticks amazingly well and cushions nicely . The straight pieces can easily be made into corner pieces , since four corners go quickly .	1
Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut , but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and did n't have any problem whatsoever . Also , the foam is a bit stretchy , so your measurements do n't have to be exact . I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit . While it 's true that the tape wo n't last forever , it is also true that it wo n't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently . Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down . Easy !	1
This took care of our immediate need - PROTECT THE BABY 'S HEAD . : ) This was easy to put around our oblong coffee table and did n't leave too bad of a sticky mess when we needed to remove it . I 'm not sure if he ever really hit his head on the table but if he did , we either missed it or it did n't hurt - thanks to the bumper !	1
Good quality but it only covers the top part of the corner so it is still dangerous for baby to get up .	1
I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop . Since I do n't have kids yet ( we are adopting ) I ca n't really comment about the durability . However , they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam . If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It was n't difficult to cut the foam to length . I just started with one corner edge , measured the long foam piece , and then cut the foam with scissors ( just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed . It cut slightly jagged , but since I cut on the long side adjusting it was n't a problem . The finish product does n't look funny or leave any gaps at all .	1
A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape is n't that great , and it isn't- but so far it 's not a problem . The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick , but the guard works great . A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby : )	1
Love the ease of use , color , and cushions very well for my clumsy baby . I have it guarding edges of my glass TV stand and it works great !	1
We purchased these edge guards just to be cautious but , once my son became mobile , we were thankful for these edge guards . Our son has clipped his chin , run around corners and hit his head and even bit the sides of the furniture when teething . What a great baby proofing item .	1
We bought 2 sets , used on window sill , formica edges and corners , and along mirrored wall edges ... we suggest not putting tape in guard but putting on the surface first , then slowly rolling the guard over the tape in a straight line .	1
I got this set to edge our stone hearth , and the color is a nice neutral beige/taupe . The adhesive has stood up to 18 months of abuse by my toddler and pre-schooler . No lifting or peeling . The seams blend nicely together where the corners and straight pieces meet , and its discreet and does n't scream & # 34 ; BABY PROOFING ! & # 34 ; Highly recommended .	1
We used these with my first daughter and bought them again for the 2nd . They stick well and are very helpful with the sharp corners . Use more sticky stuff than you think you need . Also , after a year on my entertainment center , I was able to take everything off with a little elbow grease !	1
This worked perfectly for our fireplace . It fit snugly and firmly . There was plenty of adhesive tape for the entire length , which I know was a concern for other similar products . The coloring was a nice neutral match as well .	1
We were able to cover the edge at Grandma 's house with ease . Cuts easy , tape is sticky and has n't peeled off . My daughter has tried to peel off a part , and we just stuck it back on and it 's still sticking and working just fine .	1
Provides the right amount of cushion . My son was pulling up on furniture by 5 months but was very clumsy . This product was great and came with lots of strong double sided tape .	1
The table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a 1 '' space in the center of each length works great . The triplets climb all over the living and always come back to the table to play . It looks good and you do n't even notice its there .	1
We have a big fireplace and this fit it , with some left over . It 's easy to install but , keep in mind that your baby can easily pull this off of whatever it 's attached to but , you do n't want something that is going to stay on forever . Great product , Great price !	1
so glad we put these on when we did . My 11 mo old daughter has bumped her head many-a-time since we put these on our tables and shelves about 3 months ago , and has not been hurt once . They are still sticking strong too .	1
Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape .	1
These were easy to install and are aesthetically bearable . We 'll see how easily my 8-month old will pull them off , but so far they are holding even though we 've had some climbing onto them and such . I do wish that it came with a LOT more tape so that when it does come off I can just put it back on .	1
I 'm just worried for when i need to remove it ! I might be purchasing new tables ? I even used it on a wall corner near the play area . Stays fine . My son even tried chewing on it w his new sharp teeth . It held up . He was not able to puncture it !	1
I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son 's playroom . The window was level with the daybed he often played on , and I had visions of him cracking his head . I lined the edges of the windowsill . This works well . My son is a pretty good listener , and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off , it was there for a reason , and it is still there two months later . It will come off very easily if pulled , just a forewarning . But I like this product and would use it again .	1
I got this when musings started crawling so I would be ready when he started walking and I 'm glad I did . This product works great on my entertainment center and my lower window sills . The product sticks great and my little one ca n't pull them off . Just this morning he walked over to the window and fell and hit his head on the sill and he did n't get hurt . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones .	1
I bought a Safety First Foam Edge Bumper from Wal-Mart for the SAME price as this that was only about 5ft and did n't have corners , and it was already cut into strips . That was a HUGE mistake . Comparing this set to the one I bought , it wins in every category . It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners , you can cut it to whatever size you need , it bends around curves , and It 's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper ! I love it , and it 's perfect . It STICKS ! It 's 3m brand double-sided tape and it did n't budge ! I suspect people who said it does n't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly , touched the tape too much , or maybe had a textured surface . I could n't pull mine off , so I know my 9 month old ca n't .	1
This edge guard is very easy to put on and sticks very well . Its very soft as well . Would recommend .	1
I put this on my coffee table and it works great . Seems pretty secure and there will be no split foreheads with this stuff on the edges !	1
We used this for our fire place . There is a raised seat and we used two of the corners and covered the edges . So far it has stuck well and I feel so much better not having to worry about our little guy falling into the sharp edge . Our fire place is tile and the color blends in well !	1
Easy to put up , takes a bit of time , but overall fairly easy ! Was n't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it , but I look at it this way ... . I 'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it ( my coffee table ) has caused ! ( I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old ) I 'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one ! Personally I hate this coffee table , but my husband will not get rid of it ... I put this protector on my fire place too , and it looks and feels wonderful . I like that it streches a bit , and I had plenty of adhesive left over ! I rate this product 4 stars , definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product !	1
We use this on the bottom edge of our coffee table because the baby loves to crawl underneath and then he hits his head on the way out . This sticks well and he really has not hurt his head since we put it on . It does the job !	1
This stuff works great for baby proofing . Have had it on our coffee tables and other sharp edges for over a year . Still in place and working . Has saved my son from some nasty bumps and bruises many times . Totally worth it . Wish it came in black .	1
I have an espresso wooden rectangular coffee table . I bought two sets of these and they are working perfectly ! They come with 3M adhesive tape and attach securely . For some reason , even when I measure and lay out the tape carefully the strips always were cut a little too short so I had to cut a few filler pieces for the spaces between some of the corners and the edging . I applied the edge guard on both the top of the table and the lower table that sits close to the ground.My little one was making us so nervous from hitting her head on this thing before so now we do n't have to sit there with our hands over the corners when she plays around it ! I know she will fall and bump her head from time to time but I think this could help prevent a serious accident . When I googled some babyproofing options for coffee tables I read a lot of stories about some really gory coffee table accidents so I do think this is worth it even if they are n't the most attractive thing in the world !	1
Great product ! The foam is thick and durable ! It has stayed in place for the most part . The corner pieces tend to easily come off with a little one around . I would still recommend !	1
I bought this for multiple purposes and it worked perfectly for all . The only con is that it is a bit pricey . Overall , definitely worth the price.-Corner pieces used separately on corners of tables without the longer strips : This does n't look great but compared to the other clear plastic or silicone corner pieces I have much greater piece of mind with these . They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he does n't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step : I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length . It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear . This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal , it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given . The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product . *FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE : Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes . THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables . You 'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar . I covered a large coffee table for around $ 3 and some blue painters tape .	1
Bought this item to line the corners of the coffee table , side tables , and fire place . It has worked out nicely and did not have any problem w/ the double sided sticky . You can customize the padding by cutting them .	1
My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive . Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious . But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily . It become furniture . I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint ( especially wall paint ) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ; )	1
Works great . Takes some time to put the adhesive strips on , but these work so much better than other brands we have tried . Also , they are soft enough to prevent bruises when they do fall into them .	1
This blends well with our coffee table and kept my little one safe . The real test will be when we take it off - will it peal off the wood from the furniture ?	1
These work for small corner surfaces . If you have a large surface to cover , like a table corner , make sure that you cut the strip in half . If you put it on as one long strip it will fall off . Works good for coffee tables .	1
my baby has been not intrigued enough to pull this out . I have it even on the wall corners in my house . It has given me more peace of mind to let him walk without worrying too much.I have brown ones on my wood so it looks better .	1
Good quality product . Lots of cusion and sticks well . We had a hard time getting it to stick to our fireplace because it has wood around the brick hearth and the corners are n't flat . But we used it for other things in our house and my son ca n't just peel it off like other products . Thank you !	1
These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she & # 34 ; cruises & # 34 ; around our coffee table . They come with a good amount of adhesive tape , which is why I purchased this brand over others . It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides . Once I put it on both sides , it works much better . Because this item is also a bit & # 34 ; stretchy & # 34 ; it was tricky to measure it exactly right . So , we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically is n't great , but it still protects my daughter . If I had the time and money , I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now , but it works fine .	1
Quite simply this product does what it says . I accidentally ordered 2 packs and in brown but I like it anyway . Just gives me peace of mind to now that if my daughter should bump into a table corner the blow will be cusioned	1
Clean your coffee table or whatever well for the sticky to stick especially on a round glass table top . Protects the kiddo 's noggin pretty well !	1
I have tried tons of different bumpers and my favorite is prince lionheart , it is easy to apply and is nice looking as well .	1
My daughter 's bed had sharp edges and she once bumped her head pretty bad and didnt want to sleep in her bed anymore . So I brought this to resolve that issue and prevent further damage -- works well .	1
These bumpers work well on our wooden coffee table . Our daughter has already hit her head on the edge and she was not injured at all . They 're ugly , but I 'm not sure how a bumper could be more attractive . They were easy enough to install and I found that the adhesive worked fine , although I have not tried to remove it yet .	1
So far , my 9 month old has n't tried to pull this off . It seems pretty stuck with the tape they gave you . It has stuck really well onto our fireplace ( which is small , square , not totally even tile ) for 2 weeks now . This brand is MUCH better than the Cosmos brand , also sold here on Amazon . The corners fit better , and the tape works a lot better .	1
This product works rather well . It is easy to apply to furniture and it remains in place . I highly recommend it .	1
This comes highly recommended in my family . My brother used these for my nephews and keeps them on things because his niece ( my daughter ) is now toddling about . I like them , they do n't hurt your furniture ( do n't sue me if they hurt yours , but they did n't hurt mine or my brother 's ) . This is often the difference between a quizzical look and a meltdown .	1
This product comes with special double-sided sticky tape to attach the guards . It & # 699 ; s easy to apply to the inside of the guards and easy to attach to the corners and surfaces that you want to use . For us we have an extremely sharp edge in our shower and baby crawls around so we didn & # 699 ; t want him to slip and fall on the edge . We put the guard on the edge and it stays even though it gets wet every day as we shower . I used the table corners for the corners of low window sills that are in his play area and it works well to protect him from falling on them and doubles as a teether . lol He loves chewing on it ! It & # 699 ; s a very soft , spongy material . Hopefully there & # 699 ; s no BPA in it because it & # 699 ; s constantly in my son & # 699 ; s mouth !	1
Needed this item for our brick fireplace and decided to give it a shot despite some saying that the double sided adhesive tape did n't work well . I assumed we would try it and then rig something else up ( velcro , etc ) if it did n't work . It has been one month and the included adhesive tape is working very well . My 11 month old goes up to it and tries to chew it ( for all the chew toys that child has ? ! ) and it stays put no problem . Time will tell how long it lasts , but I am happy with the density of the edge guard and how well it went on that even if I did have to do some reworking of the adhesive in the future I would still be happy with the quality of the edge guard as well as the safety the product provides .	1
This is a great product for protecting your babies ! We loved its quality and baby proofed our entire living room with it !	1
This edge guard worked out pretty well for our needs . Since we have an old , beat-up coffee table , it did n't really affect the looks of our furniture much . Baby was able to pry off the corner edges after just a month or so ( of course , the corner edges are where she hurts herself mostly ) . And it does leave behind some pretty substantial sticky bits when it comes off , I 've just been too lazy to clean it up with anything yet . Overall a good investment .	1
We like the product and works very well . It 's a little pricey but overall good product . We have purchased several .	1
soft foamy , with double side tape . seems a bit old perhaps , because when I unroll it the foam is showing stress marks from being rolled up too long , and appears to crack from being dry rot ? but it 'll do for now . lets see how long it lasts .	1
I wish I had two ! One to use , while the other is washing ! It seems as soon as I take off my baby 's diaper , it 's then she decides to `` go '' .I read other reviews about complaints of color fading and shrinkage . Well , I have had NO color fading and the shrinkage has been minimal , and certainly not to the degree others had mentioned . I have washed the cover over and over on hot and then let it air dry instead of putting it in the dryer . Maybe that 's why I havent had so much of a shrinkage problem . Regardless , it fits the contoured pad fine still , a bit snugger but not at all too small.I would have given it 5 stars if the terrycloth they used had been a higher quality . I mean really , for the price , I could have bought a better made towel that had emblishments that cost more than the cheap elastic they used to make the cover . I would have even paid more to have the choice between this terrycloth and a better one.Finally , I still am very pleased and would purchase it with the contoured changing pad for a friend 's baby shower too !	1
This works well with the contour changing pad . It fits a little snugly , so the corners of the pad do n't exactly stay as `` pointy '' as they were when it was new , but it works very well . It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad . You 're right there with baby , anyway .	1
I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover ! I purchased the lilac , and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor . I only wish I got more that two ! These terrycloth covers are thick , absorbant and easy on my newborn 's skin . The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them . So , when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight , but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size . When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more ! I mean it 's terrycloth , what do ya expect ? Besides , the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day . They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is . They are totally worth the money to replace ! I would buy them again !	1
Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old . I 'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller , but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each , my double stroller was only 30 bucks ! It handles well . When you put the connectors on , make sure they 're tight , and even so it will seem like there 's too much slack for it to really move , but it does work . Just give it a go . : )	1
I connected two different brands , a double jeep and single ( ? brand ) which are two different heights . It was slightly difficult especially since the double did n't have much room to put the middle connector on.. but it works ! It 's not like a SMOOTH push or anything ( but it is smooth with same size/brand ones , I have another same brand single lol ) , but it 's worth it ! Love !	1
I was a bit hesitant to buy this booster , although it came highly recommended . I felt like it was overpriced and essentially offered nothing ... boy , was I wrong ! I 've been using this booster for 2 years now . It has been used by my 3.5 year old and his 2 year old brother . Both of them LOVE it . The seat is comfortable for them to sit on , unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it . It does n't slide around on the chair , and it is SO easy to clean . I also like that it is easy to take along if we 're headed to grandma 's house . No extra straps , trays , or pieces to worry about ! I do n't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use ... it is well worth the money !	1
After tiring of wiping up trays that did n't stay put , straps that could n't be cleaned completely and levers that did n't operate easily , we tossed our high chair and booster seats for this absolutely WONDERFUL little seat . Made of an interesting foamy material , it actually stays where you put it on a chair so your little one can eat like a `` big person '' at the table with you . The surface wipes clean easily , it 's portable and comes in its own plastic carry case so you can toss it in the car to bring along to restaurants ( who wants to use a filthy universal high chair that maybe 1000+ kids have spilled on before yours ? ? ) Your child will love the comfy feel , the secure bottom and the colors ! We bought ours in the store and there was a choice of Aqua , Red , Black , Royal Blue and Purple . The price is right in line with other toddler feeding contraptions , and this one will grow with your child till they are old enough to sit without a booster . There are no straps on this seat , however , so do n't expect to prop a baby inside ... your child must be at least 18 months old OR old enough to sit still while eating and not topple out .	1
My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays ( ie . Tot-Loc , First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat , and First Years Folding Booster ... all great products by the way ) She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl , and she did n't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays . We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here , we decided to give it a try , but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child . Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster . The booster wipes clean very easily , sticks to the chair very well , and the seat itself is non-slip , so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters . Best of all , the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table ( much better fit than the hard plastic boosters ) and she appears to be much more comfortable ( not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now ) . This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better . Also , the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch , and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster . We 're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years , and since it 's so portable , we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention , I would n't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and does n't like to sit still . My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied , but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age , I would n't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in .	1
This is the best booster seat . It `` grips '' easily to chairs and does not slide . We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it ! It is the most durable seat too . My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition . It is soft and comfy . It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it . It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat . Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids ! Definitely a must have !	1
My 2 1/2 year olds highchair was terrible , so I threw it out on his first b-day . This chair is great , but I dont see anything miraculous going on.PROS-* Very comfortable , my son always says everything should be like cooshie* All one solid piece of foam , bo creveces to get food stuck in* It doesnt slip due to the material , a plus for a wiggly toddler* Sits him up high enough to eat* Can be easily taken off , no straps and all that stuff* Cute color , not bright and pastely* Very light weightCONS-* Is not at all portable , I dont know about you but I wouldnt want to `` travel '' with something the size of a large platter everywhere ! * The `` carry case '' is cheap and really the size of a diaper bag ... uhh sorry I already have one of those* leaves his feat dangling , although this is a problem occuring in MANY booster seatsThis is just a booster . I like it and I am glad I chose it but I dont really understand the amazing changes in children with a booster ( not that I am denying the fact that those reviews are true ) I just dont see how this cooshie could do it . My son is still fussy , and will get down when he feels like it , this comfortable booster doesnt stop him . He loves his booster and loves being a big bow v.s sitting in a highchair like his little brother	1
For the older toddler , this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays . The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable , even when strapped around the chair . The trays do n't leave enough room for a bigger child 's legs . However , this booster seats is soft and cushiony . It feels stable on wood chairs , and it allows the child to sit at the big people 's table . Obviously , it 's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess , but it 's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl . The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it 's not attached to the adult chair .	1
We love this booster . My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so . We have solid oak chairs and did n't have the problem of other reviewers . It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there 's no residue . Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing . Your chair does need to be made of something to `` grip '' this chair , such as a wooden chair . I tried to take it to my dad 's house and he has cooshy leather chairs , and it did n't work . It cleans extremely easily , holds him securely , and works better than I could have expected .	1
This is a great product . They do what they are supposed to do , at least on my desk . My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate , with a very smooth surface , so these things stick very well . However , I have not attempted to take them off yet , and i 'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone ' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes . I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish , but then again you ca n't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury , which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner ! For this 'peace of mind ' , I give this product 5 stars . One more thing ... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision .	1
I must have a newer version because mine stick just fine . I have very sharp corners on the bottom of my kitchen counters and these guys do the job . They are so much thicker and cushionery than the other versions ( pricey though ) , but I think they 're worth it . No more bumped heads !	1
I love these . I have n't had to take them off the table so I ca n't speak to the residue part , but these are snug and protective .	1
I 'm not judging anyone else , but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off . I guess my daughter never tried very hard , but they are really stuck tight . I 've had one set for about 14 months , and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago , and they 're not going anywhere . I ca n't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood , since I 've never tried to take them off . They do n't look too bad either , since the dark color matches most of my furniture . I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood .	1
I just put these on some sharp corners in my house and they are great . The tape is sticking well so far and they have already protected my son 's head . He moves so fast right to where the furniture is . I watch him and move him away , but it makes me feel better to have these there just in case . I needed the jumbo size for the bottom of my entertainment center .	1
When a baby gets to the crawling stage , your life changes . Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well . There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges , but in most cases , this is enough . I only wish they were a little less obvious . Unless you have very light wood furniture , these things stick out like a sore thumb . My only concern is that there is an adhesive ( that supposedly comes right off ) . Many months from now I suppose I 'll find out if that is true , but in the meantime I have ( relative ) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1 .	1
I ordered these corner guards for my TV stand and coffee table and they work great , the only down fall is if your furniture is n't as thick as the guard the sides do n't stick very well because they are n't flat against a surface like they are on the top .	1
I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well . My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again . They are large with good cushion and will do its job . The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months , they are still there on all three corners . I would recommend but of course , if your child is persistent , I am sure he/she would get it off eventually . So far , so good .	1
We love this product . Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we do n't have to listen to the same lullaby 's all the time ( if at all ) .The light is dim , but as a few others noted , who wants a bright light ? The baby is trying to sleep ! It 's enough light to see him if I peek in and it 's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough . It is a crib cd player , not a house cd player . It 's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery , and i 've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange , and if it does take that much power , it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next model : ) overall we 're very pleased though .	1
I really like this CD player . I do not understand why it has such a low review . *Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light . It is a nightlite . It is just fine . I can check on baby and see him fine . *The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine . I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep . *The timer function if great . *The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up . It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out . Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this . *As far as the CD 's ckipping when hit , I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib . No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip . ***It is not perfect but it does the trick ! ***	1
I love my cd player . My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep ... at night and for naps . I like it cause it shuts off itself . I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder , ... but it truly is worth buying !	1
We 've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1 ) Fairly easy to clean , integrated design . Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2 ) Built in pee guard for boys ... We had another seat with a snap on attachment , and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3 ) very sturdy and stable on toilet . This seat positively sits on the toilet , and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones , and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one . Highly recommended !	1
We have two of these and love them . I tried to use the little potty that sits on the floor but I prefer this one . It is much less messy . We have a boy and the front of the seat is high so it keeps the pee in the toilet for the most part . Would highly recommend this !	1
Fits on most seats with minor adjustment . Once set it is one hand operation especially for the times when you are running with the kid in one hand . My daughter likes to do it herself and it is very easy for her to do so . It not heavy in case the finger gets in between the seat .	1
After some little potty chair fails , I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet . This one came up first as it has the most reviews , and it does for a reason . This seat works , period . I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat . My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem . I have to finagle it a little , but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE : Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly , so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair , I highly recommend it .	1
Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely . She can even put it on the toilet herself .	1
I definitely , wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy 's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight : - )	1
We 've tried a few different brands of potty seats , and this is by far our favorite . It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats . Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning , and the Baby Bjorn training seat does n't fit it . Also , after about three years ( and a couple of kids ) the black rubber handle on the back started to break , but I consider that minor wear and tear . Overall , I 'd recommend this seat above others on the market . It safe and looks nice .	1
My son is 21 months old and likes the bear on the product , which entices him to sit down on it . There is no risk of him falling in , and it does n't seem to slip .	1
this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not . It 's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat . The splashguard does n't really do much for boys and because of it , my son ca n't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare , so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it 's a bit bulky for travelling . we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling .	1
I bought BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son . He likes using it , and the splash guard in the front works . There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat . We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations . Now if I have to reinstall the seat , I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat .	1
It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl , I like it ! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it .	1
We bought this about 8 months before my daughter started seriously training . Once she started training this was a great seat and she used it until about six months after she was trained and could get up on the seat on her own . Great seat .	1
i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old , and we 've reduced the number of diapers significantly , with very rare # 2 diapers , woohoo ! ! ! of course i had to hold the baby , but at 11 months , holding is discouraged . there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip , but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets , though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly . ( but then if your kid is n't too young , you probably wo n't need a trainer for a small toilet . ) i even take this to other people 's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i 'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training , and this product enabled me to accomplish that .	1
I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one . I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did . We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn did n't work at all on our toilet seat , but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large , it fits great anyway . My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it . Definately worth the extra money , great design !	1
I like this toilet seat . It keeps his little butt out of the toilet . He likes it , too.Good for boys , no spray . Looks nice . Cleans easy .	1
the best ! we have 4 , all over the house ...	1
I love this seat . I have two in my house and this one is my favorite . The kids say it 's comfortable and it adjusts to fit the seat . Which is great , since we actually have a round seat in one bathroom and an oval one in the other . I keep this one in the main bathroom , since it 's the favorite . Definitely recommend this to anyone who has smaller butts ( you know , children ) in the house .	1
Good toddler toilet seat . No issues . Fits well on long toilet seat . It does come up a little easier then I thought but still no issues .	1
We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old . Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for , she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business . Now that she 's nearing the two-and-a-half year mark , we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process . After reading tons of potty seat reviews , I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer , since it 's one of the few on the market that 's made of BPA-free , non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl . As an added bonus , this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat . We have oval-shaped , elongated toilet seats in our home , and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly . This toilet trainer does n't slide around at all on the toilet seat , which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it . Despite the exact fit , the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted . There 's a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage . ( We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank ) .As I said in the title of this review , the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect , if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto . Apparently , when toddlers first begin to use the `` grown-up toilet , '' many of them experience an innate fear of falling in , even when using a potty seat insert like this one . Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat . This was the case with my daughter . When sitting on this toilet trainer seat , she could n't relax enough to urinate , much less have a bowel movement . She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the ( unsanitary ) toilet seat in order to steady herself , but even then , she still could n't relax enough to do her business . On a hunch , I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat , Colors May Vary , which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles . The first time we used that seat , my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet ! However , the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat , and it 's not adjustable , so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it . And unfortunately , none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market ( the BabyBjorn , Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod ) , has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the `` SHANDLE '' . The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong , moisture-proof adhesive strip . It 's intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat . But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat . We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat ( around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat ) , and voila ! She had two , secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat . It does n't hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs , martians and robots , which makes them attractive to toddlers . ( It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white , for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look ) . Our daughter is n't yet fully potty-trained , but now she 's comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat , and she looks forward to using the `` big potty . '' ( So much so that she 's pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone `` baby '' potty ! ) If you 've been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it does n't have handles , please Google `` Shandle '' and consider giving the product a try . It was the perfect solution for us.Grade : A- ( 1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer does n't have built-in handles ) .	1
This is a fantastic seat for these reasons:1 . Does n't slide or wiggle on the toilet.2 . Easy to clean ! 3 . Pretty flat , light-weight compact design can pack easily in a suit case or other luggage for travel.4 . Does n't pinch skin.5 . Child does n't fall through hole ( holds little behinds securely ) .6 . Easily removeable for adult use of toilet.7 . Carrying handle is great for kids and sanitary for moving the seat around.The only reason I did not give this seat 5 stars is if a little boy is sitting to go # 1 , you really have to make sure his `` aim '' is down otherwise as the force of urine stream hits the deflector it can splash up onto his legs a bit ( nothing a bit of TP ca n't hande , though ) . If the deflector were a tad higher this problem probably would go away . The other issue is that if his `` aim '' is n't directed either right in the center of the deflector or right down into the bowl , the urine can splatter up under the deflector and make its way onto the toilet seat , toilet rim , and/or the back of the kid 's pants if the clothing is not pushed down beyond the gap between the toilet seat and rim.No problems with # 2.Do n't forsee any trouble with little girl use either ( daughter will use this seat in about 1 1/2 years ) .Despite the deflector issue - I would buy this product again there are too many other great attributes of it . All it means is a little extra foresight for mom and dad when he is getting ready to go .	1
I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground . This is great for me because it is less clean up ! Would highly recommend !	1
This item is very simple to install and the white plastic makes it very easy to clean . My son ( 22 months ) has no problem sitting on it . The shield for boys is not high enough to sit him close to the front but if I move him to the rear of the seat the stream does n't go over the shield . Great design , if it was n't so pricey I would get rid of my portable potties and purchase 2 more of these .	1
This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy . Very easy to use and clean , and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet . One caution : the splash guard in front will not always catch everything , especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it , or if he moves around . You 'll need to watch out for this , and you 'll likely have a little spillage from time to time . Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard . I still think this seat is very much worth buying .	1
My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training . She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it . With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over . We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and & # 34 ; parts & # 34 ; some times when she would try to slide up on it . I understand why the bump in the front is there ( to stop kids from peeing out the front of it ) but if it could be made with a softer material ( at least on the front ) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of .	1
After lots of reviews I figured this was the best seat for our long toilet 's ( Kohler brand ) . While this does n't 100 % fit/lock in . It does stay in place and is very comfortable for my son . It made for an easy transition from potty chair to the bigger toilet .	1
I think you have to like this toilet trainer . It 's comfortable , reliable and easy to clean . This is a better model than many alternatives .	1
We have two of these toilet trainers : one for upstairs and one for downstairs . Love it ! Easy for my two year old boy to use , non-slip , and does not attach to the toilet , so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat . The raised part in front is great -- we do n't have any aiming problems with this potty : )	1
It fits ! Finally a sturdy potty seat for my awkward toilet . Potty training has been much easier now that my wiggly boy can sit without sliding off .	1
This is the first seat you used for potty training . I LOVED it for the following reasons : 1. it adjusts to stay in place , 2. it fit all of the toilets in the house ( important when you have two round and one elongated toilet ) , 3. it was n't padded or cheesy ( cheesy characters ) , and 4 . I like that the shape sort of holds the child in . I potty trained my daughter the week she turned 2 and wanted to be sure that she did n't fall off of the potty , but I also did n't want to deal with emptying a little potty into a big one . This is a GREAT seat . I would give it 4 1/2 starts if I could . We ended up needing a second seat for another toilet and it had handles . My daughter prefers to have the handles ( even if the seat itself is not as secure ) , especially when she is pooping .	1
Happily we are way past the training . I forgot to review earlier , but this is a very good choice and no pinching or hang ups for my Grandson . I do recommend this one but you also will have to train him to hold himself down so the flow does n't jump the small cup . He caught on right away so no problems there . Last but not least , the cleaning was easy , fast and comfortable from the first time on without fear of falling in because it 's a perfect size .	1
The hubs and I do n't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods . Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses , he eats with adult silverware , he never used a pacifier , etc etc . So we did n't want to buy him a separate little potty chair , either . Might as well start him on the real thing so we do n't have to switch him over later , right ? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely , sturdy device , which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall . What a nice bathroom decoration . The guests . just . love . it . & # 34 ; You have a toilet seat on your wall ! Wow ! That 's great ! & # 34 ; said nobody ever . But whatever , it 's an easy way to store it . The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he 's sitting down , but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature , so I 'm good with it.I do n't really know what to say . It 's well made , but come on , it 's a potty seat . Your kid sits on it to pee . It 's not super hard to get that wrong . Anyway , my son is still not really interested in the potty , but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair . I 'd recommend this product to others .	1
I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs . I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat , easy to clean . It has a nice shape for sitting . As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty , he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up . That does n't seem to be a big deal to the boys . It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes . Seems very durable . I have one in every bathroom .	1
Having our grandson move closer meant I needed to purchase some necessary equipment - and a potty seat is definitely necessary . However , the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats I looked at were made for standard toilet seats . After reading numerous Amazon reviews , I decided to purchase the BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer and am very pleased with my choice.The BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat . This moves two `` wings '' so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat , even if it is an elongated seat . After securing the seat , I tried to wiggle the BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer from side-to-side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler . The seat held firmly in place.The splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays . Further , it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides ; they flow down into the toilet as they should . The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further , the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung , by the large attached loop , to dripdry . I hung a light S-shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer after it has been rinsed.If you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats , you should definitely consider the BABYBJ & Ouml ; RN Toilet Trainer . It is a five-star necessity !	1
This seat is awesome , it fits both elongated and normal bowls very snugly . It does not slip and slide . My 2 year old daughter can lift it up and put it on the toilet . It is very easy to clean . Great product .	1
Love this thing . Relatively cheap , comes in various colors , has an adjustment knob to 'fit ' various toilet sizes , the hooks allows you to hang it ( added a tacky hook to bathroom wall ) and best of all it does n't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain . Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned ' - & # 62 ; not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat , it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway , it did n't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk ' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet . This is a better option .	1
I purchased this hoping to avoid using a stand alone toilet trainer . This seat fits snugly onto the toilet and does n't move around . My daughter just did n't like sitting up on the adult toilet ... Oh well , I know it will get used someday when she does feel more comfortable sitting up there .	1
We 've been potty training my son for several weeks now , and he showed signs of being interested in using the big potty . So we bought a well-rated fancy potty seat with all sorts of `` features '' that was absolutely terrible . It was quickly returned , and replaced with this one.This seat is SO easy to use - there 's a dial that 's accessible from the top back to adjust its fit , and it 's snug as could be . We have one of the long oval toilet bowls , and that did n't cause any trouble with this seat . It 's secure and does n't move around , but really easy to take off again for adults and older kids to use . This only showed up this morning , but already my two and a half year old has nearly figured out how to get it on and off the toilet seat by himself . It has a nice pee-guard for little boys , and sits down into the toilet a bit so the pee does n't end up coming out between the toilet and seat . We put a big sturdy step stool in front of the toilet , and my son is so excited now that he can get up there and down again by himself !	1
At first , I was n't sure if this seat would work as it does n't have side handles and the splash guard seemed too high . However , after three months of regular use , my 2.5 year old son has no problems with it and it fits nice and snugly on our Toto toilets .	1
We love this seat so much , we ended up getting two ... one for each of our bathrooms . Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she 's going potty like a grown-up . Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo ( gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea ) since it goes right in the toilet !	1
great seat , fits well on toilet , my son loves it . comfortable . great quality . we also have the baby bjorn potty , so they make great products .	1
We ordered this seat for our daughter after she liked the one her cousins had . It is a great size for a little two-year-old learning to sit on the toilet . The front part can get a little messy if they scoot forward after using the bathroom , but the surface is very easy to clean . This is a great little seat .	1
Used this seat for my daughter , and now using it for my son . The guard is great as long as you teach your son how to sit properly on the seat . This has been a great seat for us , and it fits both of our toilets securely . No complaints from the kids either .	1
Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap . Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones . If I had this would have been the one I would have bought . This potty seat is well designed , does n't rock , and is one piece . It 's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son 's house and the one at my house . My granddaughter would n't sit one the `` cheap '' one bought originally but really likes this one . Dry days are coming soon , wish they had these when my kids were at this stage .	1
This potty seat is simple , comfortable and easy to use . I have only found one toilet that it did not fit on . Only potty seat we 'll use for our kids . We love it ! Seat is made in Sweden .	1
This product really does fit ALL toilets . We used it on the road at a hotel , and it fit on the hotel 's elongated toilet . I highly recommend it .	1
Which just about says it all ! This potty seat is easy for my daughter to put on the potty and remove . We have a hook on the wall for hanging it when she 's not using it . She seems to find it comfy to , judging from how long she 's willing to sit there sometimes . And , best of all , it 's relieved her totally valid fears of falling into the big potty , which means a lot less little potty clean-up for us.This is our 3rd potty seat . The other two had soft , foamy seats , which try as we might , we could n't keep clean . We ended up tossing them , as they would eventually begin to smell , and become discolored from the inside out . They always seemed to leave my daughter 's bum with an angry red rash too . So , the absolute best feature of this potty seat is how clean it is , how clean it stays , and how low maintenance it is . We wipe it down occasionally , but its wonderful design keeps it from getting waste on it , and keeps germs from accumulating.Lastly , it 's easy to install for any toilet . We have one in both our bathrooms , and sent one to my daughter 's preschool , so it fits large toilets as well.Despite the higher price , this is an item that will last a long time and function as expected . Ultimately , I believe that makes it worth the extra money .	1
Fits on larger toilet seat . I do n't even need to secure it to the lid , fits perfectly without moving . Easy to clean and lightweight . Transportable if you need to take it places .	1
It is so secure when placed on a toilet and really - that 's what I was worried about . It 's very comfortable for my big/tall toddler and I feel very safe when she uses it .	1
So easy to put on , use and take off that my two-year-old has no problem doing it by himself . I have an oval , enlongated toilet that we use this seat on . A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit . There 's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it ... just do it once for fit.There 's a different brand at church that has handles , so I thought he 'd miss not having the them to hold onto . He does n't miss them at all . In fact , if you are potty training , it 's best to imitate the really thing anyways . You 're not going to find handles on a public toilet , so why train your kids to get used to them being there ? The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat . You put it on there and it 's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use . It does n't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well . Very happy with this purchase .	1
All the potty seats I looked at say they are for older children , including this one . My daughter is almost a year old . I had started , earlier this summer , putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a # 2 . So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions , I decided to take her to the potty . It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat , but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do , plus I 've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews , I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer . It is perfect ! My daughter seems comfortable on it , and I do n't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us . Now the potty seat hangs from the toilet tank and is easily accessible and neat looking.Pros : Sits securely on toilet seatEasy to cleanFlexible handle for hangingCons : Expensive ( best price at my time of purchase was here at Amazon ) I would recommend it , but I am wondering if the Arm and Hammer seat ( which seems to be similar in shape ) is comparable . It is less expensive . I would like to get another seat for Grandma and Papa 's home , but am not sure if I want to spend the same amount of money I spent on the Babybjorn seat since my daughter will be at my home more than at her grandparents ' home .	1
Fits our toilet seat very without sliding and no space left on sides . Does not wiggle when set correctly . Suitable for boy or girl . Classy , not gaudy , if you can say that of a toilet seat .	1
This potty works just as described and has been very easy to use . My only complaint is that for a little boy you do have to be sure to push his privates as downward as possible because the bump at the front is not that high . Once I did not do this and had pee going everywhere .	1
I bought one of these potties for my 18 month old and it is fantastic ! I just bought another one to use in the other bathroom . It does n't move around like the other potty seats she has used . Would definitely recommend !	1
I have a very large ( and very precocious ) 18 month boy who is doing GREAT with this ! I just came back to order another one for upstairs after carrying one back and forth for 1.5 weeks . Super portable ( but easier to have one on each floor ! ) , I 've already followed another reviewer 's advice to pop it in a tote bag for when we 're out and about- that way , he 's not afraid of using the sometimes huge potties in stores ! I ca n't compare this to any other seats ( well , we also got an actual potty chair just in case , but he 's not interested ) , but this has worked great so far . Very comfy , and no spraying or damaged boy parts- spray guard works great .	1
We have bought three of these toilet trainers ( one for each bathroom ) . My daughter loves them and it gives her the perfect amount of comfort and support during potty training . Can not recommend these enough ! ! ! ! !	1
[ updated ] This is one of two potty seats we use in the house with our HUGE 3 year old son ( 45 pounds , 42 '' tall ) .The seat is well constructed , and has some nice features . In particular , it has two braces which can be moved by turning a dial accessible while the seat is on the toilet , to make the potty seat tightly held in the toilet seat , and therefore stable . That 's nice.The plastic is smooth and easy to clean . And unfortunately , I spend a lot of time cleaning this potty seat and around it when my boy pees sitting down . Originally I thought this was because of the potty seat design.The front splash guard is raised to keep the child from missing the potty entirely , which is great . However , it 's not aimed downward but instead is straight up and down . Unless I 'm extremely careful to position him towards the very back of the potty seat ( a problem if he will poo ) , my son winds up hitting himself , the toilet seat , and for all I know the ceiling when he pees . Worse , the pee splashes up underneath the potty seat and pools around the inside of the black rubber seal around the potty seat 's edge . It 's a mess , and requires cleaning the toilet seat every time I remove the potty seat from top of it.I guess I should consider this incentive to get him to learn to point down when he pees , but when you 're potty training and just trying to get your kid to use the toilet at all , it 's a pain.So , five star construction , comfort for sitting , and the adjustable fit . 3 stars for hygeine and spraying my son with his own pee . Average is four stars.Addendum : Since writing this review I 've used a few other potty seats , which has improved my opinion of THIS one . Unfortunately unless you teach your boy to aim downwards , pee is going all kinds of places you do n't want with pretty much any potty seat . This potty seat 's front piece extends further down than a travel potty seat , for example , which is good . In this potty seat , there 's sprayback , but in a travel potty seat , the pee can actually shoot UNDER the toilet seat and above the toilet , at the hapless parent foolish enough to stand in front of the boy . And I get some sprayback . So , given a choice between these two design options , I think the babybjorn probably makes the right choice . Bumping the star rating from 3 to 4 to reflect this . I 'd still like a miracle solution , if anyone knows one !	1
We bought one for each bathroom ( one upstairs , one on main floor ) and it was easier and better to travel with than the little green baby bjorn potty . The price is awesome . My girl covered it in lifelike bug stickers which is just funny when company comes . For as long as their little tushes are too small for the big seat , it is awesome .	1
This is perfect . It adjusts very easily to any bowl , is firm and steady when it attaches , pops on and off in a second . There 's nothing to improve and nothing more we could want .	1
My son used this when we transition from the potty chair to the toilet . This helped him tremendously and made the toilet more comfortable . He did n't have to fear falling in the toilet with this . I hung mine on the bathroom wall and he would take it down and put it on the toilet himself when he had to do # 2 and then put it back when he was done .	1
Although the adjuster to fit on our oval toilet does n't work on it , it does n't matter because it has a rubber edge that keeps it in place easily , for all 3 of my triplets , and they 're all different sizes .	1
My little one has tried a few different toilet trainers , and this one by far is the best . It 's ergonomically designed to allow for a comfortable set as well as preventing over shooting with the front elevated part .	1
Do n't get me wrong , our Bjorn trainer is a keeper- has a great seal , extra pee guard in the front , adjustable fit , and the handle makes for easy storage and cleanup . But , when it comes to toilet seats for training ... let 's be honest ... you can find a cheaper one that does the job . This one is just maybe the Cadillac of trainers ? I would n't buy this one again , but would certainly want one as a gift !	1
You can ask my husband - I 've purchased at LEAST 5 potty seats since getting our son to use the potty . I 've returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son ( I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet ) . The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first , but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning . So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn . WHY did n't I buy this sooner ! ? ! ? This is the best potty seat I purchased . There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine . It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat . There is a small splash guard ( more like a ridge ) in the seat so no `` fountaining '' can occur . Everything that I 've complained about in the previous potty seats is addressed with the Baby Bjorn - it works fantastically ! Highly HIGHLY recommended .	1
My kids wanted to sit on the toilet quickly , but of course , were too small . These seats are great for potty trainers or small kids .	1
In a move of overzealous anticipation which has become common for me , I bought both this toilet trainer seat and the Bjorn stand alone potty for my daughter when she was 18 months old . Obviously she did n't do much with either , but she liked to sit on the stand alone potty and pretend she was going , or put her stuffed animals on it to make them pee . Fast forward to about a week ago , she just turned 2 in August , and she uses this toilet trainer all the time . For some reason she will not use the stand alone at all . As others have mentioned , she can place it on the toilet herself , which she really enjoys , and even helps me wipe it off after using . Even with a girl , she has managed to pee over the splash guard twice so far , but it is really a small price to pay for how clean and convenient this seat is . Partially it is because she is so fascinated with seeing what is going on that she leans back and the pee goes out , so it is not actually a flaw in design . I love that it fits in my ( formerly ) diaper bag , so she always has a clean toilet seat , even while travelling . I was skeptical of this seat initially , but bought it anyway based on the reviews , and boy am I glad I had this on hand and ready to go , because when the timing is right , it 's right !	1
Have two of these ( one for upstairs , one for down ) as well as the Baby Bjorn freestanding potty . With a step stool , my 2 year old can put this on the toilet herself and get up onto it . Love the little potty as well , but obviously prefer that there is no clean up required with the seat toppers . Fits all three of our toilets perfectly and very comfortable for our child .	1
When we were potty training our daughter , my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground , they may be scared to go on the toilet since it 's higher up . So we bought this one and even if they are still too small , you do n't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it 's made . My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we do n't worry about him falling in . He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he does n't try to climb off .	1
Great seat ! This is our second one in 4 years and two kids ! The first one had the handle crack.I bought a different potty seat to replace this one initially and it was sent back quickly in favor of this seat ! There is a dial that turns to adjust two plastic pieces that sizes it for your toilet.My son is 3 and he knows how to use the potty all by himself . He is able to put this down on the toilet and get on and off it himself . There is no leakage between the seat and the toilet seat and the guard works well.I fully expect that my daughter will be able to use this seat when she is ready to potty train .	1
Using the wheel to adjust this for a snug fit on our toilet seats was VERY easy , very pleased with this seat , it seems very comfortable for our 21 month old . Also recommend buying potty hooks for a few buck each ( may be cheapest at BRU unless things change ) . I have a potty chair for my son but want him to have the option of using the big potty on a regular basis as soon as possible , so I am fitting each toilet in our house with one of these .	1
I recommend this potty seat to all the mom 's I know . We had a different brand one before buying this seat and it pinched my sons private parts . This seat is all one piece and is easy for my son to put on and take off the potty . It has a wheel that adjust so it can fit in different size toilets . It has a convenient handle for carrying and hanging and is super easy to clean.You can not go wrong with this seat ! !	1
The lip on this is necessary for boys ! Looks nice , cleans well , travels well , stays put . It 's perfect for my 3 year old .	1
They thought about the little things that would make this better than the competition . Kept the price reasonable . Very happy .	1
I bought this seat based on all the great reviews and I was not disappointed . My son just turned 2 and is small for his age and he fits perfectly on this seat . What I also love about the seat is that it does n't move once you get it on the toilet . I do n't have to worry about my son slipping and sliding around as he moves on the potty . I bought 2 !	1
This is a great adapter for a normal adult seat . This makes it easy for your toddler to use the potty without feeling as though they are going to fall into the toilet . My only complaint is that it does not secure well to the toilet itself . It can easily be pulled off . And it is not easy to store in that it is wide at the top . Overall , though great from potty training your little to use a big toilet versus the potty seats .	1
This is not offensive to look at , it stays put on the toilet and the splashguard works beautifully . Its very easy to clean because it 's all one piece and my son feels very comfortable sitting on this one without pinching his thighs or feeling like he may tip to the side .	1
My daughter really likes her pink potty seat . It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her .	1
This was easy enough for my toddler to put on the toilet . It 's simple to clean and fits well . We very much preferred this over the potty seat that does n't sit on the toilet - my son wanted the & # 34 ; real thing & # 34 ; . We really love this toilet trainer .	1
For some reason my son likes this better than sitting on his own baby potty . He has yet to & # 34 ; go & # 34 ; but at least , for now , he wants to sit on the toilet .	1
our potty training days are over for the time being , but this was great ! i could tell my daughter was comfortable sitting on it , and it did n't scoot around at all . it 's easy to remove quickly for others who are already potty trained when they got ta go !	1
Great design -- we have n't actually used it yet , but I like how it fits on the toilet seat . It seems like it would fit any seat . We were trying to introduce our baby to potties really early , but have been lazy about it . We also have the other Bjorn toilet and she does n't mind sitting on that one . But we can use it on the changing table , so it 's easier for us . She 's 8 months .	1
My son was scared of falling into the toilet so this was super helpful when we really dove into potty training . He liked that it tightened down so it did n't slide around like a cheaper model we had picked up . The little lip in the front is very handy for boys learning to aim while seated if you know what I mean . ; ) We 're getting ready to use it for boy # 2 and it still looks new .	1
I did a lot of research before purchasing a seat to go on our toilet . I already have a Bjorn stand alone potty but my daughter did n't seem to be comfortable on it for more than a minute or two and she wanted to sit on the big potty but is just too small . So I figured a seat to go on the regular toilet would be the way to go . So far though it has n't gotten her to go she does seem comfortable sitting on it . The design is really clever and I do believe that it would fit on any seat tightly the way it 's adjustable . It 's nice to feel comfortable that it 's not going to slide around . I think this is definitely the way to go for toilet training.Update 11/21/2011 : My daughter is now actually using the seat instead of just sitting on it : ) This seat has successfully taught her how to use the potty . We like it so much that for our travels over the holidays we 've ordered another seat to be sent to where we 'll be spending the holidays so she 'll have the exact same seat there . Very happy with this product . Also I 've noticed that though she 's a girl it 's still helpful that this unit has a splash guard on it .	1
We have now bought 3 , count them 3 , different potty scenarios for our 2-year-old , and this is by far the best . Stays on snugly , prevents leaks well , easy to clean .	1
Here is what I like about this : - you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it does n't shift when on the Toilet ( this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady ) - just one piece ( that way things do n't get in between the pieces ) , less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different : I wish that the seat was a little cushioned . If he 's been on the potty for a while , poor thing has red marks on his butt . ( it goes away , just do n't like seeing that )	1
This toilet seat works great . Nice design , fits easily on toilet . When our son was 3 he was able to attach and remove it on his own with no issues . Easy to clean . I recommend this item ( and the matching step stool too ! ) .	1
We bought two . Have it up and downstairs our almost three year old likes this more then the potty chair . You must buy a stool with it but otherwise great	1
My son it doing well with this seat , no little potty , staight to this seat . The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over . Fits on the toliet really snug	1
LOVE THIS SEAT ! Well designed to adjust to many different sizes of toilets . Super easy to clean after each use . Just rinse with warm water and let air dry . I purchased one for each bathroom and also a few for the grandparents house . Stores away easily . LOVE IT !	1
I am embarrassed to admit how happy I am about this potty seat . We were using ( without any luck ) the Prince Lionheart weePod . The BB toilet trainer by comparison # 1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet , long or round . I put a small black dot on the dial where it has the perfect fit , because with time , it does adjust ever so slightly , so I know exactly where it needs to be snug . # 2 The entire base that sits on your toilet seat is lined with rubber so there 's a no slip grip . No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable . # 3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way . My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up , on & over the hump on the weePod . This may be a downside for boys , but is a bonus for girls . # 4 You can hang it . I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that 's where we hang it between uses . My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself . All key things in her independence . And there 's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right . # 5 This is completely personal reasoning , but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material ( in my head ) makes it seem more sanitary . Or maybe because its clean & white , idk . That being said , when I say hard plastic , it is not by all means uncomfortable . The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it . The weePod , for whatever reason , would cause her to lean back in the seat . My daughter loves this seat . A+++ in everyway . Worth every penny !	1
Have n't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet . However , wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it . This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a `` snap on '' deflector ( for boys ) . Purchased 2 of these , one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs , as they are in the process of potty training our grandson . It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats , and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it . I also purchased the stool and potty book ... and am ready whenever my kiddies are . Highly recommend this seat as it very well made .	1
My son is 3 years old and I potty trained him in 1 day . I purchased this toilet seat along with a potty book for boys ( and no potty ) . He learned to go on this by itself , I was amazed at how fast he learned . All I had to do was get rid of the diapers and buy him big boy underwear to start the potty journey . It took a day of `` accidents '' , but it was well worth it . This toilet seat is versatile and you can take it along anywhere you go ! I highly recommend it -- no need for a potty either : ) .	1
I read several reviews before settling on this one . Initially , I was considering the potty with the ladder but breakage , slippage and space were an issue with that one . This turned out to be the ideal potty seat for us . It fits over my elongated toilet seat comfortable without slipping so I have no fear of it falling in when my little ones rush to the potty . They even put it on the seat themselves . It little ridge on the front are perfect for little boys and avoid any leakage or spilling ! The kids love that they have their own seat that is so comfortable . Baby Bjorn products are always well-made and well suite for the their particular purpose and this one proves that . It gives me peace of mind knowing that my little ones can use it easily without fear of them slipping off of it or the seat falling into the bowl . Great potty seat !	1
We just potty trained our daughter 2 weeks ago , and having her sit on the big potty has been a challenge . We 'd much rather her to her business on a real potty than the plastic Baby Bjorn potties that we also have.This device is simply fantastic . What you would expect from Baby Bjorn . Well priced , well made , and very functional .	1
I love the dial on the back that makes it really secure on any shape seat . It does n't shift side to side and feels like an extension of the real toilet seat because of how secure it stays in place . If you 've ever had a kid fall into the toilet you know important that feature is !	1
I bought this item after reading the reviews for it here on Amazon . I have a less exspensive cushioned princess toilet topper but this Baby Bjorn is SO MUCH better ! PROS -- Easily adjustable to fit most ( if not all ) toliet seats.-Snug fit ; does n't wiggle/wobble when climbed onto by my 28lb 2yr old & no worries of her legs/fingers being pinched between the seats.-Ergonomic design ; my daughter seems very comfortable on this seat ; Much more so than the `` cushioned '' one I mentioned prior.-Would work well for girls or boys since it has a high front side which helps to avoid accidents.-Very estically pleasing.-One fluid piece so it is easy to clean ; no grooves , creases , etc . to have to worry about.-Durable ; something I can definitley hold onto for our next baby.CONS-N/A ; ) I would highly recommend this item . It 's worth the extra $ 10 you 'll pay for it over the cheaper ones !	1
I was having a hard time finding a potty seat that fit our elongated bowl in the basement bathroom , until I came across this seat . The dial in back made for a snug fit . The seat does n't move at all and # 1 & # 2 go where they belong . Have n't had any issues cleaning it up .	1
This seat is very easy to install and fits securely . My daughter was hesitant at first but there was n't even a scare of her falling in once she sat on it !	1
My son prefers to use this seat instead of the small stand alone potties . I guess because he feels like a big kid using the big potty . Its dimensions are perfect and he can sit without any danger of falling in or feeling off balance . We also have n't had any accidents with pee splashing out of it , so the pointy splashguard at the end seems to work . I 'd give it five stars if it had handles on the side like I 've seen on other training potties .	1
I like the style and ease of this potty seat , but for my daughter , the hole is much too big . She squirms on it , and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in . I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat . Hopefully she will grow into this one . She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side .	1
Seat works well , adjustable & fits our toilet well ( standard seat ) . Stays in place well , and my baby can sit on it himself ( he is 5 months old ) . We 've been using it since he was 3 or 4 months , and it worked well then too .	1
It 's hard to get excited about a potty seat , but my toddler loves this one . We keep the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer on a low hook next to the toilet for him to grab . He can carry it by the little rubber handle and ( with some help ) put it on the seat . I 've already adjusted the potty seat to fit our elongated toilet . It fits nice and snug on top of the toilet seat with no rocking or tipping , and my son sits on it quite well with no danger of falling in or off it ( he 's almost 2 but he 's big for his age ) . It fits round toilet seats too with just a turn of the dial , which makes it great for travel . I wish it came with a travel bag/carrier of some sort . ( I 'll have to make my own travel potty kit : an old duffel bag , flat-folding step stool , flushable wipes , disinfectant wipes , antibacterial hand gel , etc . ) It 's made of the same durable material as the seat that came with our white toilet so it matches perfectly , and it 's easy to clean . I expect the guard in the front will keep things where they 're supposed to go -- we have n't had a `` full '' event yet , but fingers crossed .	1
Easy to install , comfortable for my son to sit on and has a very useful splash guard . The seat blends in very well with the bathroom and can be easily hung when not in use . Of all the seats out there , this one seems to be one if the most well made and most functional . Would highly recommend .	1
These are just great . My son sits comfortably on them . No hassles as they are adjustable . Baby Bjorn delivers great quality as always . I have 2 of these & would recommend these to everyone always .	1
This Toilet Trainer is more than a trainer . It snaps into the opening of a standard flip seat of an adult toilet , allowing a small child to seat on the toilet without falling in . A 3-year old can put it in place , making the child independent . The prongs that hold it in place are not very stiff , so the seat is easy to remove , even for a child . Thus even after the child is & # 34 ; trained , & # 34 ; the seat is useful .	1
Works Great ! Easily get a tight fit to the toilet seat and remove for adults in just seconds . I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone .	1
Before we bought this we have used two of the princelionheart wee pod basic which crack every single time . I decided to try this one out . It does seem a bit more pricey than other toilet seats but it is worth it . It is adjustable and allows the child to sit more naturally on the toilet than the thick padded seats .	1
Not much to say beyond that - it does what its supposed to do , and its easy to clean . I started using this on my son when he was 9 months old - have nothing to complain about .	1
and prevents my daughter of falling into the toilet . it does get a little dirty and requires a regular wipe down , but i like this ( plus a step booster ) more than the little potty . our daughter also likes that this helps her use the same potties mama and daddy use .	1
my son loves it ! i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one ! perfect shape , perfect comfort , perfect size for a 4 yr old . ( potty trained now ) sometimes , he sits on this for a long time ... .so i know it 's very comfortable ... .LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies . and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that , it is still a 5 star rating !	1
Easy to install . Now if potty training was just as easy . Easy to clean the toilet still too . Would recommend .	1
having gone through several ( cheaper ) seats - and tons of clorox wipes cleaning up the dribbles off the toilet and floor - I read reviews and tried this one for my twins . the adjustable mechanism makes all the difference in the world - as long as its adjusted snugly on the toilet , no leaks , dribbles , messes ! i bought one for each toilet that they use and it 's worth the $ , no question !	1
This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use . It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma 's already contoured seat . This is a hard , but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom . We have the cushioned one , with little ducks which is nice , but this is really a step up . It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot . I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma 's . It is strong , sturdy , easy to clean . It comes in other colors , but I only have white . It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath . Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to `` shimmy '' and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving . Worth the extra money .	1
I keep this toilet seat in my son 's bathroom along with the Bjorn step stool . My son loves using the potty with this seat ! The simple design makes it easy to clean and use . I also took a plastic over the door towel hook and hung it from under the tank of our toilet ( on the side ) . This works perfectly to hang the seat by its plastic handle when not in use .	1
This potty seat fits very nicely on our elongated toilet seats . The adjustable fitting makes it nice and snug so the kids do n't wiggle at all on the seat . We are just beginning to potty train so it has n't had much actual use yet and I ca n't speak to how well it works otherwise .	1
I 've bought several potty training seats , and this is by far the very best out there as far as fit and stability.If I were going to change one thing about it , it would be to make a boy 's version and a girl 's ; the guard in front is pretty unnecessary for our daughter , and it gets in the way of her wiping herself.With that said , I 'm really happy with the way it adjusts to fit the seat and does n't wobble or slide to one side , like other seats I 've tried . It 's also very easy to take on and off the toilet seat so others can use the bathroom with no trouble , thanks to the handle.Do n't bother with those other seats . This is the one you need .	1
This seat fits my toilet beautifully and only wished I bought it from the get go . Nice quality seat , smooth and easy to clean , and fits my elongated toilet seat perfectly ( due to the adjustability of the seat ) . Most importantly , my son is very comfortable using it and no longer fears the seat moving on him and now is getting on and off the potty by himself . Dramatic change in just 2 days of getting the seat . Worth every penny in my book !	1
I bought this for my 8 months old daughter after she had been using the BabyBjorn potty for a month or so . I realised that it was n't much fun cleaning the potty so decided to give this toilet seat a go and it 's been working great for us . My daughter is happy seating on it , it 's small enough for her and it 's very easy to install , put on and take off .	1
I tried a few different seats and nothing fit my oval shaped Toto seats well.The adjusters in this allow it to fit the seat perfectly . It 's sturdy , and easy to clean . Hangs perfectly with the potty hook.Great product !	1
Purchased this after purchasing the Babybjorn Smart Potty because the other was too high at first . This one is just ever so slightly smaller and a much better fit for either small or early trained kids .	1
my son started using this potty at 6 months . it is one of the only potties small enough for infant potty training . the potty has a great splash gard , and appears to be shaped to help my son go . almost like the squatting position you see kids do in diapers.although i have seen kids as old as 2.5 using this potty , it appears to be geared more for younger ones .	1
My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train . He 's about 27 pounds age 21 months.Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you 're good . ( Wear gloves and wash your hands after too . ) Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue .	1
Although I am a die hard Baby Bjorn fan , I am not a true fan of the LITTLE potty . It 's small in design , with no removable bowl which makes it very hard to keep clean . Save your money and upgrade to the Baby Bjorn regular potty which is well worth the money ! ! We keep our little potty in the minivan for those unexpected road trip emergencies .	1
This potty is great . As the previous reviewer mentioned , it 's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside . I think the only fault is that it 's incredibly low to the ground , so although that is great for new learners , once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house , it does n't encourage them to go because it 's too short . If you can spend a bit more , the newer model with the inside that comes out ( $ 24.95 ) is much better in my opinion . HIgher for sure , and actually easier to dump since it has an insert . Make sure never to use bleach in these , though , I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50 % bleach solution , it ate away the smooth bottom .	1
We take this little potty with us everywhere . I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty ( BBLP ) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car , so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we 're on the go . I 've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on , so that we would have access to a potty ... even if there was not a bathroom available . With little ones it is so hard for them to wait , and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also , if you do infant pottying or elimination communication , this is one of the & # 34 ; must-have & # 34 ; pottys . The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you 'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ... which makes it ideal for little ones ( I am talking 1 year or younger ) .	1
I have been practicing EC with me 2 month old , and she went on this the first time I tried ! Its easy to dump it into the toilet and rinse in the bathroom sink ( the one we do n't use , hah ) . Great little potty for introducing the concept of going potty outside a diaper early on . It 's small because it 's meant for early use .	1
It is small enough & light-weight enough to take anywhere . My son 's little , petite bum fits great on this potty . He can get on & off of it easily as well . The price was well worth it !	1
I like the simplicity of the chair , its easy to grab and use when an any room and clean is really easy . The only complaint I have is the comfort factor , but I do n't see how that could be improved without loosing the ability to grab and go and clean easy . I use it with my 9 month old twin girls when I catch them . We are n't full blown potty training yet , so I imagine when we do we will probably need a more perm . fixture .	1
We got this potty for our 2 1/2 little girl after she was potty trained for little over a month . We have the bigger Baby Bjorn potty for home , but we quickly learned that she is terrified of big toilets when we 're away from the house . We keep this potty in our car and it 's been great ! She knew it was a potty as soon as she saw it because it 's the same color as her big one and it has the same bear on it . We take it to friends ' houses when we 're over there , and we even have her use it in the car when we 're away from the house for long periods of time . She thinks it 's great ( and funny ) that she gets to `` pee in car '' and has used it right away every time . I 'm not sure how other parents bridge the gap of potty-training while away from the house , but this works perfectly for us ! ! In fact , we 're taking her on a plane for the first time in a couple months and plan on taking this potty in our carry-on . I recommend it to anyone . Oh , and it 's much shorter than her big potty , but she does n't seem to mind one bit . Honestly , I wish we had gotten this one first for when she was really little and interested in the potty ( we got her first potty at 16-months , but she still had a hard time getting on it herself because she was so small ) . So if you 're starting with a little one , this would be perfect ! !	1
Great size for a baby but the bottom can slip on a smooth floor . Scared my baby a bit when it slipped unexpectedly . The guard in front is large enough to contain pee but not too large for an infant . We mostly used this as a travel or back-up potty , with parental support .	1
For all those EC moms , this is a perfect product . It 's a nice small size ( for infants ) and easy to use and clean .	1
Ok so my 8mo old has been doing EC ( google it ) since 3 mo old.So we have like 4 of these ( 1 per room ) You got ta get a WHItE one ! ! White makes it so much easier to see if he has gone # 1 ( and 2 ) .I wish all 4 of ours were white.Please star this so others know white is the way to go.Oh and bjorn , please make a clear one ! ! Frank	1
We have one of the larger Baby Bjorn potties for each of our girls , 3 years and 20 months . However , the younger one has a bit of difficulty sitting down on the larger one because of the shield in the front . She often gets so frustrated with the larger potty that she tries to turn the receptacle around , which of course , does n't help matters.This small potty has been an ideal solution . It 's reasonably priced , and the perfect size for a child under 2 years who is learning to use the potty or just has potty curiousity after watching an older sibling use the potty . We knew buying it that it will likely be a temporary potty , and that when she 's too big for it , she can graduate to the larger one.My only complaints are as follows : -Judging from the marks on her bum , I do n't believe that it 's quite as comfortable as the larger version for long periods of sitting , and she 's our second to have that tendency to `` camp '' on the potty.-The ease of dumping it is somewhat less that the larger Bjorn potty . Where we can rinse the receptacle for the larger one in the bathroom sink , this one is just large enough that we have to rinse it in the bathtub , and there 's a bit more area that needs to be cleaned , with it all being one piece . Since we do n't really plan on making it the long-term potty , and more just a trainer , this is n't such a big deal.So , if you 're looking for a small potty for a younger child that will temporarily suit them perfectly , look no further . A nice bonus is how little space this potty takes up ! I think it 's the smallest potty we 've encountered yet . Just be prepared for a little extra work in the clean-up department , and a new potty or seat adapter somewhere between the age of two and three , as this potty will surely be outgrown early on .	1
I 've noticed that the negative reviews on this potty focus on how small it is . Yes , it IS small . It would be too small for most kids beyond the age of 3 and any bigger/tall toddlers . If you are in that category you 'd want to look at one of the larger Bjorn potties.HOWEVER , if you are ECing a baby or working on potty training with a younger/smaller toddler , this potty is great . Their feet will touch the ground and it 's easy for them to sit on . For myself I love the simple , one-piece design . This makes it really easy to carry to different areas of the house , in the car , and it seems less tempting to be used as a hat . We have used 3 different potties over the years with our children and this is my favorite . The back has a knotch cut out for easy carrying . Really great little potty .	1
We used this chair starting when my daughter was around 8 months old and it was the perfect fit for her . It was comfortable ( or so it seemed ) and easy to keep clean ! She is 18 months now and we still use it often every day and we have more than gotten our money 's worth - but I think she is getting a bit big for it now . I am eyeing moving up to the regular size Bjorn potty seat , which I hope will be a little more comfortable for her height .	1
We started with this potty when my son was around 6 months . He 's 3 now and still uses it , although he 's opting for the potty seat more often . Good learning potty as it 's easy to sit on quickly . No messy parts to clean . Easy to take on the go .	1
My third son was bigger than average and had NO ISSUE sitting on this potty . I do n't understand the negative reviews because of the size of the potty for normal potty training ( I 've never done the baby potty thing ) . He was two and a half by the time he was potty trained , used this potty ( off and on ) until he was almost four ( we 've only one bathroom , so he used it `` in case of emergency ! ) . This potty beats the one I used for my first two boys BY A LAND SLIDE ! This one has NO CRACKS OR CREVASSES ! The ones with the take out pot some how ALWAYS get urine under them . YUCK ! I love how easy this is to clean . I rinse it out well then wipe it out with a Clorox wipe . After all the uses , it does n't smell like urine or excrement at all.I 'm on here ordering another one for my little girl so I can have two -- one upstairs and one downstairs . You can not go wrong with this potty !	1
To date , we have purchased 4 of these potties for our petite 14 month old daughter ( upstairs , downstairs , both parents ' cars ) , when we wanted to start to introduce toileting in a natural way . ( Petite = 20 lbs , 28 1/2 inches tall , wearing 12 mos clothes ) . It is a tiny potty , and we were looking for one because nothing in the aisle at Target was small enough for her to sit comfortably on it . From the minute I unpacked her potty , she walked right over and sat down on it , diaper and all . We have now successfully integrated it into our diaper-changing routine , and she fits nicely . I like that it 's backless in that it 's easier to sit behind her and make potty time a relaxing time , while I hold a book in front of her . I do wish it had a higher back , a la the bigger Baby Bjorn potty , so that she had something to rest her back on for long sits . I like that it is all one piece , making it super easy to clean . It does fit well in our little bathrooms , too . I would suggest this potty for parents who are introducing potty training early , including but not limited to EC'ers .	1
This is perfect for my 20 month old . She can sit on it on her own . It is VERY small . Imagine a gallon of milk cut in half . My daughter is small for her age and it fits her perfectly . There is no problem emptying it . We just add a small amount of water and dump it in the toilet . Then a quick rinse and dump that in the toilet . This is much better than seats on the real toilet that she feels uncomfortable on . She is relaxed on this and that makes all of the difference . It is perfect for us , but be aware it is small .	1
We love it , baby loves it , washes easy , good price , free shipping when bought from Amazon ! Great size for EC babies !	1
Perfect little potty , I 'm using for EC with my 3month old and it is working beautifully , easy to grab nice neat compact size and just great to have around ! I 'm glad I chose this potty !	1
This potty is the perfect size for anyone doing Elimination Communication with her baby.My baby is still too young to actually sit on it , but it works great for something to hold him over . The lip is especially great for little boys . : ) Plus , it 's light and easily transportable.I love it that Baby Bjorn has recognized the need for a smaller potty for the ECing crowd or those with smaller children wanting to use the potty .	1
This is the best potty . It stays really clean because it 's just one piece of shaped plastic . Also the splash guard is important , even for girls . The other potty leaked out the front . Also it 's light and easy to take to the beach or wherever we go .	1
Love this potty . I highly recommend this potty . It works well and I ca n't imagine anything better . I can definitely recommend it .	1
I got two of these after starting EC with my 9 month old . The potty is a perfect size for a young child/baby who is beginning to use the potty . My son ca n't get on it by himself , but can get off ... his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys . The one piece design is great for cleaning . Other reviews said that they wished Bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why I got white ( next best thing for seeing when he 's done ) . If you are considering trying EC ... do n't hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently . Great quality product for price !	1
This little thing could not have been more perfect for what I wanted and my daughter needed . I bought it when she was about 8 months old and just had her sit on it before bathtime while I got the water running to get used to having it in her environment . She went # 1 and # 2 on her first sit . Since then , she is now 13 months old and nearly every time we sit her on it , she goes # 1 . We 're still only using it to allow her to adapt to its presence since they do n't have potties for her to use at daycare , but I absolutely love this potty and so does she ! The only one thing that has given us a hard time is that she has figured out how to `` scoot '' around on it which was making it more of a vehicle than a potty . I read another reviewer that just put some no-slip type of gripper on the bottom so I gave it a shot . It solved the problem and we are back to happily going in her potty.I highly recommend it ! It looks incredibly comfortable and my little lady is very tall for her age . She has no problem sitting on it or using it to do her business . We all love it ! Also , I was able to pack it in my suitcase when we went to grandma 's so that 's a huge plus !	1
We have been using this potty for our 2 1/2 month old ( yes , you read that correctly ) for a few weeks now . While she is still too small to actually sit on it by herself ( she 'd fall right in ) , we hold her over it when we think she needs to empty the tank and have had much success with it . Before you jump down my throat over why I should n't be using this for such a tiny baby , I 'll defend myself by saying sometimes she will fuss uncontrollably and it will calm her immediately to have her diaper removed and have the opportunity to relieve herself without the confines of a diaper . This potty has been a wonderful solution to that problem.It 's definitely small , but since my baby is a particularly petite baby to begin with , I reckon she 'll probably be close to completely potty trained before she outgrows this . It 's a nice size for us right now , however.Cleaning it is relatively simple with dumping the waste into the toilet , rinsing it out , then wiping it down with disinfecting wipes . One feature I really would love to have in this is a pour spout somewhere to make dumping the waste a cleaner task . Because of this lack of design feature , you are faced with two options when emptying the potty out : flip it upside-down really fast to avoid getting waste spread around the edges ( never tried it ... sounds too risky ) or pour it out over the side and be faced with the waste spreading all over the side you dumped it from . I 'm sure nobody is a fan of dripping baby pee and poop or having to wipe up more than necessary . A pour spout would have been a simple solution to this problem.Otherwise , we are completely pleased with this product . I can imagine having a second one for the car down the line might be a good investment considering how reasonably priced it is.Update : We still use this now that our daughter is five months old . We saw that Ikea has a $ 5 potty , so we got one to have a secondary use potty . I hate to say it , but Ikea perfected the `` spout '' design to cleanly pour out waste . The Ikea potty is bigger and the opening is wider , so we have to be more careful about her backside falling in and it appears to be a bit more uncomfortable for smaller babies . For that reason , I still prefer the size and shape of the Baby Bjorn potty . I wish these two potties could get together and create a perfect design for little babies : )	1
This is a no frills , easy to clean , comfortable potty ... just as a potty is supposed to be . I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand . The price was definitely a plus as well . She is 2 1/2 years old , at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained . Cleaning is pretty easy , I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack : 1 Fresh Scent , 2 Lemon Fresh , 1 Orange ( 78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total ) , wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray , 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles ( Case of 9 ) and let dry or wipe dry .	1
started taking baby potty at 2 months - he 's 5 months now ( 17 lbs , 26 '' tall ) , & can sit on this potty himself . it is so easy to clean & take to work with me , & fits him great !	1
Very simple , very economical and it fits small babies . We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty . The splashguard protects well . It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction !	1
We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost . This chair is so much better that it does n't even compare . Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom ( so far just pee pees : ) ) for several months and loves it . In contrast , he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1 ) Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean . The bowl lifts out and rinses easily . Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces , just asking for places to trap dirt . Not a good thing with a potty2 ) built in urine shield ( into the bowl ) works great and our son loves sitting on it . It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3 ) inexpensiveDownside ? We have n't found a downside yet .	1
We got this one and the Summer Infant and they 're so similar you might as well get the cheaper one . This one is definitely taller but our son has n't had better or worse luck with either one .	1
Simple ! Love it . Love the high back and the front lift . Very good price	1
This is a great potty seat and very easy to manage , however the potty disassembles quite easily from the base and does not have a cover . I was not able to find a babybjorn with the aforementioned essentials . Would buy the same brand , if they made a new version that covers and did not come apart so easily from the base ( my daughter take out the center all the time ) which can become a problem if she empties the content .	1
Simple design that : - allows child to sit rather then have to support themselves ( important esp when they start potty training at an earlier age ) - the entire seat area comes off so it 's easy to clean and dump into toilet and rinse- comes in many colors to suit your liking- bottom has a rubber gasket surrounding the entire outside lip so that it creates good traction- durable and so no worry about breaking this when a child is breaking or when you are moving it a lot	1
This is a great product . It 's easy for the babes to sit on comfortably . It 's easy to clean b/c it only has one part . And it has that nice rubber ring on the bottom to prevent slides .	1
This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first . My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty , which costs about $ 5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle . My son thought it was a toy and constantly `` flushed '' to hear the music instead of sitting on it . When this potty arrived and I took it out the box , he grabbed it and said `` mine '' and immediately sat down on it . He started using it the very next day and it 's been a success so far . I do n't know if it 's the potty or if he 's just ready to be potty trained ( he just turned 3 ) but I do know that he loves his potty . I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model .	1
This potty is simple , tough , and great for a boy . Helps keep the pee in , and wo n't kill his `` bits '' if he gets caught on it while sitting . It is easy for a child to take the bowl out , empty it into the toilet and put the bowl back into the frame .	1
My boy is a big boy and it fits him perfect ! His feet hit the floor perfectly too and great height for him . Somehow wo n't tip.. nicely engineered !	1
I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert , but it was not working . I 'm grateful I finally caved and bought this . This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids . My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet . He only used this for about three to four weeks . Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one ( no inserts ) .	1
I never know what i would have done without it ... Potty training was a breeze with the help of this potty chair..My baby loves her little red potty ...	1
I first got this for my 6month old son , after reading the `` Diaper free before 3 '' book . In India , the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support . In the same aspect , I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well . I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day , as soon as me and my son got up , we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs , surprisingly , he peed in this , on the first day only ! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it . He likes to sit on this one , as it has the backrest , and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but , its good enough for him . In a way , its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet , as he doesnt try to stand up : - ) . He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy . Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side , the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time , I put him on this , any time of day , he pees assuming thats what I want him to do . Pooping , we have not started yet , but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great , remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water , and its even sanitized ! Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor . I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest ! He wouldnt sit on it even once , and its going back to Amazon today while I order my second potty chair !	1
We used this through two kids and while they both only used it for a short period of time it was very easy to use and clean . Not a lot of nooks or crannies so you only had to wipe it down .	1
This is the only potty chair we used with our little one . We did n't use bells and whistles . We did n't use stickers . This was all she needed . It was very ergonomical for her little frame .	1
We used this for both of our boys and am glad to say they are now successfully trained . This is a low price , high quality option .	1
We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers . At first she seemed like she was avoiding it . Then one day ( just about 2 years old ) she started asking to go to the potty by herself . It is easy to clean . It is stable . It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it .	1
I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own . The high back was more helpful then , than it is now , but it 's still nice to have the high back . She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back . She thinks she 's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the & # 34 ; handle & # 34 ; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for # 2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty . No leaks . The potty chair my mom has , if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor . That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS : - High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS : - Have n't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care .	1
The pink color is great ! Motivated my very girlie 2 year old to want to start using the potty ! Easy to clean , comfy to sit on .	1
Easy to clean , easy on my son 's bottom . This looks great in our small guest bathroom by my son 's sticker chart , Wee Pod Basix and potty book .	1
honestly , i was going to get the smart potty instead , but this was eligible for amazon prime and thus a few cents cheaper [ every penny counts these days ! ] but , im glad i got the potty chair . on a quick note , the green is not a bright lime green , its more of a muted lime green if that makes sense . [ more natural-leaf-looking than neon . ] were not getting too serious about potty training , just yet , but we do set our daughter on the potty after naps . shes peed in it a couple times , now . the center `` potty bowl '' removes easily and doesnt force you to touch anywhere the pee has touched since it has a `` lip '' to grab up under the front `` horn '' of the bowl . you simply remove and dump the bowl part into the adult potty , maybe put a lil water in it from the faucet to rinse it and dump the contaminated water into the toilet , too . very , very easy to use . my daughter can sit on it herself [ shes 13m ] and stand up unassisted , as well . the back chair part aids her in sitting down so she doesnt plop down [ like every child this age does ] and lean back too far.the only down side i see with this potty is my daughters curious and wants to touch inside the bowl while sitting on the potty . but thats just a learning curve of whats `` yucky '' and shouldnt be touched . ; ) overall , i recommend the baby bjorn potty chair because it doesnt have any bells and whistles [ which i find pretty pointless for a get-down-to-business type of personal business , ] its fairly inexpensive compaired to others out there , and its functional and safe [ no leaning back too far . ]	1
My little girls likes using this over the other potty that we got , personally i think it works better than other , cheaper ones , i like the hard seat so she doesnt want to sit there forever , and it forces her to get in the proper `` position '' which she doesnt always achieve the other potty .	1
With five young children in our home , we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties . With constant use ( and abuse ) they still look brand new ! They are easy to clean ( I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher ) and easy to transport . My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier : ) Well worth the money ! !	1
Since we practice elimination communication we looked for a potty that would work well for a young child who just began sitting with no ( or very little ) support . We started using this when our LO was 5.5months old . From the age of 6.5 months or so , our LO was really comfortable on this potty ( it was OK earlier , but only for very short duration ) . It is very steady , and super easy to keep clean -- you just take out the inner compartment and wash it out . We are very happy with the decision to go with this model .	1
We 've tried a number of potties for kids , and this is by far the best brand and design . There 's also a version without a & # 34 ; chair & # 34 ; back that is equally good ; we have them both.PROS : -- ergonomic , comfortable for toddlers and even infants if you are doing elimination communication -- all molded plastic design makes it easy to keep clean , no cushion to get soggy -- insert lifts out for easy dumping into adult toilet , fits in sink for washing clean -- sturdy base ensures your kid will not tip it over , even if wiggly -- spray guard works well for boys but still is small enough to let kids get on easilyCONS -- your toddler may not want to transition to big toilet because these are so comfortableI really ca n't think of any cons for these potties . We have one in each bathroom , and when my son was learning , we kept one in his bedroom as well . We have a smaller version of this one that stays in the back of our car for those unforeseen & # 34 ; I have to go potty NOW & # 34 ; incidents . They are so sturdy , are easy to clean and maintain , and my toddler can even empty this one easily himself without making a mess . Some potties have cushions and other moving parts , making it really complicated to disassemble for emptying . This one is a breeze.Also , the bowl is oval shaped and plenty long enough to accommodate larger toddlers without having positioning issues . I 've seen some that have a tiny circular opening , which is really awkward , especially for boys , to make sure nothing misses ... GREAT FOR EC - If you do elimination communication or infant pottying , these are great . The insert can be removed and held in your lap -- used as a top hat potty -- until your child is old enough to sit freely on the potty.I absolutely LOVE these potties because they are so practical , simple to use , and child friendly . My toddler prefers this style to all the other ones he 's tried . No gimmicks , just a potty . What you need .	1
Excellent product . My son is just a bit too small , but he 'll grow into this potty . It has a solid back if he leans back , and a little lip so he wo n't pee right at you .	1
Our boy started potty training around 15 months , and this high back was great for him at that young age , plus it is very easy to clean and fits his small tush ( he is only 25 lbs ) . We got one for each of the grandparents house because he loved it so much and wanted to use it there .	1
Bought for our 30 month old grandson . .He likes it . .He sits and holds a few toys while & # 34 ; making & # 34 ; ..it cleans up very well..no issues..I should get 2 more	1
we havent learned yet to use on it but i love the color and looks nice in the rest room and	1
I chose this chair based on its reviews , and I am glad that I did ! I ca n't speak for how it works for a boy , but it seemed to be really comfortable for our daughter . It 's easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom , instead of looking like just another piece of baby gear . I also like that there were n't any crazy sounds or anything like that since it made the chair seem like a more realistic potty .	1
My LO does n't mind sitting on this at 7 months ( we 're starting EC ) with a toy or a book and we 're good to go . Has great support . She was a little hesitant on day 1 but now does not mind at all although I still hold on to her . Easy clean up and very durable . I 'm tempted to get one for downstairs for convenience sake .	1
Would be nice if the white container was made with a little cushion for the small tush , but it 's nice in that it 's easy to clean and easy for the little ones to sit on . My 12 month old has no problems sitting in it .	1
This is a great potty . The biggest issue to me was cleaning . This chair has no seems or corners to trap things . The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth . The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they wo n't hurt themselves while getting on . The base is very solid and sturdy and does n't move at all . It also looks comfortable with the arm rests . My son is n't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it . He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book . Does what it should and does n't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise .	1
We also have the blue potty as well and love them both . We have 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs for our 2 yr old son who is potty trained..I love how high up the lip is on this potty , thus preventing any addicents . Very easy to clean as well and no leaking noted . We researched plenty of potty seats and found this to be the best for boys .	1
The high back and sturdy base make this chair perfect for little ones just getting the hang of using the potty . Be aware that with a boy the splash guard might not catch all the pee , but you can help him learn how to sit correctly and then it does n't happen !	1
This potty is just great . My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old . I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she does n't need me to physically support her when she 's on it . All I have to do is watch her nearby . It 's really well made and very sturdy . Also , the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess . She does n't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing ... and she does pretty much without fail . We have n't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now . One of the most useful items I bought for the baby !	1
My two-year-old daughter loves this potty chair and prefers it over her Prince Lionheart potty chair . The chair itself is very sturdy and extremely easy to clean . I love that it is ergonomic and that there is a `` high back . '' There are n't many potty chairs out there that are comparable to this one -- trust me , I 've looked !	1
we got this chair for our son to learn to use the potty . its sturdy and comfortable for him which is great . i like that the bowl is big enough that there is no spraying on the floor and i can actually see when he goes as opposed to him standing up for me to look . its easy for him to get on and off of by himself which is another big plus . i LOVE how easy it is to clean , much easier than the other potty chair we have which is 3 separate pieces.it may not have any fancy extras but it gets the job done !	1
I have a 2 year old in the potty training phase . I first potty we bought him was terrible , so I decided to try the Babybjorn . We ALL are so happy we did ! It 's a perfect potty chair . There are only 2 pieces and NO nooks to squeeze into to clean . it 's very simple in design . It has a wonderful pee guard for my boy and he never gets the pee on the floor . He actually sits back a bit and watchs himself pee . I just love this potty for the ease of cleaning it . I just lift out the bowl , dump and rinse . It 's good to go.At the end of the day , I just spray a little Clorox anywhere on it and let it dry for the next day . My son loves it , too . Its very comfortable and easy for him to use on his own . When we were doing the naked potty training ( now we hav emoved to underwear ! yah ! ) he was able to get to the potty and go all by himself without trying to get a lid off like the previous potty we bought . He would sometimes just sit there for a decent period of time just waiting . He was totally comfortable . LOVE this potty and we will be using it again with our second boy due in a few months .	1
With my first son , i bought the boon potty bench , I did consider this one , but at the time , I wanted the step stool option . The potty bench worked , but with my twins I needed another potty and got this one . LOVE IT ! I wish I would 've had it for my first son and just got a separate step stool . I have boy/girl twins that are 2 1/2 years old . They both can use it very easily , they do n't have to take their bottoms off all the way . That was something I could n't tell with the pictures 'cause of the way it 's shaped . It 's so easy to clean . They like to dump it themselves in the big toilet and it 's easy for them to do that . There are no spills with the pee guard . Funny thing was when I first got it , my four year old son wanted to try it out . He 's about 50 lbs and 47 & # 34 ; tall and even he fit on it ! It 's so light and portable . I would recommend this to anyone .	1
Let 's see ... what to write about the potty . It is easy to clean , my daughter uses it , and it has held up well so far . I like it because it does n't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter did n't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks . Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat .	1
This a nicely molded piece of plastic- simple , no sharp edges . Just the right size . Our son started sitting on it for pracice at 11 mo . His feet can be on the ground and hye likes to sit on it . The pail comes out easily to dump and the bottom has rubber , so it does n't slip on the floor . Shield is also high enough for potty .	1
This is a great potty chair . We have a frog potty in our upstairs bathroom and my daughter complains that it hurts her bum . This is her favorite and she says it is comfy . It 's the perfect size and easy to dump and clean after each use .	1
Awesome ! ! ! ! My son who is 40lbs and only 2 years old ca n't fit onto any other seat . Plus this one is soooo great for boys , there is plenty of space and the guard in front makes it really easy ! ! ! I love it ! ! !	1
This has a very nice design and is not annoying looking like most potties . The high back is nice for my daughter because she can read her favorite book and lean back . Rubber grip on the bottom works well too , does not slide around .	1
I have 2 of these for my twins . Having gone through the search of a good one with my first child , I found this and bought 2 . It 's simple to clean , you take out the wipe potty part by hooking some fingers to the front and dump the contents into the toilet . Rinse it and you 're ready to go . You can sanitize it with some clorox spray and just put it back down until the next time . It 's portable so you can have it anywhere . There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained , but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies . You never know if you 'll make it to the next toilet , you know ?	1
I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty . It leaked , its round opening was WAY too small , and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor . Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide . The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty ! The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean . There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round , so no more pooping on the seat . This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys . No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it 's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I 'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints !	1
For nearly a year , I have been struggling to help my now three-year-old become potty trained . We have tried four other potty seats , and all have proved difficult to use : -We first tried the Primo Ducka toilet seat ( looks like a duck ) , and while it was cute and engaging , he could not climb on the toilet to use it by himself , and it often directed the liquid flow right between the toilet and seat ( what a mess ! ) .-Next , we used an old-fashioned wooden potty chair ( the kind with a high back and arm rests ) , but this had a separate plastic guard that hurt my son and also allowed liquid to leak.-The third potty chair we tried was the Baby Bjorn Little Potty , which slid too easily on our bathroom floor , was too low to the ground , and always allowed liquid to drip along the outside when tipped in the toilet during cleaning.-My son did enjoy the next potty - a `` Peter Potty '' toddler urinal . It was great fun to stand like Daddy , and it even had a water tank so that it could be `` flushed '' like a real potty . After several months , however , the top water tank started dripping often , and the bottom reservoir was so hard to pull out that when it finally let loose , liquid sloshed out ! Frustrated , I set out to scour Amazon for one final shot at a potty that would work for my son and would be easy to clean . After reading the positive reviews , I decided upon the Baby Bjorn potty chair , allowed my son to be involved by selecting a color ( blue ) ... and could n't be happier with our choice ! My son has been excited about his new blue Baby Bjorn potty chair since the UPS driver brought it to our house , and I am impressed as well . This potty chair is tall enough that it is comfortable for him to sit upon , there are no separate guards that pinch him , the rubber bottom prevents it from sliding on our floor , it has a back and armrests that help my son stand up after going potty , he can use it by himself , AND it 's super easy to clean ! I have found that if you pour the liquid out the back of the potty chair insert ( where the white bowl curves upward ) , the liquid does not run down the outside of the container like other potty chairs.Overall , while a bit pricey , this is without a doubt the best potty chair we have found for our toddler boy . I would highly recommend that other parents try this chair before wasting their money on any others !	1
I like how it is a basic potty with no frills . Currently DS is not using it yet , but I ca n't wait to get out of cloth diapers !	1
Our daughter loves using this chair . It is stable and very easy to clean .	1
I started potty training my son at about 14 months , and he is short for his age . This potty was a pretty good height for him , so it was comfortable and not too high , and it still fits him at 18 months . The guard in front forces his legs apart a bit and is high enough to catch most of a boy 's unpredictable flow . Also wipes clean easily and does n't retain any stains or odors .	1
We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years . It survived 4 children . Unfortunately , it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one . It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child . The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty . The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall , I am please with the purchase .	1
We were using a Bjorn Little Potty ( which they do n't make anymore ) for a long time . But as my son grew , he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem . At Grandma and Grandpa 's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty , which seemed to work better for him . I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us , lets try the top of the line Potty Chair ! And its working great , the bowl rinses easily . Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side , but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub . I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed . Any potty ( with boys using it ) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived !	1
I love this potty chair ! My son barely used it , just for the beginning month of his potty training but it had many very nice qualities and I would recommend it highly.The color is pretty and the chair is cute . I like my bathroom to look nice and it didnt bother me to see this in there every day.The skid rubber on the bottom really hung on to the ground well , even in those times when some bath water had gotten on the floor . It is very stable and wont move around on you or your toddler.the design is simple , which means that clean up is simple as well . the removable piece just comes out and is a breeze to clean.The high back and sides make it safer for wiggly toddlersI loved everything about this and am glad I shelled out the extra money ... not only that but when it was time to sell it I got a decent amount of money for it because its a name brand and they are so expensive	1
We are currently training our 2nd child . With our first , we had 3 in diapers , giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained , so we tried almost every seat out there . Most of them were okay , but just got nasty quckly , were hard to disinfect , or were uncomfortable for my son . The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child 's sensitive parts . Those were awful . We were `` potty training '' for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique , and DS immediately sat in it . He chose blue , and we took it home . Within a week , he was trained , and began using the `` big boy seat '' , so we saved the seat for our daughter . It was incredable ! Now our 23 month old daughter is training . We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom , with the blue upstairs . She has been `` training '' for 6 days now , and is almost completely day trained ! This seat is by far the best in our experiences . Here 's why : 1. the seat has a higher back and sides , which gives the child support while sitting down , standing up , or simply sitting there . 2 . It is NOT easy to tip ! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand . 3 . It is super easy to clean - there are n't a bunch of seams to gather gunk , it 's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done . It 's also super easy to take the little bucket out , and soak in clorox or hose down . 4 . Kids can choose what color they want ! This was such a big deal to my children -- - also , they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom . The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted . 5 . It works for children of all different sizes ! My son was 40 '' and 42lbs when potty training , and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp , and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall , having tried MANY seats , this one was the absolute best for both our children , and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~ !	1
Our three year old son immediately loved this chair ( we ordered it in his `` favowit '' color green ) . He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well . My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle , the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath . It 's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can would n't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting . I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess . Other than that , though , it 's lightweight , easy to transport if needed , easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it .	1
I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs . Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time . We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it . She does n't use it every time , but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros : Comfortable for the little one ( she is about 20lbs ) The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons : Wo n't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth , slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip : If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh , be aware she may try it on herself at some point . D'oh .	1
First time potty training for our 14 months daughter . Too many choices available on the market , but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon . This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much , but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it . Easy to clean , and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty . The high back rest helps alot , because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable . Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value , nice design , and definitely easy to clean . Highly recommended .	1
This is really useful and simple to use . Just the right size / hight for little ones to do their business on their own . Really easy to clean . Would recommend it over the ones that go over the regular size toilet seats.. because those are too high.. and the kids would need a steps..	1
My 2.5 year old just wants to play with this and not use it as a potty . She discovered that the seat insert makes a great cowboy hat and is also fun to stand in and push around the house and put her toys inside and underneath it . I tried every rookie mom mistake to get her to take it seriously and nothing seems to be working . She only wants to potty train on the real toilet and , hey , that 's not a bad thing . Just wish I knew before I bought it ! I 'd suggest starting with the real toilet and a seat to fit on top before buying this . Otherwise , it 's a great potty chair ! I think it 's well made , a good size and has a nice simple design . That 's why I gave it 4 stars .	1
I ca n't say enough good about this potty chair . It 's inexpensive ( but very well made ) , SUPER easy to clean , has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable ( I 'm assuming ) . I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool . Do n't like it at all . Tough to clean ( lots of spaces for urine to get ) and I do n't think it 's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it . Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed . Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st . Great product . Ca n't say enough good about it.From a parent 's stand point , it 's the best b/c it 's soooo easy to clean . I 'm not clean freak , but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product .	1
When starting potty training , this seat was the perfect size for my toddler . It was comfortable for her height and she was willing to sit on it for more than a minute . The contents are easily to empty out and wash . There are rubber grips underneath the seat to prevent it from sliding around . No complaints !	1
works great , son loves it . works perfect for boys . great quality . the high back supports my son so he wont feel like he is falling back	1
We have been loosely potty training , at my daughter 's discretion ( self-lead ... working beautifully ) for a little over 6mos , and recently she has become very independent about it all -- she literally holds up her hand to stop us from following her to the bathroom to use the potty sometimes ! We have always just had a cushioned training seat on the big potty , and had recently gotten a potty seat with an attached `` step ladder '' , but she had trouble getting her pants down safely once she was up there , so she could n't REALLY go and do it by herself . I thought I would give the floor-potty a chance , and got this one . She immediately said `` I want to go pee pee ! '' and so I showed her that she couljd stand on the floor , take off her own pants/pull-up and go ... she did , and the potty is super sturdy , it 's the perfect size for her tiny little hiney ( she 's only 23.6lbs at a little over 2yrs ! ) , and she had no trouble at all getting on or getting up ... the `` arm rests '' were a great way to help herself get back up - might want to consider that if you are considering the smaller Bjorn potty chair . It emptied easy as pie , and was ridiculously easy to clean and sanitize ... but once I did that , she grabbed it and put it back in the shipping box ... she just prefers the seats on the `` big girl potty '' . Otherwise , great little chair , for sure.I would mention , the `` lip '' that is there to prevent issues for little boys or `` forward spillage '' during a pee , might prove a little tough to maneuver or might get a little boy caught on it ... I 'm sure they have to be high enough to actually prevent the spill/splash , but this one took my daughter a moment to get over the little hump , and being a girl she does n't even have the `` extra accessories '' .	1
I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles . There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed . $ 27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic ( bowl and base ) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up . In the end , I 'm happy with my Bjorn purchase . The simple design is easy to clean . My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I do n't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over . The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits . Some of the potties I 've seen have very small bowls which I 'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds . My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes . So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design .	1
I bought this potty chair after looking at several other brands/styles because of the high back and arm support . It has a great `` wrap-around '' design that is perfect for my 4-month-old who is just getting familiar with the potty . For those working on infant potty training , I highly recommend this chair . My little one has no problem sitting up in this chair by herself ( of course I 'm holding onto her for security ) . She has already made many , many poops and pees in the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair ! It 's also very easy to clean . Just dump out contents , rinse , and wipe with a disposable disinfecting wipe . Definitely easier than changing a diaper !	1
This is a pretty good design and we especially like the high back , which makes it possible for babies/toddlers to sit unsupported .	1
This potty is very nice . I bought this because of the sleek look , high back . It will work fine . My daughter turns 2 yrs old soon , I will then try her on it if she is ready .	1
We love this potty chair ( bought one for each bathroom ) . The design is simple . It is comfortable and easy to use . My 2 year old son has had no problems with it . Very portable ( we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips ) . We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well . I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants ( he likes both equally ) . Made in the USA too ! !	1
Our son is not potty training yet but , he loves to sit on his potty . We placed it in the bathroom and every time before he takes as bath , we take off his diaper and he immediately sits on the potty . With a high back , he looks comfortable and relaxed sitting on it . Lots of great colors to choose from . Simple yet smart design .	1
I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really ca n't complain . My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it . I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday . I did n't make a big deal about it and it did n't seem to bother her . I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad , just incase , so nothing got on my carpet . But she seems very comfortable on it .	1
Our first potty for our daughter had one of those squishy foam-type seats . We thought that would be more comfortable , but soon realized it just irritated her bum . It had a huge reservoir , was a pain to dump and clean , and that foam part was always getting dirty and could never be completely cleaned.A friend had a Baby Bjorn , and seemed happy with it , so we gave it a try . My daughter chose her own color - I love that there are so many options - and we ended up with a green one . She loves this potty . It seems comfortable , and she does n't get that red ring around her bottom from sitting on it . And best of all , it 's SO EASY TO CLEAN . The reservoir is compact and can be rinsed in a small bathroom sink , but holds plenty . If you forget to dump it once , it wo n't overflow on the second use.My first daughter still prefers this potty over using the adult one . She 's 3.5 , and big for her age . The size of this potty is very versatile , and I think it will last her a good while longer if she needs it to.Now my second daughter is getting to the potty-training age ( 18 months ) , and we 've invested in a second one in her favorite color , yellow ( it 's actually a lovely shade ) . The same potty that can accomodate my preschooler works just as well for my little toddler , and that 's a great feature.I have zero complaints about the Bjorn potty . It 's absolutely worth the extra money .	1
This is the ONLY potty I 've found that 's perfect for boys ! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat , so it wo n't fall off , and is high enough to `` keep it all in '' if you know what I mean ! = ) I had to order 3 since it 's seriously the only one he 'll even sit on anymore ! We have 4 different types/brands , but he ( and I ) hates them all . This one is truly THE BEST . Super-easy to dump and clean , he likes to do it himself , and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it does n't slide around when he sits down/gets up . It 's also a really good size `` bowl '' , some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in . AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend !	1
I love the look and it 's appears to clean easily , but we have n't used it much to give good feedback . Our 21 month old will go sit on it without guidance , but he wants to pul out the bowl and take it with him . Hopefully when we officially start potty training , it will be fine .	1
LOVE this potty - it 's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on . Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that did n't have a splash guard ( stupid me ! ) , which was frustrating for everyone involved ( trying to tell/help a 2-year old to `` point it down '' ... yeah , right ) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time , his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty , instead of dreading it . The design and height are perfect , and the seat is easy to remove and empty ( so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it ) . Best potty ever !	1
I am potty training my 19 month old daughter . She is my 6th child and I have owned a league of potties over the years . The problem with so many potties that I find is that there are too many bells and whistles that make potty time more of playtime than getting down to business . This potty is super simple to clean which is a BIG bonus over other potties . You simply pick up the insert , dump it into the toilet and rinse out the insert . I usually just use a clorox wipe to clean it out . The shield is high enough that a boy will not pee all over himself , but short enough that a little girl will not jab herself while trying to sit down . My daughter is 19 months and 24 lbs and this seat is the perfect height for her . As said , my twin 3 year old sons have used this a few times ( when both just got ta go at the same time and one is already on the big potty ) and had absolutely no issues with it at all . I wish I would have bought this the first time instead of spending hundreds on other potties over the past decade .	1
This potty is perfect ! So simple , no bells and whistles , no distractions , just a potty . We 've only had this chair a few days and our little boy is starting to get curious about what it is . So far he 's sat on it about ten times and gone in it 3 ! We could n't be happier . Make sure you order & # 34 ; Potty & # 34 ; by Leslie Patricelli- it 's the best potty book we 've come across and our little one loves it .	1
Love this potty ! It 's white and matches our bathroom nicely ... it blends in . EASY to use and clean , SIMPLE too . Recommended also by `` Toddler Bargains '' . Have not been disappointed !	1
Your basic , sturdy little potty . Kids do n't need all the flashy crap on the more expensive potties . The big toilet does n't cheer or play princess music when you pee . Why set them up for disappointment ? ; PMy son has no butt so he kind of does n't fit on it and gets scared but maybe eventually his butt will get bigger or he 'll get over it . Who knows haha .	1
It does the job . She was potty trained within a month I think due to being able to leave this in the livingroom so she could always see it .	1
This is the best potty chair in our ( me and my toddler ) opinion . easy to clean and super comfortable for her . plus , since lots of our friends use them , she has & # 34 ; her & # 34 ; potty when we go over .	1
I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles , flush noises , music , lights , the works . Then I thought , wait a minute , the regular potty does n't have those things . She wants one like mommies ! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read `` the potty book for girls '' She was immediately sitting on it without any prompting . Once I finally took her pants off she went right away . We are still working on going always on the potty , but she loves the potty itself . It is very basic and sturdy . My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front . I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the `` big '' potty .	1
We have two of these - one for upstairs , and one for downstairs . It 's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty , and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros : - There 's a barrier/guard in the front so he does n't pee everywhere . It 's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just do n't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he does n't fall off of it when trying to sit down . Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It 's nonslip on the bottom , so it does n't push around when he goes to sit.Cons : - A & # 34 ; pour spout & # 34 ; or something would be great along the back side .	1
I purchased this seat when my firstborn was a toddler . I 'm guessing he was around 2.5 years old.It came with 2 pieces : a base and a cup.The base has a wide , stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it . There is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor . There are no sharp corners - just curves which are very easy to keep clean . There is a hole in the base ; the cup is set into this hole , overlapping the edges . The edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup.The deflector is not removable ; it is all one piece with the cup . I LOVE this design . It is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it can not get lost.The cup is removed from the TOP of the base ! With my other potty , I had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat . If my toddler ever tried to empty it himself , he ended up making a big mess . With this potty , it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling.Having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup . There are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into . The deflector could be a little higher in our experience , but it was n't too bad . I think if it was taller , it might be annoying for a girl so I can understand why it is the height that it is.An added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore . It 's rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at .	1
We started potty training my daughter at 2 and a half . Right before her little brother was born . We decided on the BABYBJORN potty chair because it seemed easy to clean , comfortable , and did n't have anything that would make her want to continue to use it as opposed the the real potty.We bought this when she was 2 just to get her used to it . She sat on it while we were in the bathroom and read her books . She was comfortable and nothing pinched her causing her to not want to use it . Eventually she got the idea and started using it herself . At 2 and a half we ditched diapers and were exclusice to the potty training.She loved this chair because , gross , she loved to pick up the seat and dump the contents in the real potty . Lucky for us there was n't any huge mess . We rinsed the chair out nightly with hot water and I cleaned her potty when we cleaned our bathroom , weekly . She made sure I did as well . She enjoyed using this potty , but when the time came to move exclusively to the big potty she was n't sad to see this go.I 'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase another one when we potty train my son . Reason being I think I accidently tossed this in a made rage to declutter.Overall , cleans very easily , no weird places for poop or pee to hide , and she did n't become attached to it .	1
So far we like this chair . It is easy to clean up and easy for my son to use . Very lightweightas well . A little smaller than I would have thought , and sometimes the seat sticks , but otherwise a good chair .	1
When I began my research for a potty chair for my son , I had no idea how many things there were to consider ! I really did n't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it was n't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs . It is well-made and sturdy ; it did n't tip when my son got on or off . I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and did n't slip around . He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility ' of dumping the contents into the big potty ( I liked that it was easy for him to do that , and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward ) .	1
We just got this potty after trying the Safety 1st potty for a couple of months . As soon as my son saw it he knew just what it was . We watch the `` Once Upon a Potty '' video and the old bowl style potty in it was throwing him off I think . THis is close enough to that style that he started quoting part of the video upon first site . He then stood up backed up to it and sat down without any assistance , a great improvement from the other potty . He can get up and down from it without maiming his privates . His only problem with it so far is that he 's apparently gotten use to having the back pressed against his rear so he pushes all the way back on this potty too . This is a little odd given its oval shaped bowl . Hopefully our stalled potty training will get a jump start down . Just in one day he is much more eager and willing to sit on it and he giggles over quoting the video while he sits there .	1
Love this potty . No messy parts to clean . Rubber feet grab the floor to prevent slipping when the kid sits down . Large bowl with lip for boys is a nice feature , no more `` flippy '' to fish out of the potty bowl . Ca n't say enough great things about this potty ! Buy it already !	1
We have a small bathroom so I was a little worried how this would fit in there without getting in the way , but it fits great . My toddler loves to go & sit on it & at 18 months has already did 1 & 2 in it ! It 's a wonderful simple design that makes it super easy to clean . Love the green color , I think the picture displays the color accurately on my computer .	1
We used this potty chair for both of our daughters , who potty trained at about 2.5 years old . Its simple design is absolutely ideal for use and cleaning . It 's comfortable for toddlers to sit in , as well as easy for them to lift out the bowl and empty into the toilet themselves . The splash guard molded as part of the bowl is excellent , providing protection as well as not being an impediment to the child sitting down . ( I ca n't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys , however . ) The smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless . Plus , the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor . Plus , as an added bonus , it resembles the potty seat depicted in the `` Once Upon A Potty '' video , so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life . I highly recommend it , and ca n't imagine using any other seat !	1
This is a great training potty for toddlers . It 's easy to clean and I like the light color . Very happy !	1
We have this in both green and blue for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms , respectively . Son loves sitting on it and has n't had any issues at all . Very easy to clean and I like the high back because he can really sit there and relax a little while waiting to make a potty .	1
I have a 15 month old who is & # 34 ; interested & # 34 ; in going to the bathroom . Bought this seat so she could familiarize herself with it beforehand . She began using it the first day we brought it home . After a month she asks regularly to & # 34 ; go potty & # 34 ; . Perfect size . She seems comfortable- it is very stable and easy to clean .	1
I wanted a pot for boys and one that could be used for a healthy ( chunky ) child . My son used this pot for the entire potty training process . He had one at home and at both grandparents houses . The pee guard did its job and the size was great for my `` chunky '' little one .	1
My 2.5 year old is a big kid , 40 lbs , 38 '' tall . He needs a bigger potty chair , which this is . We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he ca n't keep his pee in it , he 's just too big . I like that the potty cup comes out to wash , but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it . We 've had urine on the floor several times just because of this . I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up , he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside . He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup , which is by far a better design , but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go . All in all , I like it and would recommend it with reservations .	1
I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and does n't break the pocket book ! It 's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot . The built in splash guard is great ! It 's easy to clean and light weight , but built tough . Variety of colors . My triplets are all different shapes and sizes . We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him . Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no `` falling in '' . Our daughter is long and very thin . She has no problems what so ever on this ! Her tiny behind does n't fall in or slip or anything . The splash guard never gets in her way ! It 's just the best ! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one ! Highly recommended !	1
This potty seat is perfect . My daughter is almost 3 so a bigger potty was necessary . I love the back on this as well as the splash protector in the front . Even girls can spray and make a mess ! LOL My little girl picked out the green color herself and it 's very pretty . It 's easy and convenient to lift out the white part and pour the pee in the potty . The bottom has a good grip so it 's not sliding all over the floor . Excellent product .	1
We love this potty . We 've had 4 other potties and this is my favorite . It is super easy to clean up and the bright colors are great . My son still loves to sit on his green potty . He is 28 months and can easily pee , empty it , and rinse it by himself . I 'm not sure what the people who are complaining about pee going over the place but he can do it by himself with no problems . Just teach the child to sit properly in a chair & make sure it 's not hanging out of the potty ( taught my son to tuck it in at 18 months so there really is no excuse ) . He is about 32 pounds and 36 inches & I 'm sure he will be using it at home for a while . While he 's been using the regular toilet for a while too at home , he loves his green potty . BTW , baby bjorn makes 2 potties ( and a ring too ) this is the larger one . If you are wanting a smaller one , there little potty is great but would not recommend it if you are starting with an older child as it is rather small ( my son loved it at 15/16 months and will use it now but I do n't think I would buy one that small for an older child ) .	1
nice potty is easy to clean and looks alot like the adult potty so helps eliminate confusion . has worked well so far .	1
Got this for my daughter ( shes 2 ) . I like it real well . She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good . She can sit on it and on feel like she 's going to fall in . I would recommend this to others . I also got the step stool . She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she 's done ... .The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White ( I got the pink one to match her seat ) It stays put and is sturdy .	1
This is the most comfortable potty chair around ! My daughter loved to sit on it for a chair when we first got it and it did n't take long at all for her to start using it as a potty ..she 's almost 3 now and still uses it because she says it 's more `` comfy '' than the big potty I think the biggest plus for her is the smooth back rest and the biggest plus for me is it 's so so easy to clean !	1
This was the 3rd potty we bought and I wish we had bought it the first time . It is the perfect size for my 2 year old son . I thought the smaller BabyBjorn potty was too small . This is the potty I will be buying to put on our 2nd floor .	1
I bought two of these for my twins when they were 14 months old . My son was using it by 15 months . My daughter & # 34 ; practices & # 34 ; on hers . They are very simple and easy to clean . Great for smaller tots . Some other seats were much too big or wide for them . And , they seem very comfortable to sit on . The raised back adds support .	1
This potty works very well for us . My son likes that it is his size ( we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he is n't so into ) . It is light enough that he can move it himself , but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits . I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard , which you ca n't remove , but this has n't been a problem for him . Also , we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros : Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons : Ca n't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child	1
We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old . He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably , though is n't really using it much yet . Like the chair , purchased 2 of them in different colors , good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean . I knock off one star only because I can tell the `` splash control '' on front for a boy is n't going to be perfect , but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there ... and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only . If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors .	1
I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back , and the raised front is great for little boys . We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys . I also have the shorter backed version , and they are both good for different reasons . This one feels a little sturdier , and the bucket is easy to empty . The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor .	1
We have this potty in green . I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $ 12 ! ! If I would have known how much I would love this potty , I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child . I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts . It makes cleaning much easier . No one enjoys cleaning out a potty , but it 's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean . Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices . I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I 'm done !	1
Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl , she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too . This potty will grow with her .	1
This thing is the perfect height for the boys ( youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months , and the oldest is 4.5 ) to sit comfortably . It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into . It 's pretty unobtrusive color wise , but it is kind of large . There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the & # 34 ; cup & # 34 ; and the base , but he has since learned and we have n't had any more issues . There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job , but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well , so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks . Overall , great product and not too pricey .	1
This is light , safe , easy to clean and attractive . My daughter likes it and is having no trouble so far using it . She can easily and safely get on and off it by herself or with help . It is also easy to clean .	1
This potty chair is perfect for my daughter as the back is higher up to support her lower back and it does n't have all the music and sounds to distract her interest in truly trying to go potty . She gets a toy or a small book and wants to go sit on it and try and has had off and on success with going at this point but I like how easy it is to clean too .	1
fit as expected , ,my baby love it .This potty chair does n't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties . But is the best . When i was shopping for a potty , i read the reviews and then went to the store to & # 34 ; explore & # 34 ; for myself . i was n't convinced of any other potty . why ? 'cause all the others either did n't sit sturdily on the floor ( and this is w/o a child sitting on it ) or were difficult to clean . This potty is simple and sturdy , gets the job done , comfy ( my picky daughter never complained , she likes the teddy bear logo on it ) , and so easy to clean . Never had a spill too . Besides , potty training should be as simple and natural as possible , so choose a simple potty . i have 2 of this item ( 1 downstairs and 1 upstairs , now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car ) .there 's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too	1
We received this item last week in the mail and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the quality . This is a very sturdy chair with a nice no-slip rubber coating around the bottom edges , and this seems like a chair that will be super easy to clean . My daughter is not quite ready for this but I am sure this is a great purchase .	1
I LOVE that this is `` healthy '' materials - HATE that it sticks to my sons bottoms when he stands and in 2 cases pee everywhere ( one other case POOP EVERYWHERE ! ) I will keep the 3 that I purchased for him , but I did purchase one wood potty that I like much better too.Just trying to keep healthy the best we can . I guess nothing is perfect ...	1
I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better . Its smaller and more easily stored away . Other than that this one is easy to use as well , inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well . it 's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well .	1
This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found . The pee still splashes out occasionally , but far less than all the other brands . It makes me so mad that they do n't have boy-specific potty 's . The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat ) So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement . My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month . He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back .	1
I am so pleased with this potty . It is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old . It is also very easy to keep cleaned up .	1
After extensive research , I finally settled on this potty chair and I am extremely pleased with my purchase . I , like many other reviewers , was intially put off by the $ 22 price tag.The problem I have with many baby products today is that companies try to make something a `` new concept '' by adding bells and whistles or attempting to make things multi-purpose . Do n't get me wrong , I love technology and my daughter has tons of electronic gadgets , but potty chairs should not double as toys . Nor do I care to have my child using her potty in the future to stand on to reach the sink.This is exactly what a potty should be ... a potty and nothing else . Its ergonomic design and rubber bottom makes it comfortable and stable , even on carpet . It looks remarkably similar to a real potty because if its smooth , white finish . When I got it home my 16-month-old daughter immediately knew what it was and wanted to sit on it . She now loves to sit on the potty and this one appears to be very comfortable for her.In a nutshell , it is simply made , easy to clean and perfect for potty training .	1
This seat is easy to clean , sturdy and a nice color . We bought a potty that had a face and would play music but my son thought it was a toy . With this it 's just one thing ... . A potty . So he can get down to business . Nice arch too for back support .	1
Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You ca n't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There are n't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty . If your child was like mine , she wanted to follow you everywhere , even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit , she asked to take her pants off and that 's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub , I just life it off to clean and put it back . No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size . The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler , it still fits her just fine .	1
I just received my BabyBjorn potty last week , and my daughter is only 15 months old , so I ca n't write about her being successful at potty training yet . But she has already gone # 1 in her potty the first time she ever sat on it bare-bottom , and I am thrilled . I bought this potty early so she would see it around and get use to it before being expected to use it . As soon as I took it out of the box she wanted to sit on it , and cried when I took her off or took her potty away . And because she likes sitting on it so much , she has started sitting on it immediately after I remove her dirty diapers during her diaper change , before I put her new diapers on . And about half the time she goes pee in it while she sits there.This potty is so sturdy and sanitary cause it is easy to clean . I love how long and deep the opening is , and how there is no chance for leakage . When it comes to potties , the simplest design is definitely the best . My daughter can lean on it without it tipping over , and she loves to comfortably lean against the backrest while sitting on it . The shape of this potty ensures that kids sit on it correctly every time . I am so happy I read the reviews before picking a potty , and bought this one from amazon instead of just going with whatever I could find at my local stores .	1
Easy to clean.The & # 34 ; lip & # 34 ; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty , but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the & # 34 ; bowl & # 34 ; off to pour the contents in the toilet . Even my 2 ( almost 3 ) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides . Makes it comfortable for the child , especially when we initially began using the potty .	1
This is a great little potty chair . I like its two piece design , and how easy it is to empty . I like the high back , and so does my son as he likes to `` lounge '' as he uses it . The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess , but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs . I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son ca n't scoot it across the floor . All in all , I would probably buy this chair again .	1
My son is a big kid ( tall , 28 lb , one year old with chubby legs ) and this potty fits him perfectly . He has already used it for # 1 and # 2 . He does not mind sitting on it at all so it must be comfortable to him . Mess cleans out of it easily too .	1
Bought this for my grandson when he comes over . It 's lightweight and easy to move . He seems to like it . The plastic shroud in the front is great . My only concern is that it could be bigger . If you have a boy and get this system , you 'll learn what I mean .	1
When my then 14 month old daughter started to sign `` poop '' and then within minutes would start going in her diaper , we knew that she was ready to start potty training . It took me almost 2 weeks of researching different potty 's , reading various reviews ( good and bad ) and then finally deciding on this one . Our little one took to it immediately ( not to mention the 10 potty books she had to read helped quite a bit too ) .Eventually , she would say `` poop '' and we 'd rush her to her potty chair . I read many reviews on this one and I took any reported problems that parents had ( of both boys and girls ) into consideration . I was nervous about her accidentally sitting on the splash guard or watching for her bottom having a red ring after sitting a while or the seat sticking to her bottom whenever she tried standing up and spilling pee everywhere . Honestly , I have n't had any of those issues . Her bottom does have a pink ring on it from the impression of where she was sitting on the potty seat , but it 's not like it 's sore or that it 's an actual bruise . I get one too whenever I use the toilet , so ca n't really understand why parents complained about that.This is a really good potty seat . It has a rubber bottom edge so it keeps the potty chair in place . It has a tall back support and some armrests which is really nice . The little inner potty cup is easily removed and cleaned instead of needing to pick up the whole thing.I did n't give it 5 stars because the potty chair is kind of short . My daughter is petite and I 'm surprised that she 's still kind of tall for this . I think it 's still one of the best potty 's out there .	1
Our son loves this potty . It was delivered quickly , it washes easily , and it is simply wonderful . Only positive things to say about this potty . Highly recommend .	1
My 18 month old son enjoys sitting on his & # 34 ; potty & # 34 ; . It seems very comfortable for him , and it is easy to clean .	1
This fits newborns great so if you are starting early , this is the potty to use . It has a nice high wrap around back to give support while sitting . The bottom is truly non-slip and the whole potty is so stable I use it to help stand up when sitting on the floor next to it !	1
We practice EC and have used this potty chair and the toilet for pee and poop since our baby was an infant . Most every time the big people in the house go to the toilet we put baby on her potty . We use cloth diapers and have changed very few diapers with poop . Our baby has learned to tell us when she needs to go by pointing to her diaper or by removing her diaper . A great tool for parents and kids !	1
Delivered timely , item as described , very nice and well made just as pictured , we are very happy .	1
I love this potty , we have one upstairs and one downstairs . My son does n't mind using it , it is incredibly easy to wash , get one !	1
This is a great potty . It seems very comfortable for my little guy . He 's only 9 months old , but we started potty training at 6.5 months . He loves it and stays put there . Easy to clean .	1
Perfect size for toddler2 parts so no complicated set up ( The bowl & seat ) No small nooks or crannies that can build up moldDurable plasticPortableEasy clean upConCan potentially slide easily along floorCan also potentially be flipped over by toddler if not careful	1
Great size , washes well , like the red color . Not much else to say about a poo receptacle really . My son willingly sits and stays on it and that 's about all I can ask for !	1
We have just started potty training my 22-month old , and have n't used this chair very much . It is sturdy and does n't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over . It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors . I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers ... we wanted something simple and basic , and this fits the bill . My only complaint is that the inner bowl , while very easy and quick to remove and clean , can be a blessing and a curse : when my daughter sits on it for any length of time , it sticks to her skin , and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast . That is the only thing to watch out for . Other than that , it is great !	1
I wanted a chair with a removable bowl , but now that I 've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out , part of me wishes I 'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though , it 's durable and sleek in appearance ( for a potty chair , anyway ) .ETA : OK , now I 'm glad that the bowl is removable as we 're using it more , but you do have to watch for spills . It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable .	1
This potty chair is awesome ! I have had this chair for about two weeks . I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter . I also purchased Leslie Patricelli 's `` Potty '' book in the same Amazon order . When the box arrived , I took it into my daughter 's room ( I had already cut through the tape ) and we opened it together . She was so excited . We took this right into the bathroom , so she could see . I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the `` Potty '' book is on a stand next to her potty chair . She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I did n't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays . I have been trying to get her to say the words `` potty '' , `` poop '' , and `` pee '' . She has n't said any of those words yet . However , she is starting to comprehend the words . She loves sitting on this chair and reading her `` Potty '' book . On an even better note , she has peed twice in the past two days , while sitting on her potty chair ! I was so impressed ! About the chair : It 's so perfectly simple ! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into . The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard , but it 's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated . So far nothing has splashed onto the floor . The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet . The bowl does n't have anything to lock it into place , so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning . As the description notes , the design is ergonomical and stable . The chair is high , wide , and well-curved . It would be difficult to tip over.On the ( barely ) downside . The seat is hard plastic and does n't seem comfy . However , my daughter does n't seem to mind . It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children do n't try to take the bowl out .	1
we used this for a short time and eventually it just collected dust . there 's options out there that are n't as clunky if your taking it to go .	1
My two year old loves this chair . We are just practicing sitting on it right now . It fits her well and it 's easy for her to get on and off it . It does n't slide around on the floor and she seems to be comfortable while using it .	1
This is easy to sit the baby on and easy to clean . She does n't get distracted or use it as a toy . The seat is comfortable for her height and fits her bottom and legs very well . It 's not really breakable . I like it .	1
Easy to clean , low enough for kiddo , hole was large enough for # 2 , backing made for a good reading position for the kiddo while we waited for the pee pee to come out .	1
I bought it for my 10-month old son who is extremely active . So when i got it , I was nit even sure I can seat him on the potty and keep him seated long enough . But the seat is so comfortable that he can sit in it and listen to a song for a minute or even two before he gets bored - that is usually enough to get him do his small business there . He even tries to play with it getting the white insert out and putting it back in like a puzzle though we try not to let him play with the potty much . Word of caution - when I tried to seat him for the very first time , he tried to just walk out of it and went down head-first - he was not a strong walker back then but I was ready and caught him and put him right back so he did not get scared of the experience . We had to pick him up to standing until he was about 10.5 months old and became more confident standing and walking though . He can stand up carefully from it - no stumbles since then .	1
We really like this potty chair , got this in pink color and it looks very cute . It 's stable but at the same time very light . The back part is very comfortable i think , it lets ur baby lean back relax and concentrate on the important process : ) also its very easy to clean , just take the white part out and wash it . We are very happy with this product .	1
Very good material , nice and sturdy . Smooth and rounded at all edges . The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use . Definitely deserves an award for design ! This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor 's brands but it works for us because it 's exactly what we needed for our daughter !	1
My daughter has loved her potty . She is 10 mo old and has enjoyed sitting on it . The second day we had it she went pee pee on it and we are now a week into having it and today she went potty 4 times on it at 10 MO OLD ! I am so glad we have our BABYBJORN to help us EC .	1
This was great for potty training and then great for teaching my son to go potty on his own . I would recommend this chair .	1
The size is perfect for our bathroom ( which has about 4x4 ' of walking floor space ) , and the shape is great . It has a nice & # 34 ; splash guard & # 34 ; on the front , so I 'm not worried about the little man peeing over the top . He has yet to use it successfully , but he has been interested in it since the day it arrived ! Training techniques aside , it 's a solid little training seat .	1
We 've had several potty chairs and I 'd say I like this one best . It has a high back and armrests , making it comfortable for my daughter to sit . There are n't a whole lot of cracks and crevices , which makes it easy to clean . The chair is sturdy and does n't tip over . It is larger than some of the other chairs , which were a little too small as my daughter grew . If I had to do it over again , I 'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE : This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew . It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law . She agreed it is a good chair .	1
This is working great for us . So far she 's pee'ed ( spelling ? ) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here . Definitely a great product .	1
We love this potty ! ! We 're doing elimination communication ( & # 34 ; EC & # 34 ; ) with our daughter so we started & # 34 ; pottying & # 34 ; her almost as soon as she was born . Because we did n't know any better at the time , we first used a toilet seat reducer or just held her in the infant-in-arms EC position . Luckily , at around 4 months , we found this potty and have never looked back.The high back is perfect for infants who are n't able to sit up yet fully unsupported . We still needed to closely supervise , as she would sometimes lean forward and , once , she took a dive and ended up bruising her forehead on the bathroom floor . I blame myself fully , as I had looked away momentarily . Now that our daughter is older ( 11 months ) , her feet touch the ground , so she 's much more secure in the seat . She still needs close supervision though , as she likes to try and stand up out of the seat.I also love that the insert is easily removable . We just flush the & # 34 ; contents & # 34 ; and rinse the insert out with water in the sink . Every now and again we 'll let it soak in warm soapy water , but if it 's washed right away after use , it stays quite clean.All in all , this is a great potty and we 're very happy with our purchase . Thanks Baby Bjorn !	1
My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it 's comfortable . Have n't personally tried it myself ! Easy to dump and keep clean so it 's a winner in our book .	1
We had a purchased a couple of other types of potty chairs for our toddler and were disappointed in the size or fit . This one worked great - in fact we got three - one for each of the grandparents ' homes as well as the toddler 's home . Easy to clean , good fit , the best we found .	1
My son and I love this potty . I never had a hard time training him to use it . In fact , I only told him once what to do , and he was using it since then . He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time . He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy . He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that . My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs . Cleaning is also very easy , even without a liner . This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner . I only have good words to say about this potty . I have no complaints at all .	1
I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair . When we first started potty training , it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child , it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone . By the time she was 2.5 , she had no issues getting on and off . The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean . The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work : ) Great little potty !	1
We got this to help us with elimination communication on our 6 week old . She really was n't digging the in arms position and we were n't feeling confident holding her in it . When we first got this it was hit and miss if she would like it . Because she is so small still and ca n't sit on her own and the potty is a bit big for her to lean on the chair part , we sit her very close to the front and hold her upper body up . I realized when she has been bundled up and then we take her potty she did n't like the cold plastic on her legs . So we bought some leg warmers and problem solved . Now she is 9 weeks and on good days we are happily catching most of her potty needs . Right now we keep the potty on our bathroom counter facing the mirror and some lotion bottles , she 's loves looking at herself and reaching for the bottles while going . When she 's older we plan to keep it on the floor so she can reach it by herself .	1
I love this potty seat . There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into . Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean . This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids . The lip in front looked too high at first . But actually it is perfect . Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys . I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training . I just might keep this seat forever ... .I will have visiting grandchildren someday . : )	1
My husband insisted that our son would potty train with those on the adult toilet seat inserts . We bought all different types . Potty training just was n't working . I actually researched many of these potty chairs right here on amazon and the Babybjorn had the best reviews and comments , so I managed to convince my husband that we should at least try it . Best decision ever . My son 's potty training excellerated . Now he enjoys sitting on this potty . It 's the best height for him and he even likes emptying the receptical into the big toilet . Easy to clean . Now my youngest likes to just sit on this potty , even fully clothed . He feels like a big boy copying what his brother does . Very glad we made the decision to go with this basic floor potty .	1
This IS a great potty . Easy to clean and simple in design , HOWEVER , if your son has learned to stand up to pee , then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up . Of course , we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl , but in the meantime , we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty , which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design , and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it . I would 've gotten their one piece smaller potty , however , my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy , so I was n't sure if he would fit on the seat .	1
Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training . She has low muscle tone , so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her , and this one does the trick . She seems very comfortable sitting on it , I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position . I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth , without many little creases , nooks or crannies where , um , germs might get stuck -- so it 's very easy to clean . That 's a relief for me !	1
This is the best potty that I could find out there . The size is perfect for our small bathroom , and our 19 month old sits comfortably on it . I am sure that it would be comfortable for most children who are potty training as well . I wanted something that was comfortable , compact , and without all the bells and whistles ( lights , toys , sounds , etc. ) . This potty is perfect and I recommend it to anyone !	1
Thanks to Amazon 's 90 day return policy , we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try . No , he did n't `` use '' them , just sat on them to test durability , comfort , and function.Durability - solid plastic . I 'm not going to sit on it , but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty . the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect . The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys . Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough ( or not there ) , which could be a disaster . Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home . We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders , etc but do n't use it . Avoid the `` talking '' potties and create your own reward system ( M & M ; 's work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets ) . You can also get one of the more basic , smaller potties to keep in your car for trips .	1
We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet ( built in type , portable type , and a cushioned type ) . My son was refusing to use that to potty train , and we decided to try this one instead . It took awhile , but now he 's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size , does n't require help from us , and can be put right in front of the tv ( we 'll have to change this last one soon ! ) . He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his & # 34 ; small potty & # 34 ; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it , it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair , and the splash guard is great for the boys . There 's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too .	1
This is a very nice potty chair . It is a sleek , simple design , easy to clean , no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles . I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty ( not starting training yet ) . I have a small ( 18 pound ) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall . I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty , which is a very similar design without the high back/sides , and it seems to be a much better size for my needs . It appears that the bowls are interchangeable . I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes .	1
I love this potty . Because it only has two pieces to it , its easy to clean . The high pee-guard means no need to supervise when my son is using it . We do n't ever have any splashing incidents . Like most stand alone potties , it is very small and low to the ground so I do n't anticipate being able to use it for much longer .	1
I got this potty after reading reviews on all the potty 's on Amazon . What a great potty . My 18 month old son loves it . He is just starting out with his potty training . He pooped and peed on the second day of training and just loves the idea on sitting bottomless on this potty . He has had zero issues with it and I have no complaints . Great potty !	1
My son was so excited when he seen his big boy potty ! This has made training so much fun for him . I love that it 's simple without all the bells and whistles ( distractions ! ) and looks like an actual mini toilet . The gaurd on this is higher than most which is also great for boys to prevent spraying everywhere . Simple to clean too .	1
*Ever have your kid on the potty in a dim room and wonder whether he actually made anything yet ? I just realized I could stick my cell phone through the hole in the back of the BB potty , and it glows through the seat so I can see what 's inside ! This seat is an absolute must for potty training . Right height , comfortable back to relax and let things happen etc , but let 's get real - we care about the clean up , right ? NO POTTY beats this one for clean up . The sturdy non skid big piece stays on the ground as you clean the bowl , or hold it up for a boy working on his stand-up pee . I had one of those potties that had a little tray to catch the poop , but got rid of it because poop can exceed the height of that little tray , even for very little guys , if it 's stacked just right . If that happens , how are you supposed to pull the tray out without smearing it all over the potty ? This has a nice deep bowl that keeps everything dropping down.I 've read reviews that said the front was too high and can hurt a baby , others say its too low and does n't catch the pee . I have two boys , and this was just high enough to teach them to point it down a bit , which was useful when they later used public toilets . They have never had trouble avoiding it when sitting though , so have not hurt themselves on it .	1
I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on . We did n't pressure her to use it , but would casually ask . She would run in and sit on it , read on it , and sing songs . Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose ! Still in the potty training process , but this is a great starter tool . I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went .	1
I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front . I broke down and bought this . This does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty . But it 's beauty is its simplicity . he is able to sit and do his business , carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself ( he was not even 2 yet ! ) . I would highly recommed the potty training book `` Potty training in less than a day '' . it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on [ ... ] .	1
This is great , partly because it 's low-profile and does n't take up much space , and also ( best of all ) because it 's SO easy to clean ! The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution . Even the white does n't discolor over time . The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile , so that 's convenient . I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small , simple quality training toilet . For boys , the pee guard lip works pretty well .	1
This is a child sized toilet . It is attractive looking . We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent 's house . Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it . I think it is easy to clean , just remove the inner seat , empty , and rinse . My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that . I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet . We are big fans of this .	1
We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs ( the ones that turn into step stools ) because the back is higher and it has arm rests . Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space . Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler . Also , despite its 'lack ' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe . The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature ! Highly recommend this potty chair !	1
Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own . This was for my first child , now 3 and we bought this over a year ago . He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he 'll be using it for a while to come . It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new . He 's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit . It was a year ago , and it still is . For the novice parent of boys , it does n't matter how high they make the splash guard , boys need to point it down . That took some learning on my part . We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too , but we 've hardly used it . He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own .	1
This is a really nice potty chair , I like the high back since my toddler is special needs and has trouble sitting up , this gives her a little extra support in the back . The color is cute . Really just your basic potty chair , no bells or whistles , but that fits our needs . Four stars .	1
Sturdy , serves the purpose , plus it is stylish in design . I ca n't get my 2 year old to use it for anything else than playing with , so we 've reverted to the toilet seat ring on the toilet which she will use to go potty .	1
I have two different pottys . This is my granddaughters favorite . It is very easy to empty and clean . I love it .	1
Our son just turned two and we have begun introducing him to his own potty . This chair is great.Pros:1- Sturdy . He leans forward to get a wayward car or his stuffed teddy and it does not tip forward with him2- Catches all of the day 's product , nothing has escaped yet- the guard is tall enough.3- Easy to take the pot out and dump into the toilet but because he is sitting on it , no chance for him to pull it out and dump while he is sitting.4- Easy to clean ( the most important ? ) Con:1- Once he has stuck to the pot and when he stood up quickly , it stuck to him and dumped . A minor problem in the grand scheme of things and it has not happened since.We bought one for grandma 's house and would recommend highly	1
Nice looking potty , white insert is removable for easy cleaning . Cute color , yellow lining on bottom of potty . And is BPA free ! ! !	1
Why I love this toilet ... .it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there ... but really , why do you need them ? This one is easy to clean ... must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom ... it is the perfect height ... and has a nice seat back ... .best part , it does n't tip over ( yet at least ) . Not sure how it works for boys ... but for a girl it worked well .	1
I keep this potty as a spare in our master bath ( we have other potty seats by Bjorn ) . My son loves this potty , and so do I . The simple design makes it easy to clean and use . Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper potties made of thin plastic . I returned every one of them and purchased all Bjorn products . I love how sturdy their designs are .	1
We wanted a potty for our daughter to start using once day when she was about 7 months old . This one has been great - it is n't so big that her butt falls through the hole , but it definitely has room to grow . She seems to like sitting on it and using it and it is very easy to clean .	1
Like this chair . It 's small , convenient and gets the job done . The back rest really helps the baby . Would certainly recommend to others .	1
I was very satisfied with the quality of this potty chair . However , my daughter used it as a piano bench for her toy piano and nothing else . Then one day I took her to a family restroom that had a little potty in it and she ran for it to go sit down . I immediately bought her a potty chair that looked more like a real toilet and found that she actually was interested in potty training , she just did n't realize this chair was supposed to be a potty .	1
My daughter loves this potty . She is 17 months and we are just starting to introduce her to the potty . It is sturdy and bright . She can sit in it for a while , even if sometimes she does n't do anything in it : - ) I just wish it had a lid , it would make it a little easier to keep her from throwing toys into it .	1
I use cloth diapers and was anxious to at least get the BM 's into the toilet instead of having to wash them . I bought this for my son when he was 8mths old and we have been using it for BM 's . I am fortunate to be able to stay home with my son so I am in close contact with him and can tell when he is trying to go # 2 . As soon as I see his BM face ( starts pushing , and eyelids get red ) I quickly take off his diaper and sit him on this potty . It works great . With him being so small you do need to sit directly in front him and entertain with a song or a toy as he does his business but it is worth it . I do n't always catch the BM 's but have to clean a lot fewer ones by using the toilet.This seat is comfortable and I like the back part because he can sit back without falling over . If he is not positioned quite right he might pee outside but for the most part if you are watching closely it contains everything just fine . : )	1
My daughter loves this potty . She actually thinks using it is fun . My wife and I have bought a few other potties that just did n't work that well . This one is perfect . We are so happy we bought it .	1
This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on . We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age , the other potty we had was & # 34 ; the shortest on the market & # 34 ; but bc of the design she had trouble . She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front . The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it . Like the gray color too .	1
We are just now introducing the potty to my toddler ; therefore , have yet to use it in its full capacity . He appears to fit great on it and it looks as it it will be easy to clean .	1
The seat is the perfect size for toddlers , contoured to be comfortable , and designed to be easy to clean . Your little one will sit and be situated as i the same body position as an adult on a real toilet . The raised front of the white part serves as both a pommel/hand rest and a splash guard . The white bowl is deep enough to prevent most splashes . The back and arms are high enough to make your little one feel secure and allow him/her to rest against them . The seat does not slide on tile flooring . When your baby is done , just lift the white bowl and clean . Perfect potty training chair . Fits almost anywhere and is very light .	1
I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training , he 's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile . I saw that some people commented that it was small , which is what i was actually looking for , and it works great for us . The back is great , he can sit on quite comfortably , so long as I entertain him ! He has used successfully , and it 's really easy to empty . I just add some water if needed and flush it , the seat just lifts out.There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up , but he does n't seem to mind.Here 's a tip : since he still pretty short and his feel do n't reach the floor , I use something to put his feet on for leverage , and it really helps . The baby wipes container is perfect .	1
I find these cloth diapers very useful . I use them as burp cloths and to have handy in case of spills or other baby related messes . They are absorbent and comfortable to use . They are soft , so they do n't scratch my babies face when I clean his mouth . I first bought 1 package and then went back for more . They are inexpensive and very useful .	1
These for cloth diapering ? Um , no way . Way too thin for that . These for burp cloths ? Absolutely ! While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use , they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers . My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough ... I can not imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd , 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time . These are easily washed and inexpensive ... admittedly not as pretty , but most mothers get over `` pretty '' real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time ! lol	1
A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers . I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold , and fortunately , received these . They are large - 27 '' x 27 '' square and are essential for baby care . I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old . I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day . They work great as burp cloths , and are superb for wiping up other food messes . Additionally , I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months . Extremely durable , fold-up rather small for travel , and launder well . 101 uses , I love them !	1
Love these ! Absorbent , soft , inexpensive , held up well after many MANY washes , no stains , ect . My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers . When she was a newborn , she 'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her . As she got older , she 'd arch her back , scream , and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her . So when she was a newborn , I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style ( no plastic cover , although you could use one ) to give her a break from her disposable diaper . We 've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time . Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper ( fold in fourths , then half ) and Thirsties ( fold in thirds , then half ) . You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers .	1
these are great . got them in 2009 for my son - never used as a diaper ... these came in handy in a bath , and when baby was falling asleep he would use it to cover himself . Now with my daugher I am using another pack of these - would recommend	1
I disagree with whoever said that these are too thin for burp cloths . They do look gauzy , but fold them over once , and they 're thick enough to absorb most of my baby 's spit-ups entirely , and ( apologies if this gets graphic ) even a single layer is effective at catching all the chunky bits in spit-up which can cause your clothes to smell . I fear that the prefolds would be too bulky for me and not nearly broad enough . I like the simple , large form of these diapers.I use these predominantly as burp clothes . They are so absorbent , so effective , so economical , and so handy . I have three packs , and I really needed them all when my baby was a newborn . I keep a tall stack on my coffee table , and I 'm always ready for errant bodily fluids.I also occasionally use these to wipe up all manner of spills . They 're extremely effective at drying dishes and wiping down counter tops . In a pinch , they make great handkerchiefs for my runny nose when I 'm out for a walk with the stroller . I also fold them and put them in my baby 's ( all-in-one-cloth ) diaper if I want to give it a bit more absorbing power . Tuck one in the car-seat , another in your pocket , and lay one under your baby 's head when she goes down for a nap . They do n't take up much room in the laundry , so you might as well use them liberally and keep the rest of your life clean and dry !	1
I 'm a first time mother , and no one told me about using cloth diapers for just about everything ( apparently all mothers know this ) . My friend bought me a pack for my shower , and I now use them for burp cloths , lap pads , covering my son when changing him ( another mother 's secret -- to prevent being urinated on ) , etc . Apparently they make great dust rags when baby grows up ! !	1
Love that these are cotton - texture is great and they are actually much softer than they look . We do n't actually use these for diapers . I bought them as `` temporary burp cloths '' while deciding on some others . I now use these exclusively . One thing I love about them is that they wash very well - I do n't spray them with any stain remover and they come out clean every time simply using Dreft detergent.We also use them to `` catch '' my little boys ' geyser , as my husband refers to it , during diaper changes . I think these would also be great for household cleaning as well ( I 'd use separate ones for those ) . These also make a great light-weight , breathable blanket for blocking the sun - we live in Texas , so this is a huge plus !	1
I do not use these as diapers , but I could n't live w/o them . When my baby was really little , I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly . These are much easier to change and wash than those covers . These are also the best burp cloths . My daughter has really bad acid reflux , and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up . I go through about 5 a day . They are VERY absorbant !	1
It may be telling that I 've never had old Gerber flats . Maybe if I had 20 or 30 year old diapers to compare these to , I 'd give them a much lower rating . But I don't.These are absolutely the cheapest way to cloth diaper a baby if you want to buy new diapers . They 're an ultra-basic birdseye cotton . MANY modern cotton flats are birdseye . They do indeed appear thin . BUT after a few washes , they are super-soft . I really can not over-talk how wonderfully soft they are . They 're a very close second to the flannel receiving blankets I also use as diapers.For comparison , I bought some OsoCozy flats , also sold here on Amazon , back in January . Those flats are visibly thicker . After I prepped the OsoCozy diapers , I did a head-to-head comparison . I put my daughter in an origami-folded Gerber flat , pinned , and kept her coverless until she peed . Then I did the same with the OsoCozy flats -- same fold , same pinning , etc and kept her coverless until she peed . End result ? These are JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive diapers.So , why am I not giving them five stars ? One reason only : size . Flat diapers are supposed to last your baby from the newborn stage through toilet training . These really wo n't . For all that the product description says they 're 27x27 , they 're not , at least not after being washed . They are very rectangular after prepping , and pretty small.Their small size makes them PERFECT newborn diapers , though . Even if most of your stash is all-in-one diapers , you would do well to buy a couple dozen of these for the first couple of months , especially if you tend to have smallish babies ( one-size diapers do n't usually fit below 8lbs ) . They work perfectly for small babies -- yes , they even contain breastfed poop ! -- and once your babe has outgrown their intended use , they are FANTASTIC for stuffing pockets , lining gDiapers ( this is my usual use for them these days ) , and using as doublers for fitted diapers or overnight diapers .	1
These looked huge when I took them out of the package ! Do n't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash . These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you do n't have to worry about staining them . They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached . After the first wash , they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue . In short , I love them . I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day . I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house , but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that ! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house .	1
i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby . i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk . its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples . i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela . buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk . otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions .	1
These are the only bottles I use and they work well . They are very durable & dishwasher safe . I have a medela pump also . My daughter is breastfed and feeds from these well , except for with the slow flow nipples - I recommend a fast flow nipple unless you want to take over a half hour to feed your baby while he/she struggles to get the milk out . I should mention that she is not picky ( becasue some babies are ) about what type/brand of nipple she uses as long as the flow is not too slow .	1
I use these to pump & store my milk with the Medela Harmony pump . Each bottle is the perfect amount for 1-2 feedings for my 6-week old baby . But the nipples are worthless -- -not shaped like me in the least ( and probably like no one ! ) -- my husband tried them once while I was away ( when we first bought them ) and she hated them . Instead we pour the milk into a Playtex drop-ins system bottle with the big slow-flow nipple .	1
This is really handy with the mini electric pump that I have . I can pump straight into the bottles . I just use the bottle occasionally so this item works great for me . The nipples are a fast flow so the first time I fed my baby , the milk flow was too fast . I just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples and it 's perfect for my baby .	1
I have not had a problem with using these bottles on my older model of the medela pump . Very helpful to have extras !	1
Working full-time and pumping at work and at home . Needed the extra set . Did n't hurt when I saw them come with the nipples for those emergency feedings in the car !	1
This is a must have for working moms who have the medela pumps . The extra bottles come in handy for transporting milk to daycare and for expressing milk on the job . Would n't live without the extra set .	1
I needed to pump when I went back to work and I bought a couple of these on top of those that were provided with the Medela Pump In Style . They are very resistant , easy to clean , and the rings and caps are very useful.I only put 4 stars because the nipples are useless if your baby is already using another brand , and I would have prefered another bottle and accessories instead .	1
These bottles are great but are very pricey . I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer . I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles , but for $ 18.99 for 6 , I needed to find another alternative . I did some research and found bottles made my Mother 's Milkmate ( mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay ) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings . The refrigerator storage system is great too , you have to check out the website to understand what I mean . If you love these bottles , you 've love the milkmate ones as well.Hope this helps and saves you money !	1
we used these bottle because they are compatible with the medela pump . the 5oz capacity is much better than the tiny 2oz ones . my wife was very happy when they came . I would check to make sure these do n't have bisphenol A ( BPA ) , we did n't know about back when we got them . fast shipping .	1
I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child . Unfortunatly I was unable to do that . But these bottles work wonderfully with formula ! My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well . I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become `` gummy '' and `` sticky '' , but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time , which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them !	1
I love medela bottles , I love that they are BPA free . I love this product , I like the way it looks , the only thing I HATE are the bottle nipples . They look horrible and my two month old daughter does not like them at all . I went online and got other medela nipples , those she likes .	1
I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump , and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly . I like having many bottles on hand so that I do n't need to wash them every day . I do n't freeze my milk in these ( I use Gerber bags ) , but they 're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles . I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples ( these nipples seem too fast-flowing ) .	1
These are great to put under a Pack-N-Play , or on top of a changing table . Or even to change baby on the floor , or on the go . They are soft , absorbent , and portable .	1
I use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle . It is a bit wide for my cradle , so I just tuck in the sides . It is wide for the portable changing pad , but still works good !	1
I love these pads ! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it . It is so soft and absorbent ! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings . I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms do n't always appear clean . It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold . I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery . Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them . They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere . Will use for next bundle of joy !	1
This pad is great to place under your sheets in parent 's bed where mom sleeps and nurses . Just the right size to shield mattress from excess breastmilk !	1
I bought it for the playpen , which it says it fits . It does n't . It is a little to big , but I managed to make it work . I bought it because I can use it on his crib or it says a twin bed , which is would be too small for . It does it 's job at keeping the bed clean from wetness which is all I need .	1
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition to the mattress pad . I have about 4 of them and they are essential . I use John Lennon receiving blankets ( 6 is a good number ) with the quilted multi-use pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad . I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on . It 's nearly impossible to do when you 've had a c-section , and not a good idea to strain yourself .	1
This pad can be used for anything ! I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on , under him during & quot ; let 's give that touschi some air & quot ; time , and as a take along for diaper changes ... no one 's going to tell you but they secretly do n't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa ! Go figure.Also , unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad ' it does n't pill up enough to care .	1
This product seems great . You can use it for every purpose which involves your baby . We have them in different sizes for the Crib , bassinett , playard , and just extra changing pads for middle of the night changes and carry around pad . They absorb great and wash with no problems . I tumble dry low , that way they keep their shape longer . Take them everywhere and dont have to worry about laying your little one on hard cold surfaces when diaper changing . Very affordable and worth every penny . I highly recommend to every parent .	1
This pad fits my Arm 's Reach Co-sleeper great . I bought this to put between the mattress and sheet . The pad gives it more cushion and will absorb any leaks if they happen . I washed it and the pad washed great .	1
I use this and the smaller ones all the time . I have this in the crib as a mattress pad , I put it on the changing table over the cover for an extra barrier . I use the smaller ones when traveling to lay down to change my child in public areas ( those koala tables ) They are durable and easy to clean . Everyone should have a few of these .	1
I bought two of these and I just love them . I use both of them at the same time -- one for his head , the other for his butt . They do the trick of catching spit-up , vomit , and leaking diaper problems . These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I do n't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time . They 're getting a little fuzzy now that they 've been through the wash a few times , but for $ 7 , I think these pads are a great buy ! !	1
I used this to protect the Pack N Play and crib mattresses , which proved very effective . However , as a regular changing pad , it spends more time in the bleach bucket than in the nursery ! Regular burp cloths are softer on Baby 's face and less bulky . The only reason I can think to use the quarter sized sheets is for the annual visit with Santa . Santa might appreciate that !	1
I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play . LOVE THEM ! Great item to have !	1
I use this pad on top of my son 's mattress as well as the smaller sizes for his playard bassinet and the changing table . They may not be the softest on the market but they work very well . For the price , you can afford to buy several so that you do n't have to do laundry as often . The only thing I did n't like about these pads is they seem to shrink a bit when put into the dryer . My advice is to line dry them to avoid this problem .	1
What I like about these pads are the way the do n't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets . My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table , so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house . And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day , whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere . They worked wonderfully . They come clean easily and I do n't mind that the cotton pills up . That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors .	1
Of all of my baby purchases , these have been used the most ! I have three that I keep around -- one for the diaper bag , one for the bedroom , and one for the laundry -- and I do n't know what I would do without them . Since my baby is only 6 weeks old , I keep him in the bedroom with me at night . I just throw one of these on the bed when I 'm changing him at night so I do n't have to walk across the house to his room to use the changing table . It is water resistant ( and everything baby can `` spill '' on it resistant ) and it is large enough so that if my little guy starts to go to the bathroom while I am changing his diaper , it gets on this pad instead of the bed . The one in the diaper bag is also very useful -- much more practical than the plastic covered changing pads that come with diaper bags . Because this is much larger , and absorbant , I just throw it out on the seat of the car , or on the public restroom changing table , or on the floor , or wherever I need to change him , and it covers a nice large area -- I do n't have to worry about him touching any dirty surfaces . I will buy these for all of my frieds having babies -- I recommed getting at least 3 or 4 of them to keep around !	1
These pads have definitely come in handy . They are super absorbent , very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things . When my daughter first came home I used them under her , on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her . I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play . I also use on on the floor under her activity gym ( Sparkling Symphony Gym ) since it does n't include a mat . I also have two at Grandma 's for changing and laying on the bed . They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse . I would recommend buying a pack even if you do n't think you 'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use .	1
These pads are soft and absorbent - just the right size to put on a cradle . The smaller size is perfect for laying on top of a changing table . They wash well and I have n't noticed shrinkage . Good value and worth having a couple of different sizes on hand .	1
I love my pad , I use it under my bassinet sheet . It has proven to be very durable . I also have the mattress pad made by this company as well . Worth every penny !	1
This pad is perfect for our playard . I put it under the sheet and I have no worries about trying to clean the matress board since the material can not come off . It is very soft , provides an extra layer of padding since playards are so hard , and it can be washed and dried in the machines no problem . Even when we go on vacation we pack it up with the playard . Great investment for your babies saftey , babies confort , your sanity ( when trying to wash the playard matress ) , and what makes this even better is the price ! ! ! !	1
These pads are wonderful ! ! I began using them for my daughter in both her portable crib and regular crib as an infant . Now that she has moved into a `` big girl bed '' at 2 I also use them under her sheet to protect her mattress for those occasional nights when she wets through her diaper . They are great and have held up wonderfully wash after wash . Very affordable and very versatile .	1
We 've tried a lot of different sipper cups , but these are our absolute favorites ! We 've been using them for 17 years . The valves are easy to remove and to clean , unlike other brands that grow mold inside a valve you ca n't really clean out . They do n't leak unless banged upside down onto a table or floor , and the valves are easily replaced once they start to wear out.Unfortunately , it 's getting hard to find this particular style of the playtex cups . Since they last a very long time , we 've replaced valves and are using some very old ones . We 've even replaced lids once upon a time.I ordered one set of these recently , hoping they 'd be boy-colored for my new one year old . Unfortunately , we received pink and purple flowered ones . My 3 year old was thrilled and the 1 year old does n't really care at the moment . I 'm not sure if there 's a way to request a boy-theme or not , but we 'll probably order again sometime soon and take our chances .	1
We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best . My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest . For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts . They were getting expensive to replace . I tried other hard spout cups but he did n't like them . I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but could n't find them . Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them . My son loves these . They are easy to clean , do n't leak and he happily drinks out of them . I have ordered several packs of them . All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints . I highly recommend these cups .	1
I 'm a huge fan of Playtex sippies . I 've tried many brands and these are the sturdiest and leak the least amount then anything we 've tried . We have 3 children using sippies and so they get a lot of wear and tear on them . They last us for years . This was a great price and I could n't get it this cheap in the store . I like the insulated ones better but for the price these were worth it .	1
These have been around for a long time , and it 's because they 're the best . We have several different kinds of sippy cups , but these are the most dependable and the easiest . Definitely a favorite in our household .	1
These cups do n't spill , but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter . She 's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily , so that 's not the cups fault . She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little . So if your baby is fine with a faster flow ... go for it ! I 'm hoping to use these once she 's a little older since they really do n't leak at all . She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out !	1
My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out . He is getting better now after a few months of having them . He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out ! It 's a great cup that way , totally spillproof ! Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer . The valves are easy to put in and take out , my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice .	1
We 've been using these cups since my son was around 8 months . He had another sippy with a silicon tip and handles at first , but we wanted to introduce a cup that he could use for many years to come . This is it ! Cups with silicone tips WILL leak if they get bent . I can throw this cup in the diaper bag and not worry that it 's going to leak . It has n't leaked once . I love that this cup will fit in most cup holders . It 's super easy to clean with it 's THREE parts . You can use them as regular drinking cups for older kids .	1
Last year when I was pregnant , I asked other moms which cups and bottles to use . A few told me playtex , but most told me Avent bottles and sippy cups were the only way to go . Well , I decided to go Avent , and here I am writing a review for a playtex sippy cup . Avent sippy cups are hard to hold , difficult to drink from when the cup is not filled to capacity , a pain to clean , and worst of all they leak . The spout leaks ( nothing magic about those cups ) and the collars can leak too . I finally decided after 5 months of using Avent magic cups with little success , to give the & quot ; hard to use & quot ; ( as one mom had classified ) playtex cup a try . The difference was astounding . My daughter could easily drink from this cup on the first try . The cup is easy to clean ( its only 3 pieces as opposed to the 5 or 6 ( w/handles ) pieces for the avent cup ) , assemble and use . I 'm sorry I did n't at least register for a pack of these when I was pregnant . I should mention that I	1
does not leak , relatively easy to clean , nothing to chew trough ( it is amazing that a replacement part for a soft spout may cost as much as a new sippy ) and yes , the bottle is finally gone !	1
The only time I 've had one of these sippy cups leak is from operator error . I have two kids ages 4.5 and 2.5 and have used several different brands of sippy cups and these are by far the best . I 've gotten rid of most of the sippy cups in my house but did keep these around for when my 2.5 yr old wants a drink of water in her bed at night or if my neices or nephews need one when they come over . I loved these so much , I could n't bring myself to get rid of them !	1
the last set that I bought was the wrong colors but I used them anyhow ... they wash good and last long .	1
My wife purchased these from another store for more than twice the price so I decided to bring down the cost average after we found out that they do not leak . There is a small rubber piece that fits in the spout to control the speed that the liquid comes out . After your child gets old enough you can eliminate the rubber piece . I think these are great to use as soon as you stop using bottles . After you stop using , the rubber flow control piece you can use them until your child grows out of sippy cups or you lose them . Great choice . Highly recommended .	1
We have been through soooooooo many sippy cups . My kids only like these . They do n't leak and they stand up to a million dishwasher cycles . I should probably take apart the top pieces every once and awhile ... but I do n't .	1
It said colors may vary but I got the same as shown . Nothing exciting and does the same function , made well , but looks dull , very dull ... . Wish you can pick out your own but these will do for now .	1
I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away . I use to think that using the soft sippy cups was a great transition from bottles..NOT ! ! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid . I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain , anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them . I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly	1
My son needed more replacement valves as his seemed to all dissapear down the garbage disposer . Well I ordered these and got PINK cups instead of the blue/green shown . Oops . I really did n't think colors vary would vary between sex 's - I assumed wrongly they 'll all be unisex . Well he wo n't use them of course , but that 's fine my 3 year old daughter just added them to her collection and I will pick up more cups for him somewhere else . Cups work fine though .	1
I like these cups a lot . I love the colors . They are easy to use and easy to wash. My toddler loves them . I have n't had any issues with the cups leaking and I have been using them for 6 months . They seem sturdy even after I have been washing them in the dishwasher since day one . Great value too !	1
These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles . If you use a Medela pump , you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers , eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain.I also find that the small sizes are convenient , especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I did n't give this product five stars , though , because , really , these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc . If you have a bunch of bottles anyway , you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $ 4 and use those instead .	1
If you are using Avent bottles , these storage containers are a must . Very convenient and versatile ( use as bottles , sippy cups , storing breastmilk , babyfood ) , easy to clean . Nice size to take to work or anywhere . You can use these with the Medela Pump in Style breast pump , but you need to buy an adaptor from Avent .	1
These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk . Unlike some of the reviews I read , I have experienced no leaking thusfar . I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful ( and they are acrylic , so reheating is much easier ) . My only complaint is that they are slightly too small . I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz . and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk ( which is too precious ! ) . However , I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product !	1
I love these breastmilk storage containers . They make it so easy to collect the milk , cap it , and store it . When I need the milk , I just take them out of the freezer , heat it in the bottle heater , put on a nipple and go . They are great . Perfect size for my baby who still only drinks about 3-4 ounces per sitting . I will definitely continue to use these after she outgrows them for milk as baby food containers . They are great .	1
These storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula . I like making a few bottles at night then later at night as I need them I warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and I am ready to feed my daughter . I love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use .	1
I love this containers . First of all , I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump , so these containers are perfect for me . I express into these containers -- freeze them -- thaw them out -- replace the sealing disc with the nipple -- warm it up . Then my husband is ready to feed the baby . It 's one of their times together , and I get to spend time with my older children . Perfect .	1
I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps do n't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh . I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle .	1
I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out . I love these containers for this use . I do n't have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar.I gave these 4 stars because I did n't get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer ( which is why I registered for them in the first place ) . It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles . I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer .	1
Love this containers . These work well with the Avent on the Go breast pump system . I have n't had any problems with freezing them and they have n't cracked . Love the fact that they are small containers ( 4oz ) so they freeze well and when it 's time for the milk to be defrosted it does n't take long . I plan to make my own babyfood and I am going to use these containers . LOVE THEM	1
These are great . They do n't leak and are nice and sturdy . The tops come off and nipple tops can be directly attached . After he stopped with these bottles , I used them since they had flat closed tops , to shake up his formula . I love Avent products and these are wonderful.They attach to the bottom of the Avent VIA Isis pump directly which was nice . Great for storage of baby food later on as well . Tops can be used with 9ounce bottles as well .	1
This is great ! It 's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs . My 6 month old does n't slide around in this and it 's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her . ( Could n't do that with the plastic tub . ) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up . It even has a suction cup so it does n't slide around in the tub . ( I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath . ) This tub just makes bathtime much easier !	1
We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub . I put it in the tub and though my daughter does n't sit up yet , she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her . Yes , it is more strenuous for my back but it 's good fun and exercise for my baby . Also , we do n't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods ( like those you use to hang a shower curtain ) above the tub and store it on them . This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I ca n't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in . O , by the way , I have n't reinflated it once since I bought it ( about 2 months ago or so ) - yes , some of the air escaped , as with all inflatables , but it 's still sturdy enough . I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit ' in it and play with her toys . I find it very versatile .	1
I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received . The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo . But the one thing i needed was a drain . The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out . Such a hassle while washing a 9month old . Not with this one though . I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great , so my son do n't soak in dirty water which he does pee in .	1
My almost 1 year old grew out of the hard plastic-type infant/baby tub so looked for one that was softer and bigger . This one works great . Like the dain plug and the suction cup to keep it from sliding in the tub .	1
I was worried about this purchase reading all the reviews . So far so good . My 9 month old son loves the water we use this in the tub for bath time where he splashes and has fun . I bought the Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion , Blue to go in it . I use that sometimes as I do n't find the bottom of the tub that slippery , my son stands up in it and does n't slip.But I was worried about safety so I purchased the cushion.We also use it for a swimming pool , sort of . We have had some very hot days so I take it out side on my deck putting a old blanket underneath & he just sits in it and plays.I like it also when he has diaper rash as I can put the baking soda in the water to help dry it up and the height of the tub allows me to get it high enough over his butt .	1
I bought this because my baby was n't old enough to sit up yet but was getting way too big for her plastic tub . This works great ! You do n't have to worry about them slipping in a big tub and it saves water ! She is now able to sit on her own and she really enjoys splashing around in this . I love how much safer it is and its big enough for her to use for a couple of years .	1
We were in that in between stage for the bath . My son was way to big for the baby tub . But at nine months to small for the real thing . I did not need a tub that had slots for the shampoo because then my Son spends all of his time trying to play with the shampoo . This works great . Soft , blows up easily , roomy but not too roomy . This is a good product .	1
This is perfect for my 15 month baby whose 32 inches long , 26 lbs. , it 's well made and not slippery at all , easy to clean and the suction cup hold the tub really well . Great purchase .	1
My baby had outgrown our hard plastic tub and was uncomfortable in it . I got this tub as a replacement . After reading another customer 's review I also purchased a sponge for the bottom and have had no problems with him slipping under water . It smelled VERY STRONGLY of plastic so I had to wait a couple of days to use it , I recommend airing it out . But once it 's blown up , it 's ready to go . It 's a little difficult to fill since it 's so puffy , I have trouble getting it under the tub faucet but since I need to test the water temperature anyway , I just cup my hands and let the water run into the tub like that . If you had a tub hose or something it would be easier . My son loves this tub . He lays back and luxuriates in his bath and it 's very cute to see him & # 34 ; relaxing & # 34 ; . ( 8 months old ) . The suction cup on the back is awesome for hanging it up out of the way in the shower when we 're done with it . We keep it blown up and do n't use the drain plug , we just tip it up to drain it because I read another review that the drain plug got warped and started to leak . I 'm avoiding that by just tipping it up to pour the water out . Working perfectly so far ! ! : )	1
As soon as my ( large ! ) baby could sit up with confidence , I switched him to this tub . He loves it ! ! Now he has room to splash his hands against the water , play with his bath toys and explore the duckie-print.The tub is easy to blow up , easy to hang and I 've had no problems with it being slippery.Honestly - with a couple gallons of water and a 23 lb baby inside , how much can this thing move ?	1
My daughter had the munchkin duck tub for awhile until it broke . Well ... she is almost two and I was thinking of getting another one or bath mats . Our tub is very slippery . So I found this one and the age limit was past 2years old so I thought I would try it out . I really think it is a good transition to the tub . It is not real deep and she has lots of room but it still makes her feel safe and secure .	1
This tub is perfect for my 15 mo old girl , and we use it as our everyday tub and also take it when we travel . my only complaint is that the drain sits flush against the bath floor so it does n't really drain unless you put something underneath it to elevate it a little ( I use a foam letter since we already have them in the tub for her to play with ) .	1
Bottom blow up cushion does n't stay inflated and the plug does n't really drain the water effectively however it fits snuggly in my tub and my daughter does n't mind her baths in here . Has transitioned our bath times from sink to big girl tub like I wanted so job well done . I also like the suction cup to hang the tub to bath side for drying purposes . Good product and woukd recommend .	1
We used this tub for my baby from about 7 or 8 months old until about 13 months . It was a great transition from our infant bathtub , giving her more space without using all the water that a full bath would require . It only took moments to inflate by mouth , and I never needed to add more air . I liked being able to use the tub in the middle of the big tub so my baby was never in close proximity to the faucet or water controls . The vinyl is a nice quality , and I ended up using it outdoors as a small wading pool at my mother 's house after the baby outgrew it for bath purposes . Once she started walking it was not long that she learned how to climb out of the sides , but I 'm very happy with the job that this tub did for the months we were able to use it !	1
It 's easily inflated and my baby has a blast sitting in this thing . Some reviews mention a slippery bottom but we have n't had any problems with it . And on the rare occasion when my baby accidentally bumps her bead on the side , well , it 's all soft and bouncy so she never hurt herself .	1
My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - was n't having it ! So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub . This fit the bill . I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it ( just be very careful ) . I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out ! I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes . Just place the plug in the hole and fill ! I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom . He loves it ! My only complaint is that the bottom leaves ... um ... rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in . I always do so I do n't know how it stains but it does !	1
When my daughter outgrew her infant tub , we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath . She is VERY active so she does n't like to sit for very long . We first tried the bath ring , that was a disaster . This snug tub has worked wonderfully . She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips . It 's very safe and fits snugly in our shower . I highly recommend this tub , especially if you have toddler who wo n't sit through baths !	1
was looking for a solution for my infant when he outgrew the baby tub ( he was too long for it and his feet were hanging out ) . This tub is the perfect solution . My baby loves it . I started using it around 4 months when he could lean against it , and now that he can sit and move around more it still is the perfect bath solution . Love that it has a suction on it too to hang up .	1
Great fit , cute , safe for baby but deflated so fast . My husband has to re-pump it every couple days	1
I 'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub . The bottom part under the baby 's butt blows up separately than the sides , which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first . She loves the ability to play in the water in here , I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub , she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls . I think that 's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though : )	1
very nice product	1
Good little tub . Fits just fine in our American Standard regular tub . Little man sometimes pulls the drain plug , so make sure that it is pushed all the way down . The tub is slightly wedge shaped , to help `` lock it in '' to your tub . We have been using it for 5 months with no problems , little man is now 1 year .	1
I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him . This tub is great , I even use it at home . I started using this tub when my son was 6 months , he is now 9 months old . Now that he sits up on his own , it 's a lot easier to bathe him . I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly , all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat . If you travel , it 's a great idea to get an inflatable tub , it 's portable , and quite sturdy .	1
We had the Fisher Price whale tub for my baby , and as she started to get bigger and we removed the middle ledge in the tub she 'd often slide down towards the water . Also , splashing got to be a bit messy on the counter top . I purchased this , and have used it for a few months - it 's perfect ! I 've had to add some air to it once , but other than that I just rinse it out after each use . My 9 month old does not slip around in it at all . She likes to either lean back or sit in the middle and play . I wish we had started using it earlier . It 's so nice not to have to fill up a whole bathtub with water , just for a tiny baby , too.UPDATE - My baby is now 16 months old , and we still LOVE this tub , even though she 's in the 97 % for height and 90 % for weight . Unfortunately , it has developed a slow leak . We got 10 months hard , abusing , biting on the tub use out of it , which is amazing for such a reasonably priced product . I only refilled the air once in 10 months - the rest of the time it stayed full . We have been VERY happy with this !	1
I researched a lot of tubs before buying this one , and I am happy with my decision . I wanted the biggest one available so he would be able to use it for awhile before growing out of it . It has wide sides , is tall and long . It is pretty good with being nonslip . The only downside is I have n't been able to get the suction cup to work to allow it to hang dry so I just set it up in the tub to let it dry .	1
My baby boy loved this toy so much it kept him intrigued and I would recommend it babies mine is now 18 months and this is well worth the investment	1
My little one outgrew her baby tub around 5 months old . I purchased this item and read the previous reviews . Great item ... its cushy for baby and quite large for her and her toys : ) Another great thing is even if the suction cup is wet , it still sticks to the bath tub wall without any problems and does n't deflate easily ( it 's been about 2 months and still have not had to inflate the tub since I 've purchased the item ) .Only CON is that as a previous reviewer had mentioned , the tub is slippery . So I bought the Green Spouts bathmat to put in the tub so my daughter does not slip and slide everywhere .	1
This is a nice enough tub but nothing special enough to warrant five stars . I like the Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub better than this one because it is deeper and the bottom plug is cushioned better the SnugTub 's . The SnugTub is slightly longer , though , and that was a key issue . Why does n't someone invent a larger toddler tub ? We 're trying to postpone having to waste a lot of water filling the entire adult bathtub for our growing toddler 's baths . A vinyl tub that is 9 or 10 inches high and 30 inches long would be perfect and sell well . There must be lots of other parents looking for a similar transitional tub !	1
The DEX Pillow is great . I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along . The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly . I tried the fully body boppy pillow , but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over . This pillow is easy to change sides with . Before pregnancy I slept on my belly . I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper .	1
It is a small pillow , most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation . It 's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it , maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it 'd be okay . I do n't think I 'd call this a `` pregnancy pillow '' - it 's too small . My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back ( and only 4 '' tall ) is n't going to help . However this worked good for just head elevation ( with another pillow on top ) .	1
OMG this was the best thing I ever bought while pregnant , i used it for holding up my stomach while sleeping on my side it was invaluable . It stopped pulling and stretching of my stomach , kept my legs apart when I put it between my knees . If you are a man reading this with a pregnant wife , get it for her . I promise she will love it and you .	1
I bought this pillow on a whim not having much faith since it was only $ 9.99 . It was the best money ever spent ! I have always been a left-side sleeper so I did n't think sleeping while pregnant would be difficult . By my 5th month I my would wake up with my hips aching . Just wedging the pillow under my side would make all the difference in the world .	1
I think we bought this for $ 8 . I was in the market for a snoogie but could n't bring myself to pay $ 60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months . I am 7 months along and I did n't realize that I needed to 'lift ' my belly a bit . Works great . A lot more sturdy than I thought . I 'm glad it 's not memory foam because I need a 'lift ' not to sink in . I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy ! A great little size that does the job .	1
I had two of these . One on each side of me every night I went to sleep , when I was pregnant . I did n't like the HUGE pregnancy pillows that take most of your bed and force your husband to sleep on the couch ! So , these were perfect ! ! Easily adjustable and secure . I am keeping them for my next pregnancy ! : )	1
bought this for the last 4 months of pregnancy and it really helped comfort levels during nap and night sleeps . does tend to squish into a set position but i liked that . Really nice for the price .	1
I got this pillow and when it arrived I was disappointed . I purchased it intending to use it to prop my torso up at night during my 2 trimester . It was much smaller than I realized and tossed it aside . A few weeks later I started using it between my knees while I slept on my side . I also used it under my growing belly so It would n't hang . I found myself using it behind my back during TV time and also in the car . I used it all the time . Right now , I am letting a friend borrow it for her back at work since she is in her third trimester . I would recommend this pillow to anyone so has back issues or is pregnant . The case comes off so you can clean it too .	1
My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep . This is a very small wedge , but I do n't think you 'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly . She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed . When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor , this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring . She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout . Sometimes it is under her belly . Sometimes it is wedged into her back . Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it . We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more , so I think I got my money 's worth out of this . I 'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA : Found another use for the pillow . It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars ! Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard , but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that .	1
This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow . It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava ( now 7 months along . ) It does not solve all of my comfort issues , but it gives me peace of mind that I 'm not laying flat while I sleep ( which I find myself doing without it . ) It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head . And when I 'm done using it for that , it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow . I have already gotten my $ 10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come .	1
I 'm 28 weeks pregnant , and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help . However , this did n't really help me sleep better at all , if anything it made it worse . It was very uncomfortable . Maybe I 'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger . ***UPDATE*** Now that I am 33 weeks , I use this support pillow every night . Once my tummy got bigger , the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much . Now I ca n't sleep without it !	1
A decent pillow , wife is expecting and is in her 6th month , and this was perfect gift to her for a good night sleep .	1
This headrest is perfect . Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this . When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward . Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she 's still happy . At 4 months she has wonderful head control , but I would n't put her in her carseat without this . I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible . It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car . For a small baby I would n't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat .	1
I love this product . It holds my son 's head up straight and let 's him sleep without his head flopping everywhere . I have the Chambray color but it 's still the same product . I suggest having 2 on hand . 1 in the carseat and 1 in a swing or bouncer . Also , if baby spits up on 1 , then you have another to use while you are washing the first one .	1
This is great . We started our boy on strawberries with this , as well as bananas ( frozen ) and frozen little cubes of baby food for him when he was teething . This is a brilliant idea . No worries about him choking as he began to navigate food .	1
This is great ! I was able to give my child many different types of foods and not worry about him choking . He loved that he could hold it himself and eat . I would not live without this tool . This is my standard baby shower gift now and have recieved many thanks for it . Wonderful . I ca n't say enough good things about it .	1
My baby loved this , even though he wo n't use a single of the many teethers we 've tried . This is the only thing that soothes his teething pain that he 'll take . We use with frozen apples , even ice cube pieces . Worth the price , as it WORKS	1
What a great way to introduce baby to fresh fruit & amp ; veggies . No choking ! I admit the older style bags were hard to clean ( Oxy clean and an overnight soak in hot water in a cup before a top-rack dishwasher run did get it clean , but was messy and took extra time ) .Now , new easy-clean/disposable bags are here ! Look for them out there -- our BRU had them recently . Pitch them if they 're really bad , but just unscrew bag from ring , scrub or soak both and voila , put back together and re-use . Then throw them away as the bags age , tear or stain.Alex has used ours since 4 months of age and our original bags plus newer replacements are still going strong at 10 months , with repeated dishwasher-ing .	1
I purchased this product a few months ago despite all the bad reviews and so far I have not had a problem with it . My son loves it . I 've had this sitting in the sink ( dirty ) for days sometimes and I have never once had a problem cleaning it . The best way I figured out on cleaning this product is to just clean it with hot water and dish detergent and clean out the inside really good with the same type of brush that you use to clean out the bottles . Even the bananas come out and who cares if its a little stained as long as you know that its clean . I was in the store the other day and saw a similar version of this item made by Munchkin at less than half the price of this one . I wish I found it before because this baby safe feeder is a little outrageous in price for this kind of item . I would still definately recommend this product though .	1
I received this as a shower gift from my sister-in-law . When I received it , I had NO idea what is was or what it was for . Needless to say , my perception of this has significantly changed ( for the BETTER ! ) I use this for my 7 1/2 month old son with canned pears , pieces of apple and canned peaches ... Just cut up the canned fruits/veggies to fit in the bag , and let your little one have at it ! Better yet , when they 're teething , freeze cubes of juice , and put the cube ( s ) in the bag -- they 'll thank you for it ! They 'll throughly enjoy feeding themselves ( albeit making a mess too ) ... but more importantly , they are LEARNING to feed themselves as well as about the textures and consistencies of food other than the pureed versions they 're so used to . It 's durable and EASY to clean , and replacment `` bags '' are found pretty much any child store .	1
This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet . The first time I saw it I thought , `` What will they think of next ... '' but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home . It 's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes , pineapple , watermelon , even strawberries ! It 's great for regular feeding too , since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat , fresh brocolli , etc . The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly , I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water , but after just two weeks of steady use , the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently . The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself , but it 's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder . I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it 's a great thing to have on trips .	1
I did n't find it too dificult to clean as others commented . It 's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away ( sometimes very far away ) and then all the food is gone . It 's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did . When they get a bit older and holding things for longer , it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit , for example .	1
We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old . He loved the flavor of melon , but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke . The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag . We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething . We used it mostly for fruit , especially melon , grapes , pears , and strawberries . I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder , but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits . Enjoy ! ! ! !	1
When my 5-month-old started teething , my father-in-law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip-loc bag so she 'd have something to chomp on ( she was n't a fan of chilled teethers ) . We started using cold fruit to soothe her gums , but even without teeth she managed to break of chunks and I 'd have to pry open her mouth to fish out the pieces . This simple little plastic and mesh device has worked very well for us . At first we used to fill it with crushed ice , but then started putting fruits or veggies in ( as mentioned on the packaging ) and it works great for that as well . We even take it with us to restaurants so she can chew on pieces of fruit . I like that she can hold onto it herself and I do n't have to worry about her choking ( there 's no way she could fit anything but the tip of the mesh in her mouth ) . I have had such good luck with this product that I 'm already stocking up on them to give to girlfriends as shower gifts .	1
This was absolutely fabulous for my family . We used it with frozen fruit for teething , and just about any snacks my baby wanted to eat . I never had to worry about her choking and it was so easy to clean.I truely reccomend this product for worry free feeding !	1
Would n't it be nice if the fears of solid feeding could be alleviated ? How much would you pay to have some safeguard against your little one choking as they learn to eat new foods ? Would n't it be nice if there were something better than those refrigeratable rings to sooth sore , teething gums ? Now there is ! After having a small choking incident , which I was able to react quickly to , I bought this to relieve some of my fears . I had heard good things about this product but this is something you HAVE to experience for yourself.I found it so nice to be able to offer my daughter bananas , grapes , potatoes , and so much more without having to worry about her taking in to big of a piece and choking . With the baby safe feeder , your child knaws or sucks on the mesh and the food is dispensed in small quantities that are safe to be swalled by little mouths.I loved this item even more when teething time came around . I could drop one or two ice cubes in the bag and my daughter would be on cloud nine . She never cared for those teething rings or other teething toys , this was it for us . She would hold onto the handle and suck cube uppon cube of ice until her pains were relieved.I think every parent should own one of these , it is inexpensive and well worth the money .	1
I bought this to help with teething and help my baby explore new food without choking . Overall , it 's pretty good . I think you can buy this one and not the `` Starter Kit . '' All you really need is one set . I have tried it with ice , which she loves , and peas and a frozen peach . It is a huge mess , which I can deal with . The main issue I have with it is that the mesh is pretty thick so it 's hard for her to actually get any food out of it . It is easy to clean and she likes it overall . I would n't say this is one of my indispensable baby items though .	1
I was afraid that my baby would throw/drop this and break the ring , but then I discovered that I could link the handle to the attachment on the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Highchair . It works great !	1
I love this idea and so does my son . He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product . He gnawed that thing to death . We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out . It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about . Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking .	1
I think this is a great idea . I only used it a couple times for foods . At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing . I LOVE this product for when she is teething . I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it does n't stick to her lips . She gets upset when the ice is gone . My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months ... Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would .	1
If I had to freeze breastmilk , this was great because I did n't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer ( we could use them to feed the baby instead ) . They were easy to dispose of if they outdated ( there is a place to label them with the date ) . I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn . None ever leaked for me . They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers , too . Very convenient .	1
We were using bottles to store milk when my mother bought these . I was SOOO skeptical at first , but I tried them . LOVE EM ! ! ! I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars b/c they are a little bit akward to put on the pumps , but I love them ! ! ! they save space and they are less expensive than buying 50 bottles to store your milk in .	1
There seem to be many negative reviews for these bags , but I have no serious complaints about them . I have stored milk nearly 50 times using the Medela bags and have been completely satisfied . They are sturdy and hold up well when being reheated . However , I do dislike the fact that the way they are closed is to insert a little trash bag tie into the two pre-cut holes and then fold over and over and twist together until tight . I store my milk in tupperware and then enclose in large freezer ziplocks and have not had any problem with the milk being corrupted . The way they close is annoying because it does n't freeze flat at all and I can only store 3 bags of milk per container- thus taking up tons of space in the freezer . When I heat these up in a pot or under hot water I never have to double bag or worry about leaks and that is what matters most to me . I recommend these bags and will continue to use for the remainder of my time breast feeding .	1
I love this gadget . I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband 's and my mother 's car . Unlike my car , there center seat has a harness strap . Those are hard to get really tight . My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base . With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough . With the mighty tight , it was a snap . You just hooked it in , cranked it , and voula ! ! ! That seat is n't going anywhere . I love it . It is easy to use , it makes the seat secure , and it is sturdy . You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness .	1
I have a Britax Chaperone infant carseat and the base has an excellent lock off feature built in . However I could not get it so tight that it would move less than an inch . After easily installing the Mighty Tite , it 's like the base is a part of the car . It does n't move at all . I am not a particularly strong or large person and it was a breeze to install . I highly recommend this product .	1
This is a great item you can not do without ! When I was pregnant a friend of ours who is a fireman , told us we must get this . He used it for his two kids & said he would n't do without it . We had no problems installing it in our Isuzu Rodeo or Honda Civic . I would n't install a baby seat without this .	1
The mighty-tite is a simple ratchet device , like you see on a come-along or truck tie down . Very simple to operate , but it takes some getting used to with certain seatbelts . On the old center seatbelts ( no shoulder harness ) they are a breeze . I put both the main belt and the & quot ; extra & quot ; strap that you pull to tighten into the ratchet , and crank that puppy right down . Solid as a house , and putting the & quot ; extra tail & quot ; into it keeps it from loosening.Plus side : man , is this thing tough . And simple to operate.Minus side : some car seats do n't have enough room under the base for this thing . Also , the new shoulder harnesses really torque the seat sideways , and this thing only makes it worse . I do n't like using it with a shoulder harness belt unless it 's dead center of the car , because the extra torque tends to make the seat crooked . Finally , getting it to release is kind of a pain . You have to crank the ratchet a partial turn , hold down the yellow lever , and pop a button while holding it down . Does n't always work on the first try . Now , a ratchet is not supposed to open easily , so it 's no big deal , but it takes some work and getting used to . Perhaps they need some more development on the release .	1
I believe we can fairly judge the usefulness of this accessory in terms of `` before '' and `` after '' . We 're on our second car seat now , and I 've helped install others for friends , and every car seat has its own installation quirks . At some point , with all of them , if you 're using seat belts to hold down the car seat , you 're going to have to tighten the belt significantly . When I install our car seat ( before the Mighty Tite ) , that means getting up on it and bearing down a lot of weight while tugging on it ; when my wife does it , it means not being able to get a really tight fit at all . `` After '' we got the Mighty Tite , and went through the use of it , I 'd say our car seat installation time was reduced by 200 % , and the installation job was much more secure . During a recent spate of traveling , we had to install and re-install the seat a dozen times in a two-week period , and this was utterly essential for getting on and off of the airplane quickly while still having a securely-installed seat , and even more importantly , getting the seat re-installed securely when we were putting it into a `` strange '' car.We particularly appreciated the plastic instructions attached to the Mighty Tite with a metal ring -- it meant when we got confused about how to use it with a different belt arrangement , we had the visual reference right at hand and not all dog-eared or ripped up ( like our car seat installation manual ! ) Obviously , if you 're only going to install the car seat once in one car there may be diminishing returns on a device like this . But if you have to move it even occasionally , I think this accessory is worth the price for a little extra security and peace of mind , plus a few extra minutes saved.The one caveat I provide is that the plastic retainers that hold the strap in have begun to look a little stressed ( the way well-used plastic looks before it breaks ) , so this might not wear well over a multi-year period . This is not a safety issue , since this part is used only to guide the safety belt , and if it does break , it will still be usable . Still , one would hope it will not ! Since we 've already put it to heavy use , though , I 'm well satisfied at the purchase and value .	1
I am a big guy , and even when I pushed down on the base of our Graco seat , I could not get the seat installed tight enough . A couple of clicks on the Mighty-Tite was all I needed to fix that ! This device is excellent , and I ca n't possibly imagine anyone breaking it like some reported here , the device weighs a lot ( a good thing ) and feels extremely sturdy .	1
I bought this product because I was so afraid of the seat belt not being tight enough for the infant seat base . I have used this product since my son was just a few months old . I loved it . I never worried about the seat belt again . I was in a car accident with my child when he was almost 3 years old . I was still using this product with his forward facing car seat . My car was totalled ( I drove a Saturn ) ... the only part of the car without damage was the roof & the drivers side ... my son 's car seat was on the rear passenger side , so he recieved more of the impact than I did being the driver . I honestly believe that this product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved . He came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head . Even though the Mighty-Tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself wo n't slide around , his car seat still fell over & that is what shielded his body & face from the glass . I do n't know how it worked out that way , but if his car seat had n't fallen to its side , I think that he may have been hurt more . The Mighty-Tite still worked fine after the wreck , & the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say . My son is now in a booster seat & we do n't use the Mighty-Tite anymore , but I am pregnant with my 2nd child , I am definately going to use this product again with this baby .	1
We own these sheets and they are great specially for my nephew..they seem `` thin '' but actually they are not to thin ... i washed them many times from baby puke ... these sheets has saved our travel yard from the evil smell of vomit ! and i put a light weight blanket under him ( on top of the sheet . ) when he was a newborn/1month old ... these sheets kept our play yard very clean ! ! and we love them and will buy more when baby # 2 comes ! we also have the yellow one and this green one..they both get used daily and washed daily ( if puke happens ) and we love the easy on and easy off !	1
If you are purchasing or have a pack-n-play , these extra sheets are a necessity . Baby will spit up , drop the bottle , lose the sippy cup in the playard , and extras are much more convenient than attempting to immediately wipe down the sheet.These sheets fit well , wash well , and are n't overly padded so as to be unsafe . All in all , a reasonably priced , high quality necessity .	1
I bought this item ( in a different color ) two years ago for my son.It is NOT waterproof- but what SHEET is ? ! I recommend purchasing a 27 '' size BRU Especially for Baby Brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet ( Just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress ! ) . The sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress.This sheet is durable and launders easily.I was so pleased with this product , I would purchase it again ! In fact , I did ! I am expecting TWINS , so I purchased another sheet in this color and also TWO of the smaller size for my two Graco Travel Lite Cribs/PNP's.Good job , Graco for coming up with yet another GREAT product !	1
I could n't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet . The spittle and drool just wipes off , right ? Not as easily as you might hope , and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier . They fit perfectly , match fine , and keep muck off the mat . Way to go , Graco - you 've done it again !	1
I really like this sheet . It matches the colors of my pack 'n ' play really well . I have a kolcraft and it fits perfect . It has been spit up on about a million times and has been washed about a million more . It has n't faded at all and is very durable . I would definitely recommend this sheet !	1
I bought this sheet for a Graco brand pack and play ... the sheet is fitted , just not in the traditional sense ( there 's no elastic ) just kind of pockets sewn in the corners . It stays on OK though . Just one thing threw me , I thought the color `` tea '' would be tan or some variation of a light brown , but it is definitely green .	1
I also almost did n't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site , but I could n't find another brand either , so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side ( they are the thinnest sheets we own for him ) , but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one , they are the only sheets he 's ever slept on . They are okay sheets that are holding up very well , even through numerous washings . Oh , and they are n't elasticized , but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet , I have no worries that they will come up ( we have n't used the play yard feature yet ) .By the way , we 've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer ; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier .	1
I bought this sheet for my Baby Trend playyard . The sheet fits well and I 've had no problems with washing it . I do , however , put a bassinett pad ( one of the big lap pads ) under the sheet to help with keeping the & quot ; mattress & quot ; dry . It 's not the softest sheet ever made , but that 's not what I was expecting . After all , my son plays on it .	1
We have the Graco Clarion Pack N Play and this sheet fits perfectly . Ca n't understand why there are so many negative reviews about the fit and wear of this sheet . It fits our model perfectly and has withstood many washings well . It is thin , but we have n't found that to be a problem .	1
I love these . They are very easey to put on and take off . They wash in the washing machine , and dry in the dryer . They are small and do n't take up much space to store when waiting to be used.I have four of these in three different colors . It 's a bit much though . It 's only necessary to have two . Ones in the wash , and ones on the pack and play . They also fit well over the quilted pack and play sheet .	1
O.k. , yes it is thin , it is not the softest out there , but it does the job . To add comfort I have a waterproof pad under it which I think is a must in playards anyways because it is not easy to clean the matress pad they come with.I have had no problems with bleeding , and I wash it very often and it has held up fine .	1
We have the Travelin Tot Safari Playard and even though this sheet is made for Graco Pack n Plays , it 's perfect for my son 's playard also . I could n't imagine putting him in the bassinet part without a sheet ... I 'm glad Graco came up with such a great product . It 's best to have a few on hand for spit up 's or leaky diaper 's ...	1
They absorb well . However , you will have to wear a padded bra in order for the seams on these pads not to show and/or look pointy .	1
I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these . At first when I was sore and using nipple cream , I used the disposables . The yellow cream stains , so I did n't want to mess up my good pads . After I no longer needed cream , I moved on to the washable ones . I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables . I forget that I even have them on . I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables , but I do n't really care . I do n't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables ( to me the J & J and Avent disposables are the most discreet ) . I do n't leak much anymore , so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage . I have four pair . I generally do laundry once a week , with one load at some point mid-week . I 'm able to always have some on hand .	1
Ultimately , nothing works better than the disposables , but these are the best reuseables I 've purchased . I do still leak through them from time to time so I only use them in the house . They are also great for comfort .	1
I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they 've worked great . They 're easy to wash and dry , I just throw them in with my regular clothes . I did n't give it 5 stars because you ca n't wear these with thin clothes or they show . I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way , but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show . I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use . I bought two packs and might get another one so that I do n't have to wash them during the week . Why buy disposables ? Seems pretty wasteful to me .	1
They are very soft and much more comfortable than disposables . I just throw them in washer and dryer and they still keep the original shape . I do n't leak that much , so it 's not a problem at all .	1
I loved this so much , I bought two . I had my baby by c-section so nursing was tricky at first . I used the stool in the hospital and loved it , so bought one for home , and then two . Perfect height to get those knees up so you 're not hunched while nursing . When baby weaned , I kept this for use under my desk in the office . My back problems are almost non-existent now .	1
Within a couple of weeks of breastfeeding , my back was shot . This stool provided so much relief . It also helps my husband , who has a bad back and chronic pain , sit more comfortably .	1
I so regret not buying this sooner . My back and feet felt SO much better after using this stool . Highly recommend .	1
I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this , like many mothers , slouching and what not was killing my already injured back , a friend of mine had one and i tried it ... loved it ! Ordered one for myself and cant do without . Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state ! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come ! Thanks Medela for once again , making an outstanding product ... also ... If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age -- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever ... ... I recommend the medela nipple shield , I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine , its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore ! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced ... get this one , its worth every penny !	1
Yes , it seems a bit ridiculous to buy a nursing stool , but I got one after I used it in a nursing supply store and it totally changed how comfortable I was ! Love it !	1
This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn . Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful . The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I did n't end my sessions with a backache . However , I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs ( same benefits ) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well . An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together ( 5-10 minutes tops ) and comes with it 's own allen wrench tool .	1
The Medela Nursing stool has been a lifesaver . It comes in handy when trying to prop baby at the right angle . Which also means this is not just a handy item for nursing , but also for bottlefeeding too ! I wish I had invested in this item with my first child , would have saved me from some aches and pains . I was lucky to get this item on clearance at another baby retail store for $ 9.90 . Great bargain and money is well spent on a terrific and useful stool .	1
This stool is great ! It is the perfect height for me to nurse my baby comfortably . I use it with a boppy pillow . The only problem is I get so spoiled at home , its hard to feed my son while we 're out ! My husband put it together easily in a few minutes . Slightly slante but I guess we can still use it later as a step stool . I also use it while pumping for comfort .	1
This seems like a silly purchase and pricey for a simple stool . But it was so necessary for trying to get a good latch with a newborn . I wish I would have had this at the beginning but only discovered it in a nursing room at a baby store . If you 're planning to breastfeeding or having trouble with latching , this is a must .	1
Ca n't say enough good things about this stool . I used one at my lactation consultant 's office and found it really helpful . It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable . It 's well made and easy to assemble . I am not too tall - 5'3 '' with legs on the shorter side . Maybe if you have longer legs you do n't need a stool , but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed . In my experience , anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it !	1
Icould n't have nrsed without it . Even my mother-in-law stated , `` wow , this really works '' as she was rocking her granddaughter to sleep . a bit of a pain when you are vacuuming , one more thing to move , but , otherwise , a great idea .	1
This is a wonderful , wonderful product . It is sturdy and easy to assemble . I use it in tandem with my Boppy and love the results . My two month old and I have had our trials and tribulations with breastfeeding , but this stool has eliminated all of our discomfort . No more back pain and fewer bad latches due to awkward positioning . If you are a breastfeeding mom , you need this stool !	1
I did n't have it when I started , but I really appreciated it once I got it . A definate improvement . The only part that I do n't like , and this is an individual thing , is the ridges ( tread ) . I am usually bare foot and they irritate my apparently sensative feet . I 've put a dish towel over it to make it more comfortable for me .	1
I did n't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse , but I was wrong ! I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking ! The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box . The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor ( just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color ) . I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well .	1
Learned of this wonderful invention from a prenatal class . I recommend it to all my pregnant friends as it makes nursing for long periods of time comfortable and you can use any chair in the house , you do n't have to necessarily sit in a fancy glider once you have this versatile stool .	1
I was nursing without this stool for almost 2 months . I started developing lower back pain . I thought it was from picking up and carrying around my son until someone purchased this stool for me . In just 1 week , my lower back pain began to go away . I would definately recommend getting this stool if you plan to nurse .	1
I wish I 'd had this when I was pregnant . But I have it now and it has come in very handy . I do n't use it all the time but it 's very comfortable when I do . I use it a lot more with our glider when I 'm pumping or just rocking the baby . I would n't buy it until you see if you need it .	1
this was a back saver for me while nursing . It was hard to nurse without support and something sturdy to put my feet on . This is well worth the money .	1
Once you have this stool , you will use it long after you stop nursing . It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading , watching TV , doing needlework , and much more . I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky . I was using a regular child 's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I 'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet . It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch .	1
The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms . I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short , so I needed something for my feet to rest on . I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby .	1
This stool is a miracle worker for tired legs and backs . I love to use it when nursing my son upstairs . The slanted top means your feet are positioned perfectly for holding a baby . It 's very sturdy and does n't slide around on the floor like my daughter 's plastic stools do.I did not get this until baby # 2 , and I wish I had had it with the first one ! Believe me , there is no comparison between rocking/nursing/holding a baby with this stool , or just resting your feet on the floor.Definitely in my `` top ten '' list of must-haves for breastfeeding .	1
I really like this stool . It 's sturdy and well-build . Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me . I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly , my toddler thinks this is his `` chair '' and uses it when we read books before bed time .	1
I decided against a glider/rocker for nursing and went with a stationary chair . I went about a week of nursing with my feet flat on the ground when I realized my back being achey from the position . This stool was recommended to me at the hospital 's breastfeeding class and I used it at the hospital while nursing but thought it was just an extra thing to have . Boy was I wrong . The nursing stool angles your lap up drawing baby closer to you , which allows you to have your back straighter instead of hunching towards the baby . If you find yourself stuffing an extra pillow/blanket under your nursing pillow to fill in the gap between the pillow and your lap this stool will solve that problem , and wo n't fall out of your lap onto the floor ! The stool was easy to assemble and nice solid wood . I have been using mine for two months with no problems . The hospital had this exact nursing stool too and you could tell it was really worn in and old , but still held up perfectly . The nice thing is when you are done nursing the stool is still practical to use as a foot rest for chairs around the house- including a nice under the desk foot rest while you are on the computer .	1
We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought ( years ago ) were discolored . These are clear , and look and fit great on our crib . You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though . I know some people did not , and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error . Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had , but not these . So far , our nice crib is saved , hopefully for baby # 2 .	1
These are great if you have an infant who learned to stand up in their crib and decided it was time to sharpen their new teeth on the rails ( which I think almost every infant is ! ) . in other words these are a must . I have only 1 problem with these ( hnce 4 stars ) . no mater how you try to group them , they do not cover the entire rail on any side of my baby 's crib ( standard size ) . At least 2 inches on each side are still left bare for her to chew on . The company should change their length in order to be able to provide complete coverage at elast for standard crib sizes .	1
Skip alllllllll the other gummy crib rail protectors and just get these . They go on with zero headache and stay on . Note , you will need 2 sets to cover both sets of rails . But these end up being cheaper and far more effective than the others , which , peel , curl and can even be bitten apart . Yes my little fellow managed that , even though it should n't have been possible . Thoroughly pleased and recommending to all my friends with teething babies .	1
I almost did n't get these after reading the reviews , but they sounded like exactly what I wanted so after making sure the measurements were right I decided to give them a shot . They are perfect . They fit our crib perfectly , our girls do n't even really notice they are there and they stay on great . Very pleased with these .	1
I do n't agree with the dimensions listed on Amazon 's description . It does come with 4 pieces that are about 12 inches long ... which will cover one side of your crib . However , I do n't know what the 1.5 x 5 part is . I measured the ones I have and the inside of the plastic measures about 3/4 of an inch ... and the outside of it is around an inch . The plastic is fairly flexible . I have the Aspen 4-in-1 crib and it fits my rails just fine . My 11 month olds have not pulled them off ... .yet ; ) There is another listing for this same product , http : //www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Crib-Rail-Teether/dp/B001JBALRQ/ref=pd_sbs_ba_5 , you might be able to get an idea of the size/shape of the crib rail it expects.I covered just one side of their crib at first , but this seems to work and I just went out ( to a local store ) and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib.I recommend this product , however , you need to measure or consider your crib rails - they need to be on the skinny side.Update : After several months of use , I noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails . It is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail . I hardly noticed until I looked at it harder . I still like what the product does , however , I 'm disappointed that it has ruined the wood . My cribs are cheap anyway , but still , I take good care of my stuff . I do n't know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that ( I did n't ) . I thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about .	1
I realized that there was a DC-10 power cord ( bulky ) on my power strip and wondered if this would be able to fit it . This did n't register until after I had bought the cover . When it arrived I was pleased to find that it was big enough . My boy is only 10 months and has yet to get his little hands on it . I 'm confident he will be unable to open this if he finds a cord and follows it back to the power .	1
If you have all 2-prong plugs then this will work perfectly . If you have 3-prong plugs or plugs with adapters , be prepared to rearrange your electronics because they wo n't all fit in this product . I have n't found anything better though .	1
Works as intended at a good price . One drawback is that it is really hard to open even for adults . I wanted to use it on an extention cords with items I often plug in and out . With this device it is only practical to have cords that are infrequently changed .	1
Other users have lamented over the size of this product , but it really needs to be large in order to fit the power strip and all the plugs . It gives me peace of mind .	1
This does what it is supposed to do - keeps my daughters fingers out of the extra outlets in the power strip . That 's a win in my book .	1
This power cord protector seems to be working fine so far . My baby is n't one to pry her little fingers into the hole on top so that has n't been an issue for us . It comes with outlet plugs , which were handy for the empty ones . I do n't find the pieces that hook it together difficult to line up . Many people had commented they were difficult so I actually opened and closed it multiple times to test it out . No problem . It takes some minor concentration to line the pieces up . And it is actually white , not the yellow it appears to be in the photo .	1
This securely protects the surge strip plugs from little hands . My baby loves to go toward the cords and when she 's grabbed toward them , this holds up . We keep her from them on a regular basis , but on the off chance she 's near them , this does the trick .	1
This does the job quite nicely , particularly for the price . If a little one were really persistent , he/she could probably dig fingers through the opening , so I plug up the openings I do n't have anything plugged into with the caps they include . It is n't easy to unlatch , if you latch it well . My only complaint is that I have to unlatch it to plug something new in , but I ca n't fault the product-that is just how baby proofing goes sometimes .	1
Everyone with a power cord and a child should have this . Its simple and amazing ! Worth every penny and more !	1
Holds a power strip and plugs okay , but my toddler can still get her fingers down in the cracks where the cords come out and the crack between the front piece of plastic and the longer back piece . Mine is also a white color , not the cream like it appears in the picture .	1
I had to put one of these on my computer power strip as my son wanted to push the button with the light on it , this is great and I am very happy with my purchase , you can not go wrong with buying this .	1
Daughter saw it once , wanted to play with it . She gave up shortly thereafter when she could n't get in . Highly recommended .	1
it does n't work for HUGE plugs ( like our roku ) , but will work with every other TV/Stereo/cable/etc component we have ! our daughter figured out the on/off button on our power strip , so i ordered this the very next day and it 's wonderful ! ! she tried to turn everything on/off again and found out she could n't and now she stays away from that area ! a total life saver and pretty sound product ! !	1
This is a must have for parents ! What baby does n't head straight for the power strip ? It is easy to use , plesant on the eyes ( it is white , not off white like the photo ) and IMPOSSIBLE for babies to open !	1
This does what it needs to do . It 's a bit ugly , but keeps our daughter from playing with the plugs . We ordered another one already .	1
We have a very active 8 month old girl , so we decided to buy 3 of these to cover the connectors , Was very easy to put it on . Covers perfectly and makes the power strip safe . Would highly recommend this product	1
Not very easy to open and close , which is great for baby proofing but not good if it 's something you want to unplug frequently . Otherwise it works well and holds a large power strip .	1
This is a giant pain to apply and so hard to open -- which makes it a great baby proofing product , but not very user friendly . Make sure whatever you have plugged into the strip is going to stay there for a long time and is n't something that needs to be unplugged often . The bottom portion opens easier than the top , also .	1
Easily contains our power strip and multitude of plugs behind the TV . Not the most attractive solution , but it works .	1
I really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging/plugging the electronics . It is very hard however for me to open it , but I guess that 's the point .	1
this is the best/cheapest for keeping little hands away from extension cords and looks better in person - it 's white not beige	1
These have worked very well for us . We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house , and this fits over all of them . It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well . I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small . I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips ; it probably would n't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets . I found it relatively easy to open and close . I do n't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself , and she wo n't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself . I now own at least five of these .	1
This is a great protector for over the power strips ! I had difficulty opening the part where the outlets go but that 's a good thing cause I would n't want my little guy to be able to get to them easily ! Included with the package are several plug covers to put in unused outlets on the power strip . I forgot about one of our power strips and I 'm not hesitating to buy another one of these !	1
I bought this white cover ( model 40896 , UPC 3676840896 , code on label X0000DM4BB ) andSafety 1st Power Strip Coverto compare the two . Unlike that item , this cover is not expandable . Its dimensions are fixed at 14 '' length , 2-3/4 '' wide , and 3-1/4 '' high ( except for the 4 '' at the power strip cord end which is only 1-3/4 '' high ) . The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 1/2 '' wide and 7-5/8 '' long . When closed , the hole for the power strip cord is 1-1/8 '' by 1-1/2 '' . There are no holes for wall mounting , but four outlet covers , two plastic cable ties , and ten cord identifier stickers are provided.To open the 4 '' cover at the power strip cord end , you pull up on a single tab ; this seems rather easy for a child to disengage , which means that he/she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end . To open the main cover , you pry open three tabs , then open the unit like a clamshell.The plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the Safety 1st model . I like the fact that you can simply open the 4 '' cover to flick the power strip switch on and off . It is narrower and shorter than the Safety 1st model by about 3/4 '' in either direction , which may prevent using wider strips or transformers more than about 1-1/2 '' high with it.Buy this from Amazon.com ! ( BTW , about the Amazon photo , the interior is actually white , I do n't know what produced that egg-yolk-yellow color inside . )	1
This seemed effective at stopping our 8-9 month old playing with the power strip , and certainly he can not get his fingers into the live sockets with this cover . It does organize the wires better , so although he could still play with them , he 's less interested , and I have time to pick him up and put him somewhere else without there being a hazard . However , he could get his fingers into the gap if he wanted to , but I do n't think that 's a problem currently , maybe when he 's older there could be potential for getting fat fingers stuck . Also , maybe he 'll be able to open it in the future , but the latches seem stiff at least for the initial few months , making it hard even for me to open ! It allows many different shape plugs , but sometimes companies make strange shapes so those do n't fit , which is annoying , and there is probably no product on the market to allow for those odd shapes . At the moment I 'm happy with this product and after a month trial , I bought another two for elsewhere in the house .	1
I think this is a great outlet strip cover . I almost wish I had this before I had kids because it conceals it so nicely and makes the strip look much more tidy . It 's somewhat hard to snap and unsnap together . But that 's the point , right ? I would recommend this to anyone looking to either conceal their outlet strips or babyproof their home .	1
These are great . I 'd had issues with my daughter crawling around and unplugging , or turning off power strips if she got to them . This makes them very secure . She can not force them open , and can not get to anything . Definitely recommended !	1
This item works great for us ! Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it .	1
We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv . It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are . But there also lies the problem with this . The clips on the side are not easy to reattach . So as long as you do n't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great ... . but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot , then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly !	1
It 's not flimsy to me at all . Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it , but it 's perfect . I also think it 's very pretty - it brightened up the room . I just love it . Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby . Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room . I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it 's sufficient . I like how it 's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily . Great table for a great price !	1
I purchased this changing table in the summer of 2002 ( my baby was due in Sept ) I put it together very easily by myself . When I read the directions I was disappointed when it said to only use this table for babies up to 20lbs ( I was having a 10lb baby ) so I did n't think I would get much use . I could n't afford a more expensive one so I kept it . My son is now 2 1/2 yrs . old and weighs 35lbs and we are still using it ! ! ! ! Yes , the middle shelf has a little sag in it ( very little ) but other than that it 's perfect ! ! ! I am so suprised by how sturdy this is ! ! ! After reading some other reviews , I ca n't believe how many other people do n't like it . I 'm using it till it ca n't support my son anymore and gives out but no problems yet . I store toys and diapers on the other shelves . I would highly recommended this table and it 's so affordable too : - )	1
I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down . Even being used this changing table is great . There are no problems . It 's very sturdy and durable for the price . I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all . The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy . The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one . But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price .	1
We bought this for about 70 bucks and got 4 sage lined wicker baskets to fit within it for organization . Great table , that does the trick . Fits almost everything we need for clothes , and we have a diaper depot hanging off the side to fit all the changing table items . : )	1
I was going to get the `` spindle '' changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one , at about 1/3rd of the price . This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover . i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time . this changing table looks good in her room , i also bought the Jenny Lind crib . i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves . The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard , but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i 've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice .	1
For my fourth baby I bought all new nursery furniture . Since she is my last I didnt want to spend a ton but I did want good stuff . I love this table . It has tons of storage , was easy to put together and is solid . I have also loved the matching crib and dresser !	1
I do n't know what everyone else is doing with it , but I 've had no problems with it falling apart . It was not difficult to assemble but you did need two sets of hands . I store all our diaper-changing items on the top shelf in baskets , and then diaper bags go on the bottom shelf . The only complaint I would have is that the changing pad is yellowing in strange spots ( nothing to do with where it is used most ) .	1
We purchased this table to go with the White Jenny Lind crib we bought . Table was very easy to put together and is extremly sturdy . Having two children I could n't possibly see the point in spending $ 150 or more for a changing table that you can really only use for the first year depending on the size of your child . We 've been using ours now for 4 months and I have no complaints .	1
I was hesitant to register for these covers because of some of the negative reviews I read ... However , my son is now 3 months old and we love the covers that we use ! Some common complaints I have read mention shrinking , poor fabric quality , and staining easily ; our experience has been quite different : -Shrinking is minimal ( I generally wash in hot water because I 'm getting poopy out , too ) -Any shrinking that does occur does not prevent the cover from fitting , only makes it more snug ( which I like ) -Stains come out very easily with Dreft stain remover or Shout ( neither alters the cover coloring either ) -Of my four covers , two have loose threads from excessive washing ( still in great shape-I consider the fabric quality excellent , especially considering the amount of washings these go through in the first few weeks ! ) -One thing to consider : Colors online are very different than in person ... I found that the pictures online show darker , richer colors . I have 2 blue covers and one each of the yellow and white . The blue and yellow are much , much lighter in person ( they appear to be very pastel ) ; I find them more appealing ! Like I mentioned , I have four of these covers . They are fantastic and I recommend them to everyone . Buy more than one though , because they definitely get dirty quickly -- I think I changed mine every day for the first 2-3 weeks that my son was home !	1
We recently bought this pad for our changing table in the blue color . It 's very soft and fits well with our pad , which was made by another company . Another viewer was right about the lack of slits to pull the straps through to hold the baby . However , our son is n't extremely squirmy so we do n't use the straps anyways . He hates it more if we use them and he 's more still if we do n't . Overall , we like this cover , especially for it 's cost .	1
Do exact what they are intended to do . They 've never ripped for us and they get warm quicker ( breastmilk ) than typical plastic bottles . It is easier cleanup using the drop-ins and thus worth the slight extra cost for us .	1
Very convenient . Baby ( 4 months ) is not gassy at all . But to be honest I did n't try any other type of a bottle since this one works so well .	1
I love these bottles and liners ! They get rid of half my washing since I do n't have to wash bottles . They 're a lifesaver	1
I 've been using the playtex drop in system since my daughter came home from the hospital and I love it . I have never had a problem with them a must have for new mothers	1
Have n't used these yet because I have n't had the baby but looking forward to it ! ! ! I can buy them cheaper somewhere else but still good product it seems like ! !	1
These are great . They save time and do n't leak - like the standard bags sometimes do . HOWEVER I will only buy the generic ones from now on since they are so much cheaper ! You can get both sizes at Walgreen 's , Walmart and Target . Save your money !	1
You can remove all of the air from the liner so it minimizes ingestion of air . Initially we were hesitant/worried to use this system since we solely breastfeed for 5 months . The baby had no issues with the liner/bottle system . We use this in conjunction with our Medela Breast Pump . Works great , met all expectations .	1
I was under the impression that the liner collapsed as baby was drinking , but that is not the case , so I 'm not sure how this system is any different than a normal empty bottle.The only thing it makes easier is cleaning , since I can just drop the liner in the garbage and use another one next time .	1
Love these liners have been using for many years with all my kids . never had a problem with them .	1
I did n't want bottles with a ton of moving parts that needed to be washed carefully . Using these allows at least part of the bottle to be clean every time , so you only have to worry about cleaning the nipple ( and the bottle base , but that does n't usually get very dirty at all ) .	1
These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle . Yes , I can simply throw these liners away after using them , but since I still have to wash the bottle 's nipple , this system does not save me any time . I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they do n't melt , which is good . I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount ( frequency and quantity ) that my baby spits up . However , the amount of spit-up is the same - not better , but also not worse .	1
I have some Dr. B brand bottles . They are awesome . But when I was a first time mom , I hated washing bottles and parts . It did n't take much time , but still it took time . So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles . Yay ! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day . Now I have my 2nd child . Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable . It designed for the bottle . It 's durable and does n't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note : If you want to use generic brand liners , you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself . The water level/volumn is different .	1
I am a big proponent of the Playtex Bottle Liner Drop-ins . Cleaning bottles becomes limited to cleaning nipples -- a far less difficult task . They 're easy and effective .	1
These are so easy . I do n't have to wash a million bottles anymore ! I just have to wash the nipples . The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I 'm ready , but when I put in the 8 oz . and let the bottle sit for a while , the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz . So the measurements may be a little off . I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner 's measurements .	1
We have twins so when purchasing products , it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler . These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles . The bag collapses as they consume the contents , which supposedly improves problems with gas but I 'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others . Because the bag is thin , it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration . The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning . I only have 4 bottles per baby , replace the liner and nipple when necessary , and wash everything once a day . These do n't come cheap so I do n't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles .	1
Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away , and never heatedto a dangerous level , the baby is safe and colic etc . is reduced . Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic..so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them	1
Could n't find this in stores around my area . But I 've used this before and they 're great . It 's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they 're disposables . I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there 's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles , just as good if not more effective , cheaper and more count . Regardless , this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents .	1
I love the drop-ins system . I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them . I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter . There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle does n't get dirty . I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon ! P.S . There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles . It was cheap and saves a step !	1
I love these liners . They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk . I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out , squeezed a little too hard and POP ! ! , breastmilk everywhere . I learned my lesson- squeeze gently , if at all . My only complaints are : 1 . They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it , imho . 2 . The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and do n't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells , so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk . Otherwise , this is a great product ! !	1
The plastic drop in bottles work perfectly well . I recycle the plastics and I do n't have to wash the bottles .	1
Love this system and these drop-in liners work great ! I would recommend these to anyone and I 'm picky so you know they are good .	1
What 's to say , they do they 're jobDrop-ins are straight forward and they get from me a nodThough at times they feel like a wasteBut saving time not cleaning puts a smile to my faceThese do 4 ounces , but when you get to 4 ounces it 's probably better to just go to the 8 ouncers becase you have to remember that you need to put in formula into the water and it 's nice to have some space to mix the formula .	1
Seems to help with my son 's colic . Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it . Air will flow through the nipple . We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving .	1
I tried Avent and Dr. Browns before switching to Playtex Drop Ins . I liked all three but Playtex drop ins are so easy ! And , the way the nipple is , for my daughter , seems to be the most natural and closest to breastfeeding . if you feel the nip , sounds weird ! , it has a texture to it that other bottles do n't . most bottles nips are pretty `` hard '' unless you go latex ... which scared me because I did n't want to find out the hard way that my baby had a latex allergy ! Anyway , the silicone nip on the playtex nursers is much softer and pliable so the baby can kind of pull on it as she wants to . It 's great ! I highly recommend . Hopefully this review is not too strange : )	1
These drop in liners are worth every penny . With my twins , the daycare goes through lots of bottles each day . These are so easy to & # 34 ; load & # 34 ; into the bottles and have never fallen out , burst , leaked , etc .	1
We 've been using these and absolutely love them ! So much easier to clean than other bottle systems . Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one . Just press in the liner from the bottom . We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner , and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner . Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple ( be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow ) . If your fingers are not long enough , we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air .	1
When I am home , I use the Born Free bottles . When I travel , I use the playtex disposable bottles . Makes for easy packing and cleaning .	1
I have no idea why I spent so much money on Avent ( leaks all the time and too fast flow ) and Dr. Brown 's ( difficult to clean ) . I love this disposable liners because I just discard them after use , which is awesome when you have a baby to take care of .	1
Love them . I use these when I have to pump a bottle for travel . They are handy , easy to use and I love that you use them and then toss them right in the trash . Good price for the amount .	1
I 've been using these liners since my baby was 3 months old . They work great , they do n't leak , and they make my life so much easier . These are ESSENTIAL for our out of town trips . I would take a box of liners , only about 3-4 Drop-ins nursers , and about a dozen extra nipples and caps for a 3 day trip . With my older kids I had to lug a whole plastic bin full of bottles plus the microwave sterilizer when we went on trips !	1
Some people say that these drop-ins did not keep a good seal , but I found that those individuals were trying to push all the air out through the nipple and the pressure is what broke the seal . If you want less air just press some of the air out before putting the ring on . Pressing all the air out is unnecessary . The liner does its job without pressing all the air out . The point of the collapsible liner is to not let more air in as your baby eats , and it does a fantastic job . If you would rather not buy replacement liners , Playtex VentAire takes the same nipples and does the same job with a vent at the bottom , keeping a seal when the pressure of the milk is on it , and then allowing air in through the bottom to replace the milk as the baby eats . These do n't leak as long as the bottom ring is screwed on properly . I loved them because I did n't have to buy replacements and it did the same job !	1
Perfect and fast sterile use . Using these for my grandson . Used them when his mother was a baby and still love them .	1
I love these bottles ! I breastfeed and my son takes these bottles so easily when I 'm not around . They are easy and convenient ! I 'm not sure how they would do with mixing of formula , but it seems it may not be so easy because seeing exact measurements are rather difficult.I recommend these to everyone ! No problems with excess gas and you know you are getting a fresh , clean liner everytime ! Love love love them !	1
I 've been using the playtex drop-ins since my daughter was born and she never had much problems with her bottle . No upset stomachs ( I think she may have had 2 ever and she is now 19 months old ) and spit ups were uncommon . I know it 's added cost and waste , but I am not willing to give up the convenience and how well they work for us .	1
I love these drop-ins . So easy to use ! Much easier than traditional bottles . Also , they do seem to cut down on the gas .	1
I 've tried other brands of drop-ins and Playtex is the best . I wo n't try another brand . And you ca n't beat the price on Amazon ( for 100 ) .	1
We used the playtex drop in bottles for our daughter and I do not have one bad thing to say about them . They made my life a lot easier by cutting down on the washing of bottles . You just drop in the liner and throw it away after feeding and the only thing you have to wash is the nipple . No taking apart the bottle and washing several parts ... . Just quick and easy . We used the Madela bottles at first but she was having a few problems ( too much air ) but we did not have any issues with these . We order all of our baby stuff on autoship ( including the liners ) and the price is unbeatable .	1
Classic brand , and will be great for faux formula for 'reborn ' baby dolls ( they are very popular , and for me , a better option than a real kid : D ( I 'm middle-aged and disabled , but do love a cute baby ! ! ) . One diaper , one bottle , and no college fund . Perfect kid !	1
We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation . I 'm so glad we did ! We 've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break . They 're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes . I 've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues . For those curious about measurements , it 's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags . Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out , but it 's not a large amount at all . I 've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well , but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target .	1
I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners , it 's easy , sanitary and really helps reduce air intake . My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it 's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the ( example ) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible ... It 's not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly .	1
I do n't have much time to go out shopping for things we need with a new baby . The playtex bottles are easy since there 's no real cleaning everyday - the liners just pop in and out ! The price here is just as good as walmart but it comes right to my door without the walmart craziness : ) Would recommend for sure ! No problems with leaking or anything ...	1
I love my playtex drop-ins . I have been lucky to always receive liners that are intact and work just like they are suppose to . Easy clean up , great price . Love them .	1
Baby is breastfed . These work well for childcare providers to transfer warmed milk into.Great price and easy to use . Shipped very fast !	1
I 've been using these for almost a year and they are great . It 's nice to not have to clean the inside of the bottles every night . We 've had very minimal leakage issues . And I do think there is something to Playtex 's claims that it reduces gas/air . Also not terribly expensive over the long-run . I will use the Playtex Dropin system again with my next child .	1
I love the playtex drop in system - it might cost a little more but it 's worth it for the ease of bottle prep and knowing that bottles are clean and sanitary every time ! These do n't tear and warm easily in a cup of hot water .	1
I started using these when my baby was 1 month old . Its great to not have to scrub bottles all the time ! And I believe it helped w/ her colic . I still love how convienent these are .	1
I go through these quickly , so I get a couple boxes at a time . Worth the price ; and that price is better than the price in the store .	1
use with playtex storage system . It is the best way to pump in place for use later . Both daughters use these with the storage kit . o cleaning bottles .	1
Very easy to use , combined with almost nothing to clean . The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience .	1
We used Playtex drop-ins for both of our children . I prefer buying them from Amazon , because they are must cheaper than the store . You get more for your money . These drop-ins are great quality . You do n't have to worry about your child getting air in the bottle . I would highly recommend these to others !	1
Playtex drop in suystem is what any decent lactation consultant will recommend . it is by far the slowest slow out there . kids do n't get used to gulping down , and you have the best chance of continuing breast feeding . the liners are easy to use . means you can stay out all day with only 1 bottle . great stuff .	1
I started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day . Then I came upon these Playtex nursers with disposable liners , and now I only use a regular bottle if I have to . Valuable time has been saved , now that I 'm using these things instead ! The only caution I have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements . Because the liners can accommodate 8-10oz of fluid , do n't trust the measurements on this . I noticed the difference when I poured 5oz of pre-measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag , and when it was in the Playtex bottle , the bottle indicated only 4oz of fluid.Aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements , this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household .	1
I use the Playtex nurser and tried two different generic brands ( Walmart and Babies-R-Us ) of the bottle liners . I was unhappy with both , and ended up coming back to these , even though they are a bit more expensive . I like that they collapse more easily than the generic , which seem more & # 34 ; molded. & # 34 ;	1
It is very easy to just drop in a sterilized liner and clean the nipple . Very quick and easy to get a feed in . I ca n't go with anything else except for Dr. Browns bottles , I do have those also .	1
When used with the slow flow nipple and the breast pump adapter kit this is the closest to breastfeeding as you can get.I bought the breast pump adapter kit and now i pump in these bags and never have to use a bottle holder at all.no more milk transfer from bottle to bottle , and no more air at all . you can squeeze all the air out of these liners.take a look at the images to see step by step how i connect this to my pump kit and using the adapter rings and caps store , and feed without the need for the nurser bottle to mimic as close to mommy breastfeeding as possible . For medical reasons my baby could not latch and this allowed me to bond with my daughter and have gas free feedings and be literally as close to breast as possible . Check out the images - you will see for yourself this amazing way to nurse your baby .	1
I have been using those for months and will keep using them . They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles . I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags do n't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk . This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I was n't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak . After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea , time saver on cleaning .	1
So easy to use and not as much clean-up afterward . Just pop liner in the bottle , add water and powdered formula , shake and you are good to go .	1
Drop in liners do make bottle cleaning so much less time consuming then before . Too bad Playtex is quite expensive . I tend to go back and forth between these and the store brands . I 've found that most store brands work just as well and at a fraction of the cost . However , when I bought them on Amazon this time they were at a descent price plus a $ 1 off coupon which made the purchase worth it .	1
I have been using these for 5 months , since my daughter was born and they are perfect . I have not had any problems with these and they are so much safer and sterile than a plastic bottle . Worth the extra cost to continue to buy these . I think the only thing that could come close to being as good is glass bottles .	1
These make bottle cleaning and heating near effortless . My precious baby is n't nearly as gassy either . These are a godsend .	1
Used these throughout the bottle stage with our now 19-month old . Playtex bottles were the only ones we used and the drop in liners saved us time on dishes which to me was worth the extra expense .	1
We use these whenever we are away from home ( take up less room in a diaper bag or suitcase ) Took her a while to get used to the nipple on the bottle . But she 's pretty easy to feed . If there 's food in it , she 'll figure out how to use it , lol . I am pleased with the price of these , they are more expensive in stores .	1
The Playtex dropins are a quick and easy way for bottles . The 100 count box is a good value as well .	1
These are great liners . I like the whole playtex drop-ins system . I have less to clean up with these , which allow me more time to spend with my baby .	1
Love these bottles , but baby seems to drink faster with these nipples . Does n't leak as long as you line up the arrows . Great for traveling with baby , but not that great for the environment .	1
We were shopping one night and decided it would be easier to buy formula , liners and diapers from amazon than going to the store . I did n't realize it would save us money also !	1
So far I really like . This product has not leaked and since my baby girl is growing this is perfect for water and formula .	1
These drop-in liners are great . However , some of the liners were very squished and collapsed already while in the box . So I had to stretch them out so I could put the formula in . No biggy , but just odd . These are convenient and worth the money . I recycle them too after use and rinsing . Good product .	1
Most people look at the drop-ins bottles and frown because you have to continually buy liners for them . Let me tell you something , IT 'S WORTH IT ! ! I love not having to wash the bottom part of my bottles .	1
These liners are much better then the bags : it is easy to use , and save lots of time on cleaning bottles !	1
The yin and yang of disposable liners is having to keep buying more . But it beats washing bottles all day long .	1
I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores ( Wally-World , the bullseye store , & various drugstores ) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do , but at half the price . I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling , meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking ... but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic , they work as well . Playtex , come down in price and you 'll get 5 stars instead of only 4 .	1
These liners are a great idea in theory . I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore . The measurements are a nightmare , I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle . The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out , I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them . However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully . It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not .	1
I used these with my first daughter 8 years ago . They are wonderful ! You do not have to sit and wash bottles constantly . The baby will also have less gas since there is little to no air to contend with . The only difference with these are that they are expandable . This may make a difference for some using formula in respect to measuring differently with the expansion . I will be using them to store breast milk for when I go from breast to bottle as baby gets older so the expansion wo n't affect me any . I recommend these liners for everyone .	1
These work great for the playtex bottles . I have had no issues of them leaking , as long as they are put on properly . The number on the drop ins do n't exactly match up with the numbers on the bottle .	1
The playtex with drop-ins system works great . Makes cleaning super easy - since you do n't need to sterilize the bottle every time you use it . The liner and the nipple are the only things that come in contact with milk - the liner is disposed off after one use , and the nipple can be easily sterilized.This system works particularly well when traveling . I introduced these to my son when he was 2.5 months old and we were on a flight for 16 hours . I simply took 2 nurser bottles , lots of liners , and many nipples . Made cleaning super easy on the flight - and gave me the piece of mind that everything was sterilized . The biggest advantage was that my luggage was a lot less bulky ( as opposed to traveling with 8 glass bottles ) .The only downside : The 1 oz , 2 oz , 3 oz etc markings on the nurser are not correct . You should use another system of measurement to figure out how much milk/water you want to pour in the nurser .	1
The Playtex system works well with my Medela breast pump - you will need to buy these liners , plus a set ofPlaytex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage KitPlaytex storage rings ( which these liners drop into ) . That kit comes with an adapter that fits on a Medela pump . The whole system is convenient and easy to move from frozen storage to feeding simply by dropping these liners into a bottle , and you can buy either latex or silicone tips for your bottles . The thin plastic allows the milk to heat up easily by submerging in warm water before feeding . Overall , very convenient and in almost 7 months of pumping , I never had a leak ! Also , BPA free which is great !	1
I love this bottle system ! My whole family used these with their children so I decided to try them on my son and jeebus christ these are amazing . They definitely cut down on gas and are such a time saver ! Out of the whole box of 100 that I purchased twice NONE of them leaked !	1
Works perfectly with the Playtex drop in bottles . I love this system and wish I had used it with my first child . This saves so much more time with bottle cleaning . Sure , you have a spend a little more to buy these liners but it 's definitely worth it when I think of the time I save not having to wash bottles . ( Can you tell I hate washing bottles ? )	1
This product works directly with our Medela breastpump with the use of adapters that come with the breastpumping kit . It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another . I can not comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze . The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner is n't fully expanded . We measure in a different container and pour into the liner . The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just do n't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean . Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles . All in all , we recommend this product .	1
It did exactly what I wanted . It lines the nursers perfectly . Liners are nice because all I have to wash are the bottle nipples !	1
These things work really well for storing milk . Easy to fill , and disposable . I just wish that they were a little more solid around the top edges . I would still buy them and use them again on my next child .	1
We were told about the playtex bottle by our lactation nurse . She recommended it because we were having trouble breastfeeding and she said these bottles would n't cause too much nipple confusion . They work great , we do n't have to worry about washing the bottle every time . Just put a liner in and you 're ready to go .	1
We 've used these ( and the four-oz size ) every feeding since he was brought home 5 months ago . Such a time saver for clean up and disinfecting . We could n't live without !	1
I do n't know where I would be without these . Easy to `` drop-in '' and you just throw it away . I love that it 's always ready to go and that I do n't have to clean a bottle and a brush and make sure that everything is clean inside . You can even heat up the milk/formula just by putting hot water in a bowl and swishing the bottle around for about 30 seconds !	1
I like to keep a few of these with me for changing in public places or changing an extra dirty diaper . Just the right size , and leakproof .	1
This was the best purchase ! ! These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained ! ! ! They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great ! ! ! We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it . Great to have in the diaper bag as well - do n't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these ! ! !	1
I love these and will be buying more . I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic . They absorb pretty well -- I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast , but 95 % of the time it does n't leak into my changing pad sheet . I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it does n't have time to leak anyway . These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover . I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack .	1
Love these . They are thin , but I like that as they are disposable , and I feel better about less waste . I use them mostly out of the house , but occasionally use them preemptively for messy diapers at home , too . They do rip easily , but you 'll learn quickly how to handle them to avoid it . Better priced than most , too .	1
Very handy item to have available . Heats faster than boiling and more efficiently/safely than the microwave . The only problem I 've found is that the heating instructions included with the warmer are overestimated . If you set it to a lower temperature ( between 1 and 2 ) and let it warm longer , it 's easier to prevent overheating.This warmer DOES HAVE an ON/OFF SWITCH , but still no built-in timer ( the oven timer works just fine ) .And as far as the bottle floating around during heating , you can put the bottle in BEFORE you add the water , and fill up the water to the same level as the liquid in the bottle to prevent uneven bobbing.My son is now 1-year-old and no longer uses bottles , but I still use this warmer for his refrigerated baby food and even to warm up a cup of milk for him .	1
well , i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here . its a great device , at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water ( 3 minutes ) , then soak the bottle until it warmed up ( 3 more minutes ) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes . if youve got an extra $ 40 i recommend it .	1
I use this warmer to warm both formula and breast milk . I find it easy to use . The warmer is small , compact and comes with a 4oz avent storage bottle and a spoon for baby food . Unlike other reviewers , I have an on/off switch at the back . I am not sure if it 's a different model from theirs.The warmer heats the bottle evenly and I have had no problems . Personally , I think it beats the running water method ( and is much faster ) . However , if you do n't stand there and keep an eye on it , you are liable to forget about it and the milk can overheat . That is the biggest drawback , though I am not sure how avent would change that , since if the warmer automatically shut off , the milk might get cold ! ! The other issue some people have mentioned is that bottles float ! They only do that if you fill the warmer with too much water . There is a Max line for the water on the warmer and for smaller bottles you only fill water to slighlty above the level of milk . That insures that the bottles remain steady ... and do n't float.Overall , I like the warmer . It 's convenient , easy to use , small and nice ! !	1
I was slightly spoiled , so why not pass some of that on ? I got this because it was one of those things I thought I HAD to have , not true , but is sure is nice . I lost the little green insert screen , but this thing works great , even without it.There are also instructions for deliming the warmer if you have hard water , like I do . It 's not too difficult and can be done in 5 minutes .	1
The bottle warmer works as advertised . I like the aesthetics of it and it lasted without a problem through my son 's eating-at-night period.It may overheat the bottle if you do n't monitor it , but it worked well for us . Just keep an eye on it .	1
I give 5 stars to all Avent Products . I have had no problems , whatsoever , with Avent . You may also want to purchase the Avent Sterilizer . It is fabulous .	1
I received this as a gift and was surprised at how quickly this warms bottles . However , if you do n't pay attention , it will overheat the bottle . It would really be helpful if there was a timer or auto shut-off because the water can become scalding . I usually use the wide-neck bottles so I do n't have the `` floating '' problem but the few times I did use the slim regular bottles and did experience the floating bottle . The upside is that it does accommodate the wide neck bottles . It 's also an easy-to-clean item .	1
We 've always used the microwave ( most of the time ) or a jug of hot water ( when a mircowave was n't available ) to warm our first two children 's bottles of formula - this worked fine for us as we knew the exact time to make the bottle just right.Unfortunately my third child had to spend some time in hospital when he was two weeks old . What we learned from his nurses is that microwaves can 'zap ' a lot of goodness out of your formula ( the hosptial used a microwave as well until they were told this ) . We also learned that the prescription only formula he now has to have tastes digusting when not kept very warm.Hence our decision to purchase the Avent bottle warmer . What we like about it is that it is easy to re-warm our bottles during a feed when the need arises and keeps all the goodness in the formula . The lack of an on/off switch is a bit annoying but we just turn it off at the plug . The fact that the light goes on and off as it 's keeping the water at a constant temperature is also a bit of a pain as at 2am in a dimly lit kitchen you can just assume you already turned off the plug when you have n't if the light is out.Despite these negatives things , they far outweigh the advantages for us of keeping our son 's formula nice and warm . It 's easy to use , easy to keep clean and has worked pefectly from the day we bought it.We love it .	1
I thought the idea of a bottle warmer was a rediculous waste of money before I had my daughter . I breastfeed , but have a hard time functioning in the middle of the night , so I pump during the day and warm a bottle for the baby in the middle of the night . For three weeks I boiled water in a pot and held the bottle with metal tongs ... not ideal for someone half asleep . Once we coughed up the money for this warmer I was a much happier , half-asleep mom . It only takes about 8 minutes to heat a 5 oz . bottle . Since the heating elements are on the bottom of the product , I would suggest swirling the bottle and testing the temperature before giving it to the baby , better safe than sorry . Cleaning of the product is ultra-easy as well , vinegar , water and some soak time and it 's good as new .	1
The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is a very obliging unit . It services all types of containers , and of differing sizes too . It can warm disposable , oversized , and odd shaped bottles , glass babyfood jars , and tin cans to name a few . It 's small in size , measuring 5 '' x 5 '' x 5 `` high . Thus , it occupies very little room on the counter , or bedside table . A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer , and is removable for larger items . On the front of the unit is a dial control . It has 3 settings , 1,2 , and 3 , 1 being the coolest . Next to the dial is a power light , which serves 2 purposes.1 . ) It indicates the unit is `` ON '' and working , and2 . ) When the water reaches the correct temperature , the power light blinks `` ON '' and `` OFF '' to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer . For that reason , one must unplug it after each use . With a rather lengthy cord , 3 feet long , it is very adaptable . For those concerned about d & eacute ; cor , the all white exterior is designed to blend in . In addition , the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable . By that , I mean it 's lightweight ; it weighs 1 pound , and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag . We traveled frequently when William was an infant , and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It 's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles , i.e . Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience : Right off the bat , I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day , as I was unable to breastfeed . Thus , I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer . Pop a bottle in the unit ; plug it in , and in 5 minutes it 's done . How difficult is that ? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast , evenly , and it 's durable . Moreover , now there 's no more white , icky , stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer , I never encountered any problems . Let me tell you , this unit got a workout in my house . I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual . I know ~ `` geek alert '' . Okay , that 's true , but it 's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming . I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk , because I 'd get distracted . Consequently , running a timer became apart of the routine . If Avent were to add an external timer , this would be extremely helpful to users . I almost never used the coolest setting , only when thawing frozen breastmilk , and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles . Both were rare occasions . I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator , and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here 's another tip , adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product . Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch . I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue . Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience ; although , a power strip would solve that problem . Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed . I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer . An hour might go by before I realized my mistake . Now that 's a fire hazard ! Closing Remarks : When it comes to bottles , Avent is still my 1st choice . I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand . I guess that goes to show ... input from customers can , and does influence manufactures . Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer , which would certainly increase the price . However , I for one would be willing to pay for those added features . Would you ? While writing this review , I 've debated how to rate this product . I was extremely pleased with this warmer , but I also recognize its shortcomings . I 've opted to give this product an above average mark , because1 . ) It did what it was supposed to do . It warms bottles fast , and evenly.2 . ) It accommodates plastic , glass , tin , and a myraid of bottles styles.3 . ) Warms disposable bottles , and bottle liners , and4 . ) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding , Mary	1
I like this bottle warmer . It warms up the bottles quickly and that means alot at 3AM with a screaming , hungry baby . I use the Dr. Brown 's bottles with it and they fit fine . I have n't had any problems with uneven heating or anything like that . I have even taken the warmer with me when we go to friends houses so I can heat up the bottles quickly . I strongly suggest that you do not put the nipples on the bottles while they are in the warmer . It causes the formula to overflow from the nipple . Found that out the hard way . Other than that , I have n't had any problems or issues with the product . I would suggest this to parents looking for a small warmer .	1
I think the [ ... ] . The fill line is crucial in getting the bottle warm . If you fill the water to high than it does n't heat as well . The water is supposed to be just at the level of milk in order for it to heat correctly . If you fill it correctly it will work . It works fast too . A bottle of cold breast milk from the fridge is warm in about 4 minutes . If you 're warming room temperature formula it will be even faster , probably about 2 minutes . I highly recommend this bottle warmer . My baby is not on solids so I ca n't say how it works on baby food .	1
My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she could n't get it to work . Well , I wanted it and I registered for it anyway . We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked . I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great . Just add a little water , throw in the bottle , and in minutes it was perfect . My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer . But other than that , it 's another great product by Avent .	1
I like this a lot when I need to warm baby 's bottles ( I am not using Avent bottles but it works fine ) . It heats the milk evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions.But there should be a timer , or the light should turn off only when this is warm . The directions are way too complex for a mum and a crying baby . Be more simple !	1
I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work . I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children , two of which are twins . So , I figured she knew what was good and what was not . And she was right , this works well . I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I 've had no problems with this . It 's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right ... not too hot , not too cold . I 'm very pleased with this product .	1
I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water . But , in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep , the last thing you want to do is exactly that ! ! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble . The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch . Otherwise , its great ! ! ! ( avent products are the best out there ... )	1
it 's a very practical item , it saves time and avoids forgetting milk/food being overcooked/boiled ! is very easy to clean.is not heavy at all , you can carry it everywhere .	1
I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer . ( ( Side note : the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item ! ! ) ) It 's nice to have a place to warm the bottle , and it does cut down on wasting water ( vs the other method of a bowl of warm water ) . The biggest plus is it 's faster to prepare . The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process . I thought this product would help with that but it does n't . You can get the water to almost boiling . You have to time it , but again , it 's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes .	1
Several reviews complain about features of this warmer , but I think it is wonderful . I use Avent bottles and Gerber baby food jars in it with no problems . If you put the bottle/jar in the warmer first and then add the water , the bottle/jar will not float or tip over . It has three heat settings for how warm you want your bottle and a red light on the front shows when the bottle is warming . The light shuts off when done , but if you leave the warmer on , it will heat through another cycle . It heats so quickly though , that you do n't have time to get distracted and leave the bottle to get too hot . Even if it had auto shut-off , a bottle left in hot water will continue to heat and could be too warm to serve to your baby . It uses a coil to heat and I 've heard that these type of heating mechanisms should be unplugged when not in use so that they wo n't get ruined , but there is an ON/OFF switch on the back of the warmer if you 'd rather just use that . The basket inside is removeable and makes it easy to pull out 2.5 ounce baby food jars . The warmer is small , convenient and easy to clean . I am very happy with it .	1
When I was pregnant with my first set of twins I felt that I could handle EVERYTHING . ( i.e no exersaucer to babysit , not bouncers , no ridiculous toys , no uneeded baby products , and yeah , no sterelizer ) . Well my husband said we needed most of the stuff I said we didnt . But he let me be stuborn and didnt purchase the sterelizer . Well after 2 1/2 years of boiling bottles , pacifiers , teethers and all that other stuff , I was going crazy . Yet I still wouldnt admit it to my husband : ) . When the second set of twins were on the way , I was ready . I was going to buy baby wipes warmers , exersaucers , bouncers , swings , the aquarium crib soother and this sterelizer . Well this sterelizer is my hero ( as well as my husband who forced me to get one ! ) . It cleans about 6 bottles and all of the things that come with them . ( actually it cleans 5 of the playtex airvent ones , but I use avent too ) . I did breast feed so it also cleans avent pumps ( and my friend managed to get another kind in one ! ) . My kids love pacifires so those are constantly in there , and so are all those teething rings . Let me just tell you that you can NOT put a dirty item in here , you still have to wash it a bit . This just makes sure its really clean , ( my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times , all four of them put together ! ) This sterelizer is great , and it uses very little water ( I have a purifier so I use pure water ) . like another reviewer I HIGHLY RECOMEND TO UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE ! I will say it again , after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night , REGISTER FOR THIS ! ITs a bit pricey but I can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping at the same time , and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due to unsanitary things that your child ( ren ) place in their mouth , will cost you more ! *** P.S ... IT MAKES A GREAT DRYING RACK TOO !	1
This is a really great product ... With just a little bit of water it sterilize everything really fast and it turn off by itself ... And it 's big enought to put almost everything you want to ... I really prefer this one instead of the microwave one because the other one is smaller , what means that you have to spend more electricity because you have to sterilize more times ! ! ! And not even try to boil the bottles in the stove ... . believe me , you would forget to turn it off ... That has happend to me a thousand times in my mother 's house ! !	1
We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned , boiling water in a pot ... what a mess and waste of time ! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly . After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home , I could n't see how we survived before ! It 's quick , easy and efficient . New moms have enough to mess with , do n't spend you few , precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil , splurge on this item and you wo n't regret it ! !	1
I have to say , I love this . Easy to use and most of all , its clean .	1
This one is easy . Put your stuff in , add a little water then push a button . Truely a no brainer . The only reason it did n't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use . My freind did n't and something started growing in it . Other than that , this is perfect . If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once . You do n't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you . Put this time saver on you registry .	1
I bought this Sterilizer and I am so glad I did . I was planning on breastfeeding but when that did n't work out , I found myself making formula everyday , sometimes twice a day . I can fit 6 Avent bottle set-ups in the sterilizer and it works great . It is quick and easy to use , not to mention it looks great on my countertop . It does n't take up a lot of space and it looks nice . Two thumbs up for this product ! !	1
I love the Avent bottle sterilizer . I own two , one for my house and one for grandamas . You want to be sure your baby 's bottles are sterile , but who has time to boil everything when you have a baby . It has never leaked ! It is very easy to wash and fits well on the kitchen counter . It makes life much easier and gives you more time to spend with your baby .	1
Since we had twins we were going Through A LOT of dirty bottles . I didnt want to put the bottles in the dishwasher with all the other dishes . I didnt want to always have to boil the bottles on the stove either . So we purchased the Steam Sterilizer and im so happy we did . It has a permanent place on my counter top . I cant even count how many times i have used this in the past 6 months . And it still works at good as the first time . We have all avent bottles so i dont have a problem with bottles not fitting . Other reviews said the bottles were very wet when they came out ... but if you think about it..they would be after all the sterilizing . After mine are done i just put them on the bottle dry rack and let them dry . Its just like when you wash them in the sink but this way you know they are getting clean ALL OVER . I think also that the dishwashers water gets hotter than this and does something to the nipples to the bottles . Ive had some friends who ran into shrinking nipples after putting them in the diswasher . I would rather be spending time with my children than standing over the stove boiling my bottles and part . It only takes 8 mins . Im very happy with our purchase	1
This has to have been one of my favourite purchases for baby - along with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer . My husband and I had some controversy going initially on whether this was worth the money or not , and even HE now admits that it is worth it 's weight in gold in terms of convenience , ease of use and overall good value for money . We keep a dish of soapy water in the sink and dump all bottles and binkys in there , rinse them off and load them into the sterilizer . Within minutes they are done and if you do n't open them for a few hours they can stay in the unit until you 're ready for them . I know that many people say you do n't strictly need to sterilize everytime but with this you can run it as often as you want , it 's a godsend for breastpump parts and according to our pediatrician , sterilizing is better for baby for the first weeks when they are so susceptible to germs . I would advise anyone thinking on this purchase to GO FOR IT . I can fit my entire breastpump and up to 5 bottles in as well as pacifiers in one go . This has made my life so easy ! It also has a warranty just by the way , so those who have complained it packed up within a year , you could have had it replaced free of charge !	1
This sterilizer is GREAT ! My girlfriend boiled her bottles and I ca n't believe how much easier ( and safer ) this is ! This only takes minutes and no risk of steam burns ! I also sterilized the Avent breast pump and all of its parts in this sterilizer . It worked great ! Another plus : the two racks with the tiny holes ( not the one that the bottles rest on ) can be snapped together to form a `` basket '' if you wanted to throw stuff into your dishwasher . I 've never done that ... I 'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher ... my baby 's not even a month old yet ... maybe after he 's older , I 'll use that feature as well . For now , this sterilizer is EXCELLENT ! Definitely worth the money ! We 're very pleased with it . We also have the Avent food warmer ... another great buy !	1
This sterilizer is so easy to use . It has three adjustable racks for bottles , nipples or other items . You just put water in the bottom , your bottles ( rinsed with warm , soapy water ) in the racks , put on the lid and press the button to start it . It is done sterilizing within ten minutes . You have to clean it every so often by running it with citric acid ( or vinegar ) in there and since it has a coil heater , it should be unplugged when not it use . Basically , it requires very little maintenance when the alternative is boiling bottles on the stove which takes longer and your bottles may easily be ruined . The bottles are usually still a bit wet when the sterilization cycle is done , but you can leave them in there to dry , or place them on paper towels ( putting a paper towel over the top of the bottles helps keep them sterile ) . The sterilizer also comes with little plastic tongs to grab things and keep them sterile , but I just use my clean hands and my baby has not had a problem . I sterilize Avent and Medela products in it and I have been very happy with the effectiveness and ease of this sterilizer .	1
Perfect for breast pump accessories . IF YOU ARE BREAST FEEDING AND/OR PUMPING , YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS to clean all those pesky little teeny/awkward accessories . But beyond that ( as far as baby 's bottles and bottle accessories/pieces , pacifiers , small plastic toys , etc . ) if you have a dishwasher it probably has an optional steam-dry cycle that works just the same as this microwave steam sterilizer .	1
We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child , and still used this product . Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water , and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them ? This sterilizer holds 6 bottles , nipples , tops , and pacifiers all at the same time . You can put breast pump parts in it , and anything else that you need to sterilize . I washed everything , filled this with the items and water , and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles , pacifiers , or breast pump parts . I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old , when we stopped sterilizing bottles . Its easy , safe , convenient , and fast .	1
Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter , and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding . The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water , or sterilized at hot temperatures . We bought this sterilizer , but have stopped using it . However , we still use the dishwasher , which is fairly hot . I am keeping an eye on Avent 's statements : [ ... ] We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples , she feeds easily and does n't get a whole lot of gas . The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger . We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted .	1
I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it , I thought that I would n't use it . Boy , was I wrong . I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that was n't discovered for a week . I washed the cup . When I removed the valve ... NASTY . I do n't think it 's ever been taken apart and washed . After a second washing , I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it 's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever 's in there that I 'm sterilizing is n't sitting in the water . It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump . The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it 's just been cleaned and not in use .	1
This is a great product . I leave it on the counter and throw in pacifiers , WASHED bottles , etc all day then throw in the microwave when full . Uses much less water and energy than running the dishwasher .	1
This product is a true time , not to mention life saver ! It completely cuts the time in half of boiling water . If only it can hold more bottles .	1
I bought this sterilizer after trying to hand clean my breatpump - not feeling it was clean enough when i was finished.I have n't regretted it since . It is so easy to use , so quick , and everything looks clean as well as being sterile.I use it for the pump as well as bottles.I throw my son 's pacifier 's in every once in a while as well - it works great ! If you do n't run your dishwasher everyday , you need this product !	1
This is a great sterilizer . It is so easy to use , fast , and holds lots of stuff . Just check with your Dr. , because some cities ( like NYC ) have water that is already sterile . Also , if you 're breastfeeding , it 's easy enough to boil water -- since you do n't have to make as many bottles . Pricey .	1
I was not told by my doctor that I needed to sterlize my daughter 's bottles , but I do anyway . This thing is great . It fits any type of bottle . I use it everyday . It so easy to use and fast . It takes only 4 mins to sterlize your bottles , nipples , pacifiers , etc .	1
I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child . I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware . I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done . I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items . I use the Avent system and love this ! Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice . Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something ... .this was just reassuring.Great as a gift ... .	1
I am one of those without a dishwasher , unfortunately . I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby 's bottles and parts . I do n't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles . I have to agree about making sure it 's shut/snapped properly . You have to make sure it 's just right before you snap -- otherwise , you will break a nail or two . Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave . I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns .	1
It does n't get any easier than this product . Boy , am I glad that I got this at my shower . I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy . It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well . As an aside , do n't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump . For some reason , I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer . Well , I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized ! You ca n't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it 's your baby 's health involved here , take the extra step and make sure with this item . I 'm glad I did ! Plus , it 's just so very easy to use .	1
This is a great sterilizer and is so easy to use . It can also double as a place to store your bottles . I and my baby hated the bottles that come with it though . They leak and are awkward to hold .	1
This works great . Wash your bottles and put them in this sterilizer . Put 7 oz of water and pop it in the microwave for 4 minutes and your done ! If you follow the instruction you can only fit 4 bottles , but I have been able to fit 5.Not all babies need their bottles sterilize but if you want to be safe than sorry this is an awesome product !	1
I had an electric steraliser ( which died ) before buying this one . I wish I had had this steraliser all along . It 's so easy to load up , everything fits snuggly and has it 's place ( I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser ) , and extremely easy to wash and keep clean ( the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element ) .As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes ( our microwave is n't very powerful ) . From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and have n't had a problem with it - easy to use , easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand .	1
This makes it quick and easy to sterilize . Four minutes in the microwave . Fits four bottles in the center and nipples , etc . around the outside . We use it daily . Works best with distilled water- less residue- but tap water is fine too .	1
This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful , especially if you take your baby on the road , i.e . to the grandparents ' house . If they 've got a microwave , then you 're ready to go.It 's also very durable . Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new . Plus , unlike a bottle warmer appliance , there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break , so we expect we 'll be using ours for years/babies to come .	1
This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it . The tray holds all types of bottles , caps , etc . Best of all , the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes , without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know , the price seems high , but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity .	1
This is such a great item and I ca n't say enough good things about it ! I use it several times a day for pacifiers , baby bottles , and breast pump bottles . It could n't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave . The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious . Let it sit for a few minutes before opening , because the water can splash when opening the lid .	1
This is great for anyone with the Avent bottles . A friend of mine got some of the bottles and the breast pump at her baby shower . After a couple weeks of use she decided to get this sterilizer . It 's just much more convenient for her . Takes much less time than the alternative !	1
I really like using this product . It is fast and simple to use and holds a lot of bottles as well as my breast pump accessories . It makes sterilizing your baby products so much easier . Let 's face it , who is going to go and boil a pot of water everytime you needs to sterilize stuff ( which is every day when you have a baby ! ) Buy this simple to use product which will help to keep your baby healthy !	1
No more plugs to plug in or pots to boil . Just pop it in the microwave and walk away . It fits all of her bottles and pacifiers in one process and it fits perfectly in my small kitchen when I am not using it . Definatly worth buying ! you will get good use out of it .	1
Very easy to use ( I even use it to sterilize my yogurt jars for the yogurt machine ! ) , and quick ( 3min in all ) : it 's a great product !	1
Portable and easy to use . Love the convience and ease of use . Only need Water and the microwave to kill the germs . Very convient and can do 6 bottles at a time or even baby spoons , forks & even bowls or cups your choice . If it fits inside with lid snapped shut then you can steralize it like me . Remember do not force it to close as that will run seal .	1
It 's the best way to go ! Regardless of whether or not you have a healthy full-term baby , sterilizing the toys that may have been handled by other children or licked up by the dog is essential to keeping your already healthy baby healthy ! Boilng is a good alternative but not everything can be safely boiled and some hot water does n't cut it for me . Do yourself and your child a favor and purchase a sterilizer .	1
I am NOT a clean freak who sterilizes everything my son touches . I bought the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer to save time , and money . After a brief , and horrible stint with stovetop sterilizing , I began to use the dishwasher to clean my son & # 65533 ; s bottles . Oh , and I mean USE . Sometimes I ran the dishwasher 3-times a day JUST to clean bottles . I live in the desert , where water is precious . We pay handsomely for every drop that passes through our pipes . When I saw this sterilizer sitting on the shelf at Target , I snagged it.1 . ) It requires a small amount of water , and2 . ) It sanitizes in less than 10-minutes.I thought to myself , & # 65533 ; How can I go wrong ? & # 65533 ; This appliance is user friendly , so to speak.1 . ) There is NO way to confuse the stacking order : the base , the bottle rack , and the lid . There is no other way to put the thing together.2 . ) Loading can be confusing if the instructions are not followed . Keep the manual handy , as the loading order for large bottles , differs from the 4-ounce size.3 . ) Add the proper amount of water to the base every time . Do not skimp on the water , as it could cause the unit to burn . Do not over-fill it either , as the unit may not produce enough steam to work.That said ~ it & # 65533 ; s really quite simple to use . Pour 7-ounces of water in the base , load the rack , and pop it in the microwave . In 4 or 5-minutes it & # 65533 ; s done . Of course , it depends on the wattage of your microwave . Smaller microwaves may require more time , but that & # 65533 ; s all there is to it . I learned the hard way to wait before taking the sterilizer out of the microwave . It & # 65533 ; s HOT ! VERY hot ! Plus , any steam that & # 65533 ; s emitted can burn . The contents inside the unit will remain sterile for up to 3-hours given that the lid remains closed . Once the cooling time has passed , 2-minutes or so , remove the lid carefully . There will be lots of condensation on the bottles , similar to the dishwasher before the drying cycle begins . Place all the bits and pieces on a drying rack , or hand-dry them.When my son was a newborn , I used the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer at least 4-times a day . I cleaned bottles , nipples , breast pump parts , and pacifiers . Later on , I used the sterilizer on some of his toys . Be careful , not all toys are dishwasher safe . If it & # 65533 ; s top-drawer dishwasher safe , than it & # 65533 ; s probably sterilizer safe . We took many trips when William was an infant , and this unit made traveling easy . It provided a safe place to store the breast pump , and it worked in every hotel microwave we encountered . I don & # 65533 ; t recall exactly when I stopped using the sterilizer . It was probably soon after Will started solid foods . At any rate , this sterilizer was seriously tested in our home . I never had any problems , except the occasional burn to my hand when I opened the lid too early . Bad mommy , bad ! I can safely say the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer was worth its weight in gold . Some might complain about the price of the sterilizer , but considering two , 9-ounce bottles come with the unit , it may seem more reasonable knowing they retail for $ 4.00 a piece . The EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer turned out to be one of the BEST purchases I made the year my son was born , and I will happily recommend it to anyone.Happy Feeding , Mary : )	1
While we agree that a sterilizer is n't really needed , we liked having this one when we wanted to quickly sterilize our daughter 's bottles . It also sterilizes other pieces like breast pumps , etc .	1
I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples . I do n't know about everyone else , but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day , and I did n't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours . Plus , I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them , especially the nipples . The sterilizer works great , simply , and fast ! You , obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in . I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also , now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups , I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and are n't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them , I just did n't get to breast feed for very long : ( It saves time , energy and water ! A great product ! !	1
The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby 's bottles are truly clean . When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses . But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher , the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away , and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color . From then on I 've used the sterilizer exclusively . It is quick , easy and effective . I have taken several extended trips with the baby , and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in . This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have , but I am so glad that I do !	1
I love this sterilizer . It is very quick and completely uncomplicated . In 5 minutes I can sterilize bottles . The Avent bottles fit perfectly . I now use the Dr. Brown 's bottles and just have to lay them on their sides . Obviously the sterilizer is using steam and is incredible hot when it first comes out of the microwave . I ususally let it sit for about 3 minutes or so before removing the bottles .	1
I sterilized bottles and breast pumps the old fashioned way with my first child and in the begining w/ my 2nd child . NEVER AGAIN ! This is a very simple , fast , effective and economical way to get just about everything for baby sterilized .	1
This product is so convenient . I saw other mom 's deal with the sterilization issue by boiling everything , what a time consuming process . This way it 's all done in less than ten minutes and you can be doing other things during the process . The only suggestion I would make is to increse the number of bottles you could sterilize at one time . Great product .	1
I love this . This is the most wonderful item I have gotten . I clean the bottles and then load them into this . 4 to 5 minutes later , the bottles are all sterilized . I love this . Since I express milk and freeze it , it is reassuring knowing that the storage containers are sterile . I also love it because you never know if you are washing the bottles and pacifiers and such with warm enough water ( I am a first time mom ) . With the sterilizers I just have that reassurance that everything is clean enough for my baby . This is well worth the money . It is so easy to use and comes with extra bottles .	1
This has been a lifesaver ! ! ! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time ! ! ! Just add the correct amount of water , pop it in the microwave , and go ! ! ! It 's saved me so much time and hassle ... At first , I did n't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free , but this has more than paid for itself in it 's first 3 weeks of use ... A definate must have for new moms ! ! !	1
Every new mom should have this sterilier . It so easy to use and it 's fast just pop it in microwave for 5 mintues and you got everything ready to go . This a must have for all new moms .	1
This is one product that delivers exactly what it promises . It works quickly and well.I have used it daily to sterilize not only my isis breast pump ... but also a hospital grade rented pump , too . I am happy to say that neither of us has suffered from thrush or any infection.It 's also wonderful for pacifiers and bottles . I use the avent bottles which fit perfectly ... but also have mendela bottles that fit wonderfully , too.I would highly recommend .	1
I love this sterlizer . It will fit anything that needs to be sterilized , including breast pump accessories . The wattage is simple to use , just look inside your microwave on the bottom with all the info and it tells you what wattage it is and them refer to the manual to see the time . Highly reccomended	1
We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005 . I loved it then , but I 'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child . Before , putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward . Now , easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free . The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier . The older version was very similar but did not have specialized `` compartments '' to such an extent . All in all , it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot , it surely would not get done . That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus . I 'd buy the steamer alone .	1
This product gets the job done . Does what it says . All you have to do is add water and pop it in the microwave for 2 mins . I wish it were a bit smaller , but I suppose its size accommodates large bottles . I put bottles , pacifiers , breast pump parts in it without a problem .	1
This is a great product and I highly recommend it . The best sterilizing option since I do n't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days . Even if you just want to clean one pacifier , it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it 's quicker too . It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water ( but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer ) . It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall . But I use mine so much , I just keep it in the microwave when I 'm not using it !	1
This is a great item if you do n't run the dishwasher alot . We do n't need to run ours daily , so the sterilizer works great and takes very little time . Get a drying rack though , because the items will need to dry if you 're not using them immediately . Once I got a lot of bottles , I started running the dishwasher more and this became obsolete .	1
We use this for home and travel . Just pop it in the microwave and sterilize . Good item .	1
Wash 4 bottles , place them in the provided tub and 4 minutes later you have sterile bottles you can use ( and store ) for the next 4 feedings . Very convenient .	1
What more can you ask for ? This is one of those baby products ! It 's VERY easy to use : so easy to use , you will learn to use it ( believe me , this is important ) & quot ; in your sleep & quot ; . It is inexpensive too : just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price . Finally , and perhaps most important of all : this is an essential piece of baby gear . Sure , you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers , but let 's face it : this is the 21st Century , and you might as well make use of your microwave .	1
I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born . I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher . I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week . ( red when we ate pasta ) . This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old .	1
I LOVE this sterlizer ! It is so convenient especially when you dont run the dishwasher every day ! The price is a little high , which is why i bought a used on on ebay . Best purchase i have made ! I sterlize all my bottles in it , and pacifiers and even some toys . However , when i bought it , it did not include instructions , i later got them off of avent.com when i got a horrible steam burn from the product . That was probably just a dumb blonde moment on my part though ! I was in a hurry and not paying attention and the steam hit my hand . BE VERY CAREFUL ! you will want to use and oven mit or towel to take out of microwave and keep your face and hands away when opening it.This sterlizer is great ! i would reccomend it to everyone ! So far i have been able to fit everything from avent bottles to large 9 oz bottles in it , and even the parts to my gerber breast pump . I look forward to using this for years to come ! I found that the lid works really well for washing bottles too , instead of filling a sink full of water ! I can wash them in the soap and set them in the sink for rinsing , instead of using both sides of the sink .	1
It 's so simple , makes your life so much easier ! ! ! The lit will close if you turn it until you find the right position . Also , remember not to sterilize more than 4 bottles at the time . It just works perfectly . My baby is 8 months now and I 've been using it since she was born . GREAT !	1
This is great ! I used to boil water to have my first child 's bottles sterilized . Then I got this for my 2nd and 3rd children . I read the other reviews that it 's much easier to just pop it in the dishwasher . But what about for some of us who do n't run their dishwashers daily ( maybe because it 's not a full load yet ) . This sterilizer only takes 7 oz . of water and it takes 4 minutes in the microwave and your bottles , nipples , pacifiers , breast pump , etc . are sterilized . You ca n't beat 7 ounces of water and 4 minutes of time . You ca n't always wait for the dishwasher , which can take 30 minutes of more , plus all the water being used . So for me , I think this sterilizer is great and it is very convenient .	1
I use this to sterilize my breast pump accessories , the occasional bottle , pacifiers and other plastic toys . None of which are the Avent brand , but all work well in this unit . NO COMPLAINTS ! It 's quick & easy .	1
We wanted the microwave as opposed to the electric sterilizer because it was cheaper and more portable . It worked fast and great .	1
I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding ( or sippie cup for that matter ) . I did not originally register for this item because I did n't think it was necessary , especially since we have a dishwasher . This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free . I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies , bottles , and pacifiers . 4 minutes in the microwave and its done . Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be , it sure beats having to run the dishwasher . There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week . I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product .	1
Yet another great product from Avent ! This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles , pacifiers , toys , pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing . We have a dishwasher , but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months . Plus with animals in the house , we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind . By the way , we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it 's size we returned it for this one . This one is easier to store and use and is faster .	1
This is THE best way to sterilize bottles , bottle pieces , pacifiers , and breastpump parts . It is quick and easy . Forget boiling water or whatever else , get the microwave sterilizer .	1
This is a great product . We use the Avent Bottles & amp ; Avent Isis Breast Pump and they are made to fit into this sterilizer . However , it works just as well on other stuff . ( You do n't have to use their configurations to get good results . ) It 's so much easier than boiling . You just pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes and everything is sterilized . We love it .	1
My almost 4 month old son is VERY small ( 24th percentile ! ) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer , in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do , and it can save you some trouble . but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer , this ones great . Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space ! It cleans my bottles very well , and I use mostly avent by the way . It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds `` magic cups '' after he gets over a virus or if he had milk ( another product by avent ) . It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water , in my opinion . It also comes with 4 bottles , although my house is a bottle factory as it is ! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed . I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy , happy and playful !	1
This is one of my most used items from my registry . Originally , I thought I would sterilize my bottles in the dishwasher but someone pointed out to me that that would require running the dishwasher every day . Instead , you can throw your bottles , nipples and pacifiers in here as needed , and have them sterilized in 7 minutes . It is absolutely something I would recommend .	1
I bought this one as well as the full size counter version . This one was really helpful with pacifiers and nipples . I had a harder time with bottles just cause not many fit in it . But I found that bottles in the dishwasher and nipples and pacis in the microwave steamer were much better . In the dishwasher the nipples sometimes come out with the white dish det . film on it , of course in the sterilizer..not..BUT please do n't worry about being burned . Common sense tells you what to touch or not touch and honestly if you do it once ... you wo n't do it again.. Overall better for the money then the bigger one from Avent .	1
I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office , and getting my pump parts clean was challenging . Our sink does n't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe . Now , I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave , and I pump with the confidence that I 'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk . It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office , where I know they will remain clean and untouched .	1
This product is easy to use , works well and is FAST . . . and everyone knows that time is precious is a new baby . I use Advent bottles & pacifiers and they fit perfect as do all the parts to my Medela breast pump . I do n't use the sterilizer every time anymore since my daughter is a little older now . I run the bottles & pacifiers though the dishwasher so I feel comfortable with the heat they get from that . This sterilizer is great though as it is very light weight and easy to store in between uses . It 's up to you & your doctor whether you need a sterilizer , but if you do decide to get one , definitely get this one .	1
When we bought this , I thought of it as a luxury item , because you do n't really need to sterilize that much , but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water . Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day . So glad to have had this ! ! ! Some have complained about the `` condensation '' but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items . Shows it 's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack .	1
This sterilizer did the trick . We used Avent bottles and 4 oz and 9oz . You can get a set of 4 bottles in this thing and it only takes 4 minutes to steam ( based on voltage of microwave of course . ) I would recomnd this .	1
I love this sterilizer . I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time . This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles , nipples and sealing discs . I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away . When I 'm ready to pump , I load this up and 7 minutes later I 'm good to go . You do n't need to dry the bottles or pump before using , if you use them right away . When I 'm done , I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry . It stays there until I 'm ready to use it again . I 've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well . It is very time saving , rinses easily , and works very well . I 'm glad I 've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove .	1
I was told that I could wash our baby bottles in our dishwasher and I would not need a sterilizer . BUT we live in post housing on an Army base and our dishwasher is awful and hardly gets anything clean . So I handwash all my bottles and bought this as an extra step to help me get them clean enough for my child.I really like this product a lot . It is very easy to use and since I am using Avent products and an Avent manual pump , everything fits great in this sterilizer . I can even pop pacifiers in there when they fall on the floor . There are slots for basically everything and it all stays put when I am moving it around.I know that it is n't really necessary , but I like using it for that extra peace of mind that my baby is getting CLEAN bottles . Every parent has different 'must haves ' when they have babies and this is one of mine ! : )	1
On more than one occassion I 've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning , and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run . It 's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run ! If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product ! ( Or put it on your registry ) .	1
I love this sterilizer and AVENT products in a whole ! I bought a sterilizer because I do n't use the dishwasher at all , and well I just did n't trust it to 'sterilize ' my baby 's bottles well ( especially the nipples ! ) . Well I must say that I 'm very happy that I got this product . It is VERY easy to store and does the job well . Avent bottles fit perfectly in it ( as I 'm sure you already guessed ) , but it also fits all other bottles ! I use it to sterilize my bottles , nipples , caps , pacifiers , teethers and breast pump parts . I generally sterilize the bottles once a week , but if needed , I can take it out and sterilize her teethers , etc anytime .	1
I own Avent Natural bottles and this sterilizer was meant for the Classic line . All the holes and positions were specifically made for Classic bottles sizes.Of course it is still usable , though it will hold only 4 Natural bottles ( or 6 Classic ones ) . I use it daily for sterilizing bottles and pacifiers , and it works perfectly.Just beware of the steam when opening it immediately after microwaving .	1
MODEL SELECTION : There are two microwave sterilizer models marketed by Philips/Avent . The first is the SCF271/07 ( ASIN B001C3KXPG ) and the second is the SCF271/02 ( ASIN B000056OUH ) . BOTH actually contain the basic Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer which holds up to six ( 6 ) bottles or a combination of other items including microwaveable breast pumps , cups , etc.The only difference is that the SCF271/02 contains an ADDITIONAL two ( 2 ) of the 9oz/260ml Airflex Natural Feeding Bottle and Nippple.Strangely enough as of this writing , Amazon is selling the SCF271/02 ( the one that contains two extra feeding bottles ) for a much lower price than the SCF271/07 . So until prices remain like this , know what you are buying and consider it a bonus to have the two extra bottles.TO STERILIZE OR NOT TO STERILIZE ... WITH THIS MICROWAVE STERILIZER : The argument is not whether you should sterilize your baby products ( or expose the baby to germs as argument in strengthening the immune system ) because if you 're searching for a sterilizer and reached this page , then I 'm going to assume you agree with the sterilization process.The other argument in question is whether you are content with using hot running water and anti-bacterial soap or running a dishwasher and if these steps alone are enough to sterilize . Well it does n't help to take an extra step to go thru a short few minutes in the microwave . Again , if you 're in this page then you 've come to accept that this sterilization process is worth the extra caution.HOW MANY MINUTES IN THE MICROWAVE AT FULL POWER AND 200ml OF WATER ? 2 MINUTES @ 1,100 - 1,850W , 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN4 MINUTES @ 850 - 1,000W , 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN6 MINUTES @ 500 - 800W , 2 MINUTES COOLDOWNI 'm restating these from the manual because it 's important to ensure proper use . Too little water and you can end up damaging the sterilizer . Too much water and you fail to properly sterilize.Check to see the wattage of your microwave . The model number is usually a giveaway on this.How much is 200ml ? Your baby bottle should give you that info.Also remember to allow 2 minutes cooling time prior to unlocking the lid unless you want to be greeted with hot steam on your face and second degree burn or worse.HOW LONG WILL IT REMAIN STERILE ? The manual further states that the items will remain sterile for 24 hours PROVIDED THE LID IS NOT REMOVED . So yes you can sterilize in advance and leave it inside until you need it for the day.COMMENTS : Avent and Philips have consistently provided quality plastic products . The look and feel is what I have come to expect . It is well made and there are no rough edges or protruding plastic parts that may have not been molded properly.The manual will tell you how to position the items in the sterilizer versus simply dumping them in . The point of the sterilizer is to allow hot steam to circulate around . So incorrect position may mean not creating a good sterilization process.When all is said and done , this is a simple sterilizer you put in the microwave . For the low cost it is offered , it 's a small price to pay for extra security for your baby . Follow the included instructions and enjoy .	1
We do n't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer ( bottles , breastpump parts , binkies , etc . ) after washing with soap and water . It is easy to use , just throw items in , 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes . I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot . I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it . Otherwise , I love this sterilizer !	1
This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles . I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher , but I do n't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump . This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples . It 's ready in 4 minutes , which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher . You do need to prewash in soapy water , but I do n't worry about scrubbing . Overall , it does the job in a very short amount of time !	1
Must have for sterilizing . So easy , just 10 minutes or less of your time and your sterilizing is complete ! I use this sterilizer twice a day and it really makes the task quick and simple . Well worth the price of admission !	1
5 reasons to have the avent express micro sterilizer : - Reasonable price ! ! - It comes with an extra value of 4 avent bottles ( it says here that comes with two , but I just got mine and comes with 4 ! ! ) - Its great for travel , not too big , not too small.- Very very very easy to clean- It does the job in 4 minutes ! you can keep it anywhere because of its convinient size ( and its made of plastic ! ) * I used to have an electric sterilizer and as soon as I heard about this one , I got it and life with a baby it just became simpler than ever ! ! !	1
I saw this and just had to get it . It 's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool ! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week , and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I ca n't ever wait for the washer to run , so instead of waiting , I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it 's done . It 's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away !	1
I purchased this and it works wonderful ... however , we do have a dishwasher and I find myself using that to clean the bottles over using the sterilizer . I do still use in on occasion if I do n't have a full dishwasher load to run . This is certainly not a must if you have a dishwasher . If you do n't have a dishwasher I highly recommend it !	1
For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles , leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain . As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed ( thus more things to be sterilized ) , I found this great product and eagerly bought it . It 's such a great invention ! Everything ( pump parts , nipples , dome caps , bottles etc ) has slot of its own on the rack so they wo n't shift around . And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing , contents stay sterilized for a day ! Be sure to check your microwave power though , since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave , longer for less powerful ones . Even though I have a 1350watts one , I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure ! And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you wo n't regret .	1
This is a truly wonderful product ! I got mine on sale at a local Target store , and it included 4 9-oz Avent bottles as a bonus , so it was really a great deal . : ) I was pleasantly surprised to see how EASY it was to use this sterilizer . I tried boiling huge pots to sterilize all the bottles , pacifiers and breast pump accessories , and it took forever to boil and turned out to be too costly . This sterilizer accomodates all my Medela pump attachments , Dr. Brown 's bottles ( that have 5 pieces each ! ) and a few pacifiers easily . All it needs is 200 ml/7 oz of water and a microwave , and in 4-6 minutes you get it done ! Since it 's SOOO EASY to use , I also sterilize all my daughter 's plastic toys in it . It does n't take up much space on the kitchen counter ( in fact I store mine on top of the microwave since I 'm using it several times a day ) . The greatest thing about this sterelizer is that it gives me peace of mind that whatever goes into my 2-month old daughter 's mouth is clean : )	1
We love this sterilizer . It is quick , easy to use , and fits other brands as well . We would n't want to sterilize any other way !	1
I bought this right after my daughter was born and it is WONDERFUL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It is used in my house daily and has been for 6 months . Very happy with this product . Before I got a Medela pump , I used the Avent hand pump and used this to sterilize it . Now it is just used for my Avent bottles but it 's so helpful . In four minutes , you have sterilized bottles and parts , 4 at a time .	1
I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles . It is fast and easy and I ca n't imagine going back to boiling bottles again . A must have for working moms .	1
I have used the Avent `` II '' sterilizer found at other retailers . ( probably not much difference between the two ) I have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins . It has really been helpful cleaning non-Avent items ( breast pump items , baby bottles , pacifiers , etc . ) It can sterilize in 2 minutes ( depending on the power of your microwave ) . You do n't HAVE to have this sterilizer , but , it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher.It came with two small Avent bottles . I 'm not reviewing the bottles themselves - that 's another topic . However , this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not .	1
I did not originally sign up for this item ; it was given to me along with a box of 6 4-oz Avent bottles at my baby shower . I really like this product ; according to the sterilizer 's instructions regarding my microwave wattage , it only takes 2 minutes to sterilize and 2 minutes to cool down . I 've never had any issues with getting burned or anything melting . And all it takes is 7 oz of water ( I use filtered water instead of tap water ) that I recycle every 2-3 uses to avoid wasting water ( beyond that the water level decreases so it 's best to measure to make sure it 's still 7 oz ) .However , I have a gassy baby and wanted to see if I could switch to the Born Free bottles since several of my friends have raved about them . My 1 month old daughter is drinking 4 oz now , so I bought the 9 oz Born Free bottles and unfortunately they do not fit this sterilizer . She seems to be growing out of the stage of being fussy all night long due to gas so I guess I 'll stick with the Avent brand bottles instead of buying a new sterilizer to accommodate using a different brand of bottles .	1
I purchased this along with my Avent bottles before I had my daughter . Six months later this sterilizer has done very well under heavy use ( 6+x/day ) I quickly learned to use oven mitts to remove it from the microwave . It does get very hot . Of course that is the point - no heat no bugs killed ! ! Even got the hubbie to use it ! This is one of those items I could not live without.I have the Medela microsteam bags for when I am away .	1
solo viertes un poco de agua en este esterilizador , introduces los teteros y lo metes al microondas y listooo , ya estan excelente para darle la leche al bebe ... .	1
Pretty good . Sometimes the side containers pop off	1
I was using a basket to hold wipes , lotions , etc and keeping on the changing table . My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way . I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but could n't find one I liked for a decent price . This diaper depot is absolutely perfect . It hangs perfectly on my changing table . I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish does n't get scratched on the changing table . I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space .	1
We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers . It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy . Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that 's fine since we wo n't be using newborn diapers for long . I 'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we 're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage . We have n't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see . I 'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies . With the wipers warmer in the caddy , it 's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream . Other than that , it 's a handy product .	1
I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper . His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage . This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable . DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner . I do often have two diapers come out instead of one . Even with that issue , this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it .	1
This holds all you need and more . Great size , good quality and versatile . Worth the money if you are looking for something to keep diapers in on a crib or play yard .	1
I have an Ikea changing station and this works great to help keep everything handy while changing the little guy . It fits a Pampers wipe holder just fine . There 's not much more to say , if you 're looking for something to organize the changing station and want a practical simple solution , this is a great product .	1
Overall , we 've been very pleased with the quality of this product . It was very simple to put together and was very easy to attach to the front of our changing table . The top caddy easily holds one of the wipes tubs . The diaper caddy holds a variety of sizes easily ... we were able to double stack the newborn size diapers and easily hold several of our son 's size 4 diapers as well . The containers on the side are not huge and not very deep , but they are large enough to hold a few essentials ( i.e . diaper rash cream , tube of aquaphor , etc ) . It will not hold larger items ( i.e . bottles of baby lotion that are bigger than a tube ) . This is n't a dealbreaker for me , as it 's just as easy to store those items in a bin on my changing table . The acrylic is pretty sturdy ... it 's withstood at least one drop and a few accidental bangs and has n't cracked.My only one ( very minor ) complaint is that the clip at the top is n't wide enough to attach to the side of my changing table . It 's a bit inconvenient to have it in the front , but the opening only fits on the front ( which is presumably what keeps it secure ) . It 's not a huge issue , but it would be nice to be able to adjust it . Overall , we 've been very please with this and plan to order another to use on our secondary changing area on the pack and play in our family room .	1
For us , storage space is an issue . I was originally looking for a dresser top depot , I was unaware this was a hanging one . It actually worked out better this way ! Tons of storage space for all the diaper changing essentials !	1
Freed up space on my changing table as baby has grown and now takes the whole length ! Good quality product ! Just make sure your changing table has a rail for it to hang on ( see the pic ) .	1
I got this for my changing table and it looks great . i might get another one to put downstairs on the pack and play .	1
This is a wonderful product . I actually purchased it used from an infant resale shop and I am so happy that I did . Initially the diapers seemed a little small in the large container but I soon discovered that newborn diapers could be stacked in two stacks which means the container holds twice as many ! Now my son is about to turn one and his size four diapers are a perfect fit , we still use this item every day !	1
I was worried this would n't work for us . We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top . This product hangs at a slight angle because of this , but it still hooks on solidly to the changer 's top edge , and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top . It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem . Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there .	1
I like have this organizer , but on our changer ( attached to the crib style ) it sits just a little loose .	1
I am giving this five stars although it broke because my fianc & eacute ; put a lot of pressure on it for it to break . Before it broke , I loved it . It held enough diapers for a two-three days and the side pockets held everything else that I needed for changing him . It WAS perfect , I am tempted to buy another one , that 's how much I liked it .	1
We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great ! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy . The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed . The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes . We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it is n't a wipe warmer so it is smaller . We could n't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box . To solve the problem , we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the `` lid '' of the diaper depot . Great product after this minor adjustment !	1
I bought this organizer since I will use the pack and play in our living room for changes . I have the Graco basic pack n play and it does not have an attachment for diapers and supplies . This fit perfectly and holds everything I need .	1
It works really well for me . There 's plenty of space for diapers , my wipes warmer fits on top , and I have odds and ends on the ( removable ) side compartments .	1
i do like this product but i dont think it was worth 15 dollars . if it was under 10 bucks i may have given it 5 stars . it seems a bit cheaply made . however , it does hang on the side of my changing table nicely and keeps all the little items together . i have a regular wipe container sitting on the top and it fits well . the smaller sized diapers dont fit too well because they just slide around in the little compartment and often more than one diaper pops out when you just need one , but i suppose it was made this way so you can use larger diapers as your baby gets older .	1
I have this attached to the pack & play in my first floor . It allows me to have a complete changing station without having to go upstairs to the nursery ... very useful since I had a c-section and going up and down the stairs is not the most fun thing to do .	1
I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play . It 's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table . It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely . I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though . The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I 'm taking a wipe out . I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot was n't so wide , because when I pull out a diaper , about 2 or 3 want to come out at once . But all in all , this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing !	1
My son is huge and long for his age . At 8 months he was way too long for the changing pad and his feet were kicking off the products and wipes at his feet.I ordered this product and it got everything off the changing table so he fits now with leg room to kick away without hitting anything . Wipes are right there and we put a kleenex box in the diaper dispenser ( the diaper dispenser is n't great -- I 'm not sure how it works w/o you grabbing more than one at a time . We put the diapers on the shelf right under the table and put products and stuff in the lion heart thing.A MUST HAVE ! ! I love this product .	1
I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child . I loved it ! It stores a stack of diapers , a case of wipes , diaper cream , lotion , etc.- all within reach . What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby , they could clearly see where everything was to change baby 's diaper . Also , the plastic is clear , unlike a fabric diaper stacker , so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item , will probably buy it for myself now that I 'm pregnant once again !	1
I bought this because I am an Obsessive Compulsive - : ) I just have to have everything in it 's place . Love this item . Organizes everything nicely . My only complaint is that the holders on the sides are not big enough for your standard - big baby powder . I have to use the smaller 9 oz size .	1
A friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and I wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top . This was the perfect solution . Looks sturdy and I think it will really meet our needs ! : ) Here 's a link to the changing tray : [ ... ]	1
This product is wonderful and better than I expected . It is well made and I have recommended this product to my friends for the excellent quality of this product . It is a must buy and well worth the amount I paid for it . I am extremely pleased with this product and will buy again from this seller due to the quality of the product : )	1
This model is such a space saver for my small changing table . It 's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table ( make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put any wipe warmer on the top tray . Most of them do n't fit inside the tray . It just fits regular wipe boxes . And the side containers also do n't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion ) . I still highly recommend it though .	1
I love this product ! ! ! It is one of the few things that I knew I wanted with my second child that I did n't have with the first , and I have not been disappointed . I use mine on my changing table and it keeps everything so handy in one place . It is always neat and together , and I never have to look around for what I need . My son is still in size 1 diapers so I do find that when I pull a diaper out another one might fall out . This is a minor inconvenience for the organization that it provides . The last thing you want in the middle of a diaper change is to be disorganized !	1
This goes well with the new Prince Lionheart wipe warmer as well . A bit bulky but really useful .	1
All my daughter 's furniture is a variety of Delta Children 's products and we own theDelta Eclipse Changing Table , White . We already stocked the diapers , wipes , warmer , etc on the changing table and thought we were ready to go until our instructor at a baby class at the hospital gave us advice on changing our baby . The instructor said it 's a good idea to have everything out and ready when you change your baby , as sometimes they can be hyper or throw a fit . If you 're not ready to change them , the results could be disastrous . Another tip was to `` have everything should be within arm 's reach '' , as you will want to place one hand on the baby at all times.Upon learning this , I asked my wife `` is n't there some kind of `` side cart '' for the changing table where you can have the diapers , powder , wipes , lotions , rash paste , etc right there ? '' She said there was , so I looked to Amazon to find it . On a side note , despite registering for the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer , I 've learned that you never get exactly what you register for - especially on your baby registry . Instead , we got theMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer - Greenas a gift . That warmer itself is n't bad , but the compatible stand ( Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer ) is n't what we wanted because it has to sit on a flat surface ( like a dresser or table ) . Remember I wanted one that hooks on the side of your changing table `` within an arm 's reach '' There are other products that hook onto the side of your changing table , such asMunchkin Diaper Change OrganizerandDexbaby Nursery Organizer , Whitekind of fit what i 'm looking for , but the `` shell '' is made of cloth . Cloth makes things flimsy . I wanted something more rigid and heavy duty.That 's when I found the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot . This thing is awesome . Per the picture , it 's got 2 removeable side compartments to store stuff like bottles , cotton balls , rash cream , etc . The middle compartment is for diapers that you pull out from a slat at the bottom . The top part compartment is for baby wipes , which fits your standard wipe case . Although the Munchkin wipe warmer we own does n't fit on that top compartment for wipes , it still does everything we need to for everything else.Highly recommended .	1
For our first child we did not have this awesome little gadget . Just bought it for baby number 2 . It fits perfectly on the diaper changing station attached to our crib . No more bending in a hustle !	1
I like this product . It 's easy to fill and the side compartments are very handy . I have the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer and it tends to slip out of the top part of the stand . Also when you go to pull out a diaper of the slot you usually get more than one .	1
An excellent replacement for those fabric organizers that hang off of the sides of things , this is plastic , rigid . It 's a little weird with newborn diapers as they can fall out of the bottom ( the product is not exactly as pictured , the bottom is actually open on two sides , which is odd ) but it really works well .	1
I am a minimalist and do not like all the organizers that are insanely large . This one holds a lot but is not large . You can easily hold a day or two worth of diapers , wipes , creams , and lotions . I have been using this for 9 months and I love it .	1
I love this so much I 've started including it in every baby shower gift that I give . I was skeptical at first , but it makes diaper changes so easy ! Keeping everything in one spot is a must . We have one upstairs near the changing table and another downstairs near the pack and play . Wonderful idea !	1
We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table , probably because we did n't think there was a better option . I am so glad we found this , it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed , and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack . But if this was n't there , I 'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient .	1
This is a great item to have on the side of your changing table . I have both a diaper stacker and this . The diaper stacker is great for a decorative accent and storage of tons of diapers . The diaper depot is great for holding those diapers handy for the middle of the night changing . Also , the wipes warmer fits right on top in the perfect reach . The side compartment , they can come off , hold all the perfect necessities like Desitin and baby lotion . I held Alcohol pads in them for the umbilical cord for the first two weeks . This is really a handy little organizational item . It is clear so it does n't really stand out . I have two . One upstair in the nursery and one downstairs in the play room . I highly recommend it .	1
I was looking for something that would hang off of my changing table , out of reach of my unusually tall son 's ferocious kick . I was concerned about this because my crib is spindled , but it fits perfectly and is exactly what I was looking for !	1
I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table . I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it ( with the fold facing out ) , and they dispense just fine . There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets ... and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder . It is a little bigger than the space alloted , but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space ... and since it is raised above the depot 's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that did n't fit inside the warmer . This was a great buy , and I do n't know what I would have done without it . Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher ( 6 weeks old now ) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this .	1
I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features . I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part ( even from another company 's product ! ) which worked much nicer with my play yard . Still - this item was very handy . Note : it only fits on the `` front '' of a changing table or play yard ( the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides ) .Update at 1 yr : still using this item . A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on .	1
I received this as a gift and I 'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know . We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby . We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs , but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby . This solved the problem ... everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes . It also keeps our dog from going after diapers !	1
This is one of my most useful baby items . I hang it on the side of the changing table and it holds diapers , wipes , and diaper cream . It keeps everything conveniently close by . You can also hang it on the side of those playards that have changing tables attached . I think every mom needs one of these !	1
This is the perfect addition to our changing table ! It has just enough space for diapers , wipes , ointment , brushes , lotion , or anything you may need at your hand 's reach while changing your baby . Would definitely recommend !	1
This hooks right on the side of my pack and play ! Everything I need for changes in one convenient place !	1
Very space saver and affordable ! I stacked for newborn size diapers and size 1 diapers and it fits perfectly , even when I pull one diaper at a time , the other diapers do n't slide through it . I ca n't believe how inexpensive this item is that comes with a great quality . It fits very sturdy at the side of Savannah Shore Changing/Dresser Table . Definitely recommend this item if you do n't have enough space in your nursery ! ! ! !	1
pFits perfectly on our changing table and keeps everything nearby . I assumed it would also fit the same brand wipe warmer but it does not .	1
Perfect for organizing what you need on your changing table . It is not huge which was great for me because our nursery is not huge either . It held our wipe warmer ( which was a little big on top but it staid in place ) , diapers , and the two side containers held creams , nail clippers , etc . It is strong plastic and hung perfectly on the side of our ikea changing table .	1
This diaper depot is a life saver . In the middle of the night , the last thing you want to do is locate diaper , diaper cream , wipes , mylecon , tylenol , breast pads , etc . Even though the rest of your house may fall apart , this will keep your baby essentials organized ! ! ! ! ! Everthing fits in it great . Smaller diapers may slip though too easy , but bigger ones like size 1 and 2 are fine ! ! !	1
We needed something to put on the side of our changing table for our wipe warmer and this really was our answer . Although our crib is curvy and not straight on the sides it still holds everything just right . A must have if you have the prince lionheart wipe warmer .	1
This holds our wipe warmer and about 2 days ' worth of diapers , so far so good . However , the side containers really do n't hold much . We can fit diaper cream on one side , and our little man 's brush and baby lotion on the other . I keep hand sanitizer and lotion for me on the changing table between the pad and the edge of the table . Wish it would hold a little more , but it 's great to have the things it will hold within easy reach of our son while we 're changing him .	1
We got this in conjunction with Prince Lionhart wipe warmer . It is wonderful becasue it allows for the wipes , diapers , powder , and a rash ointment all to be stored at your fingertips . It also works well to prevent damage to your changing table due to the warmer getting hot ( which does happen ) . As for the complaints about too little storage ... we have a full sized powder , ointment , alcohol pads , a brush , clippers , and nail files in the side bins ... which is more than enough stuff.The only complaint that we have is the diaper storage . It is a weird size ! If it was just a little wider you could double stack little diapers . As it is , you have to single stack them and there is a ton of wasted space on the sides . They also pop out 3 at a time ... great if you have triplets but a pain if you just have one . It just needs a little bit or re-designing and it would be awesome ! But , all in all it is a great little extra that provides well needed extra storage .	1
it has enough room for about 15 diapers and a wipes container on the top . The two side bins are removable ( a little too easily if you ask me but no big deal ) and we use them for small lotions , nail clippers , the nose aspirator , and a few other things.The large lotion bottle we have and the large & # 34 ; tub & # 34 ; of A+D ointment we use do n't fit in this though so i have to keep those on the counter itself.This has a lip so you can hang it from the edge of the changing table but since we have rounded ( sleigh style ) edges , it does n't fit there . We ended up putting it on a drawer instead and it wroks just fine . Only thing is that the drawer underneath the one we attached it to does n't open ( the diaper depot gets in the way since it 's taller than the drawer ) . No big deal.I would recommend this - it saves it space and keeps us organized .	1
For the price you ca n't beat this item . I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers . This one is what I settled on . It fits my badger basket changing table just fine . I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in . I like that I can also for my small prefolds ( for cloth diapering ) in where the diapers go . They do n't fit perfect , but well enough that I 'm happy ! I paid less than $ 9 for this item so I really have no complaints . It serves its purpose !	1
I have no complaints about this . I did all my research before purchasing , ie : measuring the size of my daughters changing table ... and this was a great fit . She 's now 16 months ( yes just writing this review now ) and we still use it . Her size 3 Huggies diapers fit fine and of course you get a lot more newborn diapers in there . All her creams , lotions and accessories fit in the side compartments . Very pleased .	1
Very handy to have attached to the pack n play downstairs as our other diapering station . It even fits over the plastic attachment for the bassinet height .	1
Its great , it fits so many items , i fit like 15-18 size 1 diapers , wipes , bottle of cream , tube of diaper cream , lots of small staff ( hair brush , cotton swabs , nail clippers , alcohol pads , etc . ) it very easy to put it together , i never had a problems with it falling down or falling apart . Plastic is very thick and seems sturdy . Well this huge plastic thing doesnt look very attractive , but it super useful and clear , so u dont see it right away in the room .	1
I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station . I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it , because I ca n't velcro something through it . That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it ! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station 's side is , it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches ; otherwise , this diaper depot wo n't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment , place my wipes on top , and keep a few handy things in the side compartments . This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby . Otherwise , I 'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I 'm changing my baby . As she 's growing , I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that . Love it .	1
This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff . It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below . When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out . The side holders are n't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you 're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials , read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com . Good luck !	1
The Diper Depot works well with our Prince Lionheart whipe warmer . It 's ridgid , plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers . My only whish is that the hinges on the lid , of the diper dispenser , could be made a little sturdier .	1
~*My wipes warmer fits perfectly with this product . i also like that my diapers are n't exposed to dust while sitting inside the diaper depot . but it doesnt fit my graco pack n play straight , it leans . *~	1
I love this diaper depot . Prior to purchase , I thought it might be a little cheap , but it 's the exact opposite . It is well made with hard thick plastic . It holds the diaper warmer on top and the side bins are great for nic-nacs like diaper cream , nail clippers , brush , etc . It stores the diapers in the middle and has slots at the bottom where you can pull the diaper out from the left side or the middle of the depot . It frees up so much space from the changing table and keeps everything organized and accessible . We have a Graco Sarah changing table and it fits perfectly on the front . This was one of the best baby items we bought along with the Prince Lionheart premium diaper warmer .	1
I have a Prince Lionheart wipe warmer that fits perfectly on top . The diaper bin has enough space for around 14 size 3 Pampers diapers .	1
I love this item . I bought this as well as other items for my granddaughters travel crib . There was no place to put her diapers , wipes , creams , etc . The diaper depot fits over the the side very nicely , keeps everything in reach.This will also fit a crib .	1
I read in the reviews that this would work on a graco pack n play but it does n't fit on the side when the napper/ bassinet insert is in . Once my daughter outgrows the bassinet it will be fine and we still use it right now but it will be more useful when it fits . It does fit onto the end but sits at angle due to the curve .	1
We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard . It 's not a perfect fit , but it works , and it sure beats running around to get diapers , wipes , etc . I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1 ) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big , so sometimes an extra diaper slides out . In Prince Lionheart 's defense , this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2 ) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances , it 's a great product .	1
My sister got me this for my shower and I love it . I also own the ultimate wipes warmer and it clicks right into the top of this . It holds quite a bit of diapers for size 1 and I 'm sure as they get bigger it wo n't hold as many . I love having this because it 's right on the end of the changing table , has everything I need in it and is a life saver . I wish it could hold more stuff as some of the bottles of baby junk I got are a bit big . Other than that I love this product and would n't do without it . Great price too !	1
Like many other reviewers , we used this on our Pack N Play as part of a secondary changing station . It needed a little force fitting but worked okay . The unit has helped us keep everything we need for changes organized and ready . We 've had no trouble with diapers falling out as some have reported . Yes , the side compartments are on the small side , but they manage to hold a tub of vaseline , a container of Purell , a tube of baby lotion and a brush .	1
We had a pack n play w/bassinet and changing accessory set up in our lower living room instead of always having to go all the way upstairs to the baby 's room . I love how this diaper caddy connected onto the side of the pack n play and we could have everything handy .	1
There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables . I have it and love it . It is almost a necessity . Holds wipe warmer , diapers , diaper creme , hair brush/comb , some q-tips , powder , small bottle of lotion ... you get it . It holds the essentials , not everything you bought for baby . Both are great , but it depends on the type of changing table you have . Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did , you 'll love the `` Dresser Depot '' .	1
Love it , and it is a must in our babies room , but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer ( Lion Heart 2004 model ) does not fit correctly . To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer . I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course.Note : We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great , especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers ! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery 's theme	1
fits on my pack and play and just holds the junk you know , dont think i could live without this item . and i use the diaper storage as back up when my dh uses last diaper and i and elbow deep in poop , this is a life saver	1
This is great ! It fits perfectly and securely over the side of the changing table . I like that the side holders are removable , because I only ended up using one of them . I was leery about this , since it 's plastic and only cost ~ $ 12 , but it is AWESOME ! Also , I got it from Amazon two days earlier than it was estimated to arrive ( bonus ! ! ) .It is a very solid plastic - it is not flimsy at all . It 's easy to pull out the diapers one-handed ( from the bottom slot of the holder ) . I recommend this MUCH more than a hanging cloth `` diaper holder '' - this organizer is SO much more useful ! It also puts the wipes right there - easy to grab ! Highly recommended !	1
This is very convenient . I have it connected to the side of our changing table , which makes it easy for me to have the essentials readily available when time for a diaper change . Great purchase .	1
This was recommended to me by a fellow mom , and it works great ! I was worried about limited space on my changing table , but this has fixed the problem . Highly recommend .	1
This fits perfectly over the side of our Babyletto crib and saves a lot of space . There 's more than enough room for disposable diapers and they are very easy to take out and refill .	1
This is an awesome organizer that many of my friends use and love . My changing table and crib have sleigh ends and unfortunately this makes the end piece too thick to fit into the hook . I did n't think about this fact before ordering . Oops ! Hopefully this review will save someone else some time/money . Best of luck with your new babies !	1
It is just what I needed to organize my changer table . Be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top . Also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly .	1
we bought a second hand pack and play and there was no diaper caddy attached as some pack n plays offer . I ordered this , fast 2 day prime shipping , and upon receiving it , immediately tried it ( empty ) on the side of the pack n play . It fit and appears to be secure on the side so we can use the pack n play changing pad and have our diapering needs close by .	1
Our changing table has curved ends , and it still fits nicely on the end ! The top is the perfect size for a variety of diaper cases , and diapers fit nicely underneath . The little baskets on the side slide on and off , so you can choose whether or not to use them . It 's made from a nice strong plastic , though it would break if dropped like most clear hard plastics , do . I highly recommend it if you need extra storage or shelf space !	1
We have this at the top of our stairs . It works great ! It is obviously not he prettiest thing over a nice railing , but it keeps our little one safe and does not obstruct the view much .	1
This net does what it says . I do n't really like that you have to screw into the railing , but a child 's safety is way more important . It was also a little wonky to size down the length . I would n't say it 's too stylish either , but a person would be hard-pressed to find a stylish railing guard . At the end of the day , it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing .	1
it does what a net should do ... .we set it up on our balcony . Nothing more to add here as it 's a net .	1
We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA , they did n't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway . My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort ! They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal . Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words ! So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option . Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly . Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room . Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe .	1
i use it in my indoor round stair and patio stair . to keep my child safe when walking up and down the stair . easy to install .	1
it does the job , my daughter is discourage from playing with the railing since we installed this mesh & # 8230 ; . not the best looking product but there is nothing else available in the market .	1
These are safe no doubt.Easy to installShort ... So I need two to cover my relatively small balcony.No more toys and even dishes landing on innocent pedestrians .	1
we are in a rental home so needed to set something up that would not leave any marks or damage . Took me awhile to thread and tie everything , but was certainly worth it . Not the prettiest net , but it works and it is n't permanent !	1
Once you install this piece of netting , it really is a nice product . Installation , however , is worthy of an epic stress fest . The ties they include are nylon rope , cut into 7 inch or so strips . Pretty much worthless . We ended up using zip ties like some of the other reviewers and found that to work quite nicely for getting the netting taut . Along the bottom we did use their eye screws that they included . It would be helpful if they had more holes along the top pre-drilled so where your railings do n't perfectly match up you can switch holes one or two inches over . Same thing for the corner , we found there was a pretty significant gap of where the horizontal and vertical holes met , therefore the corner kind of sagged . We fixed this easily with a couple hand made holes , but they are n't quite as finished as the other holes . Like I said though , once installed , this netting is virtually invisible and has been complimented on by many of our guests .	1
Nice quality , fits well , and easily tailored to fit my application with little effort . Appear to be durable and safe !	1
This works perfectly on my banister keeps baby safe from falling through the wide opening . This allowed me to save money because I did n't have to pay a handy man to add more spindles to my stairway banister .	1
Let me start off by saying there is probably no way that I would install this inside my house . It is definitely not the most stylish or fancy looking safety net . But for the purpose of an outdoor guard it is perfect . My condo is on the second floor and while I was n't concerned about my daughter falling through I did n't want to worry about her throwing her toys onto the deck below . I did n't use the hooks and string that came with it because it looked sloppy and was frankly a bit of a pain to install . So I used simple tack nails to tack down the bottom trim to the side of the deck beam and along the top to the rail . The nails are nice and small and wo n't leave any longterm damage . If you are looking for something a little less 'attached ' then the twine they supply would work . All in all a nice cheap solution for a deck toy barrier ! Just make sure you get more than one if you have a long deck ... . one was n't enough for me and I need to get another one .	1
When my daughter turned 4 weeks old we switched to the Primo Eurobath Tub . It has been really great . She flops around a little so we have to keep a hand on her , but I am sure it will be better suited for her when she gets a little bigger . Better price on this elsewhere ... so be sure to shop around .	1
This is a great bath tub and fits perfectly in my bath tub inspite of its hugh size . Its has a lot of space for the baby to grow in . The only thing I was surprised is that Toyrus is selling this for $ 26.99 as the regular price which is definitely cheaper than what amazon is offering at .	1
We got this lovely tub after giving up on inflatablesSnug Tub , and a few smaller hard platic modelsFisher-Price Bath Center - Aquarium Ocean Wonders , Safety 1st Comfy Bath Center in Light Blue , andThe First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub.It has been really great for us : bigger than most , but still small enough to cradle your baby or toddler . My daugther has always been big for her age , but at age 2.5 and 40 '' tall , she is still using and loving this tub . No other hard plastic tubs I 've tried fit her beyond a year or so.The primo keeps the water much warmer than a porcelein tub does , which is good in winter- you really notice the difference if you ever have to bathe your toddler in a regular bathtub . You ca n't put much water in for safety reasons , and then it goes cold fast . The Primo EuroBath solves both of those issues nicely.I like that you can fill it pretty full for older toddlers so they stay warm and get to experience the feeling of a real , splashy bath ( with toys ) without the safety concerns and slipperyness of an adult tub . We try the big tub from time to time , but at age 2-ish , my daughter is still a bit wobbly , even just sitting in the tub and playing with her toys , and with the big tub being so slippery , the Eurobath feels much more secure for her . At her size , she ca n't physically slip and get underwater in this tub ( without doing a handstand in it or something ) ! I also like that you can place your child in the saddle seat end or the more open end . Each side has some support , with the toddler end allowing more movement but not as much as just an open plastic tub- the plastic pommel in the center provides a nice barrier to force her to stay seated.And speaking of staying seated : you kind of have to stay seated in this tub- standing up in it is a little awkward , which is good . In the big tub , my daughter constantly wants to stand up to `` just get another toy '' or different soap or whatever . In the Primo tub , she forgets to want to , because it 's just not possible or comfortable to try to do so.The only `` con '' of this tub for me is that it 's not quite as cushy and comfy as our previous inflatable tubs , and the hollowed out areas in the underside can get water deposit buildup and stains and are awkward to clean , even with the Clorox bleach wipes I bought just for that purpose.Everything else about this tub rocks ! I can see us continuing to use it for quite a while longer , until my daughter is a little more mature and can handle the freedom of the big tub . I just wish I had known about this tub when she was a newborn , as we would not have had to try out and discard 5 different tubs prior to getting this one !	1
We got the EuroBath when our daughter was six months old , and we love it ! It 's true that you have your hands free for bathing , because the tub fully supports even the wiggliest baby . Our daughter was able to spread out her legs and splash around , and she still loves it now that she 's a toddler . Although the tub is big , it 's definitely worth a little hassle , because it makes bathtime fun for everyone .	1
We got this bath for our newborn . Unfortunately we were n't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o . The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub . Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper , not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great . And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby .	1
My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub . I love that there 's the option to let them recline or sit up straight . While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself ( he 's 7 months ) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes . I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I 'm done . This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub ! I highly recommend ! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat , Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child .	1
I bought this when my son was too big for the sink at about 5 months . We used this for 6 months . I would hang it from the shower curtain rod with a plastic ziptie threaded through hole in the tub and then one of these `` S '' shaped rubberized hooks from the Container Store . After my son started walking and climbing , he just used it for leverage to climb out . I though that I would get more use out of this , but at 11 months it became unsafe since he was trying to climb out of the tub ( not the tub 's fault ) . So the eurobath was replaced with a rubber rub liner with suction cups and now he walks around the real tub .	1
Got for my daughter 10 years ago and continue to buy for friends . So easy to put baby in and wash them hands free	1
Keeps baby nice and secure while still submerged in the water ( those baby hammocks in other tubs do n't really work well cuz baby is barely in the water ) . Has two ways to sit - more of laying down side and a sitting up side for when baby can sit up . If you do n't have a deep enough sink for the puj tub , this works well for small babies too .	1
this is our 3rd ( and surely , the last and the BEST ) baby bath tub ! the first 2 tubs ( Safety 1st and Summer ) were nice but became too small for our baby when he was just 2.5 months old . wish we knew about this tub before , we would n't have wasted money over the first 2 tubs.excellent points on Eurobath -- 1. huge space -- width , length and depth -- giving the baby enough space to splash and play ( safely , without fear of him slipping into the water ) . depth of tub allows for baby to be partially submerged in water keeping him warm throughout his bath.2 . holds baby safely in place allowing me to wash him using my 2 hands . works great for first-time moms who fear and dread bathing a baby ! 3 . great anchors for the baby 's arms . these help mom clean baby 's armpits , nape and back without any hassle , while keeping the baby in place , secure and comfortable.4 . drains fast.net , this is the best-ever tub we 've laid hands on . highly recommended for babies from birth to toddler .	1
We bought this tub after our son outgrew his standard baby tub because we were nervous about putting him in our deep jetted bathtub . It 's been a great item and our son LOVES his baths more than ever . The way the tub is designed works out perfectly for our wiggly toddler - it `` holds '' him in place so that he does n't slip under . The drain is my only complaint - we use this tub by placing it in our `` adult '' tub and the way the drain is situated we have to lift the Eurotub slightly to get it to drain ( or place something under it to prop it up ) -also : the drain cap should 've been designed to open in the other direction so the natural water flow when draining would n't close the cap so easily . Two tiny prices to pay for a great tub - I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again .	1
We gave our baby his first bath in this when he was only 5 days old , and we 're still loving it now that he 's almost 5 months . It 's growing well with him and he always seems secure so that we do n't worry about him slipping around . It is a large tub ( almost as long and wide as our standard bath ) , so I do n't recommend it if you are looking for something easy to store . However , if you have a dedicated child 's bathroom where you can keep it , then this is a great baby bath tub .	1
I use this tub along with the Safer Bather and absolutely love it . While on vacation at a friends home I about lost my mind without this tub . She had another baby tub and my daughter was sliding all over the place . I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she does n't slide anywhere . She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water . I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child . I think every parent needs a safe tub .	1
After I read all the reviews here on Amazon , I bought this bathtub right before the baby was born . I had received 3 different baby tubs as gifts and returned them all and I 'm glad I did . The baby is now 6 weeks and I can say that it is a well designed tub.Pros : Works great for newborn and the baby can continue to grow into it . The baby feels safe in the built in cradle for smaller babies.Cons : Only downside is it is super big . I have to use it in our kitchen or the master bathroom where we have a large enough counter top . Make sure you have enough counter space to place the tub on . I would not put this in a regular size tub , ca n't imagine bending over like that is good for anyone 's back or knees.Overall : I highly recommend this tub . Baby is happy and safe .	1
I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here ! My son was 5 months old when I bought it , and he is now 14 months ... it works great for us ! He is just starting to outgrow the small side ( and he is very long for his age ) , so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish . I love that this tub is BPA free , and it cleans/dries very well . It is large , but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows . One of my most useful buys !	1
We have 6 children & have fostered several . This tub was the best we have used ! I have gotten rid of this tub twice thinking we were done just to have to buy a new one . We absolutely love this tub !	1
My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub .	1
This infant bath is huge ! We decided we 'll be hanging it in our bathroom out of the way , once the newborn phase is over.I think it will last throughout infancy and am glad we received it .	1
we like that this tub is large enough to bathe a toddler in . IT can be used for both babies and those that are old enough to sit up on their own	1
This product has been wonderful for us as we only have a stand up shower at home . For my little ones who are not old/big enough to shower , this tub allows them to take a bath with ample room . Other baby tubs they would have out grown long ago , but this thing is really BIG .	1
Like most parents , I try to streamline the baby gear I buy - if one product can have two uses or can be used into toddlerhood , I 'm all for it . That was my thought when purchasing this tub . The idea of being able to use one tub from birth to age two seemed very efficient . While I do love this tub , if I had to do it again , it would n't be the only one I 'd buy . While my daughter was about average length and weight at birth , I found she slid around quite a bit in this tub . She just was n't big enough for the supports to be very effective . I put it away and just started bathing her in the sink . It was only at about four months of age did I feel she could fit into this tub comfortably . At that point she was in the 99th percentile for height and weight , and she fit into the EuroBath very well . Now , at a year old ( and about 27 pounds ! ) we still use the infant/reclining side , since I love the extra help the molded parts give me while bathing her . We will probably transition her to the toddler side in a month or so . If I had known that I would n't use this tub early on , I would have bought a Puj tub or something similar for the sink for those first few months.Other that that , we love the tub . It 's big , but that 's a key feature . If you do n't want a huge baby tub , try some of the other offerings . The drain hole is fairly efficient , the molded plastic cradles your child , and the price is n't bad ( try Buy Buy Baby or BRU - both are cheaper than Amazon for this product ) . Remember to overturn or hang the tub up when empty so that it does n't get mildewy ( and it will if you leave water standing in it ) .	1
Agree with everything all the other ( positive ) reviewers have said . Used this for two kids . I felt like I could at least turn away from my baby long enough to fetch a washcloth or towel and know he would be safe . Plus , once they get old enough it 's great that they can splash in the water without having to fill your whole bathtub . It is really huge , though . If you have a small bathroom , anticipate having to store it IN your bathtub .	1
When I first got it I through we do n't need this until baby is older but since he is able to sit upward we are using this . He is a fast growing baby only one yr old but already bigger than many 18 months . We have five different tubs at home and both grand parents house plus a travel tubs . So fur this is the winner . I highly recommend this !	1
Big , but great tub for newborn . Kept my son , comfy , warm , secure and safe	1
I have had this tub for at least a year and a half now , and I still love it . My chunk 26 month old can still fit in it comfortably . It also worked great when he was much smaller .	1
I originally bought a Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad based on all the good reviews . I did not have any luck with it , was very hard to bathe baby alone so I searched again and came across this one . It is exactly what I needed . I am able to bathe my little one without any help . She was probably about 8 lbs when we started using this tub and it cradles her so nicely so I do n't have to hold her up or worry about her slipping under the water . She is able to kick her feet and feels cradled and secure up by her arms . This is really an awesome design . It is a really big tub though . We store it in her bedroom after it dries because there is no room in our bathroom for it . That is the only downside , but it does n't take away from the product at all so I did n't lower the rating . Would highly recommend this tub .	1
This is the only tub I have ever owned , and I LOVE it ! I 've tried other models when watching my friend 's kids , nieces and nephews . Of the ones I 've tried I felt that the molded ones do n't grow well with the kids , and the ones with padding , foam , or the slings never get as clean as you want them . I got this one based on the reviews , and none of those things have ever been a problem.It was a little big when my baby was a newborn , but I just lined the reclining end with a small towel ( rolled up a bit at the bottom to give her a boost ) and it propped her up perfectly . The grandparents did n't have a baby tub , so I had to bathe her in the sink when visiting . I dreaded it because I was so spoiled by how easy this tub makes bathtime . That free hand can be priceless ! I went so far as to bring it on vacation with us ( for her and the 2 other babies there ) - just packed a bunch of her stuff inside and threw it in the back of the car ! She is a year old now and she still fits just fine . We lay her back to wash her hair in one end , and when she sits up she can spin herself around to the other end to play . As a little bonus , now that she is mobile , using this tub keeps her contained . I am not chasing a slippery toddler up and down the length of a full size bathtub ! It is a definitely a big tub compared to other models , but do n't let that deter you . I went to Lowe 's and bought one of those giant , locking suction cup hooks . I stuck it to the top of the tub wall opposite the shower head . It holds the tub , and we still have plenty of room to shower . Our mesh tub toy bag hangs neatly out of sight underneath it , and as a bonus the toys are n't soaked every time someone takes a shower . ( The only thing with the suction hook is that if it 's not locked down the tub can fall , and when it does it is LOUD ! But - lesson learned - it only takes a second to lock the hook . ) I 've never used the drain . She is only a little kid - I do n't think she gets so dirty that she needs a whole tub full of fresh water to rinse . After her bath I just tilt the entire tub up to dump it , wipe it out with one of those Lysol or Clorox disinfecting wipes , rinse it and hang it up . The only real crevice to clean out is the drain plug . The rest of the surface is smooth so it wipes down quickly.Overall , I feel like this tub is easy to use , easy to clean , and easy to store . We 're expecting another baby and - again - we will be using this tub just as soon as this one can take a real bath !	1
Primo claims that the & # 34 ; Eurobath is the only bath tub you 'll ever need & # 34 ; . It might just be true ! When our LO was born , we started with one of the smaller standard bathtub with a net . It was ok while we used the net but quickly became uncomfortable for our LO . Now that we 've tried it , we wish we 'd have gotten the Eurobath right from the start.PROS : - Fits in our standard bath tub- Can be hanged ( we use a Command hook ) - Keeps baby comfy and safe for months on the & # 34 ; baby & # 34 ; side ( at 7 months old , 18 lbs and over 28 & # 34 ; , our LO still uses the & # 34 ; baby side & # 34 ; ) - There seems to be lots of space on the other side for when we 're ready for it- Empties fast and easily- Actually saves water because it 's so wide that there 's no water loss when filling from the tub spout- No mold issues- Baby loves it ! CONS : Have n't found any yet .	1
First , this is for our 3rd baby and it 's our 3rd tub . I love the fact it 's big . Now when I give my 6 month old a bath , I can do it on the counter not breaking my back doing it in the tub.It 's no frills , no toys , lights just a tub . I love it , it 's really big and very sturdy .	1
We 've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old . At first we used the infant position which worked great . We got this when he was younger but since it does n't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up ( maybe he would n't have cared , but it looked painful ) . After a year , he is still using it and fits perfectly in it . The tub went through a lot of banging , crayola drawing and stuff like that , but it looks great , and works like new . The stopper has never leaked !	1
This tub is great . Very well designed and extremely well made . My son is very big for his age and yet still fits in it really well . It is very sturdy and yet is light to carry and as our bathroom is quite small is hung on the wall out of the way when not in use . It fits well in the large family bathtub but also on the worktop next to the sink when my back is too sore to lean over the bath . The small plug is very easy to use too and means you can drain a little water to top it up if you need to . I love the fact that as he gets older he can sit up at the other end and I wo n't have to use so much water as the large family bathtub for him for quite some time . I have n't seen a better bath anywhere .	1
Liked the fact that it can be easily used for newborns as they do n't slip down and sink ! It 's very resistant and durable , the only thing I do n't like is that you need plenty of space to storage it .	1
I had a different baby tub before this because I thought this was too expensive . But my baby outgrew the one first one I bought so I ended up buying this one and I wished I bought this one in the first place ! The tub is large so it holds more water . My baby loves playing in it ! The newborn side of the tub is awesome . It prevents my baby from sliding.The toddler side is great too ! My son enjoys sitting up and playing with his floaty toys.Do n't be intimidated by the size . I have a narrow tub and was worried it would n't fit in it , but it fit perfectly !	1
This bath tub is everything we wanted in a tub for our baby . It has ones side where she can lie down and the other side where she can sit up . We started using this when she was 5 months ; she could not yet sit by herself . She is now 8 months and sits very well on her own . She 'll use the sitting up side for part of her bath , but still very much enjoys lying down on the other side . I was hesitant when I bought it , but now that we 've had it for a few months , I would definitely buy it again .	1
I have 20 month old twin boys and they didnt really use large baby tubs ( no room ! ) so I completely forgot how important this would be for my now 4 month old son ! Thankfully someone bought me an infant tub , and thank god its this one ! * The Eurobath doesnt leak on the counter , which is a god-send since it didnt fit in our double sink too well* Holds enough water to cover my baby* Has an infant side for babies who cant sit up yet ( although we put a little dishtowel there for extra `` gripage '' ) * Has a toddler side for infants who can sit up , gives them some room to play* Cute color too* Will fit in the big tub when we need it there* Cleans up very easilyBUT* Its really really big and its hard to store* Theres no support to keep a baby from slipping* it wont fit in the sink* Its expensiveAll in all though , this is a great tub and by far the best available on the market , really comfortable , dont waste your time buying a cheaper model , you will just wind up buying this one anyway , if you wind up with a good tub .	1
I brought this tub for my newborn . Great bath tub for babies because it provides the back support for babies . However as your baby get older , you may have to switch out of the bath tub since it does n't provide much sitting space for older baby . Great bath tub still .	1
It is a great bath tub for my newborn ! The side for the newborns in this tub makes them feel safe since the baby does not slips so easily . It also gives a good support for the head . You can actually enjoy to give a bath to your baby by focusing more in cleaning and playing with the baby than worring about finding a way to hold him to avoid him to drown . It really facilitates the bath for first time parents .	1
We absolutely love the EuroBath ! We use it in conjunction with the Safer Bather bath pillow and our 6 month old just loves bath time ! The tub is incredibly well constructed , with a convenient drain at the bottom . Whether your new baby is lounging on the one side , or your older baby is sitting on the other side , it is a safe , secure and comfortable way to bathe your child.Do not be frightened away from this fantastic tub because of its size . It is longer than many tubs , but you can use it for a very long time and it stores conveniently right inside your bathroom tub or closet.I HIGHLY recommend this product !	1
I bought this tub after my 5 month old son started to become too big for his other infant tub . A friend has this tub and highly recommended it . I am so glad she told me about this tub , since it is so big and he wo n't grow out of it for a long time ! The tub is roomy and the grooves hold him well . I imagine that this tub would be great for a newborn as well . We love this tub and highly recommend it !	1
Our 4 month old son outgrew the First Year 's Infant To Toddler Tub within a few months . He wanted to kick the water , but was kicking the plastic instead , which made him unhappy . I finally bought this bath . He tried it out yesterday and he was so happy ! He fit in the tub very nicely . He could finally kick and splash in the water . In this bath he can splash the water with his hands too . He looked really crammed in the First Year 's tub compared to this one . He stayed in the bath for 40 min splashing , laughing and cooing nonstop . No matter how much he moved , he stayed well secured.Great bath ! Yes it is big , but that is the point !	1
We chose this tub because of the molded infant side and the big toddler side . We started using this tub when our son was three weeks old , and he just seemed so small in the tub . A few weeks later , he flipped out of my husband 's hands and landed face down in the tub , so we discontinued use of the tub until he was about 4 months old.Now that he 's older , he loves it ! While lying in the infant side , he had the freedom to splash around , and I never have had a problem with him rolling over or anything- the sides help keep him from doing that.He 's now 7 months old , and we 've switched him to the other side of the tub . He loves it , and the middle core keeps him from sliding around too much.The biggest setback with this tub is it is huge . We keep it in the tub of our spare bathroom , and it takes up most of the tub . The drain is also inadequate- it is much easier to just pick it up and dump all the water out .	1
We had a Fisher-Price baby bathtub that someone gave us . It had a mesh sling in it to use when the baby could n't be submerged yet . That aspect of it was nice , but when we started putting our son down in the water , he was moving all over the place and sliding down a lot . We used the F-P tub for about 4 months.I checked bathtub reviews inBaby Bargains : Secrets to Saving 20 % to 50 % on baby furniture , gear , clothes , toys , maternity wear and much , much more ! ( a great book to get to research baby gear ) and found this bathtub . It is the best ! It has guides for the baby 's arms and legs and a crotch post to keep him/her from sliding down . Our son was comfy and in a reclined position . When he did n't want to be laying down for baths anymore , we switched him to the other side where he could comfortably sit up and play . We used this up until recently when we started putting our son straight in the big bathtub.For a long time , we used this on our bathroom counter . At some point , we started putting this tub inside our bathtub . He is 18 months now so we probably used it for about 14-15 months.Pros : -nice supports and guides to keep your wee babe from sliding all over the place-sunken areas for storing soap/shampoo-bigger area for older babies-recommended use for up to age 2-drainage holeCons : -BIG . This tub is huge-we had some issues with leaking from the drainage hole , but it was very little water so we just wiped it up when we were finished with a bath . It was about a tablespoon of water each time .	1
This is really a great product . We bathed our daughter in this from new born until 3 1/2 . Found it to be safe and secure as one side is more shallow for the newborn .	1
My newborn squirmed and cried bloody murder during her sponge baths so you can imagine how nervous I was to immerse her in water for her first real bath . I need n't have worried . The shape of the infant side kept her comfortably cradled and even when she squirmed she stayed in place , allowing me to focus on getting her squeaky clean . ( No need for two sets of hands ) . When she `` fouled '' the water , I used the drain to quickly empty the tub and then refill it before continuing with the bath . Since there is a toddler side I will be able to use this tub for quite some time before she transitions to the bathtub . Also the lack of slings or other cloth pieces eliminates concerns about the tub being fully clean and sanitary . My mother saw the tub and scoffed why would anyone buy a tub when they could just wash the baby in the sink . Then she saw how easy and effortless bath time was and she was sold . My newborn actually likes getting a bath now , hence I now enjoy bathing her . It 's worth every penny.Things to know:1 ) The tub is big . It ca n't easily be tucked away somewhere out of sight.2 ) The shape of the tub requires maneuvering to get all of the water out while draining since all areas do not have direct access to the drain .	1
I works great as it has 2 sides . Start on one when she was a newborn , but then as she got older , she moved to the other side . About 2 months into it realized that the plug actually suctions to the side on the tub , so the water flows easily . It is bulky though , so you need to have space in the bathroom to store it and to use it . The Primo sign fell of within a couple of months .	1
We decided to go with this bath tub after reading lots of reviews about it ... they were all positive ! When we received it via courier , we were happy with the quality although found it a bit big.Our daughter is 5 weeks old and we 've used it about 6 times or so . Unfortunately we have to use it in the bath tub since it 's so big which makes it difficult for us having to bend over all the time to wash her . We do n't have that much kitchen counter space so it wo n't work in that manner.All in all , our daughter enjoys it and seems quite secure in it . She 's not slipping around and she is well supported.PROS : -plastic seems durable , not flimsy-no foam/anti slip material in tub = less mildew , bacteria growth-has drain in tub-infant is well supportedCONS : -a little pricey-bigCompared to all the other tubs we saw , this one is a lot better in quality and function . I would definitely recommend this to my friends !	1
this tub is a little big , but it is absolutely the best tub out there . before my baby could sit up , it was a huge help to have both hands free to wash him . easy to clean and will grow with the baby . the other tubs out there are way too gimmicky	1
This is an excellent tub . I tried one of the seats first , which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable . Second I tried another tub , I wish I could remember which one to warn you , but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its `` no slip surface '' .Finally I tried the EuroBath . Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it . Its great for itty bitty babies , big babies , and even small toddlers . I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge . If you lack storage space , this can be annoying , but its definitely worth it .	1
No frills , sheer elegance in design ! Love this bathtub . I was looking for a simple plastic design so that the tub would be easy to clean/sanitize with no mold issues . The closest highly rated blue whale tubFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub ( like most others ) , while really cute , has a tendency to develop mold in hidden crevices . The PRIEuro has no crevices . I have been using this since LO was 2 weeks old . She is 4 months now and still loves it . It is quite big in size but we have ample counter space on the vanity so it works well for us . Looking forward to using this until LO is a toddler !	1
This is by far the best purchase we 've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs , and too big for most tubs . This one is perfect . He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath ! It 's very supportive , but at the same time , he has a lot of freedom to play . Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night , and he loved it as well . He sat up where my son lies , and also had support and freedom at the same time . It 's too large for our kitchen cabinet , but it works well inside a bathtub . I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent . Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it !	1
I got this tub on the advice of previous reviews and have to agree it 's great . It is big , I store mine on it 's end in our linen closet and set it on the kitchen counter for baths . My girls slipped around a little on the infant side until I put a burping cloth under them . The wet fabric helped keep them in place . My only complaint is the drain plug must have been stuck in backwards . The force of the draining water blows it closed so I have to prop it open by sticking a pair of scissors through the hole .	1
This tub is great for my 19 month old . We did n't really use it until she could sit on her own at about 6-7 months though . I did n't like it for before she could sit ... another option with more padding is better . I will continue to use this until she 's 2 ... it 's great that I do n't have to fill up the whole tub and feels much safer .	1
I registered for this tub after doing my research and reading reviews and have only had positive experiences with it . It 's the first tub we 've had , and I predict it will be the ONLY ONE we ever have . I have used it for my 3 month old since her first water bath and I have had NO problems . It IS a large tub to store , but I do n't mind since it makes our bath times so fun and easy ! My daughter just loves splashing around in it and it fits her little body so well that I do n't worry about her slipping out or off of the infant rests while I bathe her . I actually put this tub into our bathroom tub for bathtime - fits perfectly . When her bath is finished , I simply dump her water into the large bathtub to drain and store this one away . There is a drainage hole and pipe for easy draining if you choose to use it somewhere other than a bathtub . There is a lot of room for her to grow also - we 'll be using this tub for years to come !	1
We had a pretty big newborn ( 9lbs ) so this worked really well for us . I think I would be scared to put a baby littler than that in it though . It is a HUGE tub . If you do n't plan on keeping it in the tub all the time ... get a different tub . I 'm glad I have a basement because storing it anywhere else would be a pain.But the size is one of the reasons I love it too . Son really likes kicking and splashing around in it and I feel he is very secure in there . I love the little sections to put his shampoo and soap as well . I love the little `` out spout '' it has too to empty it .	1
Your baby will have support with this and can lay in it alone . This means your hands will be free which is great for a quick bath if your baby is like mine and cries during the whole time .	1
Wow -- where do I begin ? This tub is , hands down , the very best bathtub on the market . We bought this tub before our daughter ( first child ) was born . We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took . After 22 months of use , this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare . This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one , if not both , hands free . The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that wo n't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn . Our daughter 's very first bath was in this tub just the way it 's pictured here ( no infant insert needed ) . She 'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub . We expect she 'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday . Now THAT 'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter 's first birthday as a gift . We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we 'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top . To our dismay , we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small . We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions . In addition , the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter 's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap . In the eurobath , even at nearly two , she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys . She sits confidently in the eurobath because she 's supported so there 's no slipping and scaring her , and there 's no worry for us . I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she 'll slide and bump her head , etc . We 'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I can not say enough good about this tub . You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just does n't exist . Other tubs may have `` spa '' features or temperature devices but they do n't hold a candle to this tub . You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine . This is just the best design on the market and you will thank yourself time again , probably for two years or more , for buying this tub . We do , that 's for certain .	1
My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath ! It 's spacious and comfortable , he likes being in the water , other bathtubs have a seat out of the water . It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty . I love that it holds an older baby too .	1
PROS : This tub is PERFECT for my 6 month old . It 's nice and big , the water covers her whole body and she has room to splash and play with good support . She still uses the lying down position . We do n't usually use the drain plug , it 's light enough to just dump the water out.CON : For 0-3 months this tub had issues because it does not have the newborn sling . ( It looks like there are holes for one but there 's nothing to buy from Primo ) .Our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing . You just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing .	1
Bathing my infant girl has been so easy thanks to this bathtub ! I started using it when she was just three weeks old , and the contoured infant seat supported her just fine . She has never cried during her bath , even when I pour water over her head , because the seat positions her so that it is next to impossible to get water in her face or ears . She is six months old now and loves her bathtime more and more each day . She still fits comfortably in the infant seat and is able to kick and splash very easily and safely . She still can not sit up on her own , but with my assistance I have also moved her over to the deeper side of the tub so that she can play in the water . I can already see that the tub is designed so that a baby can sit in it with the bare minimum amount of slipping and sliding . Yes , it is much bigger than most tubs , which makes it impossible to store anywhere but in your own tub or shower stall , but it is worth it , because I know that we will be using it well past her first year .	1
After they outgrow the infant tub this is awesome . We had it for our first and got rid of it thinking we were n't having more . But we had another one and had to have this tub again . It will last well until he is 2 and works wonderfully .	1
This tub is large , fits in the bath tub , and works very well for our daughter . She just chills out in it while we scrub away ! It also has a plug in the bottom . But we just tip the water out in the tub once we 're done bathing her .	1
This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time ( just DO N'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners ! ) All you would need is a little pad to put under baby 's butt or back..everything else it perfect ! It is a little on the Big side ... so if you have a small place , I would invest in something a little smaller ... GO TO [ ... ] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller , so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is : ) Just nail it to the wall ( back of door ) like I did : )	1
One thing I did n't understand when I registered for this online is that it 's huge ! We lived in a small one-bathroom condo when I had my first baby and it was difficult to find a place for this thing since we had to take it out of the tub every time we showered.If you have a bathroom that 's just for the baby where you can leave the tub in there all the time , this tub is perfect . If , however , you bathe your baby in your own bathroom , consider getting the Sure Comfort tub that 's smaller .	1
It is huge and can be slippery but if your child loves water and loves to splash around this is probably going to be the right tub for you . Put a wash cloth down and , as always , watch them closely ! I will say , however , that after ordering it off of Amazon , I found it for a cheaper price at Babies R ' Us so check around .	1
I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own . When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more . But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water . He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house . As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive . Yes , it is a little large , but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering . Recommend it to all my moomy-to-be friends .	1
We did n't buy this seat until our daughter was 4 months old , because we were previously using the Puj tub . I only wish we had bought it sooner ! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic , made in the USA , and can be used for many months . One side has a cradle seat for younger babies , and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling . Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece , and loves that she can splash around . When she can sit up , we will put her on the other side . We will feel much safer putting her in this knowing that she wo n't be able to slip like she would in the regular bathtub . One of our best baby purchases !	1
I LOVE this tub ! The moulded shapes hold my baby nicely and allow me to have my hands free to bathe him properly . We have been using it since he was three weeks old and it still works well . We always lay a towel in the bottom to keep him from slipping around and for comfort . The drain on the side is a nice convenience and makes emptying it easy . The only issue is it 's size , but we found that it fits perfectly under the crib and we store all of the baby toys , towels and baby bath products inside .	1
just make sure to use a thin bath towel under the baby to keep them from sliding so much , only issue I 've had is that the piece for the leg split is too wide on the baby side , at four months my daughter still has a hard time having to sit there with her legs that wide apart ... it is just short of 4 '' wide on the baby side and not shaped for her legs to go over it either .	1
This is a great tub for when babies have out-grown the infant type tubs , but ca n't yet sit on their own in big tubs . This tub is huge , which I was aware of..it 's one of the reasons I love it . My son who is almost 8-months , looooves the freedom this tub gives him . He splashes to his little heart 's content . My only negative comment , is about how slippery it is . I still have to have one hand on him at all times because he likes to reach for things and squirm and he has taken a couple headers into the water , which he did n't seem to mind , where it gave me palpitations . It 's a lot of work to hold him in place while he 's kicking and splashing , while also trying to bathe him . I use a towel on the bottom of the tub to make it less slick , and it does help , but it is n't fool proof . Once he becomes more steady , and aware of himself , it will become easier .	1
This is a great product ! The tub is well-designed and comfortably keeps my 5 month-old baby in place while I 'm washing him . Our son loves to kick and splash in it.We originally had the Fisher-Price Aquarium Tub , which was great for our newborn - 4 months . After that , it became really uncomfortable for our son .	1
Used it for 1st time today . My 5 month old seem comfortable in it . We just graduated from that 1st year tub ( with sling ) since he look too big for the other tub.1 less star for the scratches and dirt on the tub when it arrived . But it 's good after washing . Well it 's a molded plastic . Nothing fancy . Very well shaped though !	1
My husband and I love this tub . So roomy and it 's very clean/sleek looking ! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age ! His toes would reach the end of the tub ! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars : It is not ideal for newborns because it does n't come with a hammock . From 0-4 months , the smaller tub was great for our son . It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink . This tub does not . If you have a smaller baby , I do n't recommend this for your newborn ! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up !	1
We 've been using this since birth for the past 4 months and it 's working well . I do n't really have a comparison point but no complaints . The back seems a little slippery so we put an organic cotton diaper on it as a little pad to make things more comfortable . There is plenty of room and I think we 'll begin to love this more once she is old enough to sit up . For now , we get through bath without any tears or falls and that is good enough for me !	1
Great bath ! Super useful and will be used for much longer than a typical baby bathtub . It is very big , but much better than the others available in my opinion . I like that there are two sides- one for a reclining baby and the other for a toddler sitting up . This is better to use than sitting in the bottom of what can be a very dirty bathtub and it saves me from having to wash the bathtub multiple times per week .	1
I really like this tub for my sitting baby . She still manages to swish herself around face down , despite the little barrier that sits between the baby 's legs . But that 's why you 're never supposed to leave babies unattended in the bath . They can manage all sorts of crazy things when left to their own devices.The only reason I did n't give this tub 5 stars is because the white tub develops a little brown spot where her bum sits . I clean her thoroughly with wipes before each bath , so I 'm not sure why this is happening , and she 's never pooped in the tub . I 've tried scrubbing it with baby-safe detergents , but it wo n't come off . It seems to be permanently stained . I 'm too afraid to try bleach in that spot , since it 's where the most sensitive part of her body rests in the tub . If I could have gotten another color for the same price , I would have .	1
This tub is the best- I wish I had bought it sooner . We had a 4 stage tub for our son , but he got really big and it did n't fit any more . I saw this tub listed in Baby Bargains ( great book ! ) and decided to try it . I never used it for my son when he was an infant , but you can put the baby in one way and they recline , then face them the other way once they can sit up.This thing is fabulous ! My son has a ton of room to splash around and play . In fact , now he hates to get out of the tub since has so much fun in there . The tub also has a spot to hold shampoo and bath wash bottles .	1
As the previous review stated , this is the perfect tub for a tall baby . Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows . She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room . It seems to be made well and is super sturdy , we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it . Yes , it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue . If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space , you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space , this is a must !	1
I do n't use the drain feature , so that does n't bother me ( other people have said it 's hard to drain . ) I love that it 's roomy and has a couple different options for seating . I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play . Actually , he can switch himself between the different seating options now ( he 's 8 months ) , which worries me a little , that he 's that mobile in the tub , but hey , I 'm right there watching , so I guess it does n't matter much , and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub .	1
This is a big improvement over our previous tub , which had no built-in supports - only a separate chair on which our son would constantly be sliding downward.Three places for improvement:1 . There is no stand , and apparently you ca n't purchase one . I built my own to elevate the tub 6 & # 34 ; -7 & # 34 ; in order to save my back . ( I do n't endorse this - a poorly built stand would present its own obvious risks ) . Plus I feel safer being able to reach the baby easier.2 . It does n't drain fully on its own - it must be tipped later on after the baby is out.3 . The middle support piece could be taller . For the most part , it holds my 6-month-old in the reclining position . However , the does a full-body kick ( like in professional wrestling to escape a pin ) , and has almost managed to throw his whole body onto the top of the supporting piece .	1
I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter . My daughter freaks out in the bathtub , and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure . I also needed a new infant tub . I really like the size of this tub , because it is huge ( though it still fits easily into my standard size tub ) . It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son , yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter . This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product ( the first time was a Primo potty ) , and I have been very pleased both times . I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker , but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use .	1
Newborns can be so wriggly & amp ; this product was a great help at bath-time ! Especially for 1st time parents ! The design holds baby in place & amp ; our 1 month old ( who is almost rolling over already ) stays put during bathing ! The only change to this product I 'd recommend is a foam liner where baby sits/lies . I went to a craft store & amp ; bought some for cheap & amp ; installed it myself ( used a towel as a 'liner ' the first 2 baths ) . Also , it is quite large for counter-top use but we made it work in our master bathroom , too big for the kitchen . Really a nice product , helped me feel more comfortable about bathing a newborn ! Update at 4.5 months age : I stand by my statement above in that this is a great product - IF you use it . I have taken baby into the bath with me more often & amp ; Daddy helps to dry him off when we are done.Update at 7 mos ( July04 ) : Using more now that he is bigger & amp ; harder to take to the tub with me ( wants to crawl in the water ) . Still would have liked for a layer of foam against the back , as said above I did my own !	1
I bought this when my 5 month old got too big for his small baby bathtub ( he was 20lbs then ) . He was a really big baby and his arm and legs were starting to hang out of the other one . The baby seat my mom got me would n't stick to my bathtub floor and would tip over . So I 'm so happy I found this . It worked perfect . Exactly what I needed . Super easy and my son had so much fun taking a bath since he could play with a couple toys . My son is 15 months old now and I have started putting him in the regular bath tub now and he does fine now that he has good balance and everything . He is 30 pounds now and for him if he leaned over the side he would start tipping the whole bath . But I think it 's pretty sturdy , maybe just that my boy is a big for age . Lifesaver for me when he was 6-12 months though ! And it still looks brand new now , so I can use it again for next baby .	1
My son is 7 months old ... we 've been using it since he was approx . 1 month . We used one of those `` bear '' shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny , but we 're still using this tub and we love it ! He 's now able to sit up and play in it . I can see we 'll be using it for a while ! It 's a good investment . It is large ... .you 'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom ! You and your baby will love it !	1
We just recently stopped using it for our 18 mo old just because she can now sit in the regular tub but this little bath tub was great ! Very durable and easy to clean .	1
I have used this tub for my two kids and it is perfect for our needs . We use it inside our full sized tub . My son who is almost 3 still fits in it and I used it for my newnorn daughter as well . The design really helps little ones stay upright when they are starting to sit .	1
We started with what I call the newborn tub and switched to this by 3 months . We could have used this the whole time if we 'd had it ! It is very large and fits perfectly in our existing tub . We used it on our kitchen island counter-top until about 6 months when my son was really sitting up unassisted . Unless you have a sink right next to a large enough counter space you will have to bail the tub a bit unless you are really strong . One side is sloped for reclining . Makes hair washing a breeze if your older baby will stay reclined ! My son no longer will ! The opposite side is a little deeper for older babies . There is a drain plug built in that has n't leaked on me yet ! Just press it in when setting up the tub to be sure . The stopper on the drain plug tends to flop back down making draining the tub take a little longer . We just squish one of his squirt toys between the walls of the recline and side of the tub and tuck the stopper underneath .	1
I wanted something comfortable , safe , and high quality for our 4 month old . This is a great tub for her getting ready to sit up on her own . It is big , and takes up almost the whole bathtub , but it beats the others since it creates her own bathtub . There is plenty of space for her to kick and play . It drains easily and easy to clean . For the price you will get your deal , especially the end result is a happy baby : )	1
This is the best baby bath tub out there . It is large , taking up a good amount of space , but when hung on the wall ( there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use ) it 's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath . We 've used it in two of the homes we 've lived in , and it 's worked great in both . I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo ( as we did n't have much space anywhere else ) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back ( and he did n't like lying down in the water ) . This keeps baby 's head elevated even when he ca n't support it ; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end ... Win win !	1
I received this as a gift . I did n't use it until my daughter was 5 months . It 's wonderful ! While you would never leave a child unattended - it does provide a great deal of support . I have a hard time getting my daughter out of the bath - she just loves being in there ! I highly recommend this item !	1
This teether is ridiculous . It 's huge , it 's hard to clamp down on , and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It 's just too big , awkward , and hard to push down on . Not worth the money , in my opinion .	-1
This product sucks . My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he 's teething - and he bites down hard . He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate . Very disappointing .	-1
My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it . When he finally did , the battery gave out nearly the same day . The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I would n't waste my money on it again .	-1
I thought this would be great for my teething baby , but the vibration freaks him out . He wants nothing to do with it . = ( It might be a wonderful product for other babies , though ! It appears to be well-made .	-1
Our 6 month old ca n't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own , so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth ( it 's also heavy ) . He seems to enjoy the way it feels , but it 's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so . Maybe better for older teethers ?	-1
I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it . So , when my new baby started teething , I sought out the same teether . I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is , `` safety tested '' for BPA , lead , and phthalates . It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free . As a former regulator ( of medical devices ) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements . Perhaps too much so . But , I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned , and the lack of clear `` BPA free '' labeling on this product gives me pause . Specifically , when they test it for BPA , lead , and phthalates , is there an acceptable amount allowed ? ! If not , why would n't the company simply label the product as BPA , lead , and phthalate free ? Eight years ago , when I gave this toy to my sons , no one had ever heard of BPA . My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths , and I 'm sure it was all riddled with BPA . But , in this day and age , when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous , I can not in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it . And , though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free , I 'm still skeptical . Again , why not label it as such ? Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that can not be confused .	-1
Do n't waste your money , my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether . The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work . : (	-1
This would have been an ok teething necklace if it were n't for the Star bead . As another reviewer pointed out , if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful . I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically .	-1
I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it wo n't fit on our Graco stroller .	-1
I received this as a gift , unforutnately it did n't fit on our stroller ( pretty standard Graco Travel System ) or on our carseat ( either our Grace or our Marathon ) and so it was pretty useless .	-1
We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This does n't fit on either one ! ! It was a complete waste of money ! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying !	-1
I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags , we used it the way it 's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it 's time to change the pail , and it 's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy . Also , my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper . Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in , this allows me to keep tabs on how full it 's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism would n't have allowed ... and still trap the smell ! Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid , something I could have bought for cheaper .	-1
This product is n't that bad ... however it is not smell proof . I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag , but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby 's room and it does not smell pleasant .	-1
Ok , so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome -- it is very easy to use -- that 's why I gave it 1 star . However ... the thing REALLY stinks ! ! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it . However , the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago . I thought ... '' Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I wo n't have to purchase any liners '' ... Well that was a HUGE mistake ! ! I see why this thing got 4 stars -- all of these parents have young children ! ! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older , I guess her diapers come with more odor ! After literally only a few diapers , her entire room smelled of poop ! I could n't stand it ! In one week , I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times . Is that really saving money ? ? I do n't think so ! Plus her room really smelled bad . I 'm taking it back & getting the Neat again ! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants , but you may want to consider something else for older babies !	-1
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite . I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ , but that 's the only positive in my opinion . I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor . When you 're changing the bags on the champ , it can be messy , depending on how long you waited to change the bag , but with the Decor , you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it 's full to the brim -- so much easier . I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot , instead of a hand like with the Champ , because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table , I need of my hands on him !	-1
After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend , we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie ( lid broke off ) with the Champ . What a disappointment ! Here are the big two complaints:1 . It 's unsanitary . Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess . Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work ! And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2 . The smell . It 's probably not as bad with an infant , but let me tell you , opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience ! Yikes , what a smell after just a couple days . We used the odor prevention garbage bags , but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid . Since nothing seals off the individual diapers , it 's just a sea of messy diapers in there . Yuck.On the plus side , it 's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags , not the expensive ones the Genie requires . And it 's certainly easy to use . But I 'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year , we 'll be going back to the Diaper Genie . It 's not perfect , but it 's much cleaner and there 's less odor involved ( the reason to get one of these products in the first place ) . And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model , so we 'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time .	-1
... ... all I can say is the smell is horrible ... ..1 star ... .. Please do n't buy this one !	-1
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke , I bought a Diaper Champ . I figured I 'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills . While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags , that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired . My son 's room smelled very badly , even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really is n't a pleasant experience . Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth ( nothing is sealed ) when you open the lid to change the trash bag , but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well , I 'm back to using a Diaper Genie , and my son 's room smells just fine . Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around .	-1
My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it . The cylinder continually got stuck , and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder . It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle wo n't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it . Plus , I think it is unsanitary . The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail , and then they drop through to the bag . Well , messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area , and it was not easy to clean . Finally , after two months of dealing with this pail , one morning , I flipped the handle , and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail . ( It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it , either ! ) I have n't been able to figure out how to fix it , so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now , and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week . I think that for the price , it should have lasted longer than two months . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it 's worth . Lifting my daughter 's mattress takes no effort : it 's made of lightweight foam . As a result , changing her sheets is also super easy . I just have to lift the mattress , and it takes two seconds . On the other hand , snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes ( plus , the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash , which means snap on crib , unsnap , snap again before wash , unsnap , snap on crib ... ) So , if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room , I 'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners . If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room , then by all means , try the ultimate crib sheet ...	-1
Was really , really excited to get these , then read what it is made out of , the very bottom layer is PVC . Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in ? Not in a lifetime . Plus , when I opened the package , it smelled of plastic . I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes .	-1
The concept of this product is good , but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap ( maybe they get easier with a little wear , but I have n't used it enough to see ) . Therefore , I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets ( which are also more attractive ) . I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out . Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily , making this product pretty unnecessary .	-1
at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet . if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band . baby could choke on it if you ask me . i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it .	-1
The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old ( 2002-2004 isn ) . Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft . Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product . I would n't sleep on this so will not use it for my son 's crib . As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says ... but I 'll never know since I 'm returning it .	-1
My sister recommended this product to me , and I wanted to like it . It is very waterproof ! But the waterproof barrier makes this not breathable . My baby would sweat profusely . We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper . If he was laying on his back , his chest would be cool , but his back would be hot and sticky . Or if laying on his stomach , his front would be sweaty , but his back cool . Basically , whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea . Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt . This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100 % wool mattress pad instead and could n't be happier . It was slightly more expensive , but it was worth it . Wool is a truly fabulous product : very breathable , helps regulate body temp , naturally water resistant , anti bacterial and NATURAL ! ! ! ! No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals . My baby stays dry and comfortable .	-1
The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib . I also did n't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets . So it might be a good idea if you do n't have a great baby mattress or are n't into decorating the baby space . At first I thought this product was clever , but once I got it I realized how useless it was . It 's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby 's crib , so I really never needed this .	-1
I measured the crib before purchasing this , but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib . Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed , so they just hung thee . It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard .	-1
Seemed like a good idea , but I did n't care for it . I returned it because it was n't soft . Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too .	-1
I bought this , put it on the crib , took one look at it , took it off , and returned it . I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it -- it bunched and would n't lay flat . Also the snaps did n't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure . This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment . My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I do n't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway .	-1
I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick , or has an accident/leak ... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons -- really doesnt save time , and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer .	-1
My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months , so this product was wonderful . However , by the time that he was 6 months old , all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs . The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones ( maybe a different brand ) for future children , but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these .	-1
This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet , but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet . You have to reach all around the crib to do ( or undo ) all the snaps , which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib . Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on , I think this might actually take longer .	-1
Yes , scratchy ! I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet . It feels like very cheap , low thread count material , not nearly as soft as most bedsheets . When my daugher used this sheet , she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head . It 's possible , of course , that these were unrelated to the sheet . However , both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer , normal bed sheet.Also , I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product , especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot . There is no way to tuck the sides under , as with a regular sheet , so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate . Keep in mind , too , that undoing the snaps is very easy -- so easy , a baby could do it ! The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous . Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these ? My daughter is now six months , and rolls around her crib . I wo n't be regularly using this sheet anymore . But , there is an upside . This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use . Snap , snap -- that 's it . There is no lifting the mattress . And it is waterproof underneath ( unlike a certain zipper sheet , I could name ) , so in an emergency you do n't have to worry about the mattress . Recently , my daughter had a stomach virus , diarrhea everywhere . To make matters worse , I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress . This sheet was perfect .	-1
I 've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them . I do n't hate them , but I do n't like them and will never purchase them again . The idea is wonderful , but parts of the product are too cheaply made . Within the first washing , some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet ( with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing ) . That was disappointing . Thankfully , it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function . However , it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it is n't very soft or cozy for baby . It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area , but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use ... it failed miserably . I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often . I wish I had been better informed , I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead . The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms . Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib . This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib , it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota ... One more additional note , it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer . Not handy or helpful .	-1
This product was pitched to me as a `` must have '' by all my mommy friends . It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents ( so we do n't have to put a whole new crib sheet on ) , but there is one major issue with it . The straps do n't line up properly with our crib rails , so it can never be totally attached to the crib . There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down . We tried over and over again to get it right , but to no avail . We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new , high quality one . We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet . This is ok , but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly . It 's a good idea , but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings . I would n't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend .	-1
I tried this out on my baby 's standard size crib , and it fit horribly . The little loops that hold it down , do n't seem safe at all ! ! ! And they do n't keep the sheet secure to the mattress . I do n't know how they 're allowed to sell these . They seem like a major safety hazard to me ! ! ! Total waste of money ! ! !	-1
If your child moves around in the bed and you do n't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss . And it does n't secure to the bed that well . I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed , not just a small section . I 'll probably trash it and get a better one , I do n't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad . ! 00 % would not recommend it .	-1
This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money . It does n't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change . I do n't even try any more to 'twist ' the bag , I just take the lid off . It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older . If this is all you can afford , it 's not that bad .	-1
Excuse me , ... but this product is so far from being odorless . At first , it was ( maybe a little less than a month ) , odorless then after that , ... there was nothing to get rid of the scent . I even bought some odor discs but they did n't work either . The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then , the bag can hold many diapers .	-1
My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags . That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail . The springs have been popping off since about the first month . My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke , which completely gets rid of the supposed & quot ; odor-free & quot ; feature ( which I found was n't exactly true either ) . Now that we are expecting baby # 2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one . My advice : Do n't waste your money . It 's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can .	-1
What a waste of money and more importantly my time ! This thing does not work well at al ! ! I ca n't fit a larger cable through it . PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does . You ca n't use it . So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and wo n't work . So this ended up in the garbage .	-1
There are two pieces to the outlet cover : back part replaces the outlet cover ( and needs to be screwed on ) and the front cover , which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides . The plastic side pieces are part of the back part , made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze . This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets ( it would not stay flush to the wall ) .	-1
Unfortunately you can not tell from the picture , but this product is not well designed . It projects far out from the wall , and can not accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong ( meaning non grounded ) table lamp cord . Anything like a power strip , laptop cord , etc , will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it . In addition , the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house . It also sits on top of the outlet cover , so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit .	-1
I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover. # 1 : The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover . They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me , I need to go purchase a handful of screws. # 2 : Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic , small , two-prong plugs . So what wo n't fit ? Our laptops , our phone charger ( Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall ) , iPod chargers , computer charger , power strip plug , light dimming plug attached to lamp , DSLR charger , baby sound machine , Verizon Fios plugs . Well crap ... what appliance plugs DID fit , you ask ? A lamp . Just one lamp . Oh , and the electric toothbrushes.Useless , sending them back . The Safety 1st units are square ( not pyramid shaped ) and hold various plugs .	-1
If you want to keep the plug in there forever , it is the best one . But the first time , you still need to open it to install . After you put it on the wall , it 's really hard to remove . Another con is the cover is too small , that I can not put anything other than a stand lamp in it .	-1
The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small . I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip 's cord up into that -- but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something -- not a thick wire . Also , it would n't cover the box of the cell phone charger , either . This is for very basic wires and plugs .	-1
I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you ca n't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs . I feel everything of my children 's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall . Have yet found anything to use it for .	-1
These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them . My mom and I each held a side and pulled , but nothing . I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart . Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off , I had to leave the latches pushed in , defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off . Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture . It 's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in . I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up .	-1
I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up . It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open . Yes , it 's childproof , but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all . It also does n't fit all outlets . I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they do n't have the sides that have to go into the wall , instead they protrude out .	-1
The only other cover I could find would n't fit my power strip so I ordered this one . It seems sturdy and does fit fine , but the opening is way too big . My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could . I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening .	-1
I returned this product due to the several reasons : - It is too bulky- I ended up pinching my finger while installing it ( do not want my child to do it since he will be trying to figure out how to open it )	-1
I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old . It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside , hard to keep things plugged in , and too big to hide out of the babies view ( not to mention that it 's bulky and a bit ugly ) . For the babies , it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands . They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it . Yes , the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip , but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end , I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary . It was just too annoying to keep using the cover .	-1
Really ? How could this possibly be useful ? I saw somebody else post that the baby 's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating . Really , I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier . The baby 's whole hand fits through the giant gap . Plus the thing is huge . Like almost as big as a shoe box . And really ugly . I do n't know what we 'll replace it with since the others do n't sound better , but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show . There 's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room , so I might as well just leave the cords as is .	-1
I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room . The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly , it is also easy to put together . But it has two big minuses:1 . Its height . The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs , so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not . It barely fits under our chest.2 . THE REAL ISSUE : The width of the slot through which the cables come out . MY TODDLER 's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly , so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord . What is the point of this item ? We just hope , at this point , that it will be a further discouragement -- and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest , we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in . Hopefully we 'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers . Although the toddler will be able to reach in , he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell . This , of course , would not stop him/her from turning the switch off -- in our case , this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed , among other bothers.In summary : buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall . And if you are planning to do the wall , keep in mind that this is pretty big -- like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall , only it is a solid , ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it .	-1
It 's funny how many people have positively reviewed this . Yes , it 's very convenient , easy to use , and fits well . What it does n't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs ! It 's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening . In fact , I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover . If I can fit my hand in there , so can a child . And it does n't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there . This product is , in a word , worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets , or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip . But please do n't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks .	-1
This fits a very specific style of power strip . Fully straight , single row .	-1
Seriously , I just got this , and this product is not worth a single penny . It is too bulky and gets in the way . Even when it is on its smallest setting ! Not just that , but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through , but the gap is so big , my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them .	-1
To bulky , not what I expected or needed . Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area . Would not buy again .	-1
This powerstrip cover is pointless . Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked .	-1
These are a great idea but did n't work for me . Our cords are thick and long and would n't fit inside the box .	-1
Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds . It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords ... DEAD ! ! ! It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS ! ! ! But if you must keep your corded blinds , get the Fashion Wand ( approved by PFWBS ) . Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety ( PFWBS ) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords . Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds . And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether .	-1
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter , when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer . I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck . Terrifying . Although these do pop open easily , they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child 's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw . From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these !	-1
This product is useless . After installed , I could still open the oven door with my pinky finger . The directions were also unclear and the picture does n't match the product .	-1
This item wo n't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive wo n't stick to the sides . Also , it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven .	-1
My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort . I would not recommend it .	-1
I do not reccomend this product at all ! It did not stick well , and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door !	-1
This product is a great concept , BUT it has a critical flaw for me . The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter . I mean , why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers ? Hello ? Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed . What about those holes ? It is cute that the manual says `` do not drill through the door , '' hugh ? Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors ? Also , what happens if say the door cracks while I drill ? Who pays for that ? I know the answer to that one - > ME ! Soooo ... .product is going back . Non-starter	-1
This sounded good in theory , but did n't work at all . They were correctly installed by my husband , but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open . It was a waste of money for our cabinets . It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets , but it definitely did n't work through our solid wood cabinets .	-1
On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off . If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention , my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt . To add salt to the wound , I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller . The first email asked me to describe the defect . I responded to the email . After which , I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item ; SERIOUSLY ! 1 . Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it ? 2 . If I described the defect as a sliver of metal , the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item , as a sliver denotes a very small piece , so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like . 3 . If the seller needed a picture , this should have been requested in the first email , not in a second email . I shop online because I have limited time . I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $ 3 nail clip . However , I am so irritated with the product and the seller 's response that I decided to write this review . In addition , my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed !	-1
These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago . I tried to trim my 3 month old son 's nails , granted he is the fidgeting type . Just as I was about to clip one of his nails , he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger . His finger bled , my son cried and I panicked . Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage . But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company . They are VERY safe . I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents . I shudder to think of using nail clippers again , especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails .	-1
this thermometer is pretty consistent , but the nipple is too large for young babies . after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers !	-1
The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I do n't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just would n't like it . I 've tried this in my mouth , it is n't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done , this was over 2 minutes so I do n't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them . I 've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out , even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue , they HATE it . My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I 've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally , it IS very easy and the most accurate . I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp . If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature . I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality , they just do n't work and I 'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing .	-1
My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers . I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong ... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things ... this was one of them . No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his ( her ) pacifier that he ( she ) loves and always uses . Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately , its too heavy . Especially if the baby is not feeling well . Do n't buy this . Get a real thermometer .	-1
I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift . I just do n't think baby is comfortable in it . His leg was all scrunched up , his head fell to one side ( unpadded , by the way ) , and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it 's a small round thing . Anyway , before I had the baby , I bought my husband a bath head cushion ( the kind you blow up ) from Target which he never used ( too girly I guess ) . Turns out it is the perfect cushion ( it has suction cups ) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths . It has grooves so baby 's head does n't flop everywhere . I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body . The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back . He just lies on the soft terry cloth . It 's perfect .	-1
I am sorry I bought this tub . It is very uncomfortable for my daughter . Used it since she was about 3 weeks old . I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it 's uncomfortable . Also , there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain ! It 's way too small . She 's now 4.5 mos and I 'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it . And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug - it 's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I 've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger , nicer , more comfortable , and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes .	-1
This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done . However : -it does not hold a lot of water , so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is : -it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap , wash cloth , or toys	-1
I bought this tub before my son was born , thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink . I do like that I can use it in the sink , but he 's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds ! It does n't hold much water , either . I wish I had read reviews before I bought it , because now , after only 2 months , I 'm just going to replace it and throw it away . What a waste !	-1
If you are really , really , REALLY hard pressed for space , then maybe this tub is for you ... except that you 'll only use it for 3 months because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space . As with most tubs , this holds maybe a quart of water , which means , only babies bum is wet , how fun is that . And as soon as baby can sit , that is if she has n't outgrown this small tub by then , she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at . Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink : I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years -- my baby is a year old and I still use it ( she is petite , but I 'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it . )	-1
I got this as a shower gift . The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub . She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again . I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption . I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here . I currently put her on the safer bather ( read my review ) or put her in the tub alone . Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year ... ..	-1
I bought this tub without doing any research on it . I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby . Well , I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning . Also , I have yet to get it to shrink , so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time . The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller , but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick . However , that causes him to slide down the sling and it 's quite hard where the sling ends , so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back . Also , it just does n't seem to hold water . I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out . All in all , I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks , I am getting another one .	-1
I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby 's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick . Unfortunately , it does n't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet . Leaks horribly , bulky - we gave up , returned it , and now we just bath with baby . Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway , and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub .	-1
We 've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old . I have not had any problems with the tub leaking . But like I said , we 've only used it a handful of times . I definately do n't think this tub is appropriate for small babies . The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body . It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help . It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub . I would n't recommend this tub for small babies .	-1
I hate this tub ! ! ! It leaks everywhere . I do not recommend buying this item	-1
Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open ! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want ! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child . And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly . Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day ... .got another brand ... .	-1
I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it . I followed all the directions , I was very careful and patient with this tub , I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom . The design idea was good but it just is n't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly . The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring is n't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub . No matter how hard I work it 's impossible to keep this tub clean .	-1
This was terrible . It leaked all over the place . Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped . Save your money & buy the cheap $ 10 one that 's one piece .	-1
I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath , I found this tub is not very easy to use . My husband and I coudl n't solve the leaking issue . It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good , either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it . I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead . I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born . It is very easy to put over my sink . The green net comes with the tub is easy to use .	-1
I 've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago . There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling . I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub . I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there was n't enough cushioning for his head and bottom . My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub .	-1
70 % of the time , the tub does n't leak . The 30 % that it does leak , however , is a fiasco . Here 's how it happens : Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are `` clicked '' into place ( and yes , we did read the instructions ) we fill the tub . Once we finish bathing her , we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain . It is at this point that by moving the tub , the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub , it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks ... .all over the hardwood floors . And let me tell you , it is n't easy to remedy this while holding a wet , squirmy baby . Mothers ( and fathers ) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess . My husband , an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal . Look at it ! Meanwhile , we 're shopping for a different type of tub . We cuss too much using this one .	-1
I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks . This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week . I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water . So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i do n't have to worry about all the leaks . Really , who wants a tub that leaks ? ? ? ? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub ... .so we are in an awkward transition phase . a phase that this tub does n't suitably deal with . I would n't buy this tub .	-1
I registered for this and got it home and put it together . It didnt seem to fit together right . I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on . Much better . less $ $ and easy to use .	-1
It leaks every time I use it . It 's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size . I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it . I love the sling , but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it . If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside , it would probably be easier ( but I do n't think my knees would appreciate it . I received this as a gift and did n't check the reviews before using , I should have . I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk . Buy at your own risk .	-1
this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it , which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up . couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily - i gave myself more than one bruise ( due to pinched skin ) when trying to open and close it . also , by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months , she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub , but rec 'd this . preferred the euortub by far !	-1
Enough said .	-1
My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old . In the beginning , we used the infant sling , but my baby would constantly slip down into the water . We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping , but we still had to readjust him quite frequently . When he learned to sit on his own , we tried using the bath seat feature . He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring , thus painfully squishing his private parts . We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him , but we managed . Now he twists and turns and wo n't stay put in the tub . I have thought about buying a better tub , but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub , I do n't want to spend the money . Please consider buying something different for your baby . I will not be using this tub for my next child .	-1
I was never fond of this even with the first use . The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby . When i moved to the bath ring it 's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around . It does n't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub . The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this is n't needed .	-1
I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years . Well , first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub , because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface . Most tubs are non-slip , that 's what the little bumps are for in your tub . This was fine though , I planned to use it on our kitchen counter . No matter how hard I pressed on the middle `` locking '' device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor . This tub is more trouble than it 's worth !	-1
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower . I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub . Wrong ! ! First of all , the tub leaks . You can not let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide . My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy . The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves . I would n't recommend this to anyone .	-1
I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great , BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock . I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby does n't have far to slide down . Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we do n't need the hammock .	-1
This tub was the worst ! Talk about making your job harder than it already is ! It leaks , the sling hardly stays in place , it takes up so much space , and you have to use it in the tub anyways . It is more trouble than it is worth .	-1
DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB . IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB , YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM	-1
We registered for this tub , before doing any research . Big mistake . As a newborn , I used the sling to bathe my son . As he got bigger , I put the sling into the tub ( 2nd way of the 4-1 system ) . Bath time became a pain . My son kept sliding down , even with one hand on him at all times . He did n't really seem to enjoy it either . Finally , after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath . LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! From day one my son had a great time in his new ( huge ) tub . He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub , with no slipping . He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash . We 've had it over a month , I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub .	-1
This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used . It is impossible to get folded and unfolded . When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling . My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water . She is now to big for the sling , but to small to sit up in the ring . I gave it a fair try , but I had to go out and buy another bath . It seems like a great concept , but it is really just a waste of [ money ] .	-1
I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling , but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up , we tried the sitting position . But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him . I would not recommend this bath tub . There are other tubs with slings that are much better .	-1
this is the worst bath tub i 've bought . i returned this item right away . it leaks . once i pulled it out to be longer but , no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together , it just would n't click . when i pressed it to lock the extension , i could n't tell whether it locked or not , so then i put water to test the lock system . the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now , i bought the Euro bath . it does a good job .	-1
This tub is okay , but not the best there is . Our son is 3 months old and fairly long , 25 inches . He ca n't sit on is own yet , so has to lay on the sling . He loves to kick and splash and does n't have the room he needs . He also slips down the sling frequently . There 's got to be something better ...	-1
Who is very chatty and outgoing . He 's five months old now . It startles him and made him cry a few times . Decided it was a bit too 'manic ' for him . Maybe when he 's a bit older .	-1
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo , and it is a great toy ... My 1yo & 3yo love it . BUT it has an issue with batteries ! When it arrived ( with included batteries in a `` try me '' box ) , the batteries were dead . It 's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week . When it begins getting low on power , the music sounds warped , like an old warped record , which is dreadful ! Perhaps we got a defective one . I do n't know . I hope this is n't happening to others .	-1
This thing as so loud and piercing . My son does n't really care for it . It 's heavy for a baby to hold and does n't really do much .	-1
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys . I had high hopes but my little boy just does n't seem interested . We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat . He is now almost 14 months and does n't really play with it unless he is prompted by me . Even then he 'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it . This thing is heavy for a little person and I 'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors . I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it .	-1
We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com , which showed a picture of an older model , not the new `` upgraded '' toy . The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar . The `` music '' is tinny and unattractive . Apparently , the older model had better sound quality , which is why I went with this vendor . However , communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle . The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer . I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners ( the older model ) or buying it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it . If you are going to purchase on Amazon , consider another vendor . Very disappointed . I will not do business with this vendor again .	-1
I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children . I never saw any of them properly engage with it . They 'd pull it out , bang it a couple of times ( starting up 2 different sounds ) and then get bored and crawl away . It was the one toy I knew I 'd never buy for my children .	-1
The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months , but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same . How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments ? I guess they do n't have actual instruments in China .	-1
I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin . The sound difference is amazing . I 've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries . Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one ( even if it 's used ) . I got mine on ebay .	-1
My children ( an infant and a preschooler ) like this toy -- but it is WAY too loud . I wish there was a way to turn the volume down . I 'd return this if I purchased it at a store , but it 's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon . So sad .	-1
The musical sounds do n't sound like the real instruments , they just sound like a cheap toy . Also , I thought each instrument would play its own melody , how it would in a real orchestra . For example , the horn would play the background , the flute a lighter melody , then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed . But really , each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument . I was really disappointed , and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center . The ones on that toy are really neat .	-1
So , first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them ( but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners ) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes . To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once , which I find annoying . Overall my LO does n't seem too interested in it just yet .	-1
I love that there is an off switch , and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on . My baby received this as a Christmas gift , and she likes it quite a bit , hence the second star . But why , oh why , did n't they put a volume switch on this thing though ? ! My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister , and it is ok for the first few minutes , but it is so darned LOUD , I 'm practically loosing my mind . I have to take it away , so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere ? As for good points , there are lots of colors obviously , and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang . The individual instruments do n't REALLY sound authentic , but it was a nice try . The musical arrangement was a nice choice , too . But please MUNCHKIN , for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift , put a volume control on it ! ! ! If you are looking for a great gift for a parent , seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin ' Pals ( Colors May Vary ) , it 's lasted through 3 kids , six years , and still going strong . It 's nice and quiet , too .	-1
Too loud . Too hard . Buttons do n't depress easily or distinctly . My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard ( ! ) unpadded edges . The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners ? ? ? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old . She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object . Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds . Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube	-1
This music cube is a great idea , but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible . The violin does n't sound at all like a violin . Overall it 's very tinny and hard to listen to .	-1
Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up . Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them . Given the age that a kid outgrows this , you wo n't have much use for this very long .	-1
I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones ! If your kid is like mine , however , and likes to sit on the potty `` unproductively '' you might want to consider something a little more comfortable . The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside . While your child is sitting , the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child 's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic . Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting . Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have , it also has a tendency to slip around . I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it would n't fall into the toilet with a toddler 's wiggling around . You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot .	-1
We have an elongated toilet and I do n't know of anyway to hold this seat in place . My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back , the whole seat goes with her . So when she pees , it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess .	-1
this is a good toilet ring , but ONLY if you have the smallest , round toilet seats . the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit , but it 'll also slide around and leave large gaps . my home has a mix of elongated/round seats , and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls . we use that for our elongated seats , and this ring for the tiny toilet that 's in the hallway . otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you 're trying to toilet train .	-1
My daughter liked the seat she had ( Primo Ducka ) but really wanted a seat with handles for pooping . This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I did n't mind buying another seat.Yes , it `` fits '' elongated toilets . But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps , no pegs , no rubber feet , nothing ! Every time my daughter tried to sit down , the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard . If I start with the little seat as far back as possible , it 's too far for her to get on without help ( she 's nearly 3 ! ) and once on , her feet do n't touch her fairly tall step stool . It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it wo n't stay there . So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on . Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and `` do it herself '' .Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place , the biggest complaint starts . This thing collects pee . The little pee guard is pointless . From what I 've seen pee guards are needed by some kids , not by others - regardless of sex . My daughter needs one - a decent one . This one just deflects her pee all over the seat , the floor , her pants , her shoes . In short , a drippy , nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry . I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles . Fine . I 've added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat . She 's pleased . This piece of junk went in the trash .	-1
Really , how hard can it be to design one of these things ? This fails for two basic reasons:1 ) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down . This is an enormous design flaw.2 ) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat , so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate ? It takes away room for daughters ' pee to go down . And it 's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter did n't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby 's head . He was not pleased . Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties , the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky . The pee guard on the froggy potty is great . I love this low-tech seat as it 's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters ' favorite . The singing duck potty was more expensive , is much harder to clean , is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby , and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard . Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market .	-1
Not good quality and did n't fit my toilet . I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that .	-1
We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it . Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not . It had no handles then , and the pee guard stood up high and was removable . We never used the pee guard , it made it harder to get on the seat and it just was n't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more ( one shows way more interest than the other - it 's the reluctant one I want to bribe ) We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I 'm willing to try anything at this point , within reason . ( ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much , LOL , and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert ) The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE . It 's a very low pee guard . Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy , but it 's there , and it 's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it was n't there . ( One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem , but with this in the way , it would be ) And it does not come off . I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow , maybe with a dremmel , but you should n't have to make modifications to a potty ring . It 's one of the worst designs I can imagine . It 's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder . So I decided to skip this . Even if we were to have marginal success with it , I am pregnant with another boy now , and I refuse to buy something I know he wo n't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son 's potty ring when we lost it , but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item . No handles made it easier to travel with . We kept it in our diaper bag . Now I am in the market for a used potty ring !	-1
A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent . I sent it back to Amazon immediately . My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora !	-1
My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty , but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model . He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it . We also bought the Primo Ducka . He will sit on that seat all day if you let him . This might be a good choice for parents of girls .	-1
I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo . If I had noticed it was evenflo , I wouuld not have wasted my time . It was a pain to install . Total PAIN . Then , when it 's unlocked , it slides for adjustment . The thing is , there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm . We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that . IF we had known about the second risk , we would have just taken it down then . THe next morning , it was kid tested . Yeah , all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward . So far , I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position . MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD . Not to mention broken bones . The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes , when you go to unlock it , sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot . I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open . Also , the gate now leans . When opened , it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate . Not sure how that came about . We have had this gate for a couple of months . My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling . My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break . Not a good gate at all . Evenflo just needs to stop . Every product I have had has been crap . I am afraid to buy their carseats . If they ca n't make a good simple baby gate , I would n't trust my child 's life to their carseats . We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks .	-1
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates . Within one week , our 13 month old broke two of the gates . Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom . This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up ( which of course we did n't . )	-1
Update : 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use . It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands . I 've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it . So , if you buy it , try rubbing some wax , or something , on it to help in the beginning , because it was pretty dangerous at first . And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you 're opening it . That will happen with any slotted , sliding gate . Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud , and it 's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands . And with it being difficult for her to do , she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying . I 'm always afraid she 's going to wake the kids . So , if you have your mom at your house a lot , get something easier . It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you ! -- -- -I 've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it . What happens is when you unlatch it , you first have to slide the gate in , then swing it out . There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together , and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract ( look at the photo - you 'll see what I mean ) . The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do . I 'm sure with use it will loosen , or perhaps I can put some wax on there . But when you 're opening the gate in a rush , as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows , I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide , and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket . The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby . My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful . But busy parents like us do n't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate . When we 've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows , the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate ! ! I dont ' mean to beat a dead horse , but seriously , that 's not good . The pinch I got today was major painful - I 've got a blood blister that 's almost half an inch long !	-1
2 stars for bad marketing & items missing . We received as a gift , so our annoyance is probably moderated . This review is for product misrepresentation. -- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes. -- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading . There is no `` play mat , '' but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat . Only large enough for half the pieces . The scene is completely different from that image . The real image has none of the detail. -- `` Rocks '' are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides , thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether . Only received 10 out of 12 , but not really missing them.Half the dinosaurs are very small ( 1-2 inches ) and the other half are more medium range ( 3-6 inches ) . Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides , but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling , so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names `` Animal Planet '' and `` Toy R Us '' should be a tip-off . Over-priced small dinosaurs , 6 trees , and a small plastic bin .	-1
We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child . There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco , so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits ( in the owner 's manual ) as the regular pack-n-play . Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered , the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily , Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back , but we are quite disappointed .	-1
As soon as I opened the box , I could tell by the VOC 's that this playard was treated with chemicals . I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants . In addition , some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl ... like the entire face of the sun is PVC . Why would you let your child play , let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew . I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard . It 's the same size but quite a bit more expensive . The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants . Definitely worth it to pay the extra $ , knowing my children wo n't be exposed to harmful chemicals .	-1
Be very careful using this play pen . My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on . He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen . Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes . At first I could n't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting . From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on .	-1
I got these as a gift at my baby shower , so I have n't had a chance to use them until now . Since I 'm breastfeeding , I do n't use them on a regular basis , just for outings . You ca n't pump into these , which is a bit of a hassle , but it 's not too bad . My problem with the bottle is that the bags do n't stay in . The ring does n't hold the bag in , so when I went to feed the baby , he ended up soaked . Needless to say , bottle feeding that day was a disaster . If the bag would stay in , I 'd say I really liked these . Unfortunately , I have n't had one bag stay in yet ...	-1
With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles , I was very excited about this bottle . Yet , both me and my baby hated it . First off , the bottle itself is huge , which makes it uncomfortable in many ways . Second , even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk . In any case , we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir . I would not recommend it .	-1
I have wasted so much milk using this drop-ins system . I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners , and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter . Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk , and believe me , I 've done that many times . I 've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole , I 'll only waste a little bit . But , come on , I 'm sleep deprived , and stressed and sometimes I forget , and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter , and I should n't have to check like that for a product I 've paid for . No good.Out of a box of 100 liners , I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak . That 's quite a lot ; we 're not talking one or two here . Unfortunately , I 've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples , so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I can not afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle . I 'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter . I would NOT recommend .	-1
I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong . I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle . I figured I would be saving time because I would n't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday . Well , you are n't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle . Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins . If I 'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I 'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out . Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on , by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle . Also they are not good for on the go . There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all	-1
These burp clothes are extremely thin . They are so gauzy that you can see through them , so they wo n't even work for a game of `` peek-a-boo '' ! These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth , let alone the `` premium '' diaper it is touted to be . These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth , let alone absorbing any type of baby mess ! The only reason I did n't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products . I just do n't think they described accurately what you are getting . They are definitely not the diaper service quality , however , if you do n't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store , how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says `` premium '' on the package ? They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging . For burp cloths , I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant , very soft and durable as well .	-1
I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up	-1
I think this product was a waste of money our daughter will not wait for bottle to heat up in this and its just easier and faster to make a fresh bottle .	-1
I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong . I 'd read the directions again and try again . Another , stinking , melted bottle ! And the milk would be scalding hot . If it did n't melt the bottle , the milk would still be cold . I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer . Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen . Oh ! And it melted that bottle too ! I 'm going back to the old fashioned way . I 'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it . It is faster , less messy , and lots cheaper . Do n't waste your time and money .	-1
Ehh , I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles . The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle . The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam . What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold . I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins . : ) But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back ( remember to freeze the ice pack ) -Overall , save your money and use the traditional method .	-1
I 've heard some say this is the best warmer available . If so , parents are S.O.L . Heating is SO inconsistent . Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time . Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot . When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium . Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place . Otherwise , the bottles ( esp . Brown 's ) will overflow . If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate . The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz . bottles or any other of similar height . The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke . The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open . Of course , you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water . They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just ca n't believe that someone ca n't design a better `` mouse trap '' .To add insult to injury , the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off ... ( picture provided by Amazon is not the current model . refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers )	-1
I really did not like this . We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water , and we found this worked faster and better . We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night . Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water , and to use a cooler for the bottles ( our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night )	-1
the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk	-1
I loved this product from the moment I got it . It works wonders with drop ins , And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely ... . Sometimes that is . We have been using this with ourDr . Brown 's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile . Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate ... . Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently . We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day , four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over . Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish . The instructions are basically nonexistent . All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities .	-1
The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating . Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing , but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece . There 's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup . It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way ( it 's an eye sore ) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus , the heating is inconsistent . No matter whether you put extra water or not , the bottles still do n't get warm like they should . When we first got it ( 4 months ago ) the milk would actually be too hot . That has n't happened in a while .	-1
I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night . We loved it for the first month we had it . BUT , after just about a month of use ( warming 3 or 4 bottles per day ) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top . I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer . ( The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I could n't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes . ) We played with the amount of water we were using , thinking we were putting too much in ( even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions ) . That did n't help . After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed . I would not recommend gettin this product . First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works .	-1
This thing stinks . The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it . Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this . We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks	-1
I bought this bottle warmer , because the previous model from the same company broke . When I got the new version of `` The First Years Night and Day Warmer System '' , I was shocked on how short the electric cord was . I was also displeased with having to unplug it , in order , to turn it off . I am not happy with the new model . I would try a different brand , if you need a bottle warmer .	-1
Do not buy for glass bottles . Says nothing about this on the website but on the box . Very dangerous because gets so hot	-1
This product is a major piece of garbage . You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try . It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot . Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product ( at least 4 people ) said that it catches on fire . We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would be way too hot . We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever . We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING ! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this . Remove from your registry , return , or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead .	-1
I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump ( Medela Pump in Style ) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP ! This single electric one just can not get enough pressure/suction/whatever . plus even if it DID work , a single pump means double the pumping time . I know double electric pumps are expensive , but beg , borrow , get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump ! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant . Just do n't bother trying this one .	-1
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ( $ 250+ ) models . In an effort to save money I started with this one . But I quickly realized I 'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk . I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it . I just wish I 'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model , here are my two cents : TRY THIS ONE IF ... - You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You would n't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF ... - You 're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula , ever ( with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency ) Also , it 's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you 're done ( unlike this one ) .	-1
This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces , do n't get this . In addition to being slow , it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months . It 's a waste of money all around !	-1
I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money . It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement . The motor cycles very slowly so when it 's tugging on me all I can think is ouch ... ouch ... ouch ... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it . I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it .	-1
The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me , but I was wrong ! First , the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful . If you 're a little too forceful , it can easily break . And if it breaks , you 're out of luck with installing this gate . Second , the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position , at the top of every fence panel . The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture , which is in the middle of the panel ! This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location . Third , this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced . Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up . If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate , I 'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate . I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels ( 12 feet ) and it did not have any of the problems I just described . It was expensive , but cost less than the Kidco . Overall , it is sturdier and better made too . The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco . North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it is n't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too .	-1
The only good thing about this is the night light function . The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound .	-1
Good while it worked ! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings . I only had it for three weeks when it stop working . I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again . It did n't play music and light would not turn off . I am really disappointed . Buyer beware !	-1
I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive . I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out ! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it . I am returning it back to the store . My sister has the same table and her 's is fine . Maybe I just picked up a bad one .	-1
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump . The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes . I would n't even say getting this as a pump for when you 're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up . I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing ( which it says you can do ) . They do n't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part . It cost nearly $ 30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it . The entire system just is n't durable or made for much use . Also , cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible .	-1
I was hoping for more of a pad feel to make my baby 's mattress softer but this is more like a waterproof cover with some quilting as an afterthought . Did n't make the matress any softer .	-1
Had it not fallen apart after one wash , this would have been the perfect mattress pad . It never even made it into the dryer . What a waste of money .	-1
This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket . There was nothing & # 34 ; UltraSoft & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; UltraThick & # 34 ; about this mattress pad , if you could call it that . It 's probably the first amazon purchase , after a couple hundred , that really left me disappointed . You 're better off putting a thick , soft blanket under your baby 's crib sheet if padding is what you 're going for . As a mattress protector , it might be good . As a quilted pad to make it softer- it 's useless . The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to . My 7 month old would n't have even noticed a difference . He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he 's older . Guess I 'll have to keep looking .	-1
When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad . I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic . I ca n't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product , let alone sleep on it ! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover . The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby .	-1
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking . They are correct ! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers , I think there must be a problem with production . Maybe some are leaky , some are not . Fact is , out of ten bottles , five of mine were leaky . I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex . They are half the cost and never leak	-1
Do n't waste your money ! Overpriced leaky bottles !	-1
These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak . I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak . Well less tightening did not help . Do n't waste money . I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it 's much better .	-1
I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had . I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle , but I was not overly impressed . I did not notice a change in my son 's spitting up using these bottles , either.The downside of using the Avent system is that , once you commit , you 're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts . I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts , and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I can not mix and match the parts . Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying ?	-1
Wanted to use the Avent line , but baby just would n't take this nipple . Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead . Looks like a science lab ... but baby switches easily from breast to bottle .	-1
Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups . They allow to much air to enter the baby 's system . Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown 's or Platex . I know several new mother 's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else .	-1
Do n't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air . Go with the Dr. Brown 's . My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just could n't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars : -well-made-easy to clean	-1
My son is breast fed , but we have given him an occasional bottle . He refused these . I got them because of all the great things I heard about them . I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth . No chance . He hates them . He hate the Playtex disposables too . He now takes Gerber bottles , traditional and New Traditions .	-1
I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles . I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage . Needless to say none worked . Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles . I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones . First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont ' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened . There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby . The bottles are by far not cheap and there should n't be so many issues . I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well ... too bad they did n't tell me before I registered for them . Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you do n't have all these issues . When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well . I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls . In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating . I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle .	-1
I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant , because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding . The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles . WRONG . Expensive does not always equal good . I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old , and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby 's part . The nipple shape is horrible . Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn 's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth . He was 9 lbs at birth ) . Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times . I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle , so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire . Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better . He took the bottle immediately and did n't get NEARLY the amount of air . Do n't waste your money on these bottles . They are NOT the `` best '' bottles to use while breastfeeding . SO if you are pregnant , do n't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best .	-1
They leak like mad ... and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much , it 's not your fault . It 's these idiotic bottles ! I ca n't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made . Please do n't buy them , it is a huge waste of money !	-1
These bottles leak . It does n't matter how you assemble them , or if you assemble them wet , or dry , or in space , or in a cave . They leak . Terribly . And Avent knows it . They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent . Of course the ones they replace it with also leak . Buy Dr. Browns instead .	-1
HI , I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY . I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME , I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS ! ! ! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO `` TALK ABOUT IT '' I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING . THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY . THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN . I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED ! ! ! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CAN NOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET ! ! ! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT , NOT , NOT , BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES ! ! !	-1
Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand . BPA free brands include Born Free , Nurture Pure , MAM , Green to Grow , Baby Life and Adrini . ( For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful , especially to infants . )	-1
These bottles are very finicky and if you do not put them together just right they will leak ... not drip ... POUR out all over the floor , and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too ! I ended up with a full set of these bottles ( without the ring ) and one that required the ring ( which I felt leaked less ) , I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles , so I dealt with these for 11 months . I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer ! What 's the trick ? Well , the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts ( sorry if this does n't make sense ) . You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top . This requires two hands , so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly . Once you have them lined up , now screw on the top . You have to make sure it is nice and tight . Now , shake it and see ... . it leaks ! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight , so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage . Take it off and try again . Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I can not wait to throw them all in the trash .	-1
I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible . Do n't waste your money . Dr. Brown 's is the way to go !	-1
Sent me 3 bottles one of which did n't have a lid in the box . Crappy quality control . Just buy them at the store for more money , at least you 'll get all the parts with it . 5 stars for avent , -5 stars for seller .	-1
I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts , every one of them leaks . I tried everything to stop the leaks , but nothing worked . Avent makes a great manual breast pump , but they need to put a better bottle on the market .	-1
The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her . It is n't great for infants that are nursing ... My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her . Not only was she gagging , but she just did n't like the nipple . I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it . I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since , and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle .	-1
I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles . Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely . The bottles worked great for the first six months and then ... ..THEY ALL LEAKED . It was not a small leak rather , a pouring leak that soaked their shirts . I hate these bottles and plan to switch ! ! !	-1
We used Avent bottles for several weeks , but our baby was spitting up _all the time_ , seemed like she was choking during feedings , and had gas all the time . We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old , and problem solved ! No more crying from gas , she hardly ever spits up anymore , and she has a much easier time at feedings . The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings . So , I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants . Maybe later , when our baby is a bit older we 'll pull out the Avent bottles again , but for now , we are n't using anything except Playtex VentAire .	-1
when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles , i bought everything bottle warmer , sterilizer , breast pump , and a ton of bottles and nipples . well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window . my daughter had very bad gas . when i switched bottles the gas stopped . Plus the bottles are expensive ... ... you have to keep buying new nipples there are sooo many different sizes . a waste i think , most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more .	-1
These bottles were terrible for us . They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions . They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy . As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups . I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter .	-1
My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air . I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers ( I used these with all my other kids ) I wouldnt recommend these .	-1
These bottles just did n't work for my baby . We tried and tried for 3 and 1/2 months to get my baby to take these bottles but it just did n't work . My baby is mostly breastfed , and is only given a bottle occasionally , so I did n't give up on these bottles right away , just thinking that he was n't used to the bottles and that 's why he was having a tough time . My mom babysat and she has raised nine kids , all who were bottlefed , so she is an expert . She said to me that the baby just really ca n't use this nipple . He chews on it and could n't suck properly , the nipple seemed to hard for him . He could n't latch on right and all the milk would spill out the sides of his mouth . Well , I take anything she says seriously ! After investing alot of time and money in Avent , I decided to scrap them and start over . I went out and found a nipple that was closest to his pacifier that he loves . I found Gerber Nuk nipples , got four of them for about $ 4 and bought Especially for Baby bottles for a whopping $ 2.99 ( you get 3 ) and my baby LOVES them ! ! ! ! THe bottles are cute ( the gerber bottles would be fine , too , but they were n't cute enough ! ) He takes the nipple right away and finally the bottles are emptied in no time . What a relief . I am sure Avent is good for some babies , but not mine , even after months of `` training '' . My advice is to try different bottles before settling on one kind . One more note , I read the other reviews that talk about leaking , I did n't have this problem at all . The only leaking was from my son 's mouth when he could n't latch on properly . But my cousin used Avent and they leaked terribly for her and she switched to Dr Browns . I would have tried Dr Browns but it looks like their bottles have the same nipples as Avent , too hard and not good for my baby . Expensive is n't always better !	-1
When breastfeeding , these are highly recomended . The problem with a breastfeeding mom is , they do not fit standard US breast pumps . So basicly you have to pump into one bottle , then transfer into this one ( this causes a problem for those of us who do n't produce quite enough milk -- - every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial ) . Then you are faced with the leaking problem . The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking . Well , sometimes that works and sometimes it dose n't . Again , I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was . Sometimes these bottles will taunt you . I would test the bottle before giving it to baby ... then after I was convinced it would n't leak ... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded ! And there you are , wasted milk , and a hungry baby who is drenched , and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed ! ! ! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire , which only leak once in a blue moon , if you dont put it together right .	-1
I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them . I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line . After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him ... .. I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands	-1
My baby never wanted to take them , or when he did , he looked like he was going to choke ( even with the newborn nipples ! ) , and was doing a mess , with milk dripping everywhere . The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better .	-1
When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that . Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak . NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby 's face . Not only do you have to clean up but your baby does n't want to wait for a new bottle . After slowly running out of bottles that did n't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect ! They do n't leak and our baby has less gas . The liners prevent a lot of gas . If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price . You get 100 of them for maybe $ 5.00 . We have n't had any problems with leaking at all.So I do n't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time . But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer , warmer , & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them ! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that does n't mean they are all bad . I just had to give a warning so you do n't lose a lot of money like we did .	-1
these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof . i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these . they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves , watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos . well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak ( something not needed in the other bottle ) the plastic used is also completely different . it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain , it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable . and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily . so disappointed that i now have to return these : (	-1
We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding , and they advertise a 'slow-flow ' nipple . Needless to say , the milk just ran down our baby 's chin every time . The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out . They are way too expensive and did n't work well for us .	-1
Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night . Our baby hated the bottle and would n't take the nipple . The nipples , on the Avent , are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on . We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle . The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter . Baby switches between the bottle and breast now , no problem .	-1
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck . I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow . You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer ! Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle . So , if you 've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste ! The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find ! Good Luck !	-1
I bought this to use with my Avent bottles ( which by the way LEAK ) and I was very disappointed . My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly . I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping . Once I started using a Medela Electric pump , I got tons of milk ! I was skeptical about the price , but it 's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis .	-1
I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got . However , it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day ! ! Luckily , I have an awesome boss , who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous . If I could , I would purchase an electric pump , because as my baby grows , I do n't see how I 'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump , and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping . On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great , and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours .	-1
I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea.. ! ! ! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie ! I was in pain for days after I gave birth , irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern . I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke ! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding ... NOooooo ! already , I would think ... yes and with only 4 oz to show . Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump ... NO.. I NOW know better ... . electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity , sleep , time , energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby . My milk supply in time grew ( not soon enough ) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship . We started off badly	-1
I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer , but this breast pump is awful ! The prong that connects to the handle , which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out , consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over . The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely .	-1
If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon , then this is a great pump for you . I found it to be an incredible nusance , so I borrowed a friend 's Medela electric pump . Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers ! Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to ( and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise ) . With our next child , I will definitely be buying electric !	-1
The instructions that came with this are terrible . The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels . The written instructions for Step 1 say `` see the diagram '' and do not elaborate , making the instructions worthless . The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky . Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards , destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I could n't un-stick them in order to make it right . The guards are nice , thick foam , but that does n't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery .	-1
The title says it all ... the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got . You 'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table . I 've tried goo gone to no avail . If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off , which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers , I 'd love to hear them . I ca n't believe how awful my table looks .	-1
We put this on our coffee table six months ago , all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly . The long strips dont really protect my child much . She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion . It is not really thick enough or wide enough . Corners are a joke . The tape provided is not sticky enough . Just keeps coming off .	-1
I do n't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables ! I need to return this item	-1
Good idea but this is very cheaply made ... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything ... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately . I wish I never purchased this because you 'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there 's no way I am doing that !	-1
You know when you 're child free and buy great furniture ? You ca n't fathom the day when you 'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child does n't go head first into the sharp corner ? Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard . Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and ... what ... the ? The wood came off . The WOOD came off . I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table . Not like a dent that could be sanded . I piece of wood literally splintered off . So , while this product will protect your kid 's noggin , do n't put it on a piece of furniture you like .	-1
This product does not adhere well . I have tried it on wood , metal , and painted surfaces . What 's more , other `` safety '' products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well . Also , when I tried to remove the cushion , the tape removed my furniture paint . Overall , I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler 's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps .	-1
When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child , however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it does n't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to . ( I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table ) .Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes ( must be completely flat to hold at all )	-1
This is the worst thing ever . It sticks for one week and then its down . I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape.Do n't buy it	-1
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is . I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability . I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year . They are totally falling apart at the elastic . Now , keep in mind that we use disposable `` chucks '' ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) on top of this terry cloth changing pad . It makes it less messy ( especially early on ) and does n't require washing as much . I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent , hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts , I just expected them to be more durable .	-1
After only a few uses and washes , this pad cover started to tear . It was ripping in the corners , and no matter how gentle I was , the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing . . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us .	-1
Great colors , and I like Simmons ' contoured changing pad , which this is supposed to fit , but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers & amp ; the terry fabric does n't hold up well . After just a couple of months , ours are already coming apart .	-1
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief ! Did n't even use it once ! Do n't bother ! ! !	-1
do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with 2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not move that much and its hard to make a turn ... ...	-1
These do n't stick at all ! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up . The adhesive would n't restick either . What a waste . : (	-1
They do n't seem to stick very well . Also , once they did start to come off , I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table .	-1
it never worked , i cleaned the surface and followed direction ... failed.tried with double sided tape ... failed.tried with regular tape ... . failed.i think the problem is that it 's not smooth again the surface on top , so it creates a little gap and easily falls off .	-1
This item is not top quality . I do n't have too many of this company 's other products , so if this is an example of their quality than I do n't think I will . First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached , the batteries only lasted through two cd 's , the volume does n't get very high , and it does n't even fit on the side of our crib . Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib 's are made the same . You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play 's cd 's .	-1
could not even try it it did n't fit on our crib . looks like a good idea .	-1
What a disappointment ! We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted . However , it did not live up to expectations . The sound quality was awful- very , very quiet even on the highest volume setting and , even worse , extreme static . I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems . For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful . We love it- buy it instead , better quality and cheaper !	-1
I thought this would be a great idea . So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them . We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit . I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back . When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped . We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time .	-1
While I think it 's a great fit for the toilet , my daughter wo n't sit on it for more than a couple minutes , having to adjust every few seconds because she says it & # 34 ; is n't comfy & # 34 ; . After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister , it just does n't work for our daughter . I 'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess . Stinks that I ca n't return this thing . Pretty expensive .	-1
Works well , but you basically need to also buy the steps that go with it or your kid can not get on the potty by themselves.. which is the point . To be honest we have the mini potty by baby bjorn and it is simpler and the kids can do it all on their own ... so this might be good for someone to use in a second bathroom where they do not want to have a little potty sitting around . You can easily hide it behind the toilet ...	-1
Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews , one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms . The splash guard can hurt your son . Also the splash guard does n't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat . If you have a girl it might be for you , if you have a boy do n't get this seat . Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat . Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time . This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty . If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder ! !	-1
I didnt know you had to lift the seat up to use this . there is a rubber thing inthe back that stops you from placing it on the seat itself , you need to lift up the seat and place it on the dirty part of the rim ... .all b/c of that stupid rubber thing in the back . I evem tried cutting it off , but it still doesnt help . this was a poor design .	-1
Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat . ( We have a Toto with a Bemis seat . ) This is not entirely clear in the product description , so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning .	-1
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat . Yet , this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner , causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat . Granted , I have little boys , so maybe this is n't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy 's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat ( the one with the ducks on it ) , which is , incidentally , much cheaper and easier to clean . The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat .	-1
Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys , it did not work for me . My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it . The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his `` equipment '' being damaged in the process of trying to stand up . I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this ( much cheaper too ) .	-1
I bought it based on so many great reviews . I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat . The description says `` adjusts easily and sits firmly in place '' ... well , it does not . It slides right out of the existing seat . SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there , otherwise the seat falls out .	-1
I 'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS : Fits snugly on any seat . We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem . Also , easy to clean . I also like the look of it ; simple and clean . I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS : By the time you get the seat cover up , the pants down , the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he 's already pee 'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs . Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous ; they have to be lifted . When they try to maneuver around it , the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side . I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches . I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant . With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say ; and not trure . The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own . They ca n't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead . There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it .	-1
My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair . She 's not able to sit on it without falling in . There 's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she 's having to hold her weight so she does n't fall in . In addition , the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward . Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard . I can totally see how this can happen . It 's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help .	-1
I ordered this potty because after weeks of research , this was the only potty I could find that 's BPA free . When it came my daughter was excited to try it . Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center . She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard . She 's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there is n't enough seat so it 's uncomfortable . She now refuses to sit on it . It 's going back .	-1
So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty . I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean . But every time we put her on it , after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt . What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep . Then she does n't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared . She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her . Also , every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it . It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt . I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success .	-1
This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it 's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom , it 's uncomfortable ! I 'm going to order one with a cushy seat !	-1
looks cute but not functional for us.the depth of the plastic bowl is not deep.If the shit is coming out long and hard , it might push back up to the baby	-1
My son is 50th percentile for weight and height , so pretty average sized for a 2 year old . As lots of reviewers have mentioned , the height of this potty is great , the handholds on the side are a help , the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there , and the back WOULD be nice except ... There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat , so that when my son sits on it , the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back . The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this . Even when he does not get pinched , he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs , and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all . Therefore I can not comment whether the pee goes into the bowl , because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting , I thought it would be really easy -- just pull the bowl out , dump it out , wipe , disinfect with clorox on occasion ... BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl , necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well , which is just a pain.Finally , the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son 's legs and he stands up.I can not say , however , if there is anything better out there -- we have n't found the `` perfect '' potty yet , but if this is the best of the portable potties , I guess we 're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet , because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us .	-1
I bought this for potty training my 2-year old daughter but she would n't use it . However , all kids are different in their potty training likes/dislikes , so I 'm only saying it did n't work for us . She preferred using the seats that go on top of your normal toilet seat or the type of potty chairs that had a lid to close . She liked the idea of closing the potty lid .	-1
I 'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews . My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer ! She 'll sit on it , but it 's so small . The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her . She 's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her . When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open , but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she ca n't really sit on it comfortably .	-1
I 'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair . If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy . The splash guard is way too short , my son just pees right over the top of it . I do like the separate potty and it 's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply does n't hold in the pee stream . Ugh . I 'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair . MESSY .	-1
I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews . I was pretty disappointed over all . My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby . In any case , every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum . I thought it was a little narrow for her . Sometimes when she stood up , the white part actually came up with her . I personally did not think this was a great potty chair . I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy , since there seems to be issue with other potty 's splash guards . In my case , my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all . I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings . It 's a little lower , but wider and the seat can not come up with her . She loves the songs , though it 's lower and it is actually wider , so even though she is tall , no problems . Again , do n't have a boy so ca n't speak to the splash guard issue , but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me . It 's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now .	-1
I bought this because of the excellent reviews , so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3 '' & 30 pounds . ( he is almost 3 yr old ) He does fit on this potty , but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes . It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said `` oh mommy my legs ! '' It 's not great to start potty training with a painful experience . He is now afraid of it.I do n't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it 's because he is too big for the chair , but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now . I would n't recommend this potty for larger children .	-1
Great when my son was sitting down ... now that he stands ... junk . If not right on target , you 're going to have a mess every time . Think pee puddle under the chair ... and now imagine the smell . Totally gross , and getting rid of ASAP.Skip .	-1
This was the second potty we bought for our son , who is almost 3 . In one word - horrible . I had a lot of hope that , with all the excellent reviews , we 'd find success with this one . The basic issue is the splash guard , which really does n't work at all . Pee still goes everywhere . I 'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that 's nearly impossible . If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I 've tried , I would have saved my money .	-1
I started out my son with elimination communication ( EC aka early start potty training , of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject ) when he was 6 wks old . We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was `` weird '' - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers . I could really kick myself now that he 's 2 and many many poop diapers later ! Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down . The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family , TERRIBLE for toddlers ! After he bumped it sitting down I could n't get him near the potty for weeks . I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead . I did n't put batteries in it - too much for me . I love it . My son actually uses it . It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd . Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa ! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face . I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now . And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training . Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways .	-1
I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn . Unfortunately , I have n't even given birth yet and I already know they 're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros : inexpensive.The cons : These diapers are horribly rough , even after a washing . The fabric is fraying and even triple folded , these things do not hold liquid . Since I 'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels , but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you 're trying to dry , they do n't absorb.Save your money and skip these ... and buy a higher quality cloth diaper .	-1
I 'm not sure how other people can give these a good review , or maybe I do n't know what they 're supposed to be used for ? Certainly not diapers ! My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes , using for burp pads , etc . The ones she meant were the cushioned ones , however . These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like , see-through ! I 'm returning immediately .	-1
Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths , I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center . This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering . However , the same brand , with the absorbent center pad , is much better .	-1
The can never be used as DIAPERS ! They are cheese cloth . In fact they may have more holes than cheese cloth does . There is no way that these diapers will hold anything that they are going to need to hold . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I just received these as a gift and will be returning them . I had intended to use them as burp cloths , but they are way too thin and not absorbent at all ! You can see right through them . Plus , the fabric is really scratchy . Not at all what I was expecting .	-1
These are just too thin to be used as diapers . They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers . I do n't use them . They are just sitting in a drawer . I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now .	-1
I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby . I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002 . They were amazingly awesome back in the day , so I 'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin . I could n't even use them as a changing , shoulder or lap pad in a pinch . Any baby `` mishap '' would immediately seep through . Not only that , they feel very rough - not something you 'd want to rub on a newborn baby 's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I 'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products . I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money . You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these . As far as burp cloths , the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those .	-1
Yep , flat diapers are indispensible for baby . But skip the Gerbers ! I 'd decided to cloth diaper , and got some fantastic ( big , thick , soft ) birdseye flats for $ 12 per dozen , online ( Google flat diapers ) .At the shower I was given some of these , and I thought `` cool , some cheapies for the non-diapering situations . `` I was shocked to find they 're not that cheap , and even more shocked at the ( lack of ) quality . After 5 weeks , these are still sitting untouched on the shelf , even though my tendency to grab my `` diapering diapers '' for everything has me running short on diapers a lot !	-1
I was very disappointed in this product . It was highly recommended by the hospital , so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born . After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks , I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple . We also tried the Avent nipple and she did n't like those , either . We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium . She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those . Now she 's a pro ! ( Anyone need my Medela set ? ? ? ? )	-1
The bottle quality is n't great for the price . Dr. Brown 's bottles ( the narrow ones ) screw right into the Pump In Style . So you can pump and use , just as you would with these bottles . If you use regular bottles , the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in . Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $ 4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles . I use Dr. Brown 's - since those are pricey , when I use up all of those , I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown 's bottles .	-1
These bottles are useful for storing milk ... .they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely . My baby hates them for feeding , however . I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles . I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby ... and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast . Um , no . Take one look at them and it 's pretty clear . My baby would n't even take it in her mouth . She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples , however . Much , much better !	-1
I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we 'd be feeding our baby with , eliminates a step right ? Well , having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they do n't work well for feeding . Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth ( 3 mos now ) . I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage . I like the evenflow glass bottles better , she wastes very little milk with those	-1
Do n't bother with these . They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary . It is much easier to buy storage bags . If you are pumping full time , you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time . I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby 's belly and the result is gas or worse , colic.They also flow too fast for newborns .	-1
i got these to put on my bed for my son 's morning massage-cuz by now it 's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off ! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression `` let 's see how good these really are '' ... only to be terribly disappointed : upon turning him over ( yes he did let out a dose ) i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle ! ! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution . i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers ! ! this was a waste of my money . i am back to using a regular sheet folded over .	-1
Yes they leak , I mean POUR milk from under the sealing ring . Do n't waste your money . If you are crazy enough to buy them SAVE YOUR RECEIPT !	-1
We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar . The infant size tub was fine , and still works okay after 2 years . However , the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak . The first one we bought had a very slow leak ; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak , so we bought another one , thinking we would n't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong ! ! The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub . At first it was so slow , it just meant we 'd have to reinflate it once in a while ; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it wo n't last through one bathing without going limp . After the second flop , I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement . They never responded to my friendly letter . When I finally called ( took me a while to get around to it ; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now ! ) , they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at `` Customer Service '' kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns , and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer . Way to stand behind your products , dudes ! Then when I called the retalier ( Right Start ) just now , they said that it 's not their responsibility to handle a replacement , it 's the manufacturer 's -- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she 's ask her boss and look into it more , just to see if there is anything they can do.I 'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers , especially repeat customers such as myself . I mean , come on , how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy ? ? However , since that is their attitude , you 're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life ( non-virtual ) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy , such as Babies-R-Us or Target , so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement . That 's what we 'll be doing from here on out.So long , Kel-Gar . The tub was `` just ducky '' but your service was DOA ! Update : No go on the replacment . Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub , I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead . We got it after having to give up on inflatables , and it is roomy , comfortable , and DURABLE , unlike Kel-Gar 's products . 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you ca n't beat that ! PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White	-1
I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation , I caution you with this purchase -1 ) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2 ) it is dangerously slippery . My son can sit up very securely , however he immediately slid . I even bought a tub mat insert to try , and he still slipped.3 ) It barely fits into our tub .	-1
This is a nice , big tub , but the bottom never held air . Decided to keep it anyway , but then after a day it developed a slow leak which made the whole thing pointless . Returned it .	-1
I bought this wedge as my stomach started getting bigger to find some comfort sleeping at night . The wedge is very stiff , even after working it for a little while . The angle of it is n't right..it should be thicker at it 's current thinnest part , because basically , my belly just pushes into it , and it falls on the floor , eventually . It was a waste of money , and a rolled up blanket or pillow does the job way better , and they are way more comfortable !	-1
Too small . It felt worthless for what I wanted . I ended up buying a 12 & # 34 ; 7.5 & # 34 ; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver !	-1
So tiny and hard as a rock . Inexpensive , but you definitely get what you pay for . Not even using . Makes me more uncomfortable .	-1
I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm . However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn 's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux .	-1
This wedge is very small , it will work well for supporting a pregnant belly but is not for sleeping on . I was disappointed that it was so small and firm .	-1
I was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly , but this was not even close to the answer to my problem . I 'll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product : Terrible and pointless .	-1
We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only . I do n't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now .	-1
I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower . I found that the items I needed to use it with ( the carseat , the stroller , the swing , etc . ) , came with their own headrest . Also , parents should know , that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department 's trained carseat safety deputy , I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat . Using one in a seat that it was n't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat , putting them at greater risk for injury . The product may be a fine one , but I found an & quot ; extra & quot ; one to be unnecessary .	-1
I am not rating this very highly because my daughter 's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies ' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns . This did n't help her head from going side to side or even forward . Also , my car seat came with one .	-1
I do n't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it . Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth , will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething . It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids . This particular one appealed to me because it 's not dyed & it 's made in the USA . As to whether or not it works ? I will never know !	-1
This item seems like a good idea , but after purchasing two I feel that we 've fallen victim to `` new parent baby marketing '' . Our baby was n't interested at all in sucking on anything in it . She woudl n't even go for fruits that we knew she loved . I 'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them ( ? ) She would just shake it around , bang it , or throw it . Also , it 's a total pain to clean it . The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one .	-1
I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old to help her learn to chew . It is very flimsy and floppy when food is in it . She just played with it ( flipping it around ) thinking it was a toy . She is teething also so I thought it would definitely go in her mouth often , but she enjoyed throwing it around instead .	-1
Some swear by this , but my child hated it . He is sensitive to food textures , so he did n't take to the bag at all .	-1
It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams . I like the concept of this but in practical use , my 7.5 month old was n't thrilled about using this . The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they could n't make it a little lighter to hold . My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her . Eating out of this does get really messy but that 's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves . In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought , this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean .	-1
I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just could n't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout ' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I did n't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion . I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms , but they did n't work well for busy , sloppy me . Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie !	-1
The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them . The execution , however , is lousy . Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal . Even though you ca n't pump straight into them , sealing them is quick and easy .	-1
I registered for and received these Medela bags . After using all 50 , I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase . Wow ! ! I will never go back to Medela . The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and do n't leak . Well this is the only good feature . The Lansinoh bag is strong as well , easy to close ( DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela 's bothersome twisty ties ) , easy to get the air out ( unlike Medela 's ) , and the Lansinoh 's take-up WAY less room in the freezer ! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape ... and thawing will be difficult because I can see I 'll need to watch that the milk does n't spill out the top . With Lansinoh I wo n't have to worry about that . My medela bags have n't split in the freezer ... I 'll give them that . But neither has my Lansinoh bag .	-1
I think that I 've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them . These were just about the worst ! ! My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding . I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped . I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day . I went through ALOT of bags ( I use bottles now ) and these were a pain . They were small , thin , punctured easily , and those twist ties ( although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept ) were just a pain in the butt . I love Medela 's pumps ( I own the Pump in Style Advanced , a seperate manual pump , and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months ) , I like their storage bottles , I even like their nipple cream , but these bags need some more work put into them .	-1
I really liked the Medela products at first , but I never really liked these bags , mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them . If you get too much milk in the bag , it will leak when you close it up . Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked , causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean . Plus , the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags , and I liked those much better .	-1
I was not impressed with these storage bags . I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure . This brand is harder to close , more time consuming and wasteful ( due to spilling )	-1
I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I 've really liked my Medela pump . I really did n't like using them with the twist ties . That did n't make sense to me at all . I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they 've worked better . They sit on their own and do n't need to be set in a cup ! I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother 's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles .	-1
If you are looking to make a mess , lose milk and get frustrated , these are the bags for you . First , these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag . You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself . Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out . It 's not that easy . The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk . Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there . The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk . This never happened with the other bags on the market . My favorite is lansinoh . Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others . Pass on this and try others .	-1
I do not like these bags . The twist tie closure system is cumbersome . The bags are small . The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen . The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly .	-1
These bags leave a lot to be desired . They do n't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them . They do n't lie down flat , so you ca n't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer . The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on . And I 've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors , which I 'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice , sterile inside . All in all , I 'm really disappointed in these bags , and the only positive side to them is I have n't had any burst in the freezer ... yet .	-1
After using both these bags and the Gerber bags , I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags . I 've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk . They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores ( Target , etc . ) .	-1
I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often . What a waste ! ! The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective . You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent . In additon to this , the cost is ridiculous . The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof . They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart . These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design . Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags .	-1
Something like this is a great idea , but when I called to ask the fire dept . to inspect my car . They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts . The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash . They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat , which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car . The mighty tite is just collecting dust . I have no plans of using it or giving it away . If I ca n't find a use for it , I 'll probably throw it away . The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing . They are great for around-the-house everyday use .	-1
Do n't buy this . It 's not safe , can cut your seatbelt , and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product .	-1
I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be & quot ; form fitting & quot ; if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation , choking ... .This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it . After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it 's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead . It was soft , and when my child was sleeping he did n't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen , I may pull the sheet out and try again . For the basinett - do n't bother .	-1
While it looks like it would be a great color , it 's poorly made ( thread count must be super low ) and when it comes out of the drier , it has `` balls '' collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft . Go for the white ! I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better ! !	-1
I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable , but it is so thin . At nine dollars I thought it would be better .	-1
Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet . Ca n't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who do n't mind spending money for better quality ? ? Also , keep in mind your wash loads . I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels . Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby 's laundry . Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby 's laundry .	-1
I had two of these sheets for my first child because that 's all I could find at the time . Other reviewers are right on about the quality . VERY thin and not very soft either . You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we 're expecting our second child any day and she 'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit , I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU , bought one of each and tried them on the bed . Here 's what I found : Nojo : Terrycloth-like fabric . Soft but still a bit thin . They are elasticized though , which is easier to put on and stays on better . There were three colors available at the store ( dark blue , light blue , white ) . Price $ 9.99Graco quilted sheet : Very plush , though the fabric is synthetic feeling ( I did n't check , but I 'd guess poly blend ) . Most comfortable of any that I tried . Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet . Elasticized and stayed on well . Was only available in a dark blue . Most expensive at $ 14.99Carter portable crib sheet : Knit fabric . On the thin side , but soft . Stayed on well , was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors ( green , white , blue , yellow ) . Price $ 7.99Koala portable crib sheet : Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality . Elasticized , available in a variety of colors ( pink , white , blue , green , etc ) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $ 6.99Overall , I was VERY pleased with the options out there . Highly suggest NOT buying these , but going with an elasticized sheet . Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on !	-1
We have the Saratoga P & amp ; P and I 've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought . It 's been so bad that we have n't used it yet . The material is very rough and the sheet does n't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position .	-1
These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap . The elastic is n't good , and the fabric is just not soft . We 've bought several other brands , all of which were better than this stuff .	-1
I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one . These really are terrible sheets . I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they 're manufactured by the same company . Boy was I wrong . They do n't fit the pad very well regardless if it 's laying flat for the playpen or if it 's set up for the bassinet . Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet does n't stay put very well at all . They are also cheaply made . Thin is n't even the word . It 's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand . I 'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere . As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet . The pad wipes down well and if i 'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her . Since she 's always wrapped in a blanket she does n't mind going w/o the sheet .	-1
We could n't get the sheet on right . It kept lifting the corners of the floor mat . They were n't soft like the others either . We never used them ... You can find ours at Goodwill . Waste of money .	-1
These sheets are not good at all . I am a big fan of Graco products , but not these ! They are thin , and not soft at all . I ended up making my own sheets ... all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners , they do n't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it . Plus , a lot cheaper !	-1
These reusable nursing bra pads are bulky and show through shirts . I was very disappointed after using them the first time . Have n't used them since and have purchased others to try .	-1
I bought these because they are washable and the box said they are 100 % cotton . However , while prepping them for first use , they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron . Why , you ask ? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad ? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging ! I started to iron the first one , and my iron began sticking to the pad . I peeled it off the iron , and there , in a perfect circle , were little melted remnant marks from the thread . It is not even polyester thread , which tolerates a VERY high heat ( i.e. , cotton ) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed . I really wanted to use these because they are cotton . So , off to the drawing board , I will just have to sew my own . And in case you are wondering why I would iron them , they come out of the wash very wrinkly ( whether you air dry or put in the dryer ; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods ) . One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling , thus , my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you do n't mind wrinkles , or are planning on using a padded nursing bra , then I suppose these would work for you ... But if you are like me , and prefer no padding in your bra , then I would give these a pass .	-1
I 've tried four different products . I 'm working to test each product I can get a sample of . I believe most products fit one or more specific needs . I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far , each brand 's strengths were as follows : > Kushies ( 3star ) absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers , > La Leche League ( 3star ) appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras , > Medela ( 2star ) was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time , > NuAngel ( 4star ) was very affordable . `` White/patterns '' absorb a bit faster than `` natural '' so I like to put `` natural '' as an outer doubler and `` white/patterns '' as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine . Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable , free samples , and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted . No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling .

Can soak a Lansinoh disposable ( most absorptive disposable I 'd encoutered ) in a single feeding and leak . Equivalent to about two & a half washable pads stacked to catch the flow . Heavy flow requires very absorptive inner doublers and low ( er ) absorption outer doublers so they have time to soak it all up without affecting your shirt . Hopefully a washable pad out there can improve on these statistics . I just have n't met it yet . I 'm still hopeful that the other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer . I will gladly try any brand and report on my findings.Rate of absorption . 3ml water dispersed in 2 seconds .

You can see these through your bra ... even a think padded bra . And they do n't lay flat so they are n't very comfortable.Try the LLLI Washable Nursing Pads . I have tried every washable brand and these are the best !	-1
These are bulky under your bras and if you have heavy letdown you will leak right through . They are also difficult to wash , getting balled up and do n't dry well .	-1
very comfortable and stay put pretty well . however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot	-1
These are a little to big for me ( even thought I have big-uns ) . They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt , an under shirt , and a bra all at once . Not my favorite . They are , however very absorbant .	-1
I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth . My nipples were raw , sore and a little bloody . Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples . My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture . To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts . Ouch ! I found the smooth , cool lycra of my bras was better . A waste of money !	-1
I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables . These work in terms of absorption for me ( I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely , but enough to soak 50 % of the surface of my bra at a time ) .Unfortunately , they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes ( flowy , patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem ) . The stitching is rough and itchy . Once the pad is washed it 's very ripply and wo n't sit flat ( which is the biggest annoyance for me ) . They 're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home , but I would n't want to wear them in public .	-1
I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst . I have n't had any problems with leakage ( with this or any other brand ) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I ca n't wear them with anything without them showing through . I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe ! Especially , when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes .	-1
I used this stool during my baby 's first month . It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable . But after the first month , it became more of a hindrance . You do n't need it if you are using a nursing pillow , like & quot ; Boppy & quot ; . Pricey . Better to borrow one from a friend .	-1
I liked this product because it 's a good rubbery material to chew on , but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider . I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib , but after being on a few months , they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them , they removed some of the wood varnish as well , so I left them on to look better . My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does ( 3yrs later ) and prefers chewing on the front bar best , of course . At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it 's converted to a full size bed , but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer . Oh well , it 's kind of cute . I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me .	-1
My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them . She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job . They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail .	-1
I like the idea but in reality did n't work for us . We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey . The length ( from top to bottom ) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches . So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood . And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too ( 11 months ) . I 'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs .	-1
If you have an Oeuf Sparrow Crib , these rail protectors are too small . Not sure how they would work if they fitted !	-1
My 11-month-old can easily remove these protectors , making them worse than useless -- they 're actually an additional hazard . Buy something else instead .	-1
I bought this at babies r us . It did not fit my rail . It says it fits most standard rails but does n't give any measurements . How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? What a pain .	-1
I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product . I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old . So not only did I waste my money purchasing these , but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks ... exactly what I was trying to avoid . What a waste !	-1
This thing is bulky and me no likeThough they snap and the locks are tightBut it 's huge but I guess that 's okBut wo n't be ordering more , it 's not worth it to payOk so this technically does the job but it 's stinking huge and the locks work too well in that it 's a pain to open up to get more things plugged in so I guess it 's best to use it for power that you wo n't need to touch for a while	-1
I would n't call this much of a safety product . The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs are n't that hard to open . I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a `` safety '' item . It 's fine as a deterrent , but nothing I would waste money on again .	-1
This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation . There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch . But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open . Now you would think that that 's the point of the power strip cover , right ? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket . It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip , I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better . If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip , than this will work for you .	-1
The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters . If the cover were taller , it would n't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside , but it 's not . It 's just too short , even for the smallest of the Apple adapters . So I had to return this anyway , but if I 'd kept it , I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain ... and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller .	-1
I have a basic single row power strip , and i could n't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch ... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close , so it would be good to keep little fingers out , but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one , & lt ; ... > but not exactly the same . Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled `` adapter '' so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space .	-1
This is supposed to keep your kids safe . My 18mth old figured out how to open this in a matter of days .	-1
This is a very useless item . It does n't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover . This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out . A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside , which completely defeats it 's purpose .	-1
This item is useless . It does not keep fingers out and it also does n't fit larger plugs . I do not recommend it to anyone .	-1
I 'd move along if I were you . While this does the trick there are better products out there . This is not the saftey strip you 've been looking for .	-1
for where we needed this it did n't work do to the plug 's we had in the outlets the cover would n't fit .	-1
This is one of the worst products created for child safety . It did n't fit our standard power cord , the front section opened really easily ( actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed ) and once we opened the back section to plug things in , could n't get the back section closed again . Also , the opening at the top is huge ! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in , which is kind of the opposite of its purpose . I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead .	-1
This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it . The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $ 2 more and much better quality fabric . The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy , like an old towel . I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them , I wo n't be buying any more though . Carter 's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad . You do n't strictly speaking need a cover , it 's easier if you do n't use one . I never used covers with DD and never had a problem .	-1
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief ! Did n't even use it once ! Do n't bother ! ! ! Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well ...	-1
I do n't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding ( got the special Playtex nipples and bottles ) . Also , the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price . Walmart ones are not as soft , but do the same thing still	-1
these leak and do n't colapse use the older rolled liners they do not leak . and you can see them colapse like they should	-1
I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup , then poured it in the liner , and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner . I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result . You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up , because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners , My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand . Also , the numbers on the liner are very hard to read .	-1
This is my 3rd baby . We used playtex bottles with liners for our first 2 kids and loved them ! I guess Playtex decided to change their bottle sometime between our last baby and this baby . The liners no longer match up and it 's hard to see the numbers . We decided to scrap it all and go with another brand completely , unfortunately .	-1
I have wasted so much milk using these drop-ins . I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners , and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter . Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk , and believe me , I 've done that many times . I 've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole , I 'll only waste a little bit . But , come on , I 'm sleep deprived , and stressed and sometimes I forget , and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter , and I should n't have to check like that for a product I 've paid for . No good.Out of a box of 100 liners , I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak . That 's quite a lot ; we 're not talking one or two here . Unfortunately , I 've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples , so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I can not afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle . I 'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter . I would NOT recommend .	-1
People ... please do n't get ripped off . I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99 Please do n't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks . These work ... but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less .	-1
These are very small in size and `` paper-towel-like '' , kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper . We bought a pack and just could n't use it because it is so small . I 'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these . For us we now use the babies R Us brand , they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it , which is much more durable .	-1
My baby is an Advent baby . I love all the Advent products , but was a little disappointed with this one . The bottle warmer , is maybe too good of a warmer , as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit . The timings really should be precise .	-1
First , we read the directions and we follwed them . But this never seemed to work the same way twice . Sometimes at 4 min . the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min . it was n't hot enough . There was no rhyme or reason to it , we had it set the same way every time . We used it for a month and then threw in the towel .	-1
So we have used this bottle warmer for over 8 months now . I have to say , with all the sleep deprived parents using this item , often in the middle of the night , you would think that Avent would be wise enough to put an auto-shut-off feature on this little doohickey . But , no . I exclusively feed my baby breastmilk , and that stuff is like `` liquid gold '' ( from what everyone has told me , and I 'm inclined to agree ) , and I ca n't even tell you how often I have put a bottle in the warmer to warm it and then forgot it was in there for like 15 minutes . The milk gets boiling hot in that time , and then it 's useless and I have to pour it out because it 's not supposed to be heated to boiling . I know people are probably going to read this and wonder how one could forget that they put a bottle in the warmer , but now that our baby is sleeping through the night , it 's more for when my husband is giving her a bath , I will get the bottle ready for him as he gives her a bottle after her bath and puts her to bed ( his time with her during the week ) . So many times I have forgotten it was in there and burned the milk , but also - and this is the really dangerous part - the light will shut off for like 30 seconds at a time ( what they call `` blinking '' , if you can believe that ) , and so often it will look like it 's turned off when there is no bottle in it , but it is n't , and it will just keep heating the water in there until it 's all gone . We have found it on after a couple of hours away from it because we did n't notice the `` blinking '' light because it was off at the time , and there is no other indication that it 's on from the front . The switch is on the back and it 's not clearly marked `` on/off '' either . I ca n't imagine how it has n't caught fire for other people or melted the plastic when the water is all gone . Thankfully , I have noticed it before the water was completely gone , but it was almost gone . How unsafe ! Anyway , I still use it because I have n't found one with an auto-off feature , but will be looking for one . I have to set the timer on my microwave now whenever I put a bottle in because half of my brain cells disappeared when my baby was born apparently , and I 'm way too distracted to remember it 's on . BAD DESIGN ! ! !	-1
Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out . In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it !	-1
I didnt really care for this . I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot . Might be user error but I didnt care for it .	-1
This thing is very hard to figure out . One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast , try another setting for 15 min 's and you still have cold milk ! I tried to use it for 3 months ... finally gave up . Save the money . Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that ... Sometimes we need to listen to our mom 's and grandma 's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine !	-1
Save your money . You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it . This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item . It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle .	-1
I used this for a short time . It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there . A timer would have been nice ( and cheap enough to add ) .I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes , it may be the best there is out there , but that does n't mean too much . It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on . There is so much they could have done with this that they did n't . Oh well .	-1
I am primarily breastfeeding , but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles , etc.. I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead , and this thing went in the closet . I feel badly for the waste of money ... but the bags are SO much easier ! ! ! And not space consuming . Plus you can use them during travel , at the office , etc.. Much more cost efficient and useful !	-1
I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself , THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time , THEN wait for it to cool ... . too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby ! & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; If your baby has an immune promblem , then this may be great for you , otherwise , skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush ... . I like the one by Munchkin. & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; BUT if you still decide to get this , check it in the store first , because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned ( someone else thought it was useless too I guess ) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck !	-1
I used this item 3 times , now its collecting dust . Most books that I 've read and my doctor agrees that it really is n't necessary to sterilize bottles . They only need to be washed in very hot soapy water . My son goes through tons of bottles a day and its not convenient to sterilize them in this item . You can only fit 4 bottles in there at a time . Save your money and wash you bottles well by yourself !	-1
The description states that this is compatible with all the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmers , but if you notice the pictures they have posted only show it with a generic wipes box or just holding the diapers . This is because the wipe warmers are considerably larger and do not actually fit flush in them . There are two small groves in the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmer that allows it to be forced onto it , but the wipe warmer hangs over the edge.The main reason I purchased this diaper depot to hang on the side was to hold the wipe warmer and diapers and save space on the changing table , but I do n't think this one is going work . The wipe warmer looks like it would just take a bump to send it tumbling and not very secure on the diaper depot . If you are just using plain wipes without the warmer , it would probably be alright . I primarily bought it to go along with the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer , so I 'm left pretty disappointed. & # 34 ; Compatible & # 34 ; and actually fitting seems to be two different things ... .	-1
Although I gave the diaper depot a low rating I do have to say I like that it hooks on the side of my changing table . But the reason I gave it a low rating is for two reasons:1 . No diaper warmer will fit on it ... not even the Prince Lionheart brand2 . There is a slit on the bottom so you can easily gain access to diapers ... this seems great but the diapers stick together and you end up pulling out 3 or more diapers at a time . Not worth it .	-1
This diaper stacker is a joke . The diapers come out 3 at a time , the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container , and the plastic is very flimsy . I brought this because of the great reviews this product got . After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it . I do n't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time .	-1
I did n't car for this organizer . It looks cheap and also like it might crack easily . There are nicer options out there , but they are more expensive .	-1
Be aware this product does NOT fit all Prince Lionheart brand wipe warmer containers . I have the premium PL wipe warmer and it does NOT fit ! If you plan to use it to hold normal plastic container of wipes , then you 're fine .	-1
I bought this item to hang onto the side of our pack n play . It did n't work for what we wanted , and we sent it back . Thanks to amazon 's awesome return policy . If your looking for something like this for your pack n play , I 'd recommend something else . This does n't fit over the edge of the pack n play .	-1
I was so excited to get this because of the great reviews . After trying it out and on the changing table , I quickly realized that there was no way I was going to keep it . The first thing I noticed was that newborn diapers do not fit in the holder . It is made to hold full size bigger diapers . Then I realized that since I am left-handed , I wanted this to be on the left side of the changing table . Well that does n't work , because the dispenser opening to get the diapers would then be in the back ! So I tried it on the other side to see if that could work . In doing so , I realized that the plastic had left 2 scratch marks on the pretty cherry wood of my changing table ! ! The plastic is sharp and scratched my changing table on both sides as I was trying to figure out how to make it work . I considered using a cloth or something soft to protect the wood from the plastic , but quickly decided it 's not worth it -- not only will it not work with newborn diapers , but it is also not left-handed friendly , and really does not give much storage space . Returning it right away . I would have given it 1 star but & # 34 ; hate & # 34 ; is too strong of a word . I simply do not like it : )	-1
This was a total piece of garbage . Several things are wrong.1 . It doesnt fit every changing table . When I attach it to mine , it tilts downward and is not level at all . You need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto.2 . The side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges.3 . The biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product.4 . Consider that you will be taking away 5 inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it.If you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room , this makes a difference.What a cheaply made piece of plastic.Pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead .	-1
Cheap material , I returned it.It is not sturdyenough to use ever day.I was even afraid tobrake before returning the stuff .	-1
It 's useless . The one I bought came broken into pieces and Amazon refunded me the full amount . Thanks to Amazon.This so inferior and can not hold much . Nowadays I believe no one is using tiny soap bottles or cream bottles as it 's cheaper to buy the big ones . This can not hold any of those .	-1
This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back .	-1
After purchasing the depot , I found it does not work well on my changing table ( dresser style with fold out top ) . I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung . More bad news ... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer , which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table . Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table , but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type .	-1
After reading all the reveiw on this , I believed I HAD to have this tub . It is bulky and a pain to use . Our daughter never liked it . Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need , in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle .	-1
My 9 month old son loves bath time with the Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub . It 's got anti-slip for infants and same goes for the toddler position . Only thing I did not like about the tub was that it 's too shallow and my son is big for 9 month . ( I 'm guessing the depth has something to do with safety ) .My brother who just has his daughter said his Primo tub was too big so he wanted to switch.Pros..it 's bigConsit 's too big and waste a lot of water . over twice as much water as the FP whale tub . Which I would not mind if it was bit deeper so my son can get a better submersion but it 's not any deeper than the FP whale tub.Main problem is that Flooring is too slippery so my son was startled everytime his bum slipped against the floor . He loves bath time with his Fisher Price Whale tub since he was an infant . Always smiles and never wanting to get but yesterday for the first time , I saw him startled and whining to get out of the tub . Never once saw my son slip on the Whale tub . In fact he would rotate and splash around while taking a bath without a problem . With Primo tub he stopped dead on his track , scared that he would slip.I supposed you can put a towel to offset the slipping problem but I think I 'd rather look for another tub .	-1
I really wanted to love this bath , but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby was n't really into this tub either.I 'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby , I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use , clean and store . My baby liked it better .	-1
We registered for this site unseen based on the reviews . It greeted us on the porch of our house when we arrived home with the baby . At first , I thought a refridgerator had been delivered ! ( Okay ... slight exaggeration . ) But it was HUGE. ( ... )	-1
This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable . His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic . Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby 's balls so watch out especially if he 's too small to fit in the tub properly ! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old . Hopefully in the future we can use it again .	-1
Arrived caved in from shipping . If a plastic tub ca n't endure shipping , how can it handle a growing toddler ? I had a nightmarish experience returning through Marketplace , horrible experience for a cheap overpriced tub . I ended up ordering the hoppop bath , which I love . The PRI tub certainly was n't worth the $ 50 I spent . Go to Bed , Bath , & Beyond to see it in person and pay $ 24.99 if you really want it . I still prefer the hoppop that I purchased through Amazon .	-1
This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased , based on all of the stellar reviews , and BOY was I disappointed ! ! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term , and this tub was HUGE ! ! Even with the so-called supports the tub has , she still slid all over the place , and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully ! She hated it and so did I , and to this day ( 18 months later ! ) she HATES the tub and we 're still doing sink-side sponge baths ! ! If I had to do it again , I 'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support ! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE , DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! UPDATE : I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $ 15 , AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT ! ! It 's considerably smaller , has walls that go straight up ( versus being slanted , like the Primo ) all the way around , and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe ! ! Should 've gone with this from the beginning ... ..	-1
This bath tub is humongous . It needs its own bath room . Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink . Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub , which places it practically at ground level , my back is killing me.Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster , go for something else . Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city .	-1
My husband registered for , and we recieved this bath when our daughter was born . From day one , I absolutely hated it . My daughter was born 7lbs 15oz and 20 '' long - She constantly was sliding around in this thing , or when she would kick and splash her legs would go around the `` post '' that was supposed to separate her legs and it would hit her privates hard . She just could not relax enough to enjoy her bath , and she LOVES to be in warm water.Even with a sponge support she cried every second she was in the water . A towel , sponge support , anything at all that might help A ) make her not slip around so much and B ) make it not so hard . Once we switched to a softer material tub by Summer Infant ( I might also add that the tub is MUCH smaller ! ) my daughter loves bath time again . She will kick and splash , play with toys , etc.I would not recommend this bath tub . It 's a good idea , but the material is just too dang hard and it 's not comfortable for little babies .	-1
I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.Also , because of it 's size you do n't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway ! I found it 's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me !	-1
Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it ! After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with . Also the refills are expensive and it does n't hold enough diapers IMO . It does n't lock out odors either . It may have for the first week or two , but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD . I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier . What can I say ? The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly . No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper , the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked . The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru .	-1
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all . I thought it was very difficult to use . ( until you get used to it ) It did n't contain the smell well at all . The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to . The lid also kept coming off of mine . I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better .	-1
I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can . It 's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie . I would recommend trying a different brand .	-1
Buy the Diaper Champ instead . The Diaper Genie 's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top . Otherwise , it 's kind of a pain in the rear . I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all .	-1
I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months . Then I discovered what a waste of money it was . Once solid foods were introduced into my son 's diet , this did n't even come close to holding in the stench . I even used the different types of refills that were made for it ... ie . infant , original and toddler . Still did n't do the trick . I even put air fresheners in and near it ... . Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers . Still a hassle to remove the `` diaper weenie '' so now I just use a normal trash can . Much less hassle and same results .	-1
It 's a neat idea ... the problem is ... the replacement bags cost too much and do n't justify the convenience . Honestly , my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in . They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers . At the end of the day , we toss them out into the garage ... end of story . If you really need this kind of doodad , there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag ... that 's much better than this deal .	-1
The Diaper Genie does the job of keeping odors away , but otherwise it is a real pain ! If you shove the diaper down and accidentally miss the clips you have to reach down and pull up the messy diaper and wipes ! Ick . Particularly icky at 2 am.And contrary to what one poster says , a monkey definitely could n't operate this thing . The refill directions are lousy . It took us over a half hour to figure out how to install the refill , and we 're all college-educated professionals ( and my dad , a retired mechanical engineer , could n't even figure it out ! ) . It 's hard to get the refill in , even when you do figure out the part that 's ommitted from the instructions . When you 're busy with a newborn , the last thing you have the time or energy to deal with is a challenge like this ! And why does the obvious dial at the top cut the liner instead of sealing off the liner for the next use ? Yes , you realize that 's what it does after reading the directions . But we have to tell anyone helping care for the baby not to turn the noticeable dial because it does n't do what you think it will.If you do decide to purchase this product , do n't turn the liner multiple times after use as the directions suggest . The only reason they say to do this is so you 'll run out of the liner faster and have to buy their refills . One or two turns is sufficient once you get the diaper lined up in the Genie properly.I wish I had taken a better look at competing products . I realize now there 's a real reason other companies decided to come up with other models . The Diaper Genie has some major flaws .	-1
I use this for less than 1 month : The quality of the material ( plasitc ) is bad and cheap , it doesnt control de odor ( the room really stinks ) and it broked after a month of use , and the refills cost too much money ! I definetly go with the diaper champ , better odor control , no refill bags ( use conventional kitchen trash bags ) .	-1
It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY . The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn ( 1-3 months ) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day . The inside gets horrible smell like something died in it . It is very hard to replace the refill . Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills . So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie . And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing . So right now it is in the garbage . Money down the drain .	-1
Why does everyone think you need this thing ? Of course , we thought so . We have used it five or six times . We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it . Once we got the hang of it , we realized it 's pretty useless . It does work to keep odor out I suppose , but so does a plastic bag.Just put your diaper in a plastic bag !	-1
We ended up giving this away . The stickers it comes with is a joke . We went with another brand ( just one long piece ) and it worked out much better since our brick fireplace is rounded . If you do go with this one , make sure to get the removable caulk as the stickers do n't work AT ALL .	-1
My son was able to pull this off right away . I 'm constantly retaping it to the fireplace . When it does stay on , it 's great . Have prevented a few bruises/cuts .	-1
We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge . Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace . This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money . It did n't fit together right and then the adhesive did n't stick to the brick . Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it ! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up . So we just took it up and she 's been fine without anything on it . In fact , she 's pretty much left it alone since we took this off .	-1
When I was a brand-new mom , eager to color-coordinate my baby 's nursery , I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available . Good thing I bought so many , because each time baby oozed , leaked , squirted , spit up , fountained , or otherwise made a baby mess , I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes , then remove the pad cover , toss it in the wash , and put a new cover on . Does n't sound like much work , but considering how many messes babies can make , changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore . On top of that , the terrycloth just does n't clean well , even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout ! It 's much easier ( and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming ) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser . Do n't waste your money buying pad covers .	-1
I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child . They are mediocre . I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use . I stitched them back up , but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places . I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap ... one is not present . Finally , I used it with the changing pad by `` Especially for Baby '' and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars , I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids ' chamois pad covers . They are extrememly soft ( you 'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff ! ) , have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly .	-1
I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose . I ca n't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad ! It does n't fit well . It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through . I cut small holes to pull the straps through , and they were all frayed after just one washing . In fact , the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use ! The material is rough and cheap . My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day . It 's softer and easier . We will look for another option , but until we find one , this cover is not the answer !	-1
I ca n't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed ! It never made it to the changing table . You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed . Therefore , have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it .	-1
I bought this cover because it was the only brand offered at Babies R Us . It was nearly worthless after the first washing because of how much it shrank . I have since bought a Carter 's cover and am much happier .	-1
These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings . In addition , the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides . Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers , but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top . This way I just change the multi-use pad and I do n't have to wash the changing pad cover very often .	-1
Not too happy with this monitor . We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static . My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried . We used it for 7 months , every day during naps and night , and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out . So , in summary : it will work but it 's not a very good product and does n't seem to have quality components to make it last . Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you 'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies .	-1
We 've been through three of these . Two were total junk out of the box . One worked very well.The first one we got did n't work at all . It was totally useless . The static was so loud we could barely make out noises from the babies room . But , we sent it back and exchanged it for a new one . The new worked great . So , we ordered another one for the other kid 's room . This 3rd one was total junk . So , 2 out of 3 were junk . But , the one that did work , we really like . For me , this explains the mixed reviews on this product . Poor quality control.As far as the one that did work , here are some more details about why I liked it.We 've tried a few monitors . This one had the least static . For us , static is the most important issue . We hate it . We use the baby monitors primarily at night , so that we can hear if the kids wake up in the middle of the night . If the monitors have a lot of static it keeps US from getting to sleep.The next most important issue is unnecessary beeping . Some of the other monitors we 've used periodically loose the signal from the baby 's room , and then automatically reconnects after a few seconds . Each time they loose the signal they beep loudly to let us know . This always wakes us up . This can happen a dozen or more times each night . No good . THIS monitor does NOT beep when it looses the signal , or maybe it just never looses the signal ... either way we 're sleeping much better now .	-1
It works well enough and I love that it has an outlet plug so that I do n't have to run it on batteries but the sound quality is terrible , lots of static ! I honestly dont recommend this item , buy something nicer , it 'll be worth it for your sanity and peace of mind .	-1
You get what you pay for ... For $ 17 you should not expect a lot . It does its job , but with quite some statics in the background . It 's working OK for me , but I regret not spending some more for a better quality monitor .	-1
This Monitor gets BAD interference ! Very buzzy with static ! I would not recommend it . I gave it 2 stars because it 's super affordable ... but you do n't want to buy it unless you really do n't mind the interference and constant buzz .	-1
This monitor is awful . Do not waste your money . It certainly is n't `` crystal clear . '' I ca n't hear my son in the next room . Often times I will wake up to another family waking up . How awkward .	-1
I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well , so got another one this time around ( previous one was given to my SIL ) . I do n't know what they 've changed , but this one is bad enough I 'm going to break down and order something else . We 've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that does n't have other major interference ( like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit ) . Plus , for some reason we 're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us ( no babies within 2 houses in any direction ) . I ca n't imagine what they 've heard us say based on what we 've heard ! Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much ... wish I 'd put the money into that to begin with .	-1
I had to return this item because it did n't work right from the start . It made very loud static and if someone talked or cried , it would only change the sound of the static slightly . I really wanted it to work too- it had all the features that I needed and I loved the price . I did n't try a second one since I really needed a monitor and did n't have the time to mess around with something that might not work .	-1
I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A . My daughter was used to the Dr. Brown 's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle . She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle , we could not use it .	-1
REALLY FAST FLOW . It chokes the baby . Please dont use it with newborns as its too much flow and air and it creates colics	-1
Do n't plan to carry these around in a bag , because they leak . Also , it 's very hard to get the top off of the part that screws on and holds the nipple , it keeps getting stuck and you have to pry it out .	-1
It pilled up with the wash and dry { tumble low } ! AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress ! Grrrrrr ... ..	-1
My mattress is water proof plus I do not use it to change diapers . I threw mine out .	-1
For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment ! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50 % less and my LO still hated them ! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies	-1
we tried these nipples after using the Nuk orthodontic latex nipples because we needed to step up the flow and Nuk does n't make their nipples in anything other than a slow flow ( at least , i could n't find them if they do ) . however , my breastfed baby did not like them . the base of the nipple looks more rounded in the images than it is -- it 's actually quite flat . we found that our son preferred something he could put his whole mouth around , as it would more closely resemble nursing . these nipples were a no-go . we ended up just making the hole bigger in the Nuk nipples and that seemed to do the trick . it 's too bad Nuk does n't make a medium flow nipple , but these definitely were not a good alternative .	-1
I have a 4.5 month old and these newborn nipples are too fast for my breastfed baby . He guzzles a 4 ounce bottle in less than 5 minutes , which is HORRIBLE for a breastfed baby . He doesnt know when hes full and ends up spitting up a ton after feeds . He also ends up with an upset tummy and is extra gassy because of them . Since this is the slowest flow Avent offers , Ive had to look for new bottles . I wish they made slower flow nipples because I really do like the bottles .	-1
New parent here . These do not work with our Avent bottles . Who knew there were slightly different sized nipples . Annoying . Have to return and replace .	-1
We brought these nipples based on all the raving reviews and write up 's online . However our newborn is now here and was n't putting on enough weight . Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and should n't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old . The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they 're unable to get enough . We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he 's feeding so much better .	-1
I purchased these because the regular nipples on my wide-neck Dr. Brown bottles have too fast of a flow for my 3 week old ( side note : these fit the Dr. Brown 's wide-neck bottles perfectly ) . These Avent # 1 nipples have the same problem : they are just too darn fast . My son choked on the milk from his bottle when we used these because the milk was pouring into his mouth . I see that some other reviewers with newborns have loved this nipple . I guess every infant 's needs are different .	-1
I would n't know if this product works or not because it does n't fit the bottles I have bought from the same company , i.e . Philips AVENT Natural Glass Bottles . Make sure you have the right bottle before you buy this .	-1
Do yourself a favor and save some money . If your old nipples do n't seem to have enough flow for your baby anymore , get a needle and make a few more holes into it . If still not enough , make a few more OR make a couple with a hot needle . That is all it takes .	-1
These brackets were very frustrating to install . Once you had them screwed in place , they were difficult to adjust to make them tight . In addition , they are bulky and white , making them very noticeable eyesores . There are much less cumbersome safety straps out there !	-1
I had incredible difficulty installing these and had to give up and return them after the screws that came with them kept breaking . I followed the instructions carefully , drilled pilot holes , etc. , and I still had difficulty . I am returning all of these in favor of angle braces . This is ridiculous .	-1
These might have worked better if I had bought different screws . I just could n't get these to work at all .	-1
So I really like that this gate is a walk through and does n't have to be screwed into the wall . Beware , there are still quite a few draw-backs . The first one is that it 's difficult to install . You twist and twist and twist all four of the touch points , and if you do n't do it just right , the gate will be wonky or pop out of the wall . My son has pulled it down several times because I cranked and cranked , but I still did n't get it quite tight enough . Also , the two touch points on the bottom for some reason fall out of the gate when it 's not installed , so if you 're storing this gate or not using it all the time , it 's super easy for one of those things to fall out in a closet or something , a toddler to walk off with them , and then never see them again , and then your gate is wonkier than ever . This gate does not work at the bottom or top of stairwells well at all , but is pretty decent in standard doorways . With stairs , it 's difficult to get it level and tight between a banister and a wall , especially because banisters do n't have a lot of flat space for the touch points , and secondly the step pedal often ends up not on a step , and so when you step on it , it can pull the gate down again ! It seems like now a gate that installs permanently would have been a better choice , but I got it for my mom 's house so she can just put it up while we 're in town and take it down for the rest of the year .	-1
I have several baby gates so it 's not that I did n't install it right . Its just that my daughter could rip this one right out . The others that I had held up when she would do her monkey in a cage routine but this one would rip out . It holds on for a while but still she can tear it down . So I would n't recommend it .	-1
So we had a little bit of an interesting situation . My husband and I were moving in to my parents ' house after they built their house . We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance , which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents ' house for when they had my daughter over there . It was barely used for the good part of that year , left open most of the time . Right before we moved in , my daughter ran into the gate ( was n't hurt , thank goodness ) but it broke apart . Not only was the outside covered in plastic , the entire hinge was made of plastic ! Are you kidding me ? That much for a gate and you ca n't even give me a durable hinge ? Sorry , but this was a waste of money !	-1
I thought this idea seemed great since my hands would be full once our baby arrived , but it did not work for us . We bought this for use in a doorway , but the foot pedal stuck out so that we never would have been able to close the door . The opening for this gate was also very narrow . We returned this for the North State Industries easy close gate , which we love .	-1
We still had to use hands to open be/c hitting it with your knee hurts . Also the plastic foot peddle started to warp after a few months of use .	-1
TL ; DR if you are looking for a great gate that will function well for 6 months , and inevitably break in unrepairable ways , this is the gate for you ! I loved these gates . We bought two of them and they were relatively easy to install and had been very effective at keeping our rambunctious 2 year old out of the kitchen and hallway . The foot petal requires quite a bit of pressure , and even kept our 6-yr old nephew contained pretty well : ) That being said -- their reliability over time is *horrendous* . These gates come with only a 90-day warranty , and both gates started breaking in obviously flawed ways within 6-months . The first gate stopped locking shut -- which is obviously a problem for a gate that is supposed to keep a 2 year old out of places . The problem is that the spring-loaded plastic peg can actually separate from the spring inside the end of the swinging door . I contacted the manufacturer and their customer support was very good ! They shipped out two replacement pegs and I was able to get the door working within a few days . That being said -- the issue will certainly happen again , as there is nothing preventing the spring from separating . This is a clear design flaw.Weeks later our second gate broke . This time the foot petal stopped actuating the pin , so the door will not open . After taking off the plastic assembly for the foot petal , I found that the metal pin which connects the plastic petal to the metal arm was completely broken ( in two places ) . After putting the pieces together , the issue became very clear -- the metal pin is tapered quite substantially in two places -- which is exactly where the pin broke . With people putting significant force on the foot petal to open the gate -- dozens of times a day -- is really unacceptable to have such an obvious weak point in the design of the metal pin.The problem with the pin being broken is that there 's clearly no way to actually reassemble the foot petal to the actuating arm -- even with a good pin . There is no way to fix this broken gate . Upon contacting the manufacturer 's customer service , they confirmed that there is on way to fix the foot petal and there is nothing they are willing to do to address the broken gate.In the end , we regret having bought these gates , and I am rather disappointed that the manufacturer does n't seem to acknowledge these design flaws in their gates . I think it also speaks volumes that they offer 1-2 year warranties on almost all of their baby products -- except the gates . Makes you really think ...	-1
The gate is decent construction , and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it . The mounts are n't sturdy.This gate only fits in our doorways , and this is with the extensions maxed-out to their maximum length . This does n't make for a secure fit in our doorways , and it is unusable anywhere else . It 's too small . It fits soundly in doors less than 30 & # 34 ; in width , so measure your doorway before you buy.The mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate , so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing , these fall out of the gate , and you have to balance these during installation.Yes , there are extensions available , but these are sold as an accessory , and with the combined cost , there are other better options available.I do n't recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler , lower-cost solution . Save yourself .	-1
I needed a gate for the top of the stairs , and searched Amazon for `` baby gate top of stairs . '' This gate is the second item returned . Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs . Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS . The gate works great in the upstairs hallway , but we 'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room .	-1
This gate went on sale very cheap so I bought and instead of sending it to me they sent me neosporin and returned my money . They did not even email me to let me know . I am very disapointed and I think its odd that they sent a tube of neosporin . Maybe it was for the hurt that not receiving my gate caused : )	-1
Color washed off within one month of use and its a little too bulky for a newborn . Recommend trying `` Baby Buddy Bear Pacifier Holder '' Love them .	-1
It looks cute but the wire is too short , the clip is big and hard which hurts my baby if he touches it .	-1
I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago . This clip is being used only when we go on car rides , so baby does n't lose her pacifier . Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself wo n't close all the way , so it does n't secure to anything . Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor . Very disappointed as it 's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder . Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill . Junk , do not buy !	-1
It is ok , but only works with certain kids of pacifiers . It does not work on gum drop brands.The clip does n't stay closed on most clothing .	-1
I actually liked this stool for the longest time . What I love about it is the slip-resistant top and bottom . However , as my kids got older and weighed more , I find that if they if they place their weight too much to one side it does tip over . They 've learned to be careful and we do still use this in their bathroom . My biggest problem with the stool is that the underside of the stool is made with a plastic grid and once my son fell on it when the stool was upside down and had to go to the hospital and get stitches in his knee . I was surprised that the plastic was able to cut him like that . Now , I know Baby Bjorn did not intend for this stool to be used upside down , but my kids are always moving this stool around to use it in different places , and sometimes they leave it upside down . These are just things to keep in mind if you purchase this stool . I obviously have n't thrown mine out , but I would n't buy another one & it probably should have gone into the trash after a visit to the emergency room .	-1
This product is not the safest step stool for kids especially little kids . My twins are 2 years old and we recently start using the step stool and the matching potty and to be honest both products are disappointing . This worked perfect in our guest bathroom where standing on top of a rag is well support . But my other bathroom is tile and it slides a lot regardless of the rubber underneath . Also the stool is quite small and both of my kids have fallen from it few times because they will step on the corner first and before they get the chance to put the other foot up they are on the floor . Before I even decided this will be a definite return my kids did not care to use it almost as if they were scared to go on it .	-1
Its probably because my baby is n't tall enough , but He ca n't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet . The top surface is nice , but the bottom needs more slide resistance .	-1
I thought this would be a bit higher - I 'm 5'5 but seem to be struggling to give my baby bath . would n't recommend	-1
Got this for our first child ( read : bought into the idea of buying the whole BabyBjorn potty training line to match ) . It 's only 6 inches tall so it 's your basic step stool . Obviously the product description already says that so that was n't a suprise . However , my son is 20 months , 95 percentile for height . When the faucet in the bathroom is on full-blast , this stool only allows him to get the tips of his fingers wet so I still have to pick him up to wash his hands . This does n't allow him to get on the `` adult '' toilet by himself nor can his feet touch when he 's sitting on the adult toilet ( which : ( a ) is bad for assisting him w/ # 2 since it 's better for him to plant his feet and `` brace himself '' rather than dangling his legs ; and ( b ) this requires me to hold him still while he 's sitting on the potty so he does n't fall backwards or forwards ) .If you want a basic step stool there are cheaper ones out there that are just as good.If you have a young child , this is n't the best option . Try a 2-step stool , such as the rubbermaid version , instead . For kids 4 and over this is probably fine , my nephew is close to 4 and this would probably work for him .	-1
I like Avent bottles but I dont trust these nipples . I dont think the water completely dries out of them so there is some residue that leaves it susceptible to mildew .	-1
This product great while it worked , but within a month of using it , the metal part of the adapter broke off and I have been unable to use it since . I used it maybe 4-6 times in that first month - not sure why the metal is so flimsy .	-1
Although they seem helpful for certain situations , I was n't too impressed . I 'm still glad that I have them in case someday they prove helpful .	-1
This was not very useful for us . We ended up nursing baby throughout our flight ( nursing is recommended since this helps with baby 's ears ' popping ) , and the strap on this flight vest is not long enough for baby to lie on my knees while i nurse her . So that meant we did n't use this vest at all !	-1
I purchased these to attempt to use with my breast pump ( Medela Freestyle ) to ease the pain and to wear at night . Neither worked . The did not fit on the flanges and I lost a lot of milk when I attempted to use them with the pump . When I attempted to wear them to ease pain and collect breast milk , that also failed . The shape is weird ( which means they can not be worn without being very noticeable ) and they seemed to leak no matter what I did . On top of that , they actually made me more sore . I would not recommend purchasing these .	-1
BOUGHT THESES FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW AND SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO USE THEM	-1
Unfortunately even when used properly they leaked . I ended up returning these because they did n't do the job . I have n't found a decent alternative so I 've been pumping one side as my daughter nurses on the other .	-1
I used these only to remain dry while my baby was nursing the other side . I reach for the nurse-dri shells that I received for free in the hospital first . These are big and bulky and I hate the design of them compared to other shells . I only reach these when my other shells are dirty . Plus i hate that they only recommend these for a certain length of time .	-1
Maybe good for moms who struggle with breastfeeding but I thought it was really poorly shaped and uncomfortable , there is no way you would ever wear this under clothing outside your own house !	-1
I bought these hoping to have a nice alternative to losing the milk that escapes when I become too full but these are definitely not the product for me . There is no way to hide these things , they are hard plastic and very apparent .	-1
they r too big an waaaay to obvious to wear . my nipples were very soar , and I tried to wear these things for a day but they kept moving and actually made my pain even worse .	-1
It made my breasts look funny , it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts . Hardly ever used it . : (	-1
I was looking forward to collecting any let down breast milk . After wearing these shells for a night , the silicone shell left these itchy welts on my breasts that have n't gone away after 2 days . : ( . If you look at the silicone part it has a weird yellow tinge to the silicone.I 'm going back to my Medela soft shells . They were made in Switzerland and the silicone looks clear not yellow tinged .	-1
I bought this for the leak side when I stay home , but the shape is weird , does n't stay on breast very well . It 's hard shell , not soft one that I hoped . when I put on with bra , feels hot ; when took it off , the milk still spill out , lost the purpose.I will not recommend this , disposable pads works better .	-1
I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.My windows in the back have a curved edge to them . You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area . Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window . The sun shines in through this lower corner . When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.If you can get it for free , get it . Do not purchase this item.I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses .	-1
I bought one of these and one of another brand , and put one in each car . The other one worked great , but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week . It simply was n't worth anything , since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable .	-1
Got these for my baby shower & installed them in my car ... they do not block the sunlight at all from the car -- might as well have nothing there for all the good they do . And the worst part is that the support on the bottom of the shade is flimsy plastic & bent within a month from the pressure of being attached by one suction cup so that there are `` wings '' pointing into my car . Terrible product & I am replacing them with a better brand . I will definitely read the reviews first this time ! !	-1
I bought this as a 2 pack with a coupon and got it for free , but it is not even worth it for free . It is a terrible product . The suction cups are constantly coming off and the whole shade falls off which does not seem too safe if baby is sitting under it . I threw them right in the trash . First years makes a better product .	-1
I had recieved this as a promotional item at Babiesrus so I did n't have to pay anything for it . Well , I got what I DID N'T pay for ! ! ! This thing does not stick to car windows and even if I made it stick , it would fall down before we even got out of the garage . Looking at the price of this item , it 's better to just spend a few extra $ $ $ and get something that will actually work..	-1
Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand . These are NOT dishwasher safe ! ! ! ! I have used them for only a couple months ( have a ten month-old who did n't start solids until 5 months ) . After just a month or so of use , the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one . They are awful . I wo n't use them anymore because I 'm worried about what could be getting into my baby 's food . I highly recommend you avoid this item .	-1
The basin on these spoons is so shallow that you can hardly get any food on them . It is a mess waiting to happen . Save your money and do n't buy these . I use them for one thing and that is decoration of my son 's spoon cup . They are lively and bright little spoons and much shorter than his others so they make a great decoration . I think that saying a spoon 's best use is as a decoration says it all .	-1
I used these temporarily since initially my nipples were cracked and bleeding . My husband had gotten me NUK-barely there at Walmart . I ordered these ( since I had their pump and loved it ) and another brand through Amazon to see if they were better , and they both failed miserably . My daughter latched on without problems with the NUK-barely there , but she hated these . I believe since they were thicker and bulkier she disliked them . After trying to use them multiple times , I gave up and ordered extra NUK-barely there nipple shields . Do n't waste your money on these .	-1
For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine . I do n't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag . Could not continue use of product .	-1
My nipples are difficult to be latched for my baby . And I feel very pain when I feed her everytime . I really hope this one can solve my problem but it disappoint me . It is hard to stick tightly on the breast , when my baby latched rubber nipples , it will become warped up on both sides , then it sticked on my baby 's cheeks , it 's so funny . The other important thing is it smells not good after I sterilize it even thought the ads said it odorless . I only tried once and will not use it again .	-1
Nipple shields in general are hard to use , but these were nearly impossible . It 's a great idea to have so much open space to allow for more mouth to skin contact from the baby , but I just could n't get them to stay on because there was so little area around the shield . If you 're a pro at using shields , then these are probably great . I just could n't get the hang of them .	-1
I could n't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase . I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield ( 20mm ) , the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield . Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand : Medela Contact Nipple Shield ( 20mm ) This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant . It 's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and `` sticks '' the best . The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning . I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes : 20mm and 24mm . It comes with just one shield , which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures , hoping that it would not be as high . Unfortunately , it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield , but also wider and thicker , making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch . Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands . In theory , the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact , but as another reviewer stated , all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes . Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side . I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields .	-1
Not all nipple shields are created equal ... these do n't stay on very well , they are thick ( not nipple like ) and large . Just fork up the money for a Medela shield ...	-1
The silicone was too thick for this , hard to keep it on . Might be handy if your kid is a super biter and otherwise does n't have any feeding issues .	-1
Horrible ! Too deep..	-1
I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems . I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this.I went with the Avent because overall , I am super impressed with their products . I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past.I do n't really recommend these specific nipple shields . I ca n't get them to stay in place and they are really akward . My daughter dislikes using them and I ca n't get her to nurse with these.If you are in the market for a nipple shield , go with the Medela brand ones . Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby .	-1
From what I 've seen , there are basically 3 methods used to eliminate/reduce gas in bottles : collapsible liners , one-way vents , and open airways . We 've tried various brands that use all 3 methods . These bottles are an example of one-way vents - the base is designed to let air flow in but prevent fluid from flowing out in the opposite direction . They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula , but they have two main problems : 1 ) they tend to leak if you do n't assemble correctly , and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn . 2 ) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle . This means a slight resistance to your baby 's suckling effort . The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby 's suckling.We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles . So if you 're looking for something to address a colic/feeding problem , that 's the way to go . But as previously mentioned , the best advice is to buy one of each and find what works for your little one .	-1
As a single , first time mom to a beautiful 7 week old baby girl who is currently using the drop in system , I wanted to try a bottle that I did n't have to continue to buy things for . So when I saw these , I jumped right on them , since they were supposes to help with gas and colic just like the drop ins , little did I know they were going to be such a pain ! I read the reviews saying that you could & # 34 ; actually hear the air escaping from the bottle ! & # 34 ; This is not the case.1 . There were so many bubbles in the bottle from her drinking that I was afraid it was going to give her gas not help stop gas.2 . After washing them one time and reassembling them like the instructions said , they leaked all over the place from the bottom of the bottle ! Talk about frustrating when you have a screaming baby wanting her bottle ! 3 . To heat up the drop in bottles I would warm up a cup of water in the microwave and drop the bottle into it . With these , it does n't work ! After waiting 10 minutes with her screaming in my arms for her bottle the formula was still extremely cold ! I had to run it under hot water for 10 more minutes for it to not be freezing , but it was still really cold ! And at 2am you do n't want to sit there with the water running forever just for the bottle to still be cold.Definitely not worth the money or your time ! Save yourself a headache and do n't even consider these bottles for your little one .	-1
I 've got a 2 week old . We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles . Great bottles , but the nipple was way too large for my son 's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip . So I tried Gerber for newborns ... smaller nipple , but more bubbles and gas for baby . So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas . But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it . Then I realized that the nipple does n't just have a hole in it like other bottles do . It has the slit-type hole , and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything 's going to come out . Well babies do n't suck that way . They suck at the wider part , naturally . But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle . ( They tell you not to do this . ) But it works perfectly now ... no gas , no sucking problems . Whew !	-1
The idea of the bottles is good . They do help to reduce air . However , to me , it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples . It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem . EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked ) , but for some reason they ALL had different flows ! Some would choke and gag him , some did n't even work and NOTHING would come out , some were okay ... you get the point . It was always a guessing game with these bottles . We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones did n't work . And when you have a hungry , fussy baby , its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that . On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to . Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed ! It was horrible . He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed . I felt that these bottles were very poor quality . Like I said , the idea of the VentAire is good , but the bottles just are n't up to my expectations .	-1
I 'm a dad of 14 month old twins . I PROMISE you one thing - these bottles are purchased only by first time parents ( like me ) . Anyone who 's on their second or third would tell you to save your money.I realize that every child is different , and some burp up more than others - but they ALL burp up and they ALL get gas . Some more than others.Parents get so frustrated and worried about their babies that they try ANYTHING different . One thing seems to 'do the trick ' when the problem was ready to stop on its own.We tried every bottle gimmick sold on Babies-R-Us . On the third use of this one , the bottom came loose , and there was formula everywhere.Since our twins were 2 months , we have been using the plain old Evenflo bottles from any grocer . They cost about 99 cents each.They work great . There 's a bottle , ring and nipple . All of the gimmick bottles have half a dozen parts that need to be individually cleaned , or come apart , or leak.Think about it - Playtex , Gerber , Avent , Evenflo - they all sell the same simple three-piece bottle , but they also sell some sort of state-of-the-art bottle that 's supposed to cure all of your baby 's ills . So how could they in good conscience continue to sell those cheap , gas-inducing , old-fashioned bottles ? Because they work ; because all of the repeat parents buy them ; and because all new parents eventually need to buy a bottle that does what it 's supposed to .	-1
Let me start by saying that we used Playtex Ventair bottles with my first child . The bottles were great -- durable and well-made . We used them throughout her `` bottle-hood '' -- for over a year . No problems.However , we began using these again with our second child . We were excited to hear that they were BPA-free and with our past experience with Playtex bottles , we were happy to purchase these.Within 3 weeks , the ink on the bottles came off of them . So we had to use sharpie pens to mark the ounces . And within 3 months , they began to leak . We bought about 20 bottles ... from a various number of stores . So now we are stuck with 20 leaking bottles that require a sharpie every few weeks . Perhaps it was because we washed them in the dishwasher ... but really , the bottles should be prepared to handle that.Please do n't waste your money on these bottles . They appear great at first but go downhill quickly .	-1
The vent in the bottom of the bottle makes it very easy for baby to extract milk . The flow is fast and furious which is good if your baby has trouble feeding from non-vented bottles . However , the high flow can overflow the capacity of my baby 's mouth ( & lt ; 2mo old ) which leads to messiness.Other drawbacks are that occasionally the vent holes leak . There are also many different parts that need to be disassembled for cleaning.I have both the `` wide '' and `` standard '' versions and there is n't any difference when it comes to feeding . The nipples are basically the same and my baby has no preference . I prefer the wide version because it is shorter ( & lt ; 7 '' ) which makes it easier to fit into wall cabinets.As far as reducing gas , I have n't noticed any difference between these bottles andThe First Years Breastflow Bottlewhich I also use . I typically prefer The First Years bottle because of the slower flow . However , this may not be a problem once my baby gets bigger.UPDATE : After using this for a couple months , I find it is too much of a pain to deal with the multiple different seals and rings . It makes cleaning and assembling more difficult and there do n't seem to be any obvious benefits to it compared to simpler bottles .	-1
These bottles suck ! A complete waste of money , maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road . They are a HUGE pain to use . For one you ca n't use a bottle warmer ( the water seeps up into bottle ) . We had to hold it under running water which takes forever . It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples . If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown 's bottles , they have more parts but easy to put together .	-1
My daughter could n't get anything out of this bottle and it frustrated her . I thought at first it was bc we were trying to introduce her to the bottle ( she used one when first born until I got my mastitis under control but we did n't keep up with it ) at first she used avent , I liked those bottles but she refused them later on . She tried so hard with this bottle where she would n't give advent a chance . Same as many others I read on here , half hour she got half an ounce . We got dr browns and instant success ! There 's something that does n't set well with me when you are n't supposed to steam sterilize this bottle . It 's junk , and I 'm glad to see it was n't just my daughter struggling to drink from this bottle . I am only trying to get her on a bottle bc i have to get my wisdom teeth pulled and wo n't be able to nurse her for 24hrs . It 'll also be handy to be able to pump and bottle feed her when we move in a couple weeks . Go with Dr browns if you are transitioning your baby to a bottle , you wo n't be sorry !	-1
Pissed is an understatement . I purchased these bottles to decrease the amount of air that my daughter was sucking in and these bottles came highly recommended . The first set I purchased began to leak from the bottom and from around the cap so I thought it was a bad batch and exchanged them for another set . Last night while I was feeding my daughter I am thinking that she is drinking the milk but it was leaking from the side of the cap and down into her neck and onesie on this new set ! I switched bottles and gave her another one . This morning I shake the bottle over the sink to make sure that the rice and breastmilk are mixed in good before feeding her and the cap which I just checked just popped off and breastmilk went flying all over the sink . 6 ounces of milk just gone ! These bottles leak from the bottom and after many uses the ring around the cap warps so it does n't screw on and stay flush with the bottle itself . I am done at this point and these bottles are going back to BRU and I am going to do what I should have done in the beginning and just go with Dr. Brown 's bottles . I would never recommend these crappy bottles to anyone !	-1
After buying ten packs ( on top of the ones that came with the bottles ) of the nipples for these bottles , we gave up and used our Advent bottles that we did n't want to use . For some reason , no matter which store purchased at , every nipple ( Stage 1 and Stage 2 ) seemed to not be opened to allow milk to come out . Our daughter has some serious suction , so I thought that the Stage 1 was already outgrown and tried the 2 . These bottles and nipples have been just a waste of money for us . I am sure that I can use a straight pin and open them more , but `` you 're not supposed to '' ...	-1
I 'm actually not a fan of these bottles , but for me , the problem lies moreso with the nipple . My son spent half his energy trying to suck the formula out of them . Even after going up a size , it did n't seem to make a difference . I gave up after a few feedings . Also , when he did manage to actually eat , he would still get fussy and gassy- an issue these bottles claim to reduce . In my opinion , there are better bottle options out there .	-1
I thought this would keep my feet warm while nursing but when it arrived it felt cheap and it moved too much to be useful . Perhaps it works if you do n't have a wood floor .	-1
I love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive , but my 10 week old son just can not get comfortable in it . I keep thinking he 's just too small and is getting lost in it , but even as he grows I am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better . I really want to use this sling , but I feel like he 's either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him , he 's too close to the edge and will tumble out . The edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick . I 'll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap , but perhaps it 's just a little too much work for a newer baby.If this company or any other consumer , has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling , I would love to hear from them . Email me at : Jul262003 @ yahoo.com	-1
I was excited when my husband brought it home since I had read some good reviews , however after placing my son in it his chin was on his chest and not comfortable for him at all . Also the material was in his face . I followed directions and thought I had it right , mabye they should send out someone to show me how it works . I gave it a 2 since it is stylish & I hope it works in a few weeks when my son can hold his head up and he can sit in it ... we 'll see . Wish I had saved my receipt !	-1
My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long ... He wasnt the tiniest baby ... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing ... It 's the WORST product ever , I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill ...	-1
I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder ! ! ! The shoulder strap is too narrow , it digs in , and I only had it on for a couple seconds . I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it ! ! ! !	-1
I was very excited to get this sling . I love that most people do n't realize I 'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you do n't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby . The outside zipper pockets are great for keys , cell , wallet , etc. , and the style is great ( it looks more like a messenger bag until you 're close up ) & I 've recieved lots of complements . My 2 mo . old dd is very comfortable sitting in it.That said , I would not buy it again . My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in . The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation ( very unsafe , not to mention inconvenient for adjusting ) . The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & does n't distribute weight well .	-1
I have three baby carriers . It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me . I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside . My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he was n't looking too confortable.When he got older ( 5 mounths ) we bought a backpack carrier . This is a really really a nice buy . We loved it and so did our son . The problem with it is that I would n't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside.So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier . I think that 's the best for newborns because they do n't have to support any body part . More over , when the baby sleeps , he is in a nice position and they seem to like it ( even though I though his head was in a weird angle ? ! ? ! ) As soon as the baby gets heavier ( 8 or 9 lbs ) it 's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do . It slips from its place so the head of the child does n't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest ( so when you have a large breast the baby 's head is really really in a weird angle ! ) . I think that it does n't worth the price for the time you use it . Now that my younger son is 5 mounths , I do n't use it anymore .	-1
Looks cute and colorful . Brush is not bad . Comb bristles are way thin/sharp/hard for adults , let alone a baby . Will be returning the set .	-1
My 7 month old does n't like the spouts , she just chews on them ... maybe this will change as she gets older .	-1
As I have stated with the trainer set , they are okay if your child takes to them , just do n't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it . I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent ) and trying first . If it works , then buy more sets online . You will know within days if your child will take to it .	-1
They advertise it , or it shows if you search for soft spout and they are hard . They are probably a good option to convert your bottles into sippy cups , but my son did not like them . I think also it does not help that they are green so he paid even more attention that they looked different .	-1
These create lots of tiny bubbles that my son swallows when he drinks from this top . It 's a terrible design because the rubber on the back side covers the air vent and the spout so the air gets sucked into babies mouth instead of back in the cup . Boo ! I was really excited to still use my Avent bottles to transition to cups , but this prodect does n't cut it , I ended up buying other sippy cups .	-1
The Design of these needs to be more natural or shorter , baby has to open his mouth really big to get this in . He just looks at it and wants to play with the bottle instead of try to drink from it . It 's too `` weird '' looking I guess , he pushes it away every time I 've tried it . I also think it 's too long for him to put his little mouth over on his own . This is not a good trainer spout that 's for sure , maybe for older kid , it 's more like a wide straw then sippy spout .	-1
These are not nearly as good as the yellow ones . They leak every time . I use them with the Pura bottles and have used the yellow Avent spouts since the beginning but have been unable to find them so I finally just bought these thinking they would be just as good . They 're not .	-1
I really wanted to like this mat and elbow pad set . Unfortunately , we have a really deep tub , so the sides are tall and the cute little piece in between the elbow pad and mat is n't long enough . I use it , detached from the mat on the bottom because it does save my knees , but I ca n't use the net because now it is flimsy without the bottom attached and wo n't hold anything . So , if you have a deep tub , just get the bottom part , otherwise , it will just be a waste of money .	-1
This item is a great IDEA . Key word , 'IDEA'.PROS : - It 's a 4-in-1 : elbow rest , knee rest , storage pocket for wash/shampoos , and then later can be used as a stepping stool.- Cute little ice animal theme , polar bears , penguins , whales , etc.- The elbow rest has suction cups that attach to the tubside.- The little storage pockets that hang on the side are helpful for all those crazy bath toys and products babies come with.CONS : - What I did not consider before purchasing this item was the placement of my bathtub 's faucet and the toilet . We have two bathrooms , and both bathtubs , on the side where the faucet is the toilet is directly next to it . Generally , if one were to be giving their child a bath , they would be right by the faucet so that they could control the water flow/temperature ... . With toilets directly next to my bathtubs , I ca n't exactly kneel with 3 inches between the two porcelain objects . Hah . I sit uncomfortably on the closed toilet instead and lean over the whole time , which SUCKS.- The stool does not raise up to be any higher than what the picture shows . It is a very VERY short stepping stool , and will be useless for quite a while.- The suction cups for the elbow rest POP OFF almost every time you lean on it , which defeats the purpose . They were very hard to get to stay put in the first place before anyone ever leaned on it.- Also , the top of the elbow rest CRACKED after maybe the 2nd time we used it.Conclusion : I LOOOVED the idea of this product . Still have n't seen a similar product , but I was very disappointed with the quality and exact features of this , and I was frustrated with myself for not considering that I could n't even use this feature because of my bathroom set-ups . This will be up for sale at my next garage sale .	-1
The kneeling stool is great . The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool ... Very useful ! BUT ... the elbow pad is a joke ! There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic . Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all . It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it . I do n't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great . I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews , you try to find it used so that you do n't have to pay retail .	-1
The kneeler is not very sturdy . I was not comfortable kneeling on it , and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion . If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning , I 'm not impressed . I might as well kneel on a folded towel . I was hoping for something that would be soft . Also , the construction of the item is not very sturdy . It is made of plastic , and it does not seem at all durable . The elbow & quot ; cushion & quot ; is also not very soft . It is not secure , either . When I leaned against it to test it , it slid right off . If I 'd been busy bathing my baby , I would have tumbled into the tub with him . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
My post baby weight was over 200lbs , if you are over 200 lbs , this is not for you . I was only a few pounds over that so I thought `` it will be safe '' . Err ! Wrong answer , I cracked the kneeler portion . What a blow to the postpartum ego .	-1
I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift . I thought it would be great . My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor . Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke . The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes , its a great picture day or night . The camera is kind of a pain , though . The way that it is angled , you need to mount it on the wall above the crib , or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib . I do n't have that , so we only really use it for the sound . The monitor is very large , though , and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room . This model has too many problems I would n't buy it if I could do it over again .	-1
the head support doesnt fit to my car seat . my baby head is squeeze and i guess it only fit in the stroller . i like the touch of it but i have to return it .	-1
My daughter was small , but this really seemed very cumbersome to use . Did n't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support .	-1
I bought this because it looked so cuddly and snuggly for my baby and because so many people had reviewed it as being helpful for keeping newborn heads where they should be in the carseat . It is nice and soft and cuddly , and made of much nicer fabric than that ghastly polyester grayco liner , but I did not find it helpful and I did not find that it positioned my baby any better than she was in the carseat on her own.My main concern with this product is not that my baby will fly out of her carseat in a crash as warned by the 1-star reviews , my concern is that this did not prevent her head from flopping FORWARD -- infact , it was difficult for me to position the head pillow in a way that did n't make forward-flopping worse . This chin-to-chest posture can restrict airflow . Newborns ca n't necessarily protest or lift their heads to compensate when they 're being deprived of oxygen . I was warned about this at my baby-carrier group ( before the sling recall , where some of the babies died for this exact reason ) and it was something I worried about when my daughter was young because her head seemed to always fall forward in the carseat , even when it said it was well-positioned.I would not recommend this product to a new parent . It looks really cozy , but it did n't stop my daughter 's head from flopping in the direction I consider most dangerous , and it really only even fit around her in her carseat for a matter of weeks anyway . I love other products from this company ( like the swaddle-me ! ! ! ) but the snuzzler is just another piece of baby junk that I could have done without .	-1
I wrote an earlier review giving this warmer 5 stars because it heated the bottles so fast and the cooler portion made it easy to use anywhere in the house and travel . BUT I noticed that the ON/OFF switch SPARKED EVERY TIME you turned it off.Luckily , I had kept the box so I just exchanged it for another only to discover the second did the exact same thing ! This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD ! I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply . I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing . Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem , avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand ! Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT ! The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use . ( I would n't be surprized if this gets recalled ! )	-1
Personally I think bottle warmers are a waste of money . If your baby is hungry they want to eat now and do n't want to wait for a bottle to warm up in this thing . It takes too long . I got one for my shower and I 'm so mad that I threw the box away because I wish I could return it . I have always just warmed the bottle in the microwave . So many people are against that but as long as you shake up the bottle before you feed the baby there 's no problem . Only an idiot would n't check the temp before feeding their baby anyway . SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE THE MICROWAVE . It 's so much faster ! !	-1
The only reason why I 'm giving this a 1 star is not for the convenience it provides to others , but because it is so not necessary to have ... another baby product on the market that is not needed . I , being a first time mom , wanted all the baby products out there ! Well ... I too read all the reviews for this item , registered for it , and received it as a gift . Well ... we found absolutely no use for it . If you start your baby with warming his milk , then you 're only getting him use to it . I 'm sure most everyone either receives the Arrowhead or Sparkletts ( or other ) bottled water in their homes ... well , the water is already at room tempreature ... no need to `` warm '' it up in the bottle warmer device ... just add your formula in the bottle , shake and give to your baby ! It 's already leukewarm . The only time I warm up the bottle is if it 's been in the fridge ... at that point , I just run it under hot water to warm it up . My baby does not have 5+ mins to wait ... nor do I ! Save your $ $ and/or those of your friends/family who get it for you !	-1
I thought that I just had to have this bottle warmer . Boy was I wrong . I found this warmer to be more of a hasssle than anything . I used Avent bottle ( which I love - no gas ! ! ) so maybe the bottles are the problem - who knows . The bottles were either too hot or too cold . It is just as easy to install an instant hot water thingy on your faucet and make a warm bottle in seconds .	-1
I just do n't like this product . Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot . I just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way . It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product .	-1
Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice . It allows the bottle to be stored on low for 8 hours and actually will boil water if need be !	-1
I use platex nurser with the disposable liners , and when I tried to heat it in the warmer sometimes it would be cold other times it would get so warm that the liner would leak . I would not recommend buying this item . It is much easier just to the bottle in a glass on warm water	-1
I am very disappointed in this product . These nipples do n't fit any of my Medela , Evenflo , Avent , or Similac bottles . Totally worthless purchase . After having ordered these , I found out that they cost less at Babies'r'us . I do not recommend this product .	-1
These nipples certainly were n't & # 34 ; fast & # 34 ; for anything but water . Formula barely comes through . Slower than the slow-flow ! The other Playtex nipples I 've bought are n't BPA free and they work MUCH better .	-1
With my first child I used the Playtex Drop-Ins , then switched to the standard VentAire once I got tired of buying more liners all the time . They worked great , so when purchasing bottles for our second child , I went ahead and purchased a full set of the VentAire Wide ( 6 of the 6oz and 4 of the 9oz ) along with extra nipples and discs . This was apparently a mistake . Our new little one is 2 weeks old and I 've had numerous issues with these bottles . Sometimes my little one will suck and suck and make no progress , other times the formula comes out so fast he chokes and gags on it . I frequently have to replace the top or bottom of the bottle to find a combination that works . I 've even had the leak out the bottom a couple of times for no apparent reason . I always make sure the pieces are dry before assembling the bottle and that the bottom vents are free from obstruction . 2 weeks in and I 'm already this frustrated , I ca n't imagine another year of this nonsense . I 'm going out to purchase a couple of different bottles to see if we can find one that works better for us .	-1
Bought these because my boy has acid reflux and is supposed to eat upright . I was hopful they would work well . However they leak . No matter what I tried they leaked . Had others try them for me , they leaked for them . They are not worth the money , I wo n't even attempt to sell them at a yard sale because I dont want to burden anyone with the frustration of a leaky bottle . DO NOT BUY .	-1
Bottle warmer fail . formula leaked from the bottom of the bottle where the vents are located . I hesitated but tried it in the warmer any way on the second use . First time I warmed the formula in a Dr. Brown bottle , this time I did n't want to create extra clean up work for myself . I ended up having to clean the bottle warmer , the counter top , the VentAire bottle and the feed to and finished Dr. Brown bottle.This is by far the worst venting system ever .	-1
I ca n't even use this bottles yet because they arrived with FAST flow nipples , although the picture clearly shows a box with SLOW flow ones ! Annoying , inconvenient , and a hassle . Thanks amazon . Urgh .	-1
My three month old daughter is breastfed and we thought we 'd give these bottles a go . I was hopeful that she might like the VentAire bottles , but they were a fail . We tried both the slow and fast flow nipples in these bottles and she was n't able to get anything out of the bottle with either flow rate . It was disappointing to say the least.Even though the bottles did n't work for us , I 'm sure they probably work well for someone 's baby , so I will try to give you a run down on the bottles contained in this set . The set contains three nine ounce bottles with the fast flow nipple . There are no additional replacement valves for the vent with the set as there are in the newborn starter set.Other reviewers have stated that they had leaking issues with these bottles . In the few times that we attempted to use these bottles we did n't have any leaking issues , but I 'm sure they could happen given that the bottom screws on and has holes in it that are covered with the silicone valve vent.The bottles feel pretty comfortable in your hand . I have used bottles in the past that are not comfortable to hold , so I think it 's worth mentioning that it fits nicely in your hand.When it comes to cleaning these bottles you can be sure you have every nook and cranny clean since it fully disassembles , but that also means that you have lots of pieces to keep tabs on . The bottle has six parts total.Overall , while the bottles look nice , I think the Ventaire concept is really a gimmack and a poorly executed one at that . What good is a bottle if it 's nearly impossible to get anything to come out of it ? Personally , I 'd pass on these bottles and try either the Avent bottles or the Playtex Drop Ins .	-1
We are loyal to the Soothie line of bottles and so forth , they have always worked well for us . I tried these hoping that it would help my baby sleep better with less gas but there were several problems right away . She did n't seem to like the shape , and it was kind of awkward for her . It was really hard to get the top just so , so it would n't leak . And the bottle will not fit in most warmers . I would n't choose this one again .	-1
These were SUCH a pain to clean and use - my kitchen looked like a science lab . I threw them all out .	-1
These were great at first , we loved the size and `` tilt '' feature . However , we stopped using them because nipples would clog . We also use some formula that might be clog-prone , but we did n't have this problem with our other brand of bottles .	-1
I bought one of these bottles because i likes the idea of being more like the breast , and i wanted to breast feed . I couldnt breastfeed but my son only really likes `` dome '' type nipples . I tried giving him this bottle and he couldnt get anything out of it ! He was just sucking air . I looked at the ammount in the bottle after a few minutes and he hadnt gotten anything . I tried twisting the top of the nipple to `` open '' the hole and tried again . he still had the same problem ! I use the normal ventaire ones and he love them and has no problem !	-1
Dr. Brown 's bottles did n't solve the gas issue , but neither did Playtex Vent Aire . Aside from the fancy name , Playtex did not reduce baby 's painful gas ( from breast milk ) . Also , the bottom can leak if not forcefully tightened - I lost 2 ounces of precious breast milk with these lousy Playtex bottles which were recommended by the women 's clinic . For people who produce little breast milk , losing 2 ounces is like losing large 24 karat gold nuggets in the sink . The number of parts to clean is comparable to Dr. Brown 's bottles , but Dr. Brown 's bottles at least provides you with a cleaning brush to clean the interior nipple ; with Playtex , you 're out of luck . I think that I heard the venting taking place ONCE when Playtex Vent Aire was dry . Since then , even when dry , I rarely hear the venting of air . All Playtex does is make you vent your frustrations in the product reviews .	-1
These bottles were a gift at our baby shower . I am glad I did n't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer . We all know you are n't supposed to microwave bottles either , so you are left with the only other option , placing the bottle in boiling water to warm . That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby , the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm , and potentially onto the baby ! Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby . USE CAUTION	-1
I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter . They have n't helped at all , and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place . I will be calling Playtex to request a refund .	-1
The only word that comes to mind to describe this bottle is garbage ! It leaks and is cheaply made . I 'm a nurse and used to working with all types of equipment and I know junk when I see it . All babies get gas , all babies need to burp . The bottom line is the basic 99 cent bottle at your local supermarket will do the job !	-1
These bottles are horrible , first I got only two of this brand because of an emergency since I 've always used Dr. Browns but they got contaminated in the dishwasher , so I had to run and get at least two of this meanwhile cause Dr. Browns wide neck are hard to find at retailers in my area , so we used these two bottles for 2 days first they come with fast flow wich is Waaay to fast for my little guy and I would say any other baby younger than 6 months old , so I decided to get two nipples medium flow , guess what still fast , specially if You have a gassy baby , then in the last try I got the slow flow and guess what again , tooooo slow , It was like a nightmare , I had to use the small 4ozs Dr. Browns I had at home wich my baby is already drinking 5 ozs so ... These Playtex bottles leak horrible , and when you place them in the bottle warmer even worse because they get water in middle of the bottom rim , so they will be leaking anyways , for the amount of parts to clean up , I did not mind I 'm used to it , cause I 've always used Dr. Browns wich have several parts , these Playtex bottles got my baby full of gas wich defeats the porpouse of them bottles , they make so much bubbles in the nipples you can see and hear them , and the last thing is the nipple collapses so bad my baby stoped getting the flow and the nipples are really hard . bottom line , I ordered my 3 set of Dr. Browns wide neck shipping next day and I 'll be ordering a second set very soon . Dr. B best bottles ever specially for gassy babies .	-1
I used these for literally a few days after my son was born . Then I switched back to the bottles my daughter had used a couple years prior . I 'm glad I saved those because I could n't stand these . They leaked everywhere , the nipples were flimsy and my son had the hardest time trying to get anything out of them . I had to switch him to the larger stage and STILL he had problems . Playtex makes decent sippy cups but their bottles are useless .	-1
I dont know what kind of crazy closet bar we have , I know it is new and was purchased at a hardware store ... and these do not fit . I really like that too =/	-1
I bought this mirror because it was far larger than the adjustable suction-cup mirror I had on the rear windshield of my car . I discovered negative # 1 in the store : it uses a giant safety pin ( as well as a strap ) to attach to the seatback . My car has a leather interior , and the last thing I wanted to do was poke holes in the leather ! I tried just using the strap , but that is supposed to go around the headrest , and there is no headrest for the center of the backseat , just the right and left sides . Since the safest place for a baby is in the headrest-less center , the strap was out . There was also a velcro tape that we could use to stick the mirror onto the seatback . The negatives there were a ) sticky glue residue on the leather and b ) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large , the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be , so we 'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it . Highly impractical for any vehicle with a leather interior or with a rear seat that folds down in the middle . I suppose it 's okay for a fabric-covered seat or for a small car that does n't have fold-down rear seats , but for an SUV or minivan it 's really not usable .	-1
This is a good enough idea , but it does n't work . I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on . It falls off about 3 times a day . If I use the oven it falls off within minutes .	-1
I used it for a few days and I felt very safe but as soon as I washed the stove the 3m stickies came off . I was very disappointed . Thinking of getting more stickies to try it out again .	-1
It worked well for a few weeks then the adhesive wore off and quit sticking . Now it is just a crappy piece of plastic .	-1
The box specifically states the brands of pumps it supposedly fits , but I could not get the threading to fit on my Lansinoh pump .	-1
I am currently using the adapters to connect my Medela Symphony Kit to my Avent bottles.Cons:1 . The adapters leak where it screws into the bottle . It is very annoying to pump and still leak milk all over your clothes.Pros:1 . It can be used with Medela kits .	-1
This product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place . i 'm taking mine out of the car today . I 'll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat .	-1
I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not . They do not & quot ; grip & quot ; our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit . We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners . They advised us the us to use shelf liner . I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner . It works the same and is more attractive .	-1
I think this is a waste of money . Not very useful . There are better ones out there .	-1
I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back . They did not grip our leather seats , and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back , and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later have n't felt like I missed them a bit . These are unecessary and really a pain .	-1
We had our car seat checked at the local police station , and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat . In case of an accident or a problem with the car seat , using any additional product ( such as this mat or an attached fleece covering ) may void the warranty of your car seat !	-1
Like other reviewers , I have had nothing but problems with this thing ! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all . You have to figure out on your own how much water to use , and then , you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot . There is a little ring piece , which is not attached , and if you lose it , the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes ! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use . It gets a brown build-up in the bottom , and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out . The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically , which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out . We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working .	-1
As a first time mother , I thought this would be a great purchase . I was wrong ! It takes way too long to heat up , it would be just as fast holding the bottle under hot water . Do n't waste your money on this !	-1
We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys . We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes , which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time , and its too cold or too hot , which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in . At 3AM , this is just too much trouble . Also , it lacks a countdown timer , a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time , and does n't have a water reservoir . The Dr. Browns is much better , and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns , First Years and Playtex bottles .	-1
I was really disappointed with this warmer it takes a long time to heat and it heats unevenly . Also , according to the chart for the amount of water us I find myself using more than what it says if not I end up with cold milk .	-1
I got this warmer as a shower gift . It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature . It has drawbacks , though . I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge . It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it , and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube . We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle .	-1
I was so excited to purchase this for such a low price . I hated thinking about thawing milk on the stove while my baby sat waiting & hungry , so I could n't wait to try this quicker approach.However , when I read the manual , it stated the warmer could only be used once every TEN minutes . I prayed and hoped it would thaw it out the 1st try so my baby would n't get fussy while waiting for it.Unfortunately , after using the warmer , the milk was still mostly frozen and had `` hot spots . '' As you know , this is the reason you do n't use the microwave . So I ended up sticking the milk in a cup of hot water from the sink and waiting 10 minutes instead.The next time I tried to use this , I tried recently expressed milk from the refrigerator . I thought surely it would be better this time since it was not frozen.No such luck . It made the milk WAY too hot , and on top of that the unit was oozing some kind of bronze colored metallic substance . EW . I do n't know what happened , since I followed instructions clearly.This was the biggest waste of money . I recommend filling a mug with water , microwaving for 2 or 3 minutes and then placing the milk container in the hot water . This way , milk is warm fairly quickly , there are no hot spots , no breastmilk nutrients are lost , and most importantly -- it 's FREE ! : )	-1
I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn 's bottle . She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick . NO SUCH LUCK . The product review says it 's stylish but who cares ? What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither . It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated , the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding . The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature ... a real time sucker when you 're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby . I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this did n't help . I 'm lucky I did n't throw away my trusty little pot since I 'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove .	-1
This bottle warmer was horrible . If you are formula-feeding , just use the microwave . Really . It takes so much less time , and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly . Sometimes they would be scalding hot , sometimes ice cold ( and then you have to wait until it 's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again ! ) . Not only that , but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle . Meanwhile , my baby is screaming because he 's hungry and wants that bottle ! ! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it 's the same temperature EVERY time.If you 're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.Otherwise , what is the point ? ?	-1
This warmer works when it wants to which means only when i 'm testing it and never when I need to warm a bottle at 3 am ! I 'll plug it in and nothing happens . I already threw away the box , so i 'm hoping Amazon will still let me return it ! I 'll be trying a different brand all together .	-1
Good concept , poor execution . Hard to use , and the instruction manuals suggested water amounts are way off base , in my experience . Wife and I got so frustrated with the warmer 's inconsistent results that we 've gone back to the old fashioned warming method - setting the bottle in a cup of warm water . That method works much better . The bottle warmer concept is solid and attractive , but this particular model fails . Do not buy .	-1
The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly . Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing , it either came out too hot or too cold . Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer . Despite following the instructions to a tee , the bottles NEVER came out perfect . We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby.To make things short , I 'll say this : Use the stove or microwave . Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine , you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer .	-1
totally not working ! returned it . you had to add hot water to heat the bottle while it does not work .	-1
This warmer worked well for a few months . The switch stopped working and the warmer would turn on as soon as it was plugged in . Now the heating function never turns off , so I have to watch the bottle carefully before it overheats the formula . I still use it , I just do n't walk away from it because I know it wo n't turn off on its own as it should .	-1
2 weeks of use . It does n't shut off so it overheats and smells like burnt plastic . Dangerous item.When it was working , it is really long to heat up a bottle on top of the headache to figure out the amount of water to add . My screaming hungry baby hated it , took many minutes for a 3oz bottle and it was either too cold or too hot .	-1
I have twins and it takes longer to warm in this than the sink and you have to wait ten minutes between each bottle .	-1
We have the First Years Day and Night Bottle Warmer ( with the cooler on the back ) for use upstairs , and loved it so much that I decided to order what I assumed to be the same item without the cooler for the kitchen counter downstairs . It never heated the bottles as well as the one that we had , and the bottles gradually got less and less warm , until the warmer did n't work at all . We used it less than ten times , and the entire thing totally crapped out . I ignored the bad reviews and really , really wanted to like this item because I love the cooler/bottle warmer so much ! Back to Amazon it goes !	-1
This is the worst bottle warmer ever . The bottles were either too hot and I mean smoking hot or not warm enough . Using this thing was the same as just heating a bottle up in a pot ! You could never leave the bottle , walk away and come back hoping that it would be the right temperature . I would have to put her bottles in , stand there and check every minute or so . The water tube that comes along with it does not hold enough water to warm her bottle sufficiently . We had to pour at least three tubes worth of water in there to get her 5 ounce bottle warm . I ordered the Dr. Browns bottle warmer and am in love ! This mess is going back immediately .	-1
This product is simple and easy to use , but it 's not reliable . Even if you put the same amount of water in it and a bottle with the same amount of milk each time - the temperature will be different . This can also be dangerous . I 've placed a bottle in this warmer only to find it 's half cold . Adding more water continues the heating process , but now the milk can reach a dangerously high temperature . Many times I 've had to add a little cold milk , to make the bottle safe to use . I initially liked this product , but am ditching it because of its unreliability .	-1
The water vial that is attached to this unit just sits ever so gently on the side meaning IT FALLS OFF CONSTANTLY . It was so annoying I returned it . I 'm a mom on the go so I would throw this in my bag and take it with me but it was always a chore to have to find the missing water vial . I much prefer the Munchkin High Speed bottle and food warmer , the water vial stays firmly in place . But with any bottle sterilizer you have to make sure you do n't lose the ring that goes around the top , too bad those do n't snap in .	-1
It may be my son only but he does n't care if his bottles are cold or warm and I use water that is in gallon containers which sit on the counter so his bottles are generally at room temperature anyway . This product did work , however , for my standard size Playtex Vent Air bottles but did not heat up my friend 's wide mouth bottles when she tried to use it . All in all , this was a pointless purchase on my part ; but the return of the item was easy cheesy !	-1
This product is poorly constructed , requires patience and you do n't have that with a baby crying . It does n't heat to a temperature the baby would like , so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards . Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on . After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it .	-1
We bought this warmer to heat up bottles for our new baby , and so far we 've only used it for that purpose . It 's okay for $ 15 . We use it several times a day so it is at least worth that . It 's a really cheap , crappy looking design , but I guess you get what you pay for.Pros : - Does the job most of the time . Probably helps that our baby is not too picky when it comes to bottle temperature.- Done heating fast , usually in under 2 minutes.Cons : - Cheap feel/design/on button- Does n't heat the bottle too well , even with `` max '' amount of water . Formula ends up lukewarm . We use this to heat up 4 oz . of formula , I ca n't imagine how poorly it will heat bigger bottles ! - You ca n't turn it off once it 's on by pushing the button . It does turn itself off after the heat cycle is done , though.- Could be a fire hazard , saw a spark under the unit the first week I had it . Has n't done it since , however it 's probably not a good idea to leave the unit on & walk away.Overall it 's just okay . Not too impressed , I 'm sure there are better models out there but this one does the job for now.UPDATE : Updating to say this bottle warmer only lasted baby 's first 3 months . It rusted on the inside despite maintenance , and we were even careful not to leave liquid sitting in it . Since it 's rusted so badly we ca n't use it for our upcoming baby . We 've been using a hot glass of water to heat bottles and that works better than this warmer . I changed my rating to 2 stars because for the price , it did work for a while , but I would n't recommend it to anyone .	-1
I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles , but it is not working for me . I try to set it so that I can turn it on , go change the baby then it would be ready . This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results . Whenever the light turns off , the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming . If I wait too long it 's too hot , so I have to stand there and wait for it . Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it . Do n't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I 'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap . Very disappointed .	-1
I bought this warmer thinking it 's more convenient than warming milk with hot water , but actually it is not ... the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want ! It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed . Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again , if a bottle is not warm enough , you have to use something else anyway ! The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again , but it may actually take longer than that ... I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer .	-1
This bottle warmer broke after the first week . It takes FOREVER to warm the bottles and then it does n't even warm them . I 'm trying to get a refund right now . Also , the opening is too small for the newer bottles ( TippeTommy , comotomo , etc ) .	-1
I am a breastfeeder . But , every now and again , my husband gives our baby a bottle of breastmilk . We are past the point of sleep deprivation , so I do n't blame the use of this product on not enough sleep - it really is very confusing to use.The directions are quite unclear and the chart used to tell you how much water to put in is even more unclear . Several times , we have put too much water in , and the bottle gets way too hot , which is dangerous ! This is only my opinion and I do not believe has anything to do with lack of intelligence .	-1
I bought this for my 2nd baby , thinking it 'd be easier than warming a cup of water to warm the bottle . Nope . I could never get the amount of water and time right . I just went back to a cup of water and this thing is sitting in a box .	-1
First off , mine was white and it looks like they changed the shape and color now , whether that matters , I do n't really know , or care . This is the most awful product . We tried it 3 times , once actually following direction , then twice adding more water to see if it makes any difference . Nope . It does n't work . The ONLY thing it does is get the actual bottle hot . Almost too hot to the touch , but if you test out the actual formula , it was literally ice-cold . Like straight from the fridge . Awful , awful product . I find these mixed reviews odd , because apparently for some , it actually works and for others , like me , it does n't do ANYTHNG . I do n't know about those positive reviews , but for me , it was just utterly dissapointing . Pity really , it would have been SO convenient to warm a bottle up as quickly as it says ( 1 minute , I believe ) . But we have to continue doing it the old-fashioned way .	-1
This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to . However , I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle . It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold . By the time I had it at an acceptable temp , my baby was already screaming for the bottle . The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top . That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning . You might have better luck with it but it just did n't work for us .	-1
It is way so powerful that it splashes the liquid everywhere..my point of buying this product was to help the formula less bubbling when mixing..but it created more..what a disappointment..	-1
I 'm confused . Why would one even need this product ? What 's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle ? That has always worked for us .	-1
The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr. Brown 's 8-ounce bottles ( regular width , not sure about wide ) .	-1
I tried the Dr. Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons . First of all , the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows . Not surprisingly , this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed.Secondly , I think these bottles are overpriced . Even if they had worked for me , I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money . Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully.Finally , although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean , they also come with more parts than standard bottles , so it all evens out anyway . Additionally , I found the big Dr. Brown 's bottles ( 8-9 oz size ) to be very cumbersome , especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag.Every baby is different and you 've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you . For our particular situation , Dr. Brown 's was not the answer .	-1
I bought these bottles with the hopes that they 'd reduce my baby 's gas and fussiness . I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site . However , the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby , and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding ! I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow , so I stuck with it . But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding . I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with . The stage 1 nipple on the Vent Aire is slow , but my baby keeps all her formula down now .	-1
As you can see in the picture the bottles are ( supposed ) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones . I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free . I wanted them to be completly clear . When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind . If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $ 7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund . But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear ( non BPA free ) ones anymore : ( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind , but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this .	-1
I 'm all about new and up dating , even though it 's on 1 child , I like to research and know that it 's the best or at least the close to it . I tried the avent first , it 's ok , but I 'm not fond of the plain look . I tried gerber , playtex and so on . Then I bought some Dr. Brown . It was ok for awhile then things starting getting messy . If you hate washing dishes , this ai n't for ya ! Now this bottle is very difficult . It has so much things you have to assemble . If you put just a tad more milk the lid will leak and it 's not easy trying to wash that skinny tube . ( sigh ) And the nipple is soft and all but my baby needs to something that he can get a grip . If you are looking for the best bottle or nipple , I recommend NAM . They came out with a new bottle and nipple . It has fun colors , very attractive , you can tell that the bottle is working from the air you hear coming out of the bottom suction and the awesome nipple that babies can actually get a grip on . If I had ten hands I 'd give it ( 10 ) thumbs up !	-1
I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the answer for the cereal bottles and bought 9 bottles in total . However , everything clogged in them and it never worked well for me at all.Also , Target lost my order and eventually it arrived , weeks late . Then , when I tried to return it for a refund , they had an administrative glitch and refunded us for $ 0 . We just received the correct refund the other day , after multiple phone calls and time . Frustrating ... A very bad experience with a product that worked very poorly for me.Not recommended .	-1
I bought these because I thought that I was going to start adding cereal to my son 's milk , however then realized this was a no no . I know that many people out there do this and I 'm sure this nipple would work out great , however I did not use this product after all .	-1
We used lvl 1 nipples on our evenflo , avent , and Medela bottles with no problems . These level 2s leaked in all of our bottles . We are n't using the evenflo bottles anymore since she drinks more than 4oz at a time now . At any rate , they 're leaking and I 've thrown them out . : o (	-1
The price was great . However these are very bad for compatibility , and they are very leaky . Even on Evenflow bottles these leaked liked crazy . I ended up throwing these away after two weeks trying to find the right combo that did n't drench my kids neck . I tried evenflow , medela , gerber , and parents choice bottles . LEAKED In all of them . This is a great price for nipples , and you might think you should stockpile ( I did , I bought a dozen ) but it 's not worth it , you get what you pay for . My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples . Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS . In fact , we noticed no gas too , we switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce , 3 Pack ( Colors Vary ) as our main bottle . The nipple ring is tight and the nipple is stiff , the bottle design prevents nipple collapse and makes airflow work in the perfect combo so that he never got a gassy tummy again . Spend the money , buy the good stuff .	-1
I have the nipples given to us in the hospital and they are slow flow . These nipples allow milk to flow out when the bottle is upside down unlike the other slow flows I have .	-1
I have no complain about the product ... but the baby just do not like it ... she takes any pacifier bu not this one ... donno why..	-1
My son never used these ... since he is a boy and the ones I received were pink ... so I ca n't attest to whether he liked them or not.Maybe it 's just me , but colors may vary just does n't fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral .	-1
I should have read the reviews : ( REALLY need a choice of colors on this product so everyone does n't end up with pink . Lots of unhappy customers with boys .	-1
My baby kept on gagging on these . The teat is very big ! Not impressed with these pacifiers at all . Do n't buy !	-1
these nipples are so small that they just fall through a regular size bottle ! ! ! What is the point of them I do not know . Would have returned but not worth even worrying with so I just threw them away ! ! If you get them make sure you have the same brand of bottles and all the other parts .	-1
I had high hopes for these little guys but no such luck . Easy packaging literally open and they are ready to go . I put one on my bathroom door and it worked to prevent it slamming on my son 's fingers , but it left the gap at the other side of the door where the hinges are , where he eventually worked his way over and CRUNCH slammed them in there instead . : ( I am sure these were designed for the one option on the door and they work for that , but they did not address the other side and for that I give it a 2 star.I have since removed them and found that my daughter uses them as elf ears for dress up . awesome .	-1
nice product but just as easy to buy the generic store brand at a cheaper price .	-1
Do n't waste your time with this one -- it just pops right off the top . I have n't found a good solution for the bi-fold door , sorry .	-1
I was a little disappointed when we received these , as they 're rather difficult to move ( especially for a short person ) ! I need something for a pantry and coat closet , however , going into those areas several times a day has become tedious . I intend to try some other options .	-1
Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle , you do n't want this . I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent 's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar , my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle ! Now , supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown 's bottles but the combination did n't work for us . First of all , the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on . Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside , it wo n't keep the heating latch engaged . I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes , the bottle was still ice cold ! I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations , but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she 's hungry !	-1
We have been quite happy with the warmer until last week . We plugged it in and 5 seconds later it was smoking and burning at the car adapter outlet . My husband right away pulled out the burning plug but it already melted and a metal piece of it stayed int the outlet causing an electric short . So we were not able to restart our car until it was removed by a mechanic . Save yourself the experience of standing on the side of the road with a hungry baby on a rainy day due to this product .	-1
The idea is great , the product is not so great . We have the same reviews as everyone else . The bottles ( we use VentAir ) do not touch the `` on '' sensor , and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles . Our son will not take them luke warm , he likes them very warm.How we made it work for us : Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.And one hour before our son 's feeding time we start warming the bottle.Very slow process , I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer .	-1
For a toy that is supposed to stack up , these cups are very hard to stack and do n't stay stacked up . Ca n't get my mind around a stack-up toy that a child can not stack .	-1
I was told it would be helpful to buy stacking cups , so I found these . Like a couple of other reviewers , upon receiving them , I was disappointed . These cups are very small and the lip area is small . The cups do not stack well at all . I had trouble with the larger cups , the smaller cups were ridiculous . I returned these and will look for cups that stack better.I will admit , if you wanted something for your child to play with , toss around , these are okay and an okay price . For the purpose of stacking , these just are not that great . Disappointed .	-1
So , the cups have a recycle code # 7 which is listed as not safe , I called the company are they reassured me that it is ( ? ? ) . My guess is that it 's not safe to use plastics with code # 7 to warm up maybe ? Not sure . I am not really excited abt these cups , as other reviewers said , they do not stack up very well but that 's not a major issue to me ... My issue is that code # 7 which was only indicated on the plastic wrapper , not the cups themselves so it 's easily missed ...	-1
These outlet covers are a complete waste of money . They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out . My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her . Bare outlets would be safer .	-1
My 22 month old just greeted me with a handful of these outlet covers . Sigh . I am so disappointed by this product . I should have bought the cheaper ones that are really hard to remove . Do n't buy .	-1
Trust me they figure out how to get them out of the outlets . Get the old fashion one that us parents have a hard time getting out .	-1
at first i liked these because they were easy to take out . unfortunately , my toddler thought so too . the only outlet option that i 've found works are the plate covers . the make it so the outlet is accessible to me , but not my son .	-1
Absolutely the worst ! The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out . Buy the old school kind for REAL safety ! ! !	-1
My 15 month old has no problem taking these out . His interest has been drawn to them now and they are very ineffective .	-1
I heard so many good things about these bottles , and after no success with the also praised Avent system , I switched to Dr. Brown 's . I had no luck with this product , either , and there were more parts to clean with this feeding system . My 2-month-old son spits up even more after feeding ( sometimes twice ) with the Dr. Brown bottles . I have not noticed any less gas , either , and the nipples flow way too fast for him , even though I purchased the smallest size . I 'm glad this product has worked for others , but for me , it was an expensive and failed experiment .	-1
Unfortunately , I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown 's bottles . I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles . The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out . I never filled them past the line , but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold . They leaked standing upright or laying down . I 'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time . It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck . Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain . I really do not reccomend these bottles . I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out . I 'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins . They have never leaked and I 'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out ! !	-1
I bought these because my daughter was a spitter . She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate . So I bought these to try and she hated them . I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too . The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers . You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it . plus she was easier to burb . I wouldnt recommend these or avent .	-1
I purchased Dr. Brown 's bottles for my daughter . The idea behind the vent is great but what a pain to put together ! With a very fussy newborn , I did not have time to waste assembling the bottle . We discovered that Evenflo and Avent bottles work just as well and are cheaper .	-1
My mother purchased this for me from TJmaxx or Ross or something . I 've learned to be very suspicious of baby products from those places- seems like they 've usually had some sort of issue and no one will buy them any more and sometimes those issues are dangerous like with this product.I think this blender is pointless . One could do much better buying a small food processor from Target or something . This Dex one is also cheaper at walmart online . This blender is weak , does n't blend very quickly or efficiently . I 'm horrified to read the reviews and learn about the plastic ring which I can not find in mine ! I guess I fed my baby plastic ! Mine 's been sitting in a plastic bag ready to go to Goodwill . Maybe I should just throw it away.It 's a piece of junk that ends up in Ross because it 's a poorly designed product . Do your baby a favor and buy a BPA free one somewhere else , and freeze your baby food in tiny Pyrex .	-1
I ordered this online because I could n't find it in the stores and it arrived without a working motor . This is the 2nd baby food processor of two different brands where I 've had trouble with the motors . I decided to use a manual food mill instead ( which can be ordered from Amazon.com ) and has pretty good reviews , too .	-1
It looks nice for the moment after it 's assembled . Within a short amount of time you will realize it is very cheaply made , the nice dark paint will chip off & the hinge ( which they claim will make it safer ) will break . It looks nice if it is not touched or used , but do n't count on it lasting AT ALL when the kids start using it ! ! ! ! Return time is short as well FYI , huge waste of money	-1
I thought this insert was a great idea , but it seemed to scare my 10-month old . She cried hysterically the second I put her in it the first time . The second time she cried the entire time despite my taking the time to show it to her and let her touch it , etc , before getting into the tub . same thing on night 3 , so I returned it . Granted , this is just our experience , but I will say that I think part of the issue was she could n't splash in it . As others have said , despite the manufacturers image , this tub does n't really fill up with water - it pretty much soaks back through to the main tub . Also , I did rinse it off and hang it to dry , and after three uses it already had that 'sour ' smell .	-1
Honestly , we never took this out of the package and I ended up selling it for much less than I paid . We had bought it thinking it would be another fun gadget , but actually having it in our home made us realize how big and bulky this was . It 's filled with those styrofaom type bead things so it would definitely need to be aired out and dried between every bath but I still think it 'd accumulate mold/mildew relatively quick .	-1
So I like this product overall but I do have one problem with it and its kind of a big one . If you forget to hang it up to dry after bath time ... IT SMELLS ! It has only happened a couple times but now I feel like the dirty smell came from mildew settling into the bath stuffing and so it must be ruined inside , i just cant see it ... . Threw it away and went with a blow up bath I can see , clean , and sanitize .	-1
The picture for this product is deceiving . I thought the fabric was smooth . I is actually a cheap feeling scratchy and abrasive type material . I wouldnt want it on my bare skin . I tried my son in it once and he screamed hysterically and I have n't used it since . Its too bad because its a great size and constructed well . I was very disappointed that I could n't use it .	-1
I wish I would 've read the reviews more carefully that this thing does n't hold water ! What a drawbak for me.. and I discovered this too late and was n't able to return it . You ahve to fill the whole tub with water and then the water that comes into the tub is used . It 's got weird styrofoam pieces inside that make it safe for baby in case he falls over but it totally sucks that you have to waste so much water at bath time ! What a horrible invention . I learned my lesson the hard way to real all available reviews carefully before I purchase .	-1
Not recommended , To messy and just not worth the headache . It was sent back after realizing it was soon to become a moldy mess . Not worth the trouble or finding a place to store it .	-1
We found this was n't the best thing to use in the bath regularly . It 's a bit of work to wring the water out , and you never get it all out . It takes over a day to dry , which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.We did find it useful around the house outside the tub . If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and do n't have time to prep it , this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position .	-1
I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item ... . Would not suggest .	-1
I do n't get all the good reviews of this product . I really do n't like it . It 's too big to fit comfortably in my standard size sink , and does n't keep babies head inclined and out of the water in the tub . It does seem comfy for baby , but she does easily get cold in it . There is n o way for baby to stay submerged in some water to stay warm . I much prefer the first years safety tub . There is a reason it 's design has been around for years ! It just works !	-1
The reason for the 1 star is because baby is not due until Dec 1 2013 , and it has not been used . Mother to be is excited about it , but we wo n't know the thoughts until its used , then I 'll re-rate it	-1
This item should of been plastic not cloth.when put to dry mold grows . Even if u wash it the mold doesnt go away.It also annoyingly soaks all the water.I wont recommend .	-1
I got this sponge bath thing hoping to replace the bulky hard blue bathtub but turns out that this thing is just awkward for newborns . I put this in my kitchen sink ( a large one ) and put nice warm water just filled up enough to be comfortable . I used it with my newborn ( less than a month old ) and the water got cold ultra fast , the sponge took forever to dry , was heavy and the incline was weird for my newborn . I think I will try it again when he gets a little older but for little tiny babies , ... .not so much . It 's sitting in storage .	-1
I liked using this for my premiee baby girl once she grew out of her NICU bath at home but after a few months use it gave her a rash on her back . I did n't think it was the bath pad giving her the rash until her 3 year old sister started to get the same rash on her bottom because she liked to sit on it after my baby girl got out . I would not reccomend this product .	-1
Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses . I HATE IT ! ! ! I 've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite . First , it does n't have much elevation for newborns . Second , it gets heavy once it 's wet and flattens.Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years ... . now THAT is a good baby bathtub ! ! !	-1
I received this as a shower gift . I squeezed this foam bathing pad out after every bath and hung it to air dry each time , using it once a week for my newborn . It was so disappointing when it started to stink of mildew after only four baths ! I purchased a Boon Naked Collapsible Baby Tub to replace it and highly recommend everyone purchase that instead ! Worth the extra cost !	-1
I ordered this because I do n't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub . It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out . I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt .	-1
We got this bath pad for our 3 month old and initially loved it , as he sat there so comfortably while we washed him , but within even the first month he started getting a horrible rash on his back due to contact with the bath pad . We have always cleaned and hung to dry , but we live in a warm climate and clearly the mildew grows inside of the mat unless you have professional drying equipment . To avoid buying another pad we have attempted to use wet towels over the pad so that his skin does not come in direct contact with the infected pad , but unfortunately this does not appear to be enough . Our baby is now six months and has an ongoing and painful looking rash on his back where it has been touching the bath pad.BOTTOM LINE : If you plan to buy 10 pads ( for $ 250 ? ? ) and treat them like disposable items - polluting the landfills and throwing your money away in the process - then this pad is wonderful , but for all of the sane people out there , please do not make the same mistake we did . There are better bath options out there that do not jeopardize the skin health of your baby . We are so sorry we bought this pad .	-1
Pro : -Spongy holding around your baby to create more safety if bathing baby in ceramic sink.Con : -Always need 2 adult to bath your baby . One holding baby 's head up so water wo n't get into baby 's ears , and the other person give the actual bath to the baby.-The mildew smell ( I try to hang it dry over night in the bathroom cause it soaks lots of water and keep dripping . Than remove to somewhere under the sunlight during the day time , to get it complete dry out for next bath . However , without drying under the sunlight ( when its cloudy day ... .it has mildew smell ) After 3 month usage , the spongy getting flat ... and the whole thing keeps sinking ( the head part used to be higher ... but now about 2 inches flatter ) ... my husband now has to hold the baby 's head plus holding up the hook towards outside the sink ... it 's totally useless now and I 'll have to buy something else ...	-1
This was really not what I expected . I have it away rather than returning it . I wanted something that would deflate and take up little space . I was also concerned about mold build up in a sponge this big . I definitely would not recommend this item .	-1
I got this awhile ago for my first son . it was a great idea , and he loved it , but man did it STINK ! no matter where or how soon I hung it up to dry . outside , inside , febreezed ... any of it . plus immediately after the bath it 's a huge pillow soaked with water , so it 's heavy and not too convenient . we also lived in a super SMALL house in philadelphia with no good spot to store it . we 've since switched to theSummer Infant Fold N ' Store Tub Time Bath Slingand it 's been through 2 kids and I 'm about to use it for one more . it 's convenient and folds and best of all does n't STINK like mildew ! blech ! do n't waste the money , you 'll end up buying something else anyway !	-1
It soaks up so much water and takes to long to dry . Not really what I was expecting or looking for . Still looking for that perfect baby bather .	-1
This was a great concept , however once you put this in the water dont expect to be able to move it . Its to heavy . It offers no support . So once you are done bathing baby , this will not lift out of the tub and if you want to take a bath with your baby this wont allow for fluid movement in the tub . It takes 3 days to dry out and is so thick you cant squeeze the water out . When you hang this to dry , it feels like a ton of bricks . It is also a very scratchy material . It will do but it is really not as good as all the reviewers make it sound . Also this does not in any way elevate the babys head . Once this gets wet , water gets around babies head . Also , when added to tub of water , the water soaks into the material but doesnt stay warm . Baby is left on top very cold . You can not submerge this in the water even a little , bcs if you do , her head will get wet ( no elevation ) and it floats upward as well . Not a good bather.Makes a good place to lay baby on when she gets out of tub ...	-1
It does n't float and it does n't stay submerged . Really wet and heavy too so it 's kind of a pain to use .	-1
I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended . It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge , but I had a few things I did n't like about it . First , it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath . The water it soaks up makes it very heavy . Second , if you do n't have all of the water wrung out of it , and do n't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath , when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold . For the longest time I could n't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather , and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him . I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better . He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it .	-1
really not ideal for safety . It 's flat and goes on the bottom of the tub . I do n't like it- maybe it works for other but not me .	-1
Spoon is too big for my son 's mouth ( he 's 11mo old ) , and the look of the plate makes me feel like I 'm feeding my son out of the dog bowl .	-1
The spoons are great for a toddler . The plate is very much like a dog bowl . It is a little too bulky and a pain to store since you can not stack that easily with your other bowls.Update after 2 yrs : still using it but white part of bowl gets stained and scratched easily . Also the spoon is plastic so it has lots of bite marks . If i were to do it all over again , i would just get the spoons . Spoons are great for 9m+ especially for soupy foods . But spoons stain easily . They are orange now . To be honest , you 'll be fine with the munchkin metal and plastic set for $ 4 . I have those and toddler is fine with that , too . Munchkin utensils fit into Boon lawn dish rack better . The baby bjorn spoons have thick handles so they do not fit well standing up .	-1
This plate is fine as a plate with raised edges , sort of like a cross between a bowl and a plate . But for twenty dollars give or take , it is wildly overpriced because what it does NOT do is stay put on the high chair tray . My 12-month-old son has no problem picking it up and tossing it if he so desires . The spoons that it comes with are easy to hold but a little wide for my son 's mouth at this point .	-1
Purchased 2 of these for small grand children - not impressed . If the cost to return the item would n't have been so much I would have returned them immediately . They can be used with much effort but the securing device is too low on the babies to be safe .	-1
I got this for my son when we visit friends and family so we do n't have to drag his high chair along . We ended up having to buy a real booster seat anyway . This seat is very unstable and just is n't safe or efficient .	-1
I bought this on the go booster seat because we travel a lot to visit family but it was very disappointing.PROS:1 . Easy to install2 . Inflates without any effort.3 . Compact and easy to carry.CONS : ( which outweighed by a lot the PROS ) 1 . Extremely unsteady . No matter where I installed it or how I installed it that chair could flip around with my daughter in it . It actually did ! 2 . It does n't fit well in every chair . Depending on the dinning room chair size you will be able to use this booster or not.3 . After constant use the chair does n't stay inflated.Overall , do n't waste your money on this booster seat ! Is dangerous for children who like to move around which I am pretty sure they are the majority .	-1
This work ok ... I did n't like how it fits and it should be included in the gate . Overall this gate was n't a good one for me.. I was much happier with the Summer Extra Tall Gate	-1
I bought this because I wanted a carrier for short trips instead of always hauling a stroller . The price was good but it 's VERY uncomfortable to wear and never sits on the body right . My daughter screamed whenever she was in it or she made her body very stiff like she was scared beyond belief . I do n't feel that this carrier is very safe and it 's very difficult to get baby in and out . Spend your money on a better one . Yes it is soft but look at others .	-1
I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old . We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor , so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs . I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy . It worked great at first . When he turned 4 months old I had problems . I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it . IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV . With him in it I could n't even put two fingers between him and the carrier . Never used it since	-1
I decided to give it a try despite some of the bad reviews , figuring they could be just unlucky . After trying these sippy cups a few times when my son was 6 month old , and again at 10 month old , I have to agree with these 1 star reviews ... it 's not your child , it 's not the parent , it 's the sippy cups problem : - Leaks no matter how many times I followed the instructions , re-read , assemble and disassemble . I use a phlilips avent steamer sterilizer for the bottle part only , and I thought I had warped it somehow so that it leaks from the sides . So I brought another one ( and did not put it in the sterilizer or washing machine ) and it still leaks ! ! : ( - the flow is just too fast . I tried this sippy cup when my son was 6 months and he kept choking cause the flow was just too fast for him . I thought maybe he was n't ready yet , and this was a good sippy cup . I was wrong . I tried a few more times at 10 months old , the flow is just still too fast he ends up either choking or having his shirt soaked with water.It 's a cute cup , I hope it 's just a matter of bad quality control only and others have better luck with this .	-1
Great bottles when used with nipples , terrible design with the sippy cup attachment . Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning , and they always are being cleaned . I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple , valve free ! sippy cups . They do n't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store . They have them in 3 sizes , with handles and they do n't leak ! EVER ! When making the purchase do it right the first time . Not like me 4 sets later : o (	-1
These cups leak like crazy ! I took pictures of them leaking . I will be uploading them into amazon 's product picture page , we 'll see if it 's approved . There is a hole at the base of the nozzle , right where it meets the colored plastic . I do n't know why the hole is there , but all of the cups have this design flaw . Do n't waste your money on these cups . They are cute , but they leak and make a terrible mess . I 've tried gerber cups and those were a lot better .	-1
This is not a horrible product . Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies , and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.They will leak , but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication . The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean . Very difficult to clean by hand ( take something else on vacation ! ) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand . There are just so many parts ! Plus the handle and the ring thingie do n't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.Two stars . You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles . But otherwise give it a pass .	-1
These cups - the entire Avent line , for that matter - seem so wonderful in theory . But in practice , they 're pretty terrible , and I ca n't for the life of me figure out how the Avent line came to be so hyped . ( A friend of mine speculates it has a lot to do with the cups , bottles , etc being pretty - I 'm inclined to agree . ) In a way , these cups remind me of the nursery rhyme my mother would chide me with when I was younger , about the little girl with the little curl in the middle of her forehead . When she was good , she was very , very good - and when she was bad , she was horrid ! When these cups are working right , they are wonderful ! But - These cups are STRANGE . Sometimes they work , sometimes they do n't . There does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to them . Sometimes they leak from the spout , sometimes they leak from the collar , but the same cup will not always leak in the same way , if it leaks at all . Avent bottles have the same leaky collar issue and if you call Avent they will tell you that you must have over-tightened the collar , that the collar is supposed to be tightened using the clear plastic over-cap , not touching the collar directly . Huh ? Who would think to do it that way ? Why would you put a cap on just to tighten the collar and then remove it ? But it 's a moot point because any way I do it , loose or tight , collar or cap to tighten , sometimes they leak , sometimes they don't.All that is after you account for the fact that the larger cups only come with the harder green spouts , which are for toddlers . This is OK , I suppose ... but the white soft spouts just SEEM nicer , my kid seems to prefer them , and the green spouts are much harder to remove the valves from because they are so stiff ! So when I bought these cups I had to then spend extra money on the white spouts , and that is all we used - which may or may not account for my next problem . I do n't know if it strikes the green spouts or not.Over time , these cups stop working . You will hand it to your child , he will suck for a bit , get angry , and hand the cup back to you . You will try the cup . All you will get is a hiss of air , no liquid . Early on , you can remove the cap and press harder to snap the valve in place ... but then after a while , nothing works . You have to replace the caps and valves . And maybe I 'm just an idiot but it bothers me to throw away things that are perfectly OK , and it bothers me that you ca n't figure out just WHICH part of the cap/valve set has gone bad , you have to either replace all your caps and valves at once or end up playing sippy cup roulette having an odd mixing of new and old spouts/valves that may or may not work when you put them together.In short , this cups have nearly driven me insane.Oh , and my favorite , favorite part about these cups - NOT - is if you use them with the nipple , your kid can push the nipple down inside the cup and spill milk ( or whatever ) all over the place . My guy first figured this out while we were out in the stroller and he had a cup of strawberry kefir . A pretty much full cup . What a mess ! These cups also hold sour milk smell worse than any other cup I have tried ( and we 've tried a lot ) They pretty much have to be washed in the dishwasher or else repeatedly sterilized which can get annoying . Of course this can be prevented by washing your cups immediately , every time , but let the mom who has never discovered a squirreled-away sippy full of homemade yogurt cast the first stone ... I guess the biggest thing these cups offer over the competition is they have caps . Most other sippies do n't - actually I do n't know of any that do . But we 've switched to playtex and I 'm pretty happy with them . No leaks , fewer parts , only one part to go bad ... Avent ... ugh . I 've used and hated the breastpump , the bottles , and now the sippies .	-1
First of all , this thing dries out wipes , even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you 're supposed to add every couple of days ! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy ... forget getting Chubbs in its round container , for instance . The little storage area is a nice idea , but it 's rather flimsy and not very supportive . Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers , which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub . These take up far less room and are much easier to clean , too . This one ? You 'll be continuously wiping it down , when it has n't fallen over , that is .	-1
I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby . Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill . It 's an OK product but if I would n't buy it again .	-1
I bought this because of the wipe warmer , but it is terrible . The wipes at the bottom will dry out and turn brown within just a few days , and the insert for `` pop-up '' wipes wo n't stay down in the unit , so it just comes out with the wipes , making it impossible to grab a wipe with one hand . The unit is supposed to snap on top of the organizer , but mine kept sliding off . I gave up after a few weeks and just took the unit off the organizer , and super-glued a regular wipe container on top of the organizer , that I just keep buying refills for . My baby does n't seem to mind cold wipes.I still use the organizer , though , and I like it . It says that it holds about 20 diapers , but when your baby is little , and using diapers through size 2 , you can turn them sideways so that you can actually fit in twice as many in two rows instead of just one . They slide out easily and never seem to get stuck in the netting . The little pockets on the side are handy for a tube of diaper rash ointment , etc .	-1
Warmers stated `` will not yellow the wipes '' . BULL ! Not only do they turn yellow they dry out ! I had my warmer plugged it for 1 month and through it out ! Every mom thinks they NEED warm wipes . Use a conventional warm wash cloth . It 's better for baby anyways . To much chemicals . Save your money ladies !	-1
Like most other parents , I was happy at finding a warmer at a reasonable price , and this worked well for the first year but then it quit.The organizer caddy was handy . It attaches to the side of your diaper table or crib with brackets that are included . Also included are some rubber `` things '' that help you adjust the brackets for a smaller widths ; for instance , if you are attaching to a table instead of a crib . The front of the caddy is a zip-up net and inside you can fit about 15-20 diapers . There are two pockets on each side that I use to keep small bottles of lotion , diaper cream , etc . The warmer snaps onto the caddy so that it wo n't fall off the top easily.It also has a tendency to `` cook '' the bottom wipes and turn them dark yellow to brown . It seems this is a problem with most warmers that warm from the bottom.The wipes have a tendency to dry out , but I think that is the case with most warmers . I usually just add a bit of water every now and them to keep them from doing so ( although this particular brand recommends against it , but my current one recommends TO DO it ) .I was disappointed to find out that there was no warranty when it quit working . I spent the same amount of money on one at Wal-Mart and it has a 5 year warranty - long enough to at least get me through the diaper stage ! Specifics : It is plug-in and not battery operated . I think most units this size are plug-in . It fits all size wipes , but does not have the feature for pop up wipes . And it holds an entire refill size of wipes . It warms from the bottom , not the top . It is very easy to open and there is no lock for the lid . You can not adjust the temperature . I think that is the same for most though .	-1
I loved this product at first and I know my daughter enjoyed it for the first two months . After a while though , it began drying out too quickly and literally burning the wipes on the bottom . The last thing you want to have to do is throw away 1/3 of your wipes because they are brown and dry .	-1
We bought this wipes warmer for our son 's room and it was awful . The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom . We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away . We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer . We 've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes . I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place . Do n't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it .	-1
A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child . Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price , we experimented with it . Unfortunately , it does n't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies . And the extra storage just did n't provide much `` storage '' . So we 've taken it back and our daughter does n't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie .	-1
My son is only 10 months old and ca n't use this seat because there 's not enough space between the seat and the tray . He 's not a fat child , either , only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly . I 'll be returning it today .	-1
The fold and go booster was our initial attempt in the art of portable boosters . We had fallen in love with a different brand that our friends had , so we ran out and got this thing . Mistake.Plus side : will hold a child upright while being fed.Minus side : straps do not detach easily for cleaning . Tray is not fully adjustable . Bottom feet prone to collapse . Chair falls apart.Seriously , we were taking it apart to wash it , and the cheap plastic buttons holding the back on broke . This is the second portable we had to scrap . There is still a lot of engineering that needs to be done on this model .	-1
We bought this without really taking time to research it because we were in a rush over the summer and needed a booster to use at a relatives house who does n't have one . I wish I read the reviews first , because I would have bought the `` on the go '' booster instead . Oh well , that 's the beauty of heindsight I guess . : -PThis seat serves it 's purpose.PROS : Hard plastic seat and tray is easy to cleanStraps , once assembled and fastened , stay tightTray is removableFolds up for storageGood for light use , I would n't use it everyday- read the cons and you 'll understandCONS : Tray is HARD to remove , you have to grasp and pull the sides JUST SO to get it to pop off ( I have to struggle to stiffle an array of 4-letter words quite often when trying to take the tray off ) It 's cumbersum to set up and fold down and you 'll need both hands to do both ( we use the `` on-the-go '' booster at my mother-in-law 's and I can open it with one hand , plop my daughter in the seat , strap her in , and strap the booster seat to the chair easily ) . First you need to untangle the straps , make sure they 're going in and coming out of all the right places , THEN you can put your toddler in first and attach the booster to the seat next or vice versa . The removable tray is nice , but again , a struggle to take off more often than not . To fold it back down , you 'll need both hands once again to push buttons on either side of the seat to pop up the seat and fold it in , then put the tray in with the rest of it , and spend another minute or two `` organizing '' the straps so they do n't get tangled up with each other or come apart from the seat itself ( even after the straps are `` assembled '' going in and out of all the right places , they just fall back out if you 're not really careful ) .This seat is n't bad for us , we only use it at relatives houses who do n't have a booster seat , so it 's not too much of a hassle . ( It 's only been used a half a dozen times in the past year ) But I would n't recommend it if you 're going to use it more than once a month . The removable tray is nice , and it is easy to clean , but between the hassle of removing the tray , having to use 2 hands to set it up and fold it back down , and the straps that fall out way too easily when not fastened , it 's too much hassle for everyday use . If you need a booster to use more often , I 'd recommend the `` on-the-go '' booster seat .	-1
I do n't like to leave negative reviews , but I was so bummed to use this and not get a great result . Also , the wood on the frame is so crappy that the back was cracked in two places when I opened the box ! The & # 34 ; clay & # 34 ; looking material is a foamy type of material and is always malleable ( stays gooey even when dried ) and it is quite difficult to get a good impression when you pull your baby 's hand or foot away . It sticks to the skin , so it takes quite a few tries , which can be frustrating with a newborn . I loved the idea of this product but it is quite cheap , and i 'd rather splurge for something else . Wish there was something else out there ...	-1
I think the material for the mold especially and for the entire frame is somewhat cheap . I know a couple of people who 've been happy with this product but it just did n't work for us . It is tough to do with a squirmy baby and once we did finally get a mold the contrast was n't very striking -- a footprint with ink may look better . Not worth the effort or $ , in my opinion .	-1
While I did n't have the problems others had with a broken frame , I was still very dissatisfied with the quality of the product.1 ) The blue background is so light that it looks more like a blueish grey than blue , the pink was fine but we were going to use the blue side.2 ) The clay is a horrible item to use for this purpose . The instructions tell you to roll it in aluminum foil . It stuck to the foil and repeatedly stuck to my son 's foot ( see additional uploaded photos ) regardless of how thick or thin it was rolled out . What finally worked was to roll it between wax paper , let the clay dry for 5-10 minutes after you roll the material before you try to make an impression ( this was not included in the instructions ) . I only found this out after we had already made about a dozen attempts and decided to use the scraps to experiment to make a hand print . Because we re-rolled the clay so many times , lint and dirt started to get embedded into the clay resulting in an unattractive print that we did n't want to frame.3 ) I would have expected a little form to keep the clay in a nice square/rectangle , cutting it with the supplied ruler was also a mess that stuck and deformed the print . After a day , the clay still did not completely dry and has the consistency of the stiffer marshmallows from Lucky Charms ( firm but will dent with pressure ) .4 ) There is nothing special about the frame except it is thicker . To attach the clay they include double sided tape.I would not recommend this product . For the price you can easily go to a craft store and procure the same materials and have a much better end result . Personally , I would use artist clay to make a foot/hand impression first and cast that in plaster.Update : 30 November 2011I contacted Pearhead regarding the difficult time we had with the clay and that it was embedded with lint and stuff from being re-rolled . They responded in less than 12 hours and said that they would send out more clay to us . I originally rated this product as a 1 , but because they had excellent customer service I wanted to upgrade my rating to between a 2 and a 3.Update : 02 January 2012Since my last update , they did not send replacement clay . I have since emailed the company two or three times and have received no response . I now would like to reduce the rating of this product to a zero if that were possible.Update : Jan 2013It seems that they did not like my picture I had uploaded of my newborn son 's feet stuck in the clay gunk and pulled down the picture from the site . Instead of fixing the product or providing customer service , it seems that they prefer to hide the imperfections with the product so that more people will buy it .	-1
It is a great looking backpack and works if you only need to go somewhere for a short period of time . It does n't hold very much and the top does n't close like you think it should .	-1
This monitor is decent for the price , I guess . But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better . The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds . But the problem is that there 's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up . There 's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby ! If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter ) , then the monitor is pretty crystal clear . The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights ( tops ! ) . So , if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night , or every other night , then I guess this monitor would be okay . But if you have that kind of money , I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one . I think I am going to return this for something a little better . I 'm very disappointed in Fisher Price . They usually have such great quality products . I ca n't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality . My suggestion : do n't [ spend ] your money on this monitor .	-1
This monitor worked great for the first week . Then , there was so much static I could n't sleep , and I could n't hear the baby clearly . I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor ( also carried by Babies R Us , but not online ) . It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing ( i.e. , you wo n't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor 's dog barking , etc . - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks , etc . ) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks .	-1
This kit represents overall good value in terms of the contents , since a single digital thermometer costs ... It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case , half of the contents fell out , since they are not secured inside it . Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle ( there 's no hole ) and is not securely closed . Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products . For additional [ money ] you get a few more extra items , all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch .	-1
The nail clippers , hairbrush , and comb are great but I did not care for the rest . It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company .	-1
I registered for this thinking it would be great . Everything I need . RIIIIGHHHTTT.. haha.. The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers ( but I can not use the magnification because it distorts everything and I can not see my sons nails ) , the hair brush which is nice , the comb which is nice , and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol . The thermometer [ stinks ] ! It does n't beep so you dont know wen its done . You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gon na sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways . The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in . And the tweezers are very flimsy	-1
They work alright , NO ONE will use your outlet , not even you . They are impodsible to remove . I had to use a pointed tool with one hand while squeezing three buttons simultaneously with the other hand . Sounds easy huh ? Do n't buy .	-1
Yes , they are difficult to remove ... that is the point , of course.But they break easily upon removal.Only use in outlets you have absolutely no intention of using until after your child is old enough to know not to stick anything in them .	-1
We tried these when my todder started to be able to pull out simpler socket protectors . First , they would n't go into all the sockets . Sometimes they 'd work on one socket in a pair , but not the other , so I do n't htink that was user error or some problem with the fixture . Second , my 2 year old was able to figure out the mechanism and strong enough to pull them out within 20 minutes .	-1
These did not work for out outlets . Possibly because we have an older home ? ? The latch that is supposed to hook on to the plate is n't long enough so it does n't grip and they pull right out .	-1
These plugs are actually really difficult to open so I end up pulling them out of the outlet sockets anyways .	-1
These work well keeping people out of the plug . A little to well actually . It hurts my fingers trying to pry these out of the outlets . If it 's an outlet you do n't use much then these will be a great product you wo n't have to worry about kids getting into.Might want to get something else if it 's a heavily used plug .	-1
You have to push in on both sides of these to remove them , every single one in the pack had one side already jammed in and would n't move.Pushing the sides in does n't move the latch enough for the cover to come out , you then need to wrestle with it to get it out which is not good for your back when you are already leaning down to do this.They are a good idea but very badly made .	-1
I bought a bunch of these for our house based on the reviews that said they were impossible to get out . I 'm not sure if we received a defective batch or what , but some of them stay in , and others can be pulled straight out and wont lock in no matter what we do . Very disappointed in the outlet covers , as we are probably going to have to replace them with a different kind .	-1
I bought these based on the great reviews and put them in the outet . Well , the problem was that I could n't remove them ! I followed the directions and no luck . My husband had to mess with them for 10 minutes and pry them out . I guess they are good at keeping your child out of the outet , but not practical if you ever plan on using the outlet . I sent these back !	-1
I know the point is to make it hard for the little ones to reach the outlets , but once these are installed there is NO getting them off without destroying the darn thing ! We had to use pliers to wrench this thing out of the outlet , and by the time it came free , it was completely destroyed . We tried multiple ones from the box and they are all the same ( we had hoped that the first two were just defective ) . BEWARE ! We almost broke the outlet trying to get these little buggers off .	-1
After reading the reviews I was hoping these would keep my little one safe . However , even after I followed the directions , the plugs would just fall right out of the outlet/socket ... with out any prompting at all.I had to return these ... thankfully Amazon is GREAT about their return policy .	-1
I suppose first-time parents think that this is the best collection of baby necessities available ! But , what first-time parents do n't realize is that you 'll get the most important of these things from your hospital when you leave after having baby ! I 've volunteered and had children at several hospitals in several states , and the going-home kit always included a nasal aspirator , a little brush and comb set , a bunch of alcohol wipes to care for the umbilical stub , a shampoo scrub brush ( not included in this set , but fabulous , especially for cradle-cap babies ) , and a little baby nail clipper . What 's included that is unnecessary : emery boards/scissors : baby 's nails stay soft for most of the first year , to the point that you can just peel off the overgrown part of the nail easily , without having to contend with a wriggling baby in one arm and a sharp implement in the other handmedicine dropper/spoon : should your baby require liquid antibiotics , the medicine will come with a syringe-type applicator , which you place into baby 's mouth and then press the plunger to dispense . Use a spoon ? Baby will swat it out of your hand and you 'll have pink and white stains everywhere . Use a medicine dropper ? Very slow and you have to keep refilling the bulb . Your baby 's meds will come with the dispenser , so these are unnecessary.temperature tester : very very inaccurate , especially since babies are still not quite self-regulating when it comes to body temperature.digital thermometer : do yourself a favor and register for an ear thermometer . It will last much longer -- years ! -- and can be used for an older child as well as a wriggly , sick baby . Believe me , baby will not quietly say AH and put the thermometer in his mouth when he feels awful ... and just try putting it in the other way ! toothbrush : bristles are NOT recommended for children under 2 . Instead , toothbrushes that have rubber tips/points are recommended , to massage teething gums and be gentle on new baby teeth.Do n't waste your money buying this kit . Get what you can as a gift fro your hospital , invest in a good ear thermometer , and get one of the sets of grow-up-with-baby toothbrushes that `` at a baby store ''	-1
First of all the bulb syringe it 's TOO HARD , and worst : it did not suck at all ( the blue one from the hospital have been a life saver ) . The brush is too rough for a baby under 2 , and the comb I started to use it when my daughter was 3 months old , because is too rough for a newborn . The nail clipper is too big for my daughter little The comb it 's OK ... The nail fillers are way TOO ROUGH too . The dropper is TOO BIG ... .I REGRET of spending my money in this ... ..Keep searching for another set ! ! ! ! UPDATE -- - > I 'm writing this note because after reading my comment after a year I have to say that I wrote this review stating that the items does n't work for a newborn as they promise , but most of the items you can use them for an older baby ... I have to say that the nail clipper has been the best one ever since my daughter was 15 months old , and after my husband step on it an broke it I run to the store and bought another one : Lucky me that I found it in a smaller set just with the scisors and the nail fillers and I did n't had to buy the whole kit again ! !	-1
to all first time mothers : this product is really not necessary ! i bought it and im only using daily the brush and the nail clippers . I bought another thermometer since , this one wasnt very reliable , and all the other things are not really necessary .	-1
I got this for my baby shower and was very disappointed when I opened it . I know the clippers and thermometer are necessities , so was excited to see that this kit came with both of us . However , when I opened it I realized that the clippers and thermometer are both cheaply made , therefore I will have to purchase them both separately . Everything else is just `` fluff '' that you do n't really need . Most of it you will get from the hospital and a syringe comes with all medicines you will buy . Save your money ... buy clippers and thermometer separately and do n't worry about the rest ... you do n't need it or you 'll get it from the hospital .	-1
My baby is 4 weeks old , I have not yet used a thing from it . Regular adult stuff is more useful and better quality .	-1
This has some useful things in it but not enough to merit the purchase . Get a nosefreida instead of the bulb thing , get baby nail scissors instead of the clippers , the teething tablets have been recalled and I ca n't get the medicine-dispensing pacifier open to put the medicine in . Also the syringe tip is too large to fit in the opening of the pain reliever so doling it out is a pain on its own and the markings rub off the syringe making it useless after a few uses . I do n't use the teething toy . I think the only thing in here that I actually use is the thermometer . In the end , it 's just easier to purchase the things you need separately . This does n't have anything magical in it that you would overlook ... when baby has a snotty nose , you have to clean it ; when baby has a fever/pain , you have to relieve it , etc .	-1
This is another one of those nice looking set geared towards new parents/ You see it and think you need it all and it will all match and be in this neat little case when you need it . But the truth is you wo n't need most of it.Let 's start with nail care . The clippers in this set are adult size with a neat little handle added . Well adult size is too big to use on those little bitty hands ... that is why they back infant sizes . Those nails are also so soft the first couple of years that you wo n't be able to use the scissors or files on them . I ended up using the files and we use the scissors to cut tags off of new outfits.Then you have all medical stuff . The nasal aspirator in this set does n't work . None you will ever buy will work as well as the one they give you in the hospital . Keep all the free stuff from the hospital because 99 % of it is better than what you can buy . This also goes for the thermometer . They will be taking your babies temp frequently after birth and they use a digital unit similar to this one but better . The one we got at the hospital works in 3-5 seconds . Another reviewer said to get an ear unit . Do n't waste you money . They are inaccurate and the doctor will not take readings form them.We still have n't used the medicine spoon or dropper . If you child needs medication it will come with a syringe which is quiet frankly easier to use then a dropper . And at 14 months our daughter still ca n't take any medication from a spoon . Our doctor said that usually does n't happen until 3 years of age.Then there were the tweezers in this set ... in 14 months we still have not figured out what these things are for ! You 've also got the toothbrush . It 's far too big for a toddler mouth and you ca n't use it until they are at very least a year old . the bristles are also more like that of an adult toothbrush . So this was added to our stash of cleaning brushes.So what have we used of this set ... the brush . The comb still makes her cry ( it scratches her head ) and gets tangled very easily in her curly hair . But we use the brush every single day . We also use the cute little case to store all the junk that came with this kit that we 've never used.So all in all , take everything the hospital gives you and buy a brush because the rest of this set is useless .	-1
The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush . The nail files are okay . The medicine dropper was useless . It would n't suction up any medicine . The fingernail clipper is also useless . It 's just an adult-sized one with an attachment . Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I 'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then ( on their pediatrician 's advice ) . I 'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital , which I 'm told are the best . So , in all , if I were to do it again , I 'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I have n't used much of it , and the parts that I have used , have mostly unimpressed me .	-1
I 'm not sure what the other reviewers are talkinga bout . We registered for this set and got it as a gift . I have used NOTHING from it . The green suction bulb is so hard I ca n't possibly get it to compress with one hand - its useless for suctioning babies nose , we used the one from the hospital . The same thing with the dropper . The tweezers were so hard to handle , I just used mine . The brush and comb are okay . The nail clippers are too difficult to see what you are doing and so I end up cutting my daughter 's fingers - the nail scissors are too dull to cut her nails.Overall , this is a cheap set and I would n't recommend it .	-1
I do n't think we will be able to use any of these items . They al feel cheap . The bulb syringe does not even work .	-1
My 7 month old wants nothing to do with these ... she would rather try to hold the bottle without the handles .	-1
They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set , other wise , inquisitive children get distracted by them , specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white .	-1
We took a chance on the & # 34 ; colors may vary & # 34 ; and lost ... got pink for our son . I took them into Babies R Us for store credit , but unfortunately neither BRU or Buy Buy Baby had these in stock ... : ( Hopefully I 'll find them sonewhere else soon , as I really wanted to have them for his sippy cups .	-1
I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it . However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers . I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one . If you are like me , you want the products you buy to do the intended job . This is not what you want . Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way ( extra bathroom , laundry room , etc . )	-1
We got the dekor plus after using the small dekor for 10 months . The reason we changed it is because the inner lid stopped functioning properly . We had the old square model where the inner lids in the pail are round and fold to the inside of the pail ( that is the model in this picture ) . We bought the dekor plus at babies r us . The diaper dekor plus now is oval and the inner lid is square . It now has a system to cut the bag on the inside of the pail , which is nice , and it has a lock for the inner lid of the pail . The lock is necessary because in this model the odors linger if you do n't lock it , hence it is not hands free as it is supposed to be . Since we bought the dekor plus it is bigger , but since the smell keeps getting out we have never even allowed more than a day 's diapers -5- to stay in there . If you want this product get the old square old version , which is the one in this picture . I guess that is the one reviewed by consumer reports and recommended . The new oval version does not work as well , also get the smaller size model -the dekor not the dekor plus.-	-1
I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago . My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper ! I have to change the bag every time she has a BM . I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie . I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus . Save your money , do n't buy this product !	-1
I got this after reading reviews for several different diaper pails and I opted for this one since I did n't want to stick my hand in anything or twist things . Pros : easy to use and change the bag . Cons : the smell ! Every time I throw a diaper in there , the 1 second it takes for the diaper to enter the compartment is enough to release a foul odor ! And this happens even though my little one does n't poop much and has barely started on solids . It does not , however , smell if the whole thing is closed and unused . Only smells when you toss a diaper in.Also , if you want to throw away just a diaper wipe , you ca n't because the 'trap door ' requires pressure ( from the weight of a used diaper or your hand ) in order to enter the trash compartment . You got ta make sure your used diaper is wadded up tightly because that helps it break through the trap door ( with light or barely used diapers , you 'll have to probably use your hand to push it past the trap door . I 've had to do this several times ) . I 'm disappointed since this performs as well as a regular trash can with a foot-pedal operated lid , which is what we were using before .	-1
Mine broke the first week I had it . ( One of the inner flap 's spring broke . ) It does not contain odors very well.However , I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers . I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though .	-1
beware , as your child ages , this system does not hide the odors . We have twins thus , two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK ! I am replacing them .	-1
I received this item at my baby shower ( 11/03 ) and we still have it . The doors keep falling off , it fills up fast . My daughter who 's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers . She know that the door does n't close and falls apart , so she 's always where the plastic bag is . We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door , because when we would open it , it would come out of it 's holders . Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone . But , when it has some stinky diapers in it , it stinks and so does her room . I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail , it does n't cost cheap , but it 's made cheap .	-1
Highly disappointed in this diaper disposal system . For the price , you would think that it would seal each diaper individually . The less expense models ( even the Wal-Mart brand ) will . We chose in the end to just have a small garbage can in our daughter 's room and a natural scent deodorizer in the bottom . The bag gets emptied daily and there are no smells of diapers in her room . Much less expense option and works the same as this system !	-1
I was pretty excited when I ordered this diaper can , it seemed like a good concept , and I did n't want to do a diaper genie . It is a good idea , unfortunately it does n't play out as well in reality . The plastic has absorbed the odors of dirty and wet diapers , so now , even when it is empty it smells ... .bad . It left my daughter 's room with a dirty diaper smell . In order to attempt to solve this issue without getting rid of it I have scrubbed the empty can down with bleach and odor eliminator , have sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the new bag and have bought Arm and Hammer diaper trash bags to tie each individual dirty dirty diaper in before throwing away in the Dekor . Hopefully this will help with the stink .	-1
This diaper pail was great when my daughter was a newborn and her diapers did n't have much odor . Now that she is older I have realized the ( 1 ) it does n't hold that many diapers and ( 2 ) it DOES NOT CONTAIN THE SMELL AT ALL ! ! ! ! ! ! Look elsewhere for a diaper pail	-1
I have only been using this diaper pail for 7 weeks , and I hate it . I have two boys in diapers - one about to turn 2 , the other 7 weeks old . The pail is so tiny , I have to change the bag daily . When it gets more than half full , the top wo n't close , letting out all the poop odors . Because the second inner door flap goes inwards , it prevents you from being able to fill a bag completely because it runs into the diapers . This also causes that inner door flap to get a little gross . The pail is insanely expensive , as are the refills . I have started using my own bags , but they are a pain to put in and take out . I really expected more and am very disappointed ! I 'm glad this was a gift - I wo n't feel TOO bad when I toss it !	-1
I loved the Avent nursing pads when they used to be made in Switzerland . They were soft and comfortable . With my current baby I purchased the Avent pads again but found them to be rough and itchy . I looked on the box and they are now made in China . I prefer the Johnson 's and Johnson 's brand . They are soft and made in France . Not much more expensive than any other brands .	-1
I love avent products but they were n't thinking when they made these . They are way too small and way too thick . Feels like a maxi pad .	-1
I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst ! They are very small , thick , and do not hold much , causing them to overflow and leak . I 'd recommend the Gerber pads .	-1
These pads are too small and too thick . They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby . They also look very unflattering under clothing . I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse . Do n't waste your money on Avent pads !	-1
These are some of my least favorite from any brand I 've tried . They leak for me . Wo n't be ordering again . : (	-1
I did n't like them ... . They are too small and very thick , they show thru your clothes . I use instead the evenflow , they are very thin and larger than this .	-1
i found a sample pack of these in the bathroom , and after using them once , i would not waste money on them . too small and too thick . not very comfortable . lansinoh is the best i 've used .	-1
These pads are a complete waste of money . I started usingLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads , 60-packwhich are awesome ! But I was hoping that these would work because they are a little cheaper . They might work for you if you have extremely light or practically non-existent leakage . But even in that case , the absorbent material used in this product performs like a thin circular cotton ball -- it does n't draw the moisture away from your skin , which was extremely irritating to my skin and made me feel edgy and damp all the time.So here are the cons of this product : -There is no waterproof backing on these pads ( which is good for preventing thrush ) but is BAD for holding leaks . My shirt and bra would end up damp anyway.-The absorbent material does not draw moisture away from skin . My skin would end up wet and damp and hot . Very uncomfortable.-I had to change these pads constantly if I wanted to feel dry and comfortable -- thus removing the whole purpose of replacing a wonderful product -Lansinoh pads- with a terrible but cheaper product.-The mesh material that covered the absorbent material is irritating to my skin and would stick to the skin when I removed the pad . The mesh material also allowed fibers through that would stick all over my skin which would then end up rubbing off on my baby 's face.-These pads are small but puffy , which would often show up in silhouette if wearing even a slightly fitted shirt.-	-1
I used to use the Avent pads until I discovered the Lansinoh pads . The Avent pads are thick and smaller and they show through your shirt . It 's hard to disguise that you are wearing breast pads , which is kind of awkward . I also found that it tends to move ( slightly ) even when attached . It 's okay to use at night because it is thick and it prevents leaks especially around morning time . But I prefer Lansinoh and that is what I use now even at nights . They are much better than the Avent pads .	-1
These pads are too thick and too small ... I usedEvenflo 60 Count Simplyabsorbent Nursing Padbefore and liked them better . Will not buy Avent 's anymore ...	-1
i dint have a leaking issue with these but they did n't stay in place well . the one little strip of adhesive was not enough to keep them in place . Maybe it is b/c I am big breasted but these did not work ( loved the Avent ones though )	-1
I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products . Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job . They are very thick , you can see them through clothing , the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak . After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads .	-1
I liked these at first but now I do n't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into . They can not support the weight because they do not bend . I 've also had one break , but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on . Keep that in mind . It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I 'm not aware of any . Also , I would n't call these `` soft '' .UPDATE 2010-02-10 : Had another one break ... so at least two have broken now . I have removed some other ones because I think they would cause more damage/risk than their worth if my son were to step on them or `` play '' with them .	-1
The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound . Audio does this nicely . Video only works if you sit there and watch it ( which defeats the purpose of freeing you up for chores ) , and if it has audio , as this one does , then why even HAVE video ? ? Video is an unnecessary expense , because just what is there to SEE inside a baby 's crib anyway ? There should n't be anything dangerous in there anyway ! ! ! ! Save the $ and get an audio . As someone else pointed out , reception is n't always good on this model either . Video monitors are a ploy to get well-meaning parents , eager to protect their children ( `` if you do n't get this , you 're an irresponsible parent ! `` ) , to spend more money . Look at the price tag on this compared to a simple audio . Sell yours on ebay , spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor , and put the rest in baby 's college fund where you 'll get much more use out of it .	-1
I read the reviews on this product before buying it . It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all . The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all . I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes . I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work . I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine . If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case .	-1
These new cups are awful . We had a couple of them from late 2012 that were awesome . The lids were easy to screw on and they never leaked . Then Playtex redesigned the lid and now they are really hard to get closed , sometimes hard to open , and they leak if you do n't get them exactly right . I just got done clearing out the shelves of my local pharmacies at 8:30 at night trying to find the old style ( Yay , got 3 ! ) because we put our son to bed tonight with a cup of ice water and he woke up 20 minutes later because he was lying in a freezing cold puddle . His cup was apparently not screwed together properly and it leaked all over his bed . I do not appreciate changing sheets for no reason . This is not the first time we 've had the cups leak on us . I will use the old style until he chews the spouts to death , which is what happened to our old set , and then I will find another brand . I 'm not sure what the point of the redesign was since the old style was perfect . Please bring back the old style ! ! ! !	-1
I love this product . But what am I suppose to do with pink cup when I order blue . I live in England . No point to return it . It will take for ever . Soo not happy	-1
I have tried over a half dozen sippy cups ( playtex , nubby , sassy and munchkin ) with my daughter and these are my favorite . ( I really liked a munchkin cup , but they changed their design and lost their lead ) . These hardly ever leak , take a lot of abuse and keep drinks cool . I would actually recommend them to others.Update : Playtex has updated this product with a different valve and locking system on the lid . I bought one of the new spout cups with the circle valve as a replacement for one of my original design spout cups that melted in the dishwasher . The top leaks like crazy ! Every time my daughter took a sip it leaked from the area between the top and the cup . A regular cup with no lid would have been less messy . I attempted to let my daughter use this cup multiple times , ensuring the lid was securely on and it leaked every single time . I am beyond disappointed that Playtex has replaced a good product with a product that is frankly , garbage .	-1
I like this sippy cup but it came in pink and I specifically ordered blue for my son . I was not satified with this product because of this .	-1
I bought these without noticing they had changed the lid of the cup . The new lid is terrible . It is hard to get it on correctly and often looks like it is on when it is n't . I have cleaned up numerous leaks from these cups already.Oh , and would it really be that much trouble for you to add the options of 'girl , 'boy ' or 'unisex ' style cups ? Or , just send out unisex options ? Will not be purchasing these again .	-1
i purchased these cups and they are supposed to not leak ( like all kids cups ) . well ... .they did leak ... alot . if you turn the lid too tight , it will leak . if you turn it not tight enough ... it will leak . Needless to say ... they are garbage .	-1
Like many other reviewers , I am a huge fan of traditional Playtex sippy cups . They truly are the gold standard . They last forever , do n't leak , and are cute as well . This new line that they came out with is just terrible . After 2 washings they leak all over the place . I do n't know whether it 's the new valves or the cup lids themselves , but they are completely useless . I 'm stalking other sites to find the originals so I can stock up because these new ones are a disaster .	-1
I orderd these cups believing I will get the dinosaur ones as pictured , but instead got flower ones . My son is not going to use the flower cups !	-1
My 3 month old loves playing with this toy when he is in his car seat , but he can now grab the toys and pull them . When he does this the arch comes off the car seat and it has already it him twice on the head . I wish that this product was designed better because my son really does love it .	-1
We did n't have this toy for long because it would not clip onto anything . I bought initially for the carseat on the road , ( ca n't have the bar up while driving ) but it would n't clip on to the carseat . It also did n't clip on to his bassinet . There was no point in having this toy , so we returned the item.As other people said it would collapse easily.Instead I use the Lamaze : Link Along Friends . I clip those to the hood of the carseat while driving . He loves to play with those toys .	-1
This is a nice little clip on toy to entertain your child , however , it is very hard to clip onto my daughter 's Quattro Tour Latch Travel System ( Graco ) . I was able to get it on , after about 20 minutes of work , but it would n't stay in an upright position . Before you buy this toy , make sure that your stroller or carseat , etc . has a thin bar/rail that the toy can be attached to.One bonus- it did fold very easily and fit nicely into my daughter 's diaper bag .	-1
This is a cute toy , I will give them that . And I didnt realize until much later that it played music . But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING . We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too . It collapses on everything , it falls on her . We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things . We could have done that with toys she already had . This was a waste of money .	-1
Way too big , it 's ridiculous . Hard to sleep with . I would have returned it if it was n't such a hassle to return the giant thing .	-1
Bought this in my third trimester , if you turn a lot during in your sleep , this is not a pillow for you . Because every time you change the position , you have to move the pillow the other way , oh my specially when you are already barely moving yourself , pillow is more like being hassle than making you comfortable .	-1
I told myself that if I ever got pregnant again that I would splurge on a pregnancy pillow ! Well , I did and hated this thing . After 2 nights with it , I could not tolerate it . Both mornings I woke-up with a sore neck and there is not a good way to turn it over in the middle of the night when you are covered by a sheet . I actually , had to get out of the bed , pull the sheet back , flip the pillow over , and hop back into bed . If the pillow was on the edge nearest the side of the bed , good luck trying to get out in the middle of the night for restroom break ! The leg support was the only thing that was decent . I decided this was not a splurge ; I will take my 10 pillows any day over this uncomfortable pillow !	-1
It seemed to work well for the first few weeks . Then I started having pain in the neck and shoulder . If you could ask someone to take a look at your neck and spine , you would notice that they are n't in a straight line when you are using the pillow . The material does n't contour to your neck and head . The pain went away after I switched back to my old pillow and using a pillow between my knees and ankles . The cover that comes with the pillow is made in a poor material.I bought this because I was a back sleeper and was desperate in finding a solution to help me sleep on my side . THE BOTTOM LINE : I wo n't suggest it to any one or buy it again .	-1
My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy , swearing it was the most comfortable thing she 'd ever experienced . I loved it for the first night or so , but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably ( since the entire pillow is connected , when you move one part , the rest wants to move with it ) . I eventually curled it into an `` O '' shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV . I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I 'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat , rectangular body pillow , as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them . A million times better than this un-tameable monster . Thanks , but no thanks on this one .	-1
i read a million reviews for a bunch of different maternity body pillows and decided on this one because it did n't look too big and i really wanted something firm . i did n't want to pay $ 50 for a pillow that was flat . my regular pillows are firm.when i received this item , i was shocked at how firm it actually was . i used it for a while , in attempt to flatten it out a little so i could be comfortable . but alas , i was NEVER comfortable . nothing about this pillow was comfortable . and i could n't see myself using it to support my belly when i was REALLY showing because it was so firm , my belly would have been up in the air instead of level with the rest of my body.i do n't know . maybe if i was a larger woman , i would enjoy this pillow more . i was 119lbs ( pre-pregnancy ) 5'5 '' . it was just a waste of money.also , it comes with a pillow case . i did n't know that , so i purchased a sage one . when i went to put it on the pillow , i realized there was already a white one on it . so it was a waste of money .	-1
I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy , and it worked well for the first few months . However , I found that the pillow really flattened out with use , and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support . I am not a large person either ( 115 pounds before pregnancy ) , so it did n't take much . Once I made that switch to regular pillows , I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around . Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult , I would not go back to the snoogle at all .	-1
Before pregnancy I never slept on my side - and I really do n't like side sleeping . The Snoogle has really helped me be able to sleep on my side or sleep on my back but with the snoogle under one side so I 'm kind of propped up on it . Sleeping became really difficult in the 6th month and I am very glad I purchased this pillow . One caveat is that you NEED to buy a cover with it - I did n't realize that and ended up trying to wrap mine in a sheet until I had a chance to get a cover . The material is very scratchy and rough by itself : Amazon sells a Snoogle with Cover for $ 65 , but since I had to buy mine separately I ended up paying $ 82.96 for the exact same thing . Bummer.I have found that mine kept its shape decently well - it 's certainly not as soft as my feather pillows , but I was unable to find something like this made of down/feather . Overall , I would recommend this pillow BUT do n't buy this one : buy the one that includes a cover at the same time !	-1
I do n't have anything to add ... it 's very uncomfortable and did n't ease any of my discomfort . I used it for one night .	-1
I kept hoping that there would be a stage of pregnancy when this was comfortable , but it never happened . For how much space it took up and how difficult it was to arrange it never gave enough support .	-1
I purchased this pillow and have never successfully slept through an entire night with it . It is really quite large and feels confining when wrapped all around you under the sheets . I felt like I could n't move and could n't get comfortable . Plus , the material is really scratchy and awful - forcing you to shell out additional money for a cover . Way over-priced . Mine sits in the corner of my bedroom . For $ 20 I bought a body pillow and ultra soft cover at Target and I love it and sleep with it every night . Save your money !	-1
I 've tried all the positions for this pillow . And it just refuse to stay near my body contour . I have a fit physique and about 14 weeks prego . Like another review ( that I wish I did not ignore ) , The fabric on this pillow is quite rough , which adds to the discomfort of using this pillow . Who wants to hug a porcupine ? So sad . I am not sure if the problems are 'fixable ' because its my money down the drain . For now , I am very comfortable with hugging a big pillow sideways and using a rolled up fleece blanket for back support .	-1
I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all ! Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome . It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head . Furthermore , it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back . Honestly , you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable ( chamomile or lavender ) beanbag pillow . Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead !	-1
I did n't purchase this product from Amazon , I got in in a local store , but unless you just have money to blow on crap you do n't need , do not buy this stupid thing ! I liked it at first , but my baby is n't even born yet and I already hate this thing ! It takes up way too much space on the bed , the pillow itself is so firm , it gives me headaches to lay my head on it all night . I should have gotten a small wedge pillow for a fraction of the cost . I paid $ 40 for the pillow , and another $ 20 for the horrible cover ( which I did buy on Amazon , and wrote a separate review for ) .I could have gotten a body pillow from Walmart for $ 10 , and a few pillow cases for a few bucks each . This thing is a pain in the butt and I ca n't possibly see how anyone who has actually used this thing on a regular basis for a few months would still like it.If you have the money to waste on something you might hate , be my guest , but I wish I 'd never bought this monstrosity or it 's cheaply-made cover . I 'd much rather have my $ 60 back .	-1
When I first bought Snoogle , I loved it , as it was perfectly supportive as promised . Then my toddler barfed in our bed , and some of it unfortunately splashed on Snoogle . Snoogle 's cover had to be washed . Snoogle 's cover is very snug , without a hint of stretch . Snoogle 's ONE cover opening is in a very awkward location . I was so frustrated with trying to put Snoogle 's cover back on after washing that I left it off and left the pillow bare . Big mistake . Snoogle 's supportive secret is in its cover because when left without , it 's basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra-lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night . Why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women ? Finally , today , I put Snoogle 's cover back on , and after a half-hour of twisting , writhing , cursing and taking two breaks ... I got the stupid cover back on but did n't even have a post-coital glow as an added benefit.My recommendation ? Buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow . It 's what I had for my first pregnancy . We simply used two king cases to cover it , and I had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed .	-1
Thank goodness I borrowed this- it 's really not something I would want to waste my money on ! ! ! ! First of all , it 's big . But that 's not a dealbreaker , I can handle big . Not like my huge fort knox of pillows was smaller ! Other preg pillows are probably of equal size . But do note that it 's a nice wall between you and hubby . Also , the covers are TERRIBLE , always wiggling off and exposing the center of the pillow.The `` C '' shape presents an interesting question- put it towards the middle of the bed , or the edge ? I chose middle , which means sleeping more on my right . But it 's easier to get out of bed this way ! The portion of the pillow which is supposed to go between the legs is really annoying- when you roll over ( which happens ) , you need to untangle your legs from that part . What a BOTHER ! I do like the curvature around the neck/shoulders . I find it very comfortable , but I think it contributes to sleeping on my back ( which I find myself doing ) .All in all , I probably would n't buy a preg pillow , but if I did , I would either buy a big U-shaped one ( which you would need to climb out of when getting out of bed ) , or the candy-cane variety , not the `` C '' shape . It just does n't work for me ... . ( Off note , I have noticed my sciatica is much better since sleeping with this thing . I 'm not sure that 's related or not- things change so fast with pregnancy ! )	-1
I have had this pillow for only a few months now . I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester , and now I 'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester . Within that time , the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out , making my legs too close together . I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips do n't hurt when I sleep . Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying , if you have n't experienced it already , you just might if you are using this pillow . In addition to this , the head part of the pillow is too flat . I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts . Overall I do not recommend this product . I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows , and this one was the cheapest with the best review . Do n't fall for the same trap I did ! ! ! Shell out the extra bucks and get a better quality , better stuffed pillow ... . you 'll be happier sleeping if you do .	-1
I bought this pillow for myself recently . I am currently 27 weeks pregnant with my fourth child . When I read reviews all over the internet , women spouted that *this* is the best pillow on the market . So I excitedly added it to cart and awaited the arrival of my new comfort . I was expecting something more , I suppose because what came out of the package was disappointing.Pros-Folds easily to position yourself differently . nice to have for propping up in bed.The length is decent . Keep in mind , tall moms like me may find that it 's a bit short.Cons -The width of the actual pillow part is very narrow . This makes for not much support area between knees or thighs . The pillow does fold , but it seems awkward to keep it like that.It is very squishy and gives just too much . The stuffing should be firmer and more supportive . This may not be a big deal to some , but it is for me . I was hoping for more support and comfort for my hips during sleep . No dice.The pillow is cumbersome and annoying to turn over during sleep . Let 's just go ahead and acknowledge how uncomfortable pregnancy is for many women . Sleeping on one side is just not a reasonable expectation . I think in the future I will go for a pillow that is a full U shape.The covering it comes with is rough and likely needs to be washed and softened a bit . I found it scratchy on my skin . Maybe a pregnancy thing or it really is that scratchy . It 's a woven material , feels very cheap to me .	-1
We have a king size bed and this thing is like sleeping with a third person . It takes up so much room and it too cumbersome to move around especially when you are dealing with a baby belly . It is impossible to put the pillow case it comes with back on it if you need to wash it . I wish I had bought a smaller one with a case that zipped .	-1
This is so uncomfortable I ca n't use it . I end up in more pain . I like using my own pillow but I ca n't seem to with this . It 's just awkward . It got such great reviews too but a regular cheap body pillow from target was way better than this .	-1
I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it . I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle . I have since returned the Snoogle . I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable . The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me . I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me . I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money .	-1
My husband and I were worried we wasted fifty bucks on this pillow . While I tried many-a-time to sleep with the pillow , it did n't make the cut . First of all . I prefer down pillows , I need lots of squish , the snoogle is really for those that prefer a firmer pillow , I share a queen bed , so the snoogle was also somewhat of a hazard . My poor husband would have to shield himself in case one of the contorted ends came flying as I constantly repositioned myself . It would be nice , on that note if the pillow was a bit more flexible or if one end was straight . I fell asleep with it once and felt many awkward pains in my neck , shoulders and back.However , all was not lost , it turns out that it can be a wonderful bumper to put around your baby if she happens to fall asleep on your bed . My husband and I immediately realized we had n't bought the Snoogle in vain .	-1
I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months ... I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews . I am 5'6 '' & 130 pounds . I have a large belly , yet I am small in size . I am normally a side sleeper.The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly ( because of the pre-shaped curves ) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head , so I do n't get it . My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed , pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor ! I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.I think this pillow may work for some , yet not for me . I will just stick with multi-pillow props .	-1
I was pretty excited to buy and use snoogle during my pregnancy but when I got it it did n't really fulfill my expectations . First , I ca n't get comfortable with it because it forces you to assume a certain position ( either with the pillow behind your back or front ) . If you belong to the group of people who wake up in exactly the same position as they fell asleep - great , maybe it 'll work for you . If , however , you move at night , you will wake up every time you turn . EVERY TIME . I tried sleeping with it a couple times and ended up throwing it on the floor since I do n't like it to wake me up all the time - that kind of defeats the purpose . It 's also way too big ( the size of a human ) , too heavy and too firm . You wo n't be able to support your belly on it , only sort of lean on it . At first I thought I would give it a chance and try it when my belly gets bigger but now that I 'm 8 months pregnant , I prefer a Walmart $ 5 body pillow way better . At least you can control and adjust the pillow to YOU , and not the opposite . The other bad thing is that the covers for this thing are more than half of the price of the pillow . I bought my Snoogle at Babies R Us and it did not come with a cover so that 's kind of a pain , too . My advice - not worth the money if you are a tosser and turner .	-1
This pillow sounded like the best thing in the world . I got it out to try it and immediately found that I was too tall for this pillow , unless I slept in a curled position ( I am 6ft tall ) . You have to use the dedicated head part for this which seemed like a rock and the material was not soft . For the money this should have been the best thing ever . I was so bummed , I really thought this was going to be great . So I went and found a 10 dollar body pillow and a 10 soft cover . I also get to use my own head pillows . Wish I could have gave this a better review !	-1
I just did n't care for this at all . The head part was not high enough for me - I am a two pillow sleeper . The curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn , just made it harder . Could n't figure out the belly support feature - just did n't help me . Does n't come with a case which is $ 20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $ 40 pillow makes me uncomfortable ! I returned it the next day - just not worth it . I 'll stick with my pillow arsenal - it 's not ideal but it 's free and works just as well as this .	-1
No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I have n't tried any other body pillows , so I ca n't compare , but it seems to help . Early in my first trimester , I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night . I still have some , but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help . I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow , so it is n't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case . Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing , but I 'm not sure how it could be improved - it 's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off , but would probably be uncomfortable or would n't completely cover the pillow.Edit : I liked this pillow at first , but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat . Washing it did n't plump it up enough . I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug . Save your money	-1
I just deleted my first review , which I made after owning this pillow for a month . I originally gave it 4 stars , taking one off because it 's bulky and makes it difficult to roll over.However , after owning it for 3 months , the top ( where my head rests ) was completely flat and I had to use a second pillow under my head . It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it . On top of all of that , you ca n't purchase covers for it , so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night.I wish I would have just bought a new body pillow , it would have saved me a lot of money and headache dealing with this huge thing .	-1
I hated this pillow . Like most pregnant people it 's extremely difficult to get comfortable for sleep and I was so excited when I read the reviews . I really really wanted to love this pillow but it just did not work for me . It made me feel claustrophobic and even more uncomfortable . I 've discussed this with other moms and they either love it or hate it . There 's no in between . I think this is way overpriced and I 'm so glad I waited to buy the cover for it because I would have wasted even more money . And the cover costs almost as much as the pillow .	-1
This pillow really did n't work for me . I 'm 5'4 & # 34 ; and started pregnancy at 106lbs then gained 25lbs . The material feels very cheep to me and the cover is not soft at all . The part that goes under your head is not soft and an odd shape . The part that should support your back is too rounded so it does n't even touch my back . The part for between your knees is tube like in the wrong direction so it cuts off circulation . The part under your belly does n't line up right and is too firm for comfort . I bought a $ 10 body pillow from a local store and love it . I suggest sticking with this better solution and am sorry I waisted my money . Frankly the $ 10 body pillow appears to be much better materials inside and out .	-1
I am petite - and this is way too big and fluffy for me . My dog loves it though ... .I curl it up like a cinnamon bun and my cocker spaniel climbs into the middle of it and snuggles in . He seems to be in heaven . For me ... not so much . It is bulky and too thick . I imagined that as my pregnancy wore on and my belly grew that it would fit better . Not even . If it does n't work for you the first time - it wo n't work better later . Some folks seem to love it though - so give it a try , but if you are like me and petite you may want to find a softer alternative . I use two king size down pillows that I can squish up to where I want them .	-1
I tried this a few nights before it got ole ' heave-ho ! It did not help me at all . I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs . I do n't know why it did n't work for me , but it did n't . It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with . And it takes up so much space ... . Do n't recommend this at all ... especially for the price .	-1
I have had back pain since the third month of my pregnancy and finally gave in to buying an expensive pregnancy pillow at month 6 . I thought this would be my godsend . I used it for less than one night before I tossed it on the ground and slept without it . Since I could n't sleep , I actually got up out of bed to print out my return label because I could n't wait to get rid of this thing and pop it off at UPS and get it out of our house . I am absolutely baffled by all of the rave reviews.Pros : One star for being made in the USA ( with foreign parts , so take that for what it 's worth ) .Cons : Cheap fabric case.Inside filling feels flimsy and like it wo n't hold up.Completely UNCOMFORTABLE ! ! ! You ca n't use your own pillow unless you want your head lifted up super high.It 's not easy to switch from left side to right side . You have to hoist the dumb thing back and forth ( try doing that with sheets/duvet on top ) , and in doing so , it 's completely disruptive to one 's sleeping partner . Also , even simple things like turning over in bed are difficult/painful whilst pregnant , and this pillow makes it even harder.I will either invest in a U-shaped pillow or non-pregnancy specific long tubular body pillow ( so I can use my own pillow for my head and turn sides with ease ) or just stick to having a regular pillow between my legs . The Leacho Snoogle was a total bust and a complete waste of money .	-1
I 've had this pillow for 3 weeks and I am still not convinced.it does kind of help but I still find myself laying on the other side.Not as comfortable as I thought it would be .	-1
I 'm so glad I 'm not the one who paid $ 50 for this pillow ! God bless my friend for thinking of me , but I wish her money could have been better spent . She said her daughter loved it , and maybe the Snoogle works well for some women , but after three attempts at using it , I stuffed it in a plastic bag , and there it sits on my bedroom floor to this day . Here are the reasons why:1 . It 's way too firm . I could not get it to support my tummy from underneath at all ; all I could do was try to sort of lean against it , but that did n't offer any support . Same thing with the back `` support '' -- the whole pillow is so firm , it was more of a leaning thing than a support thing.2 . Maybe this is more of the same firmness complaint , but I could n't get used to using the pillow part . It was n't soft enough to `` mold '' to my head and neck , and I ended up trying to push it far enough to the side that I could use a regular pillow instead.3 . The fabric is , as others have said , not very good quality and itches if your bare skin touches it . The farther I 've gone in my pregnancy , the more sensitive my skin has gotten ; I ca n't even imagine trying to use it now . Assuming I could stand the pillow itself , I 'd have to buy one of the covers ( though I do n't have one , so I 'm not sure of their quality , either ) or make one myself.4 . The curve is too confining . I felt like I had to curl up all the time . I 'm 5'6 '' tall , so you can use that as a measurement tool if you like . I just ca n't stand not being able to stretch out comfortably , and the Snoogle did n't allow me to do it.5 . It 's H-U-G-E ! ! ! God help you if you 're trying to share a less-than-kingsized bed with your spouse or significant other AND this gargantuan thing . There wo n't be room for the three of you.6 . Do n't even try to roll this thing over with you . Talk about a wrestling match ! Maybe I can recycle the Snoogle into a sort of TV-watching pillow ; it 's certainly firm enough for that . But it 's not something I 'd recommend or buy for a friend or family member . The Boppy Wedge is an INFINITELY better buy for the money ( see my review of that item ) , not to mention being a better product overall .	-1
These pads do n't stay put -- I 'm constantly having to re-position them throughout the day . They also are very flat and too stiff , so they 're uncomfortable and show through a shirt . If they were softer and more flexible I think they 'd work fine because they seem pretty absorbent , but they still slide around in a nursing bra too much . I guess it 's back to the disposable nursing pads for me !	-1
I purchased 2 packs of these pads with my first child 4 years ago . I really liked them and with my second , I needed one more pack due to a few being lost in the years in between . They still come in a great washable mesh bag , but the new pads are smaller and using very different materials than my first sets . I do not like this new style , OLD Version:4.5 '' diameterPoly lace exteriorJersey knit interior ( only negative- it feels wet quickly ) Overall very absorbentMolds to breast shape to create a concave pad interiorNEW Version : ~4 '' diameterPoly lace exteriorFlannel interior ( positive- it does n't feel wet ) Thin and not very absorbentStays in a flat shape and does n't mold to breast shapeThe only plus with this last set is the flannel interior . Overall I do not like the smaller size and do n't think these are nearly as absorbent as the older sets that I have . I will keep these as my emergency pads while my older sets will remain my everyday choice .	-1
they are very soft . but they do n't stay in place like said . they fall out . I had several experiences where they have moved and fallen on floor . embarrassing . very soft cotton but do n't stay in place . I like my medea brand better	-1
The pads are small in size , and do not effectively coverage my breasts so even they move around just slightly , they just miss to cover at all or they just become wet pads that soak through my nursing bra . If only they can enlarge the coverage size with the same thickness , and same lace design then they would be perfect . For frame of reference , I am a 32DD and size small so they are small even for me .	-1
These pads would be great is they were n't so thick and if they were larger . They 're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily . Because they are so small and do n't stay in place well , they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down , so I end up leaking . I have a few pairs of nursing pads that seem to be just a couple layers of flannel and they work great . They 're thinner and cover more area . I would try to find flannel ones instead of these .	-1
After I had my baby and my milk came in , I was leaking like crazy and tired of spending money on disposables . These arrived and I put them on right away . However , I leaked right though them ! They have no waterproof backing and are very thin so if you leak even a tiny bit , you are screwed . Additionally , they are scratchy and itchy and my poor sore nipples stuck to the fabric . Imagine my horror trying to peel them off my raw nipples : (	-1
They do not absorb milk as good as the disposable once , and I do not even have a lot of milk . They made of cotton , so they get wet very fast and so your short . I use the disposable one by Lansinoh and I love them .	-1
I liked these and still use them sometimes , but they do not absorb as much as the disposable kind , especially at night time when you tend to get engorged . I would leak right through them , my sleep bra , and my night gown . Not fun to wake up covered in breast milk . : /	-1
I bought these hoping to be environmentally friendly . I tried wearing these once and had a huge wet spot after just one feeding . They absorbed nothing and had a spot bigger than if I did not use anything .	-1
I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem . I 'm sure there are better washable pads out there . These are completely flat and do n't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple . They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top . Plus , they stick to you -- not horribly but still undesirable . I like the bag that comes with them but overall , I would n't buy this product again or recommend it .	-1
I leaked through these immediately , they barely absorbed anything . I ended up going back to Evenflo disposables . They are n't as environmentally conscious , but they work SO MUCH BETTER .	-1
These barely absorbed when I had them in . It was more like the milk beaded off of them . I had high hopes but I was let down .	-1
Initially I thought they were comfortable , moderately thick , and the padding does n't bunch up over multiple washings . I like not having to use disposables which seems wasteful since I 'd have to go though a lot of them over all the months that I 'm nursing.These nursing pads do have quite a bit to be desired . They leak frequently to the point where I 'd wake up in the middle of the night with milk soaked both through these nursing pads and my clothing . I 'm taking the time to update my review after having a different experience using this brand of nursing pads with my second child ... I do n't have trouble with my milk supply when nursing my second child . Unfortunately , I ca n't use these nursing pads anymore since they leak constantly even during the day . They are especially bad when I let down while nursing my child on the other side and I never wear these overnight.It worked ok most of the time for my first child when I was n't nursing often and had limited milk supply when he was an older baby . However , if you are nursing a newborn or needing reliable protection steer clear of these nursing pads unless you 're trying to win a wet t-shirt contest !	-1
I like the look of these , the lace on the outer layer is cute , but they do n't hold moisture well at all . It 's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit , it 'll go right through the pad . I used these at night occasionally because they 're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt , but my shirt would be damp after every feeding . They 're also very thick , which makes them very noticeable under a shirt . If you want a great cloth nursing pad , get Bamboobies - they 're way more absorbent , thinner , less noticeable , and cuter . Do n't waste your money on these .	-1
These are not very absorbent even after multiple washings . They get hard if I do n't change them quickly enough after a leak , and they also make me fuzzy if I am not completely dry when I put them on ... Small things , but not things I really want to worry about all the time . I would also prefer a slightly larger size .	-1
This product did not stop or even slow the flow of milk from my wife . It soaked through and leaked within 10-20 minutes . She tried it two times and then threw them away . Not worth the cost . Since I was buying for my wife and had no idea which pad would work , I also got the & # 34 ; Charlie Banana Nursing Pads & # 34 ; and they were much , much better and well worth the slight cost increase !	-1
I thought that these would be great , to be able to just wash them and reuse them . Do n't have to worry about running out , etc . etc . No first of all , they stick to your nipples which is THE LAST thing you want when you have sore nipples . It was similar to pulling a bandaid off of my sore nipples . OUCH . Plus , I used lanolin , etc to help soothe my nipples and the pad just wicked it away and looked gross , so I had to change them more often than I would have liked . All in all , a waste of money for me .	-1
I bought two orders , so 12 of these nursing pad hoping that they 'd work well and I would n't have to buy disposable pads . I was hoping to save some waste and money . Well , that was till I figured out that these pads are n't really that useful and started to buy disposable ones . Here 's why these pads are n't so great:1 . They are n't large enough to cover a good amount of area.2 . They slide around a lot , I find something soaked randomly - at least this happened while I was at home , not outside ! 3 . They are NOT seamless , so they do show under your clothes.4 . And MOST importantly , they are n't super absorbent . I do n't really leak so much , but even then I find myself changing my pads 2 to 3 times a day.So now I 'm using disposable pads . I wish these worked well .	-1
These pads are terrible . I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best , so I thought their washables would be good as well . Well that was a big mistake . They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast , making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater . I figured I could use them when I was home . Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced . These pads do n't absorb much at all . What I was saving on disposables , I was wasting on detergent and time .	-1
I still leak with these . They are n't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy . Basically I only use them when I 'm desperate .	-1
If you leak a lot or have oversupply ( before solids , especially if you 're pumping also ) , these pads are n't good enough . I leaked right through them several times before I just decided to purchase some disposables with plastic backing . When my milk leaking slows down a little , I will start using them again .	-1
Was n't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons : - material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside	-1
I bought this to try to get some organization for my diapers as I have two babies in them . But it doesnt hold a bag of diapers so Im constantly filling this up . Itd be so much easier if it held a bag . I would understand if it didnt hold the box of diapers but newborn size 1 diapers ? really ? It barely even holds one row ! waste of money for me ... .	-1
This is the most boring thing one can have in the nursery ! Waiting for it to fall and break and buy a different one.Although looks arent of concern then its a good buy !	-1
I have a munchkin diaper organizer that I love . However , it comes in blue and green only . I was looking for something a bit more feminine or neutral for my daughters room . The price is comparable to the munchkin version , so I went with this on looks alone . I regret that , but the box is long gone so I ca n't return . The side bins on the PLH depot are too narrow from side to side and from front to back . My powder nor my lotion bottles will fit into the side compartments . Also , they sit forward of the back of this depot and stop short of the front . A decent amount of wasted storage space , given that you ca n't really fit anything of size into the compartments . The munchkin version has larger side compartments and more side storage space . Though the munchkin compartments are divided , I can still get my larger bottles , etc into them . That said , the plastic of the PLH depot is sturdy and the pieces fit together well . It 's ok for what it is . If you do n't want blue or green , go with this one . If you do n't mind blue or green , go with munchkin 's version .	-1
This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers . Not true , I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit	-1
In theory , this looks like it might be useful . However , the side compartments are really small . Not even an average size bottle of cornstarch can fit in it . When I try go to remove something from there , like a tube of cream , the plastic side piece detaches and I have to click it back into place ( all of these pieces can disconnect , which could be nice , but I found that they would disconnect when I did not want them to ) . The diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all . The top does n't have a non slip grip , so the box of wipes just slides all over . PAIN IN THE REAR . I returned this and bought a large basket that I keep on the changing table edge and just put all my supplies into .	-1
I really love this item , but I got parts of it broken . this why I am giving it a 2 star . I would have return it but in the long run it will cost me to much time and money .	-1
I got this as a baby shower gift . I thought it would be a great and useful item , but it ended up taking up a lot of room on the shelves of the changing table and does n't really hold a lot of diapers.Also , I use a wipe warmer , so this is too tall to fit the warmer on top of it under the shelf of the changing table.I found that the diaper stacking bag that matched my crib set held a lot more diapers , and also took up less room because it can hang off the side of the table .	-1
I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks . While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping .	-1
I absolutely hate this pump ! I went through 3 of these because I was n't able to get my money back and could only exchange . The motor broke twice and one time it suctioned in and never released . Instead of exchanging it for a fourth time , I just threw the whole thing out . The part that attaches to the motor/handle and the piece that allows milk through are impossible to clean . Eventually , on all 3 that I went through , the milk builds up in the piece that attaches to the bottle ( only takes a few pumps to fill this up ) and you have to break suction for it to filter through . It continues to do this for as long as you 're pumping . If you do n't realize that the milk has n't gone through , the built up milk gets into the motor/handle and leaks out through the suction power control . The massage bubbles on the cup are uncomfortable and only irritate your breasts . The suction dies down almost immediately making pumping take so much longer . This pump is such a waste of money . Buyer beware !	-1
Honestly I bought this as a back up pump to use for emergencies and I hate it ! It is the worst pump I have ever used ! You would be better off getting a manual pump . It took me about 45 minutes to pump 3 oz . I would honestly not recommend this pump to anyone . I think they are a great company and I LOVE their bottles but this pump is horrible . There is a reason why it it $ 27 , instead of the $ 100+ they originally valued it at ! !	-1
This monitor did not work for us . It let out a loud click about every 20 seconds or so and then about once an hour it would start giving out static for about a minute for no reason . This monitor kept us from sleeping and we had to go exchange it . NO GOOD !	-1
This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible . My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise . Our baby slept through the night since day one ... it was the monitor that kept us up . I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers ... it 's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it . This monitor is not worth the money .	-1
I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet . I found this product had terrible static and made cracking/popping sounds.In comparison , the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent .	-1
We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great ... for 24 hours . Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying . To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [ $ ] wasted . My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static . Do n't waste your money - buy another one .	-1
Had this product for a while and were very dissatisfied . The only thing you can hear is static . We got now Greco and very happy .	-1
I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift , I had to return it because of all the static . I could not hear my baby at all ! I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead ... and I 'm very satisfied with the exchange .	-1
I own quite a few reusable diapers but these were by far the worst ones I 've ever purchased . They are bulky and stiff . I returned them immediately after opening the package . I understand the quality is there in terms of being 100 % cotton but they could be redesigned so that they can actually fit under a piece of clothing .	-1
I have been using these Kushies cloth diapers for 2 months now . My son is now 6 months old . They only last about two hours before I have to change him . If I wait longer than that , his clothes get damp from pee soaking through the diaper . I never use them when I am out and about or know that he will be somewhere where people might want to hold him . The last thing people want is to have a pee stain on their clothes after holding a baby . I feel that the pee soaks through so fast because the cotton inside layer sticks out the sides around his legs . I have found that Flips cloth diapers and Mommy 's Touch cloth diapers work best.Mango Snap Easy Clean Pocket One Size Cloth Diaper by Mommy 's Touch with Microfiber InsertorFlip Individual : 1 One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover & 1 One-Size Stay-Dry Insert - Moonbeam	-1
Before my baby was born I thought I 'd love these , but it turns out that I really , really do n't . First of all they are extremely bulky which is n't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart.My baby pees a lot and I just do n't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed . I go through 17 diapers a day ( because I change her immediately ) . At this price this is WAY too expensive . I 've found using liners and just five covers works great for me . And seventeen of these would n't even fit in my washer every day.If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else .	-1
Not a very good cloth diaper . The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby 's bottom . This can result in diaper rashes . You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers.Besides all the leaks with this diaper , they are really stiff . I wanted to like this diaper , but am very disappointed . We are much happier with Happy Heiny 's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones .	-1
I was so disappointed when these arrived , they were so large and bulky on my toddler and the velcro did n't hold up . They have become my back up diapers for laundry day . Id never order them again .	-1
I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either . I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage . They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner . Definitely not usable overnight .	-1
I received it today and was so excited I bought a dual action air pump from a local Target store and inflated it for my son 's bath this evening . My six month old baby laughed hysterically watching me inflating the duck tub I was sure he would love it inside as well . I am now however quite disappointed and am wondering if it could be returned for a full refund.The biggest issue for us is its small size . Our baby is barely 6 months but at 28.5 inches with fairly long legs . When he leans at the duck tail , he has to curl his legs . When he sits up , his feet are reaching the duck neck . At this rate in a few weeks ' time this tub would be too small already.Not to mention that because it 's small , my son was able to reach out of the duck tub , and bang his head on the real tub ( ouch ! ) Then some inconveniences : 1st , we put this tub inside a real bath tub . You ca n't fill this duck tub from the spout directly ( unless you have an extra long spout I guess ) so that 's quite inconvenient . 2nd , the baby would sit towards the duck tail , and the adult would need to wash him over the duck head , and that is a pretty big duck head ... I 'm wondering maybe the adult should be standing outside of the real tub but then you 'd need to bend over.Perhaps the best thing to do is to lay this duck tub on the bathroom floor , and the adult can sit on a stool while washing the baby inside of it . That though , I can guarantee , will make a very wet floor as our baby loves to play with water .	-1
I bought this for my 6 month old who outgrew her infant tub . I returned it less than 24 hours later . It was not as large as I expected and not stable at all . My daughter is very active and this tub just did not work for us . There really is no `` headrest '' and as soon as you put even lukewarm water in it the hot indicator will change . Would not recommend-at all !	-1
I looked for a next step solution for a bath for some time . I finally came across this one because of other reviews and I thought it was cute . When it arrived we blew it up no problem . It would have been helpful to know if the dimensions given were for the whole product or the area that the baby sits . Needless to say , this was much smaller than we thought . There were only a couple of inches of room when my baby girl extended her legs and she was 8 months old . She may be in the 90th percentile for height ( only 40 's for weight ) , but she is not a giant . There is no way she would be able to use this for very long.On another note , while this is a very cute tub and I had some fun with the quacking , my daughter did NOT like it at all . She was terrified . I think she thought we were trying to feed her to the duck . haha . So , it is being stored under our sink . Perhaps our next little one wo n't be scared of it .	-1
This duck was more of a fun purchase we thought we would take with us when we travelled . We used it once , its kind of annoying to blow up each time you want to use it and it just really is n't practical . It 's cheap so its not a big deal , we just would n't recommend buying it . Good quality overall , we like the temperature monitor to show if its too hot .	-1
Yes , totally adorable , fits nicely in regular sized tub , my daughter loved it . Our first one lasted approximately 3 months before it sprung several air leaks and we had to refill it with air daily . We were very careful with it , so the leaks seem to come from weak seams . We figured we simply had a lemon , and bought a second one . That one also lasted about 3 months , same air leaks . Now they are going to sit in a landfill , which does n't sit right with us . The second star is only because my daughter was so smitten with the design.I would rather pay much more for something better made . We recently bought a collapsible Karibu tub - yes , more expensive , but MUCH more durable and small space friendly.Karibu Folding Bath - Blue	-1
This tub deflated/popped after just a couple weeks.. I do n't know what happened but you would really be better off buying your baby one of those tub seats that they can actually sit in with the bars ( the two that I have are aquababy and safety first ) . My babies kind of liked this duck tub but they LOVE the tub seats soo much ! ! I sat them in their seats and they started laughing so hard and really enjoying it because they were actually in the water , it feels like a pool to them.. They can splash around and sit up on their own without falling over . Do not recommend this duck tub . Spend a little more on something that 's more efficient , sturdy , and fun for your child .	-1
I would love to write a good review about the cute little duck bath tub , but it arrived with a visible hole in it ! So i ca n't comment on the functionality of it when water is placed into it : ( so we purchased a different animal bathtub . Oh ! the beak quacks though ...	-1
I purchased this alongside renting a hospital grade pump . This hand pump is not worth the money . The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction . Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do . Every time I have used this the rubber pops out . To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in . A bad design and not at all sterile . Do not waste your money . I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump , it did exactly the same thing . It is the product itself that is defective	-1
I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer . Unfortunatley , breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel ( which enables the breastpump to pump ) . If you 're going to spend money , then spend it on a more accurate pump .	-1
This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings . There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin . First of all , the instructions are not user friendly . Like other Avent products , the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret . Once assembled , I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally . During the process of pumping , the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place . The pump squeaked sometimes and I could n't quite figure out why . The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk , however , during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle . I also purchased the sterilizer which works great . However , the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use . Frankly , there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart . I did n't think there was a need to have sooo many parts . Overall , this pump was very messy . For a manual pump , it was more complicated than it really had to be . And for all the reasons listed above , I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying .	-1
Do not buy this . We bought it , tried to use it , and threw it away . Avent Products contain BPA which is toxic for your baby . Dont poison your child with these toxins . Avent has to re-engineer their products .	-1
I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital 's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November . She said it was a `` good little lightweight pump , and affordable '' -- - well , I do n't think [ $ $ ] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered `` good . '' I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all ; the rubber guard has become loose and does n't adhere properly to the breast , and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out . I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out ! I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms do n't have to waste precious time , money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place . SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DO N'T BUY THIS ITEM .	-1
I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions , so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump ... Big Mistake . This manual pump takes much longer to assemble , has more parts to clean and reassemble , and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with . Granted , there is a big difference in price , but when you 're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time , the laundry is piling up , you have n't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner , and you have n't even had the energy to bathe yourself ( welcome to motherhood ) , it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds , get 4 oz . of milk in 5 minutes , and still have one arm free to hold baby .	-1
What a waste of time & amp ; energy ! This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me . Before it did , I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky . Buy any Medela pump instead . I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I 'm a stay at home Mom and do n't really need to use it very often . Sigh .	-1
This pump advertises that it 's design stimulates let-down , and that is not the case . This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one , and because it 's clear , you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump . You 'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express .	-1
I got this pump , because my electric one was a little noisy and I did n't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night . At first the pump worked great ... getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk.Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly ( I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher , so the reason for the parts not fitting right ca n't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me ) .Then , my milk supply started to diminish , due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing , but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement . I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively , with no bottles , to stimulate my milk supply back , but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever.So now the pump just sits in it 's little travel bag collecting dust , what a waist of $ 50.00 .	-1
I ca n't believe all the great reviews . Maybe its just me , but I think this pump is so overrated . The pluses : it is small , it does work OK sometimes . The negatives : it takes a long time to pump even a small amount , it has a lot of parts.And the worst one is that the plastic star valve keeps coming off , which requires taking it apart in the middle of pumping , while its leaking everywhere . I rented the Medela for 2 months before using it and believe me this thing does not compare , not even close . I use it only occasionally and it drives me crazy even than . There has to be a better hand pump out there . This is my personal opinion , so your resluts could be totally different	-1
After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working , I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis . At first I thought I had purchased a dud , but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time , and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony . I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber `` petal '' lining . And this pump can be squeeky . The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place , just when I would get a really strong suction going . Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position . Also , the wide bottles do n't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag , and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples . I use the Avent bottles to store milk , but I use the Medela bottles for feeding , which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle .	-1
I 've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours , I got this one ( my son was not nursing so often by then ) . I was disappointed . My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump . I guess I should expect that , given that it 's a handheld manual pump . Well , I did n't think it would be that tiring . Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides . The suction was too much . It would release , so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples would n't get sucked into the bottle ! Well , it was n't that bad , but it really would n't release . The output was n't what I 'd like , either . Maybe I 'm just used to the electric variety . This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms .	-1
I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike , and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it was n't a whiz and now that I 'm back to normal , it hardly works at all . The last time I used it ( so I could have a night out ) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk ( would n't you know , she only drank 1/2 ounce . ) Even when I would finally get a let down , the action/suction was n't enough to keep it going . Also , I could n't get the message cushion to work for me at all . The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and & quot ; diaphram & quot ; , but that still did n't help . It would stay sealed for a couple pumps , then unseal and seal again -- off and on . Very frustrating to deal with -- makes it hard to relax like you need to . Plus , when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk , that 's a lot of squeezing , which is also not relaxing . I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump ( as low as $ 140 in online searches . )	-1
Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I 'm glad I did n't shell out money for this pump ! It 's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple ! lol I could see the suction was working , but not particularly strong & it did n't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others ca n't get the darn thing to work at all . So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump .	-1
I tried using this pump for about 2 days till I got too frustrated to try anymore . When I did get the proper suction the pump worked easily and my milk came down easily . It was easy and quick . However 90 % of the time getting the proper suction going was the hardest thing . Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop , disassemble and reassemble that I 'd just give up . Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they were n't much help at all . Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper .	-1
I am not a fat woman , but when I 've just given birth to a baby , I 'm not a SKINNY woman , either . Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women . If you are n't super-skinny , you will never get that pillow around your waist . If you are skinny , I 'm sure this is a great product.I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside , as he was learning to sit up . It supports them all around from falling .	-1
After reading the great reviews I went with this tub . During the first use I was frustrated that my baby kept sliding down the sling . I quit using it for awhile and just used the foam turtle in the kitchen sink . Well now that he is bigger we started using the tub again . At 3 months he moves a lot . He is constantly sliding too far over to the side or his bottom lifts up on to the bump . I turned him to the infant/toddler side and he is not really ready for that . So basically this tub has been pretty worthless . I am going to purchase the Primo tub since the molding looks much more effective and safe .	-1
This tub is just ok . It supports him well ( we started it as soon as his cord fell off and he is 6 months now ) . We did not use the mesh part . My biggest rub with this tub is that water collects in some parts . If you do not tip it over and let it fully dry after each use , a slimy film will be left behind . I really feel like it should completely drain all water out . The plug has also left what looks like a rust ring on the bathtub we keep this in.Some of the crevices of the tub are kind of strange and I do n't understand why they are there . Look at the pictures , there is a deep fold around either side of the head that my fingers ca n't even reach the bottom of , so it is hard to clean out if water does collect in there.All in all , the tub works . Baby stays reletivly in place and he does get clean . When you have a baby , you want things to be as easy as possible , and these problems are just annoying . We will be throwing this one away as soon as our son is old enough to bathe in the bathtub . For our future babies , I will be buying the PRI Euro bath , which does not seem to have the strange cavernous crevices .	-1
After reading many good reviews , we registered for and received this product while expecting our first child . After she was born , however , it became apparent that it was a waste of money . She slid down the hammock constantly so we had to hold her up and keep her from having her head submerged , meanwhile , the hammock kept most of her body OUT of the water so she was cold . Perhaps some parents might be drawn to it because it will last them until their children are `` toddlers . '' Good luck keeping a toddler in this thing ! Perhaps if you have a shower only ... but I think a bucket or deep try would work just as well and be a lot cheaper . After two or three baths I gave it away to a friend who was expecting and wanted to give it a try . We ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub as a cushion until our daughter was old enough to sit up in the tub . When our second daughter was born we purchased a $ 6 infant bath sponge . It keeps her comfy , warm , and she loves it ( and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did ) . Skip this item all together .	-1
My baby hated this tub ( with and without the sling ) as did I . At most you can use it for sponge baths but you have to do it quickly or keep the baby covered with washcloths/towels because baby will get cold . I much prefer a tub where the body can be more submerged in warm water . The other thing is that if you plan to use this on a flat surface ( like in your own bathtub ) , the outlet will be plugged so the soapy water does n't run out . Why let your kid sit in the soap & grime you just washed off ? The worst part about this though is that if you plan to use it low to the ground , it 's such a hassle . My back and knees were constantly in pain . Plus lifting this thing full of water was bad for my carpal tunnel . I do love that the sling is machine-washable.I ended up happily using the baby diego deluxe bathinette . It 's high up off the ground , it has a built-in changing table and drawers for towels , bath toys , etc . It has a hose that lets dirty/soapy water run out while you 're still in washing mode but it can be plugged up for fun playing mode . My baby still did not find this one very comfortable until she sat up by herself . I may have even tried the sling from this tub in the baby diego tub .	-1
The hammock was a waiste ! Tried to use it , threw it out . The seat is not deep enough , my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water , when he 's on the & quot ; infant side & quot ; , but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems . I do n't know if that actually works , he 's not big enough yet . The tub does n't really fit in either single or double sinks , we 've tried both.I wish I knew which tub is better , so I could get it !	-1
The quality of this product is fine but we only used it 2 or 3 times and now it 's just taking up a lot of space . It was comfortable for Baby but baby bath tubs in general are a hassle to set up and clean up and store . We find it easier to simply have Baby bathe with Mommy or Daddy . This was something we certainly could have done without . If you 're on a budget , we 'd recommend asking around for a safe baby bath tub like this one to borrow as we suspect most folks do n't use them very long .	-1
The sling option was nice for my newborn baby , but , as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back . Troubles started when he was an infant , his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding.I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub . That is what I ended up buying and it is WONDERFUL .	-1
My daughter is 6 weeks old so I can not comment about the use of the tub for an older baby . Using the sling for an infant can be challenging/dangerous because it does not really craddle the baby . My daughter slips down , her feel fall over the sides , and there is not enough give in the fabric for the slind to cup her in . While I always have my hands on her while she is in the tub , it would be nice to have the sling make her more secure in the torso area so I could have more freedom to actually bathe her . I found my daughter almost fell out of the sling , and would have if my hand was on her torso . My daughter is a big newborn ( 10.8lbs ) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline , but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet . Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn .	-1
After baby starts moving more and wanting to splash.. this tub is worthless . The bump in the middle that is suppose to hold baby in seeted position is worthless , they slide them selves right over it so it is then digging in their little backs . Also , it 's not very slip resitant after your done with the hammock portion ( wich starts to smell bad even rung & hung to dry ) They grow so fast , do n't waste you money on this tub.. I 'm currently looking for another for my almost 6moth old son ... Any ideas would be appreciated !	-1
Absolutely not comfortable . My baby always slips out of it to a different sides , especially legs . She constantly slips down . So , we are forced to hold her while washing . Kind a stupid look of the washing process . Need to do it super fast , not enjoying the process . I do not understand why it has a septum on the middle - it is soooo annoying . Wish to return but too late . Also , I am very sure it is too small for toddlers .	-1
I purchased this item thinking it was BPA and phthalate free but it is not . It 's never a good sign when there is n't even a recycling symbol on the item . We 're trying to be as plastic free as possible so I returned it same day and plan to buy the Eurobath as a replacement . I will say that Diapers.com was exceptionally nice with the return . They provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service .	-1
I bought this tub after reading all the great reviews , and was very disappointed . The newborn mesh helped somewhat to keep the baby above the water , although she seemed quite uncomfortable in it . Now , that we use it as a toddler tub , it is a nightmare . The `` hump '' that is supposed to keep the child from sliding down , is useless . She slides down . And last night she leaned forward , fell out of the tub , and the tub toppled on top of her . Will not be using it again .	-1
I 've had this tub for a little over five months . At first I loved it - I was ready to give it 5 stars but decided to wait on writing a review until I had it for a little longer . The sling worked great while my son was an infant and he loves bath time . Well - he got too heavy for the sling and I started using the tub . Well after about 1.5 months of used w/o the sling , I noticed some bumps on my son 's bottom and back . At first I thought it was diaper rash , but then I began to suspect the foam on the tub . I did a before and after inspection of my son and sure enough no rash before the bath and after bath a big rash ! ! So , I 'm now buying a tub that is all plastic . My belief is that the foam is collecting some sort of mold . I guess it 's not good enough to just rinse and let it air dry ? as a parent I do n't have time to disinfect this with clorox and triple rinse every time it 's used . 2 stars instead of 1 because it was useful during infancy .	-1
I have to agree with the others that said this tub is not very comfortable . I 'm not sure what kind of baby fits well in this , but ours has n't since the day he was born and he 's 4 months now . We have been using the sling and it keeps most of his body out of the water , so he gets cold so we have to keep a washcloth over his body and keep pouring warm water over it just to keep him warm during his bath . This make bathtime a 2 person job.The hump that 's supposed to keep them from sliding down when you 're NOT using the sling is positioned directly in the middle of his back so it pokes at his back the entire time.Last week we figured he was finally big enough not to use the sling , but it was worse . He kept sliding down and we had to put it back on despite my complaints from above.I do not recommend this tub at all and am very disappointed . I do n't know why it has such high reviews .	-1
My husband and I purchased this bath at Target because it was on sale for $ 15 . At first I was excited but after using it for a month I 'm pretty disappointed . The wedge in the middle of the tub that is suppose to support the baby 's bum makes washing my 3 and 1/2 month old son pretty difficult . His feet already reach the other side of the tub so I do n't see us using it much longer . We never used the sling either because our son would have barely touched the water in it.UPDATE : I did n't like this bath before but now I hate it even more . It 's been about a month since I reviewed this and my son is now 4 1/2 months old , about 16 pounds and 24 inches long . He has become too big for the infant side of the tube , his back and bum ca n't sit comfortably on the wedge/bump in the middle of the tub and he ca n't sit up yet so the todler side is a no go .	-1
Unfortunately this was one of the items we & # 34 ; just purchased & # 34 ; without doing much research . My wife and I figured a infant tub is an infant tub right ? Well , not exactly . The sling was easy to install and seems to serve its function just fine . The baby is suspended and with the right adjustment gets the baby in the water , but keeps the head out of the water . However , our baby is only a little over a month old and I can already tell after we remove the swing the tub will be difficult to use because of the shape of the plastic.More importantly we purchased this for the & # 34 ; temperature sensitive & # 34 ; plug . When we went to give our baby his first bath I turned on the water to the hottest temperature and let it run on the plug for over 10 minutes . The plug never changed color and the water was hot enough I would n't have felt comfortable bathing in it much less put a baby in it . We had to purchase another temperature sensor to feel comfortable bathing our baby . Considering they list this as a feature and it clearly does n't work I ca n't recommend this product to anyone .	-1
I purchased this tub because of the high rating . I hate it ! Here are some pros ... First , the sling works really well for the new born . It 's very easy to bathe the new born . The problem starts when we removed the sling . Second , the hump at the bottom works very well . It helps my 2.5 month old baby sit while bathing.Here are the cons:1 . The plug . I put this tub in the adult . Since the plug is at the bottom the dirty water does not flow out once I unplug it . It 's block tightly against the big bathtub . I have to lift my baby up while my husband pick up the tub to dump the water out . He is wiggling in my arm , wet while my husband fill the tub again with right temperature water . It 's definitely a two men job . This does n't happen if you bathe your baby in the kitchen sink.2 . The tub is too short . My baby start to kick against the plastic wall at the end of the tub . Everytime he kick it , he lifted him self and his back ends up on the hump . Again , my baby is very wiggly .	-1
I had got tin this as a gift for my daughter I am not fascinated with the sling it 's way to skinny her legs keep ending up over the sides and my daughter is always slipping down in it other then that I have n't used the tub itself yet I do like that u can put ur soap and stuff in the holder it has	-1
Our son was not a large baby , but he grew out of this tub within 3 months . He also hated the sling that came with it . The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc . This was not safe . On top of that , he never seemed comfy . We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it 's perfect ! Bulky but a great tub . I wish I 'd registered for that one in the first place . This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money , in my opinion .	-1
Deep crevices make it hard to clean . Gunk settles in there and even a tooth brush ca n't fit in to clean it . Gross .	-1
This was great until our LO outgrew the sling . From about 3-5 months we could n't position our LO regardless of the side we used . He tried to roll off the sling so we had to remove it . Whether he 's on the infant or toddler side , every time he arches his back he slides and tries to lay flat but the dividers that are supposed to position and hold him in place jab him in the back . It 's actually left marks ! I 'd look for something more rounded .	-1
We found this to be useless ... not because it 's a bad product but rather why waste the money when a bath sponge will do . My baby loves to bathe and lays very calmly in the bath . But she gets cold easily so we bought a big bath sponge instead . We lay her on it and she stays much warmer . The best part is that the sponge is less than $ 4 and you can use it anywhere- the kitchen sink , tub , etc .	-1
This tub seemed like a no-brainer based on the many reviews , but I 'm not thrilled . Here 's why:1 ) You only need the sling for about a week until the baby 's cord falls off . After that I find it far preferable to put the baby in the water because he is much warmer and happier . Not worth buying this for the sling , just do sponge baths until cord falls off2 ) It 's massive for a small baby . There is a bumper to support their behind , but at 4-5 weeks the baby can arch his back and slide right over it . I used a much smaller tub at my mom 's , just a simple rectangular plastic thing that was just long enough for the baby to `` sit '' in with my support and he was much happier since he could push his legs against the end of the tub and not feel so out in the open . With this thing his legs are everywhere3 ) Because it is massive , cleanup is n't fun . Rinsing the whole thing out in a kitchen setting is awkward because it is huge . Would be OK in a big bathtub though .	-1
We received one of these and two of the Munchkin ( 3 compartment dispensers ) . Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it . When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle , it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid . The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping . ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3 . The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money , had we purchased it ourselves . Get the Munchkin dispenser instead .	-1
The product works but it is not as pictured . I had specifically bought this brand because it is the same as one I had bought for my older son . The tab to open it is not as pictured and makes it difficult to use . I thought I made the mistake and did n't really it was their mistake until I already opened and used it . So beware ! !	-1
search on youtube on videos of how to put it on ... did everything but it did NOT stayed on ... maybe it 's just me. , . it did n't work for me.. but did n't work for my baby either ... he did n't seem to like it ... i ended up pumping instead with the chap nipple.. laniosh creme works best.. and it 's okay for baby to nurse with the creme on..	-1
my baby would not latch starting day 3 so I started using the nipple shield as a temporary solution , because the baby latched right on to it and the & # 34 ; contact & # 34 ; is definitely the best one out there . however , he would not ween off of it and latch to my nipple after weeks of trying . breastfeeding also became extremely painful with the shield on or off . my boy is now 8 weeks , i have seen multiple lactation consultants , my midwives & doctors , i have gotten his tongue tie clipped , been treated for everything under the sun and still no latch ! i think that the nipple shield delayed proper treatment and allowed him to develop a preference for artificial nipples . although i 'm still trying to breastfeed daily i usually use a bottle ... still hopeful !	-1
I have a particularly small child . She was 6 lbs at birth but completely healthy . I purchased this item in hopes to get some relief for my sore nipples . The product is bigger than a bottle nipple . It 's to wide and sticks out to far . It gagged her so she would not use it . I 'm sure it probably works for some people but I had a Medela Nipple shield with my first child that covered all of the areola and was a better fit . This one is bulky . I may have ordered the wrong size so I would say contact a lactation consultant or your hospital 's doula for help . The one I used that worked ( 4 years ago ) was given to me in the hospital . I had to order this one online since we are military and stationed overseas . I did like that the baby gets more skin to skin contact with this item ... so if your child is n't a petite little one ... they may like it .	-1
I know you ca n't expect much from these products but this was horrible . I followed the directions , washed it with soap and let it soak for 20 minutes before using it . After the first use it became flimsy and sticky and would n't stick to my nipple as I expected it to . Went in the trash right away . Was	-1
My daughter did n't take to these at all . She got frustrated quickly . These did help with pain while she was trying to latch on but since she would only make a few attempts before she was in hysterics we did n't use them . I am now exclusively pumping and bottle feeding . Works better for us and much less pain for me !	-1
This thing would not stay suctioned to the table . Period . Took it back the very same day .	-1
Red sauce , beets , raspberries , etc stain the rubbery plastic . I 've tried putting it in the dishwasher whatever does n't come out . The mat also ripped because my 1 year old was annoyed that it was there .	-1
Seems to be good quality , but would n't stick to our wood dining table - I tried wetting the suction and still no luck . It 's been sitting in a drawer since we got it .	-1
I wanted to love this mat as an alternative to disposable mats in restaurants . It 's so cool how it rolls up and stores in a small space.However when unrolled , it wants to curl right back up . Because it 's fairly impossible to get the mat to lie flat , the suction cups wo n't actually stick to anything . Please note : I have pretty low expectations with suction cups in general . I do n't expect magic and know I 'll have to re-stick them throughout use . But this mat just does n't stick to anything in the first place .	-1
Ugh , where do I start ? The thing is complete crap . The suction cups stick for about 5 seconds , and since it 's designed in `` flaps '' to fold up , not only does it unstick , the different sections actually flip straight up onto the plate . The pocket does n't catch much food because it is angled *towards the table* instead of towards the kid . The texture is hard to clean , it 's also bulky . I could n't imagine toting this around to restaurants , those sticky plastic ones with the graphics are cheaper , disposable , and honestly much more convenient . I 'm now still in search of a GOOD toddler placemat !	-1
I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about . But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off . Plus when we were all done , I had to try to clean it off as best I could , then put it in my diaper bag-yuck ! I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table .	-1
As some other reviewers have said , this item does NOT stay flat -- it comes folded in the box and the fold lines were very strong and could n't be `` unfolded '' ( is n't this not supposed to happen with silicone ? I think this item is a silicone-rubber blend ) , which made it hard for the suction cups to stick etc etc ... between the item not unfolding all the way flat and the unevenness caused by the large suction cups underneath , bottom line is that the mat would not stay flat which made it impossible to put a sippy cup on it without the cup falling over and so on . Ask me how frustrating this was with a baby who likes to flip everything over anyway , to have the items that I expected to stay upright falling over constantly.Also , other reviewers have noted that this item only sticks to glass tabletops , which means that when faced with a tablecloth not only does it not stick but the uncompressed suction cups make a nice uneven rolly playground for all of your baby 's utensils , foods , and liquid to fall over and roll around on , nice and messy ! I also want to add that at one restaurant that had fancy wood tables , the suction cups had trouble sticking so my husband placed a drop of water underneath each suction cup like they recommend ... . which worked fine , except that the moisture-suction blend left marks on the table ! I do n't think it was permanent damage , but you never know with wood and moisture ... that 's just one more thing you have to be sorry to the restaurant for : ( I bought this one insteadNUK Gerber Graduates 100 % Silicone Platemat -- it does n't have suction cups but it 's PERFECT . It 's true silicone ( and not a silicone-rubber blend ) which means it retains its flat shape no matter what you do to it . And the silicone-ness does have a `` stickiness '' to it , just enough to keep the mat from sliding around . The pic description shows it rolled up , but I just fold it into quarters and store it in a quart ziplock baggie in my diaper bag , perfect ! It actually ships to you folded anyway . And the edging on it ( which the tinydiner mat also does not have ) keeps spills from escaping and dropped food from rolling onto an icky restaurant table . Ca n't say enough good things about the NUK Gerber silicone mat .	-1
I bought the placemat for travel purposes for my 15 month old who loves to self-feed but will throw plates around if they are in front of him . In theory , this placemat is a great idea but the suctions are not strong enough for a toddler ; he had this thing off the table in 15 seconds . Now it is sitting in the closet . I hate wasting money .	-1
This little mat has rubber stoppers on the bottom to hold it down . The only problem is that the little stoppers do n't work .	-1
We tried this placemat along with the disposable ones and neither worked for us . This one was just too bulky to carry in her bag ... it never folded back up to the size it was in the box . We also had trouble getting it to stick to tables . The least little bit of moisture or texture and it would n't work . On the rare occasions that we could get it to work then we had to deal with cleaning it . Wipes did n't work and napkins were even worse . Most times my husband or I had to head off to the restroom to try to get it clean enough to take home . It honestly was more trouble than it was worth . We finally just opted for cleaning wipes in her bag ... we clean the heck out of her area of the table and then just let her have at it . When she 's done we clean up her mess.I understand the theory behind this product but it needs works before it 's a real benefit and must have item .	-1
not too happy about this product . it was still a pain to clean . the kiddo can still splash food and drink . and after placing it in storage for a month or two mold started growing on it .	-1
The suction cups are worthless . When this arrived , I tried it one time and my son threw the entire meal on the floor within about half a minute . I am mad at whoever designed this stupid thing , let alone decided it was worth $ 12 ( including shipping ! ) . It is still , a week later , curled up ( wo n't lay flat ) and the suction cups do n't stick to anything . More of a toy than a placemat . I am back to the disposable placemats with sticky stuff on the back .	-1
Do not buy this does n't work at all waste of money ! ! ! Go buy a food processor or some other type of food mill bc this is such a waste !	-1
After feeding my first child store bought baby food I was on the hunt for a product that would soften my budget while being moderately easy to operate and clean . I went for this one because I did n't want to be making big batches of baby food at a time - way too busy for that- and wanted to be able to just pop in something from the table for my baby girl to eat . My first try was strawberries and while it seemed to work it really just pressed all the juices out of them and really did little to the berries other than press them and leave them under the plastic grate . I added some rice cereal to the juice and pressed on determine to make it work . My next try was some spinach pasta with sauce . I first tried it with the pasta just the way it was and all it did was twirl the pasta around the blades . Next , I tried cutting it into about one inch pieces and added a couple of the red peppers that were in the sauce ( and very soft and well cooked ) . After pressing down with all my might while trying to spin it without snapping the arm off all I again got was very pressed food and little 'ground ' food for my baby to eat . I pressed on with chopped and peeled apples , finely cut up into about pencil eraser size . I was rewarded with several spoonfuls of apple sauce but when I went to clean the device I found that about 80 % of the apples I had put in had just been pressed , had the juice squeezed out and were still in the tube below the blades . NOT worth the trouble for a busy mom . May work okay if you steam and peel all fruits and veggies but I was looking for something to make my life easier , not create more work . I read so hopefully the reviews about this product grinding meat and just ca n't make it come anywhere close to producing an edible result . Busy moms beware !	-1
I had high hopes for this food mill , having purchased it after reading many reviews of this and similar products.I remember a reviewer writing that the space between the grinding disk and the bottom of the plunger was too large when fully collapsed ( you push one piece into the other to push food towards the grinding disks ) . This is exactly correct . I tried to puree a small portion ( 1/2 a pear ) and nothing came out except juice ! All the fruit was stuck below the disks . Since my goal in getting this was the be able to puree small portions on the go it was no good for me . I returned it.I gave it two stars because it might work better if pureeing larger portions and the components themselves seem well made albeit poorly designed .	-1
My two year old simply slid open his closet like normal and both `` wings '' snapped right off , allowing him access . Waste of $ .	-1
I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet , and so I was thrilled when I found this product . However , it wo n't stay on the door . First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it . No luck . Then I tried gorilla glue . Both the `` lock '' and the paint came off the closet door . My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.IF you can get it to stay on the door , it works great . However , good luck getting it to stay !	-1
Wo n't stick to doors , fell right off . Completely useless . I 've got similar ones that the prior owners of my house installed that work great , they hold quite securely . These are not the same , unfortunately .	-1
I returned this ASAP ! It was AWFUL ! It comes with a thick bar that you have to place the toilet seat ON TOP of ! This elevates the toilet seat in the back and the only thing the seat is hanging on by is the flimsy plastic hinges of the seat ! ! I figured out quickly that if you sit down on the seat a few times , it will break off the hinges of your toilet seat and you 'll have to buy a new seat ! Whoever thought up this STUPID design did not think it through ! From other reviews , I see people have already broken some seats . Sent this back and boughtMommy 's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lokand I like it a lot better than this one ! Note : NO toilet seat lock will give you a super tight seal . There 's always going to be some inch or so that you will be able to open the seat , but at least your child wo n't drown -- maybe just some of his toys will !	-1
Bought this to keep our baby boy safe & # 8230 ; this ca n't be installed with the toilet seat we have . It is a random seat from BB & Beyond & # 8230 ; I feel they should have mentioned this that it wo n't fit all seats & # 8230 ; only the ones who are entirely screwed on . Ours has snaps that snap into place so this thing ca n't be attached properly . Will have to return it .	-1
These really dont do anything special . I cant find a use for them . The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money . Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products . There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price	-1
I must be doing something wrong because it leaks . What is the point if it is n't air tight ? I just use the regular bottle tops . However , this is not a knock against the Avent system , these are my favorite bottles , the only ones to decrease spit-up !	-1
we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they do n't fit the avent bottles the i bought , so we ended up throwing them in the trash , if u wan na store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective .	-1
These were a waste of money as they did not fit my bottles properly and the bottles did not seal and leaked . I threw them away .	-1
I have to agree with the other reviewers about this being more toy like than serious potty training . My daughter loves sticking her hand in the bowl to make it play the song and she loves taking the bowl out . There are times when she does n't go and the music goes off which is confusing . I will probably buy another one just so she can distinguish the difference . Once she figured out she could make it play without going potty she quit using it .	-1
I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger . It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy . Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy . Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks . The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did.I never even used the music part of it so i can not review that but i think that it is useless.I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool . I would not buy this potty again . I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good.If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things , then it probably would be the best potty .	-1
do not buy this potty chair simply for the `` bells and whistles '' they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time . I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes , my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on . The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys , but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in . I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front , rather than underneath , it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out . There are even times that my older son 's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat . If I had to do it all again , I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too !	-1
I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things , but I was wrong with this one . First of all , the music plays only when the chair is moved ... it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it . Secondly , I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy . The `` protector '' is there for decoration only , at least that 's what it seems to me ... and let 's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old ... I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool , at least I could have got some use out of that ...	-1
My son also rips these right off the table . He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older ( fortunately I only bought the 20 pack ) . This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical . I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update : I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well . The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well ( pack of 8 for $ 1 ) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10 . These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand .	-1
There are several different Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing pillows available and they are not all created equal . For some crazy reason the pink one in not removable so the washing instructions state to simply spot clean ... gross ! I sent this one back and found another one that is removable/Machine washable .	-1
I 've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you ca n't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it . My son recently had a dirty ( poop ) diaper leak ( not a big leak , like a drop or two ) , and I do n't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again . I do n't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym , swing , and bouncer for times I need to put him down . I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles . He 's 7 weeks old . I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove .	-1
The pillow provides decent support for the baby while feeding , but only allows for spot cleaning . And let 's face it . Spilled milk and spit up need to be thoroughly washed from the material . I am going to have to buy a washable cover . Might as well have bought a slightly more expensive pillow .	-1
I 've had two of these and two Boppy brand pillows . These are about half the price , are firmer , thicker and sturdier . I like that baby is boosted up a little bit higher and that the pillow does n't go flat over the course of a year of breast feeding ! ****Update : baby arrived three weeks ago and I was happy with my pillow until the first big spit up . That 's when I realized this pillow had no cover , unlike previous versions . Yucky . Then , last week , he seams began unravelling , this is NOT the same quality pillow I purchased faux years ago for kid # 1 . Ca n't return it since the window is expired but will be trying to call customer supports or Leachco .	-1
Due to the good reviews by others , this product might just not be the right fit for my baby . When he is sitted in the position just like the one in the picture , my baby did not look comfortable . His head seem to be tilted back slightly ( so the neck is not supported to be straight ) . I guess it just did n't work out for us	-1
Though the material is nice and it arrived promptly , I did no enjoy this particular brand . It was uncomfortable to wear and it became easier to use a normal livingroom/bedroom pillow to help with the feeding .	-1
I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak . At first they were okay , but then my son had trouble feeding from them . The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast . Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all ! IF you tighten the bottom too much , the baby ca n't get any milk . Whenever I used these , I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air . Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME . Try the Playtex Premium Nurser . It works much better .	-1
Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse . The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer . With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning , warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient . I 'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first . In our case , these bottles were n't worth the money .	-1
I chose these for my first child because my close friend was using them with her daughter and they did n't seem to have any leak problems . At first , I did n't either . Not difficult to figure out how to assemble or anything . No problems.However , I was soon dissapointed ... of course , only after I bought more of this brand.After 2-3 weeks the numbers came off the bottles so you had to eye the measurements.My son is still at 6 oz , but if he ever gets 8 oz I do n't know how I 'm going to easily fill these bottles as the 8 oz line is very close to the nipple despite the 9 oz bottle measurement.The bottles WILL randomly leak . It 's usually at inconvienant times like in the middle of the grocery store or while they are filled with water in your diaper bag . Considering I found another brand that had a solid bottom that gave my son no issues , that was a serious PITA.I have no clue when he 'll ever need the fast flow nipples . He 's a big eater but at 7 mo whenever he tries the fast nipples ( or I accidently put them on ) he spills milk everywhere.I ca n't say I did n't get my use out of them but I wo n't buy these again .	-1
I do n't know if I like these or not . I have several and have been using them since my son was born four months ago.The formula does n't come out the way all of the books say it 's supposed to , about a drop per second . Actually , nothing comes out unless you milk the nipple , or more obviously , if the baby is sucking on it . I did try using the second stage nipple and the formula comes out far to fast and my son wo n't have anything to do with it at this point ... perhaps when he 's older he can handle the rate of flow for the stage 2 nipple.One of the design flaws is the round silicone insert that eliminates the air in the bottle . If you do n't put it in properly after washing , the formula will leak from the bottom of the bottle . It also seems that when it is in correctly , occasionally it creates some sort of seal or pressure , and the formula wo n't come out of the bottle at all.I still use them because I have them , and they do serve their purpose . However , if I had the opportunity to buy new bottles , I would definitely go with Dr. Brown 's instead .	-1
I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital . BIG MISTAKE ! She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them . I tried both the stage one and two . I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag . She loves it and I love it because I do n't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat ! I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis . The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them .	-1
these bottles are not worth the money.. they are so complicated to put together and they always leak . my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides . please think about using another bottle , I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles & # 62 ; they are definitely the best on the market .	-1
I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles . Unfortunately , they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.I do n't have a dishwasher , so I have to hand wash each piece . I feel like my life revolves around washing , drying and assembling bottles . My son is gassy . He burps often with them , but he feeds well.Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on . Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple . Also , it 's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula . If you place it in water the bottom collects it , only to pour out when it is inverted.I give them 3 stars for my son ... I give them 1 star for myself !	-1
These are no where near the same quality as the Playtex VentAire Wide Bottle . I thought they were at least in the same family but I was completely wrong . The universal nipples that Playtex makes for all their bottles do not fit on these bottles . Also there are no meterings on the side so there 's no way to know how much milk is in the bottle . These were so far from what we wanted we did n't even use them and ended up donating them to charity.However , you do n't have to look too far to find the perfect bottle and they are somewhat related . The Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set is exactly what you want . They are so good in fact we went back and bought another set.ALSO BUYER BEWARE EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER USED THESE BOTTLES AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN THEM !	-1
Let me start off by saying I love HALO sleep sacks have used them for a year now with my son . I have nothing against this actual product but more so with how it arrived.I find it difficult to believe that this product was new . The plastic wrapping was broken in places with tape keeping it closed . The sleep sack itself had a leaf , yes a leaf , on it within the packing . For the price of this item I expect that I am getting a brand new item not one that has already been opened . I do n't feel the hassle of returning it and ordering another would really be worthwhile so I threw the item in the wash and will use it once it 's dry.So in a nutshell , like the product wish I received one that had n't previously been opened previously .	-1
I bought this b/c I have 2 other Halo sacks which I loved but were more expensive . There 's a reason for difference in price - material not as soft and the zipper separates . Poor quality .	-1
We always have our room temperature at 67 for the night . We worry that our 5 month old will kick off the blanket , so we got this based on the good reviews . My baby 's hands are freezing cold after a night in this . Hers were always warm with a blanket . I guess it is because the arms are all exposed ? I have to say that I prefer a blanket based on this one night 's data .	-1
I like that this garment is flame resistant , that it is spacious and sleeveless , but that 's about it . The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use . It continually splits from the wrong end , so every time the baby wakes up , she 's come out of it . I regret this purchase .	-1
I recently got this and it had a very strong mothball smell . Washed it twice , soaked it in oxyclean and still could n't get the odor out . Returned it .	-1
I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids . Even though where I live is n't extremely cold it 's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough . Also because of his size , it kept riding up on him which was really annoying .	-1
Another MUST HAVE I was told . I think not . Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing . The boppy just was n't comfortable for me , it was too stiff . I did n't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy , size 10-12 while nursing . I really think it is overrated and not necessary.I have heard good things about `` my breast friend '' I might try that one next time . But still felt like the pillows did the trick .	-1
The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing . It was given to me as a gift , a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due . In the beginning , I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times . Now I just grab my daughter , go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy ! The boppy is collecting dust . Pillows work just fine ! UPDATE : after 2 years and 2 babies , the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months : for putting behind them for sitting up ! I still ca n't stand the boppy for nursing , but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up !	-1
I registered for the Boppy because everyone said it was a `` Must Have '' . I am breastfeeding my baby and I do not think it is a `` Must Have '' but it is nice to have - just not for breastfeeding.I tried using it for breastfeeding and found that there are other pillows out there that work better . The reasons are:1 ) It is designed to fit around your waist but it keeps sliping out on my lap.2 ) The top is curved and the baby can easily roll off the Boppy , especially as he gets bigger.I later purchased a Tresor breastfeeding pillow that was recommended by a lactation consultant and found it much more useful . It comes with a buckle that can be attached around your waist so it stays put on your lap . Also it is much larger and flat accros the top . I do not feel like the baby is going to roll off the pillow , which is nice when you are trying to undo a nursing bra or grab a burp cloth.I do love the Boppy for other reasons . I have used it as a `` nest '' for my napping baby . He is now 8 weeks old and frequently I put him in the Boppy to curl up while I am doing other things . He seems really comfortable and stays put . I 'm sure as he gets older we will use it more for sitting up and tummy time.The fleece cover is nice and seems to stay clean . It has washed well a couple of times . However the extra covers that we purchased came apart in the laundry.I recommend getting the Boppy for other reasons than for breastfeeding .	-1
I 'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a `` must-have '' I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better . The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby . The U-shape is n't especially comfortable to me . The other problem I 've had is washing . They come with slip covers now , but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself , it screws up the distribution of the stuffing.I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow : it has a back support and is adjustable . Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on . Mine is the inflatable version , which is great - when you take off the cover to wash , you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth . My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy .	-1
Even though I ended up bottle feeding , I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow . I am not a huge person , but a little larger than average , and this pillow just DID NOT work for me . I tried it every which way I could , and no such luck.My son enjoys it as much as a 3.5 month old can . Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant , it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better , because most likely , this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women .	-1
1 . It was not the same as the photo , but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2 . Baby only likes it slightly .	-1
I was looking for something that my baby could hold and snuggle and I could attach my own paci of choice to , this seemed to be a great idea however the product itself is lacking . The pacifier attachment is difficult , you ca n't easily remove the paci to clean , I 'm actually afraid I 'd break the elastic if I tried it again . I also liked the idea of a silky side but it looks terrible . I washed it on gentle and let it air dry before giving it to my baby and all the silk starting unraveling then so I trimmed those threads . After my baby has grabbed at it for a day its all snagged . I give it two stars bc its a great idea but the materials used are so poor I doubt it will last more than a week more .	-1
Let me start by saying that I do n't leak a ton and I got a free box of these . That being said , even for free I do n't want to use these . They sound ( yes sound ) horrible as they 're crinkly . If I leaked more I 'd be really concerned because I just do n't see how these would hold up . When I push them aside to nurse they ball up and I ca n't really reuse them . I like the avent so much better ( softer , not crinkly , absorbent and actually hold up ) . I would n't spend the $ on these ever even if they were the only option .	-1
TERRIBLE ! These pads make already sensitive nipples itch like crazy ! And the pleats make them very bulky in your bra . Plus , there is only one weak adhesive strip , so they slide all over the place . Bad bad bad . The Lansinoh pads are the best , no question .	-1
PROSI 've never leaked.It 's really thin.CONSIt feels like plastic.It does not allow my skin to breathe and make my breasts really itchy.It wo n't stick to your bra . The small sticky tab does n't do much.It stinks at the end of the day.Yellow powder gets on your fingers if you open the wrapper wrong.Lansinoh has two sticky tabs that work . And it does n't make my breasts itchy or sweaty . And their wrappers do not have any weird coloring on it .	-1
I 've always used Lansinoh nursing pads , but decided to try these , since they were half as expensive . I found out there 's a reason they 're half as expensive . They 're incredibly itchy ! Many times the pleat on the inside has a scratchy piece of glue that rubs and is uncomfortable . Also , after nursing once or twice the stuffing gets all messed up and bunchy , which is a huge pain in public because it 's hard to change them discreetly , but if you do n't , it looks like you have a wad of Kleenex stuffed into your bra . Not cool . Stick with Lansinoh .	-1
Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least . My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so . I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless ! Totally crazy I know ! These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they 're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places . The tape is pointless as they do n't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried . If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place . One other issue is and at the same time it 's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer , you do n't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it 's completely soaked through for who knows how long ! It 's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish , but you only know this when you check it . I would not buy these again .	-1
I used these less than 2 years ago with my daughter and remember them being comparable to the lansinoh . This time around , I gave them another shot , and am very disappointed . They are rough and irritate my skin . Also , the adhesive does not hold well . There is only one `` sticky '' spot , which just does n't cut it . I end up having to change them every time I nurse because they roll up inside my bra and wo n't stick back on . I 've been perfectly happy withLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads , 60-Count Boxes ( Pack of 4 ) ... and if you are ordering from amazon , they are much cheaper than these anyway .	-1
These pads are definitely due for some revamping . When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size , it 's ridiculous to have a `` one pad fits all '' type of product . I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads , but after trying everything out there , I would argue that washable pads : *fit better*look better from the outside ( these look like you 're stuffing with Kleenex ) *are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot , but before settling on these pads , try both . I bought every kind out there , both reusable and disposable , and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity . They fit well , are n't noticable , and wo n't leak .	-1
These pads work fine for minimal leaking during the day , but are pretty worthless for heavy leaking . Once my baby started sleeping through the night , I would wake up with these saturated and my shirt drenched . Buy the lansinoh pads , they are much better for heavy leaks .	-1
I had heard so much about Medela , they were great for nursing supplies . When I ordered these breast pads , I thought they would be a great deal . Unfortunately these pads are not good for mothers who produce a lot of milk . I ended up changing my nursing pads three times a day , and had to get up in the middle of the night to change them again . I had high hopes that fell dreadfully low . I would not suggest this for friends .	-1
I have C-cup and I found that the fit was terrible . You could also see them under my clothes . But worst of all - it actually dried onto my nipple and tore some skin off when I tried to remove them ! ! ! I threw the rest of the box away . Then I tried Lansanoh pads , both super absorbant & ultra thin , and loved them both . No problems with sticking . I do n't recommend the Medela nursing pads at all .	-1
I received two sample pairs of these breast pads when I bought my Medela Pump in Style , and I 'm glad I got the pads for free instead of spending $ 10 on a whole box . Yes , the pads are thin and so they do n't show through clothing . However , I have n't had a problem with any of the pads I 've worn showing . These pads make a big deal about being `` form fitted '' due to the two little pleats , which give them a natural 3-dimensional curve . However , again , I 've never had a problem with unpleated pads and how they fit ( and I have a VERY large bust ) . But , the thing that I really hate about the Medela pads is the adhesive . It 's such a small piece of adhesive that it really should have been left off entirely . It 's just big enough to make it hard to remove the pads from the bra for nursing , but it 's too small to really hold the pad in place while the bra is open . This makes the pad ruffle up badly , and it 's very difficult to get it back into shape when you put your bra back in place . After only one or two times of putting the bra down and back up , I found that the pads were bunched up into uncomfortable , lumpy balls inside my bra , and there was really no way of fixing them . Personally , I prefer the First Years nursing pads with lanolin . They are very absorbent , they hold their shape through multiple nursing sessions , and they do n't show through clothing .	-1
These pads are very thin and do not show through your clothes . I never leaked much , so these pads worked fine in that respect . However , they do not hold up when you open your nursing bra for frequent breastfeeding . The adhesive on the lining does not stay stuck to the bra and the absorbent filling comes loose and bunches up.If you have these , they will work , but I much prefer the Lansinoh pads .	-1
I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk . Pretty colors , remote control , several classical tunes ... well , it would be perfect if it worked . It broke the same evening I put it together . Though the music played , the mobile did n't go around as it was supposed to . I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts , but it still did n't work . I ended up returning it to BRU . Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem . I do give it one star because it is pretty ... but that 's about it ! : - )	-1
Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food . I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work . Even then , it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill . We also tried with bananas and got the same result . The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling . Once , when pushing down while grinding , the whole thing slipped and tipped over.Worthless ! I returned the product and will be buying a quality , heavy-duty food mill , even though it will cost me more .	-1
I got this as a baby shower gift and thought it seemed like a good idea since I did n't intend to buy jarred food.It is hard to put together , very hard to take apart , and a total pain to clean . Also , it does n't grind the food very well AT ALL . The very few times I tried to use it I got so mad that I swore I 'd never use it again.It turned out that I did n't really need to puree food for my baby anyways . Simply mashing in a bowl with a fork or cutting into very small pieces was completely sufficient .	-1
It sounds like it worked for others , but I guess it just was n't for me . It seems to stick and feels like it would require a lot of pressure to actually get parts to move . I tried it and thought I 'd nock the table over it took so much pressure so I stopped . I 've had it in my car for months , but I ca n't bring myself to give it another try . It was just too painful . I was really optimistic about it so I got rid of the box before I ever tried it so I could n't return it . I might sell it on e-bay or give it to someone .	-1
I am VERY disappointed with this product . It worked the first two times I tried it , with an apple and a pear . I tried it again this morning with an apple and could n't get it to grate the apple at all . I think the blade has dulled ... Anyway , I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it .	-1
good concept but very messy and hard to clean up . i should have bought ended up buying an electric food processor .	-1
If I could give this product less than 1 star , I would . My Mom told me that all 's I needed was a grinder to feed my baby , so I bought this one . It never ground up a single piece of food . My Mom was convinced that maybe I was doing it wrong and she had the same experience . Her reaction was `` they just do n't make things they way they use to . '' It was a waist of money and after many attempts , it ended up in the trash . We ended up using a fork to mash soft foods and a small food processor for bigger stuff . My next baby , I hope to invest in the Beaba Baby Cooker .	-1
I do n't know if it works . It is still in it 's plastic wrap . The reason I am writing a review is because I did not have to use it . I used a hand blender all the time when I had to puree food . When she was old enough to eat regular food , she did n't want pureed food any more . Just about everyone has a blender or food processor . Spend your money on something like more ice cube trays ( to freeze your baby food ) and pyrex containers ( to store and heat up your babies food ) .	-1
i received this as a gift from my mother . Those of you pureeing meat in your food mill -- - do we have the same product ? ? ? ? ? Mine has a plastic grate . I **barely** mashed up some cooked peas in this thing . I ca n't imagine getting meat through this ! That `` blade '' is like a dull butter knife . It worked great with a ripe avocado , and that was about the end of that . You really need three hands to get this working - two to push down and stabilize at the same time ( I have to press really really hard ) , and a third to turn the handle . I have yet to be able to successfully turn the handle and press at the same time in any effective fashion . You also have to get messy to get the grate disk off , the only way to do it is to press down on the dirty grate with your thumbs and work it off . When it 's covered in a slick puree that 's not easy . Also , the plastic stains easily . I put a watermelon chunk in there , and now it 's permanently stained orange . It 's a great concept , but I would NOT buy this .	-1
AND it 's frustrating . It does n't puree food , it 's hard to clean , hard to use , and made from crappy plastic . What a waste ! My mom said she had something similar when I was a baby and so bought me this , but I will NOT be buying this for my grandkids . I hope they discontinue it .	-1
I ordered this because it contains the colors babies are first able to see . I was disappointed with the quality . The pictures look like a five year old drew them and are somewhat scary . Great concept , poor quality .	-1
The stitching is coming undone everywhere . I returned the blanket to the manufacturer and got a replacement blanket ( which took forever ) and it is coming undone too . And everything shrank when I washed them . Everything wrinkles really easily too . Over priced and poor quality if you ask me .	-1
I would not recommend buying a crib set . We have this one and it is cute , but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS . The valences hang down really low , so we were unable to use them with our blinds . Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them , so we have yet to use the comforter . We did get the rug , found the set of pictures that match , and use the crib skirt . They are cute in his room . We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too .	-1
We used this hamper for nearly nine months for my daughter and it has been great . The mesh bag does make it very easy to move the dirty laundry to the washer . After about nine months we decided it was time to toss the denim portion into the wash . Following the instructions I was excited to have a revitalized hamper . Sadly , when I tried to fit it back onto the frame it had shrunk considerably . I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro , but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry , do n't even let the dryer look at the wet item ! : ) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby # 2 when the time comes .	-1
I did n't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat , there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well ( b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back . ) So I was going to sell the mirror , but then I touched the mirror with my hand ( I guess I had lotion on ? ? ) and there was a huge black smear . So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner , and that made the whole mirror worse , so now it 's all foggy ! Also , the remote did n't come even close to fitting on my visor .	-1
I bought mine March 9 , 2009 and it 's August 7 , 2009 and it no longer works . The remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on , but you have to shut it off manually . The music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts . I did really like it at first though . It takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around .	-1
I thought it would be comforting to see my baby when she was rear facing , however as I soon found out if you are ever rear-ended this becomes a very dangerous projectile , that is aimed right at the babies head . I found that several babies are injured like this every year . It just is n't worth it ! ! !	-1
SO we were taking a very long , very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old . It would have been helpful if it had WORKED . We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way ( where I purchased the first ) and NONE of them worked . I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning . Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror !	-1
this was a big waste of money . remote didnt work and the music was grainy	-1
We bought this to see the baby in the rear view mirror . This mirror was a big disappointment because it was totally useless for that purpose . It was really really difficult to attach the mirror - there was absolutely no place to attach it in order to see the baby . Instead , it is kind of useful as a mirror to entertain the baby in the car . BUt I would n't spend $ 20 on a mirror for that purpose ! I guess the music is ok , but we can easily use a CD with better music for those purposes .	-1
I did n't like this because I could n't see my son in the mirror . I drive an SUV and I found a bigger mirror instead .	-1
My son absolutely loves this mirror . He laughs and smiles at himself . He does not like riding in the car without this mirror.As for me , I have my pros and CONS ! My pro is I can see my son at all times . I feel much safer knowing I can see him . Also , it 's fun to look up and see his beautiful face as he recognizes himself and that he is truly gorgeous . The remote is convenient to turn on music if he starts to fuss.My cons are as follows : The remote is great , but it requires you to leave the mirror on , which does n't allow long battery life . My mirror looked a little hazy when I installed it , thinking it was just finger prints , I left it until this week . It ONLY took me between 5-10 minutes to unhook it from the car . When I tried to clean it ( first water , then window spray , then some windshield wax ) it went from hazy , to more hazy , to scratched , to beyond scratched , to wiping some of the mirror away.Well , I decided I 'd go without it since I do n't feel like wasting $ 20 again . That was until my son was in the car crying because he is used to seeing his beautiful face . I think I may try a different brand mirror this time .	-1
I put the batteries in and nothing works ! No lights , no music , I could have just purchased a $ 1.99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest . I 'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it does n't even work . What a waste of money.Please note that this actually is n't manufactured by Fisher Price ; the name is licensed . I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company , Blue Ridge , is giving Fisher Price a bad name ! I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into , but thought oh , since I generally have good luck with products , it 'll be OK. Actually , it 's not OK ! I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue . It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective . We 'll see what they have to say .	-1
One thing I liked about this mirror was the bright colors , shapes and animals along the border . My son did like to look at them . I ended up returning this mirror though for a few reasons.I could not get this mirror to stay put in my car . I tried three different methods/positions of installing it and it had shifted each time I got in the car . I thought I would like it because the mirror was so big and it would be easy to see my baby , but each shift resulted in my baby being out of view.The noises that came out of it were horrible . I thought it was supposed to play a song , but it was just some grinding static-like noise . I tried replacing the batteries to see if I could get music , but I did not.The remote did not work unless it was within a few inches of the mirror . It was not practical or safe for me to reach back behind myself while driving . I tried replacing these batteries too , to no avail.Perhaps mine was just defective . After all , I 've been quite happy with other Fisher Price items I own .	-1
We got our gate about 5 years ago . We used it about a year with our second child . Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again . After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position . I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews . This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture . I 'll be looking for a new gate now !	-1
This is probably the worst product I have ever bought.With two children 16 months apart , I knew I 'd need an installed gate for our ground floor . Based on the ratings in Consumer Reports and the reviews on this website , I eagerly purchased two of these to keep the kids in our living room.The instructions were very clear and I was looking forward to installing the gates . I figured it would take time but if I followed all the steps , it should be simple . Nothing could 've been further from the truth.We used the templates provided by The First Years and they were of no use . I ended up drilling and re-drilling in all four walls . One wall we had to replaster and I will have to repaint when I have the time.We had to make TWO trips to Home Depot to get replacement screws . The heads of the screws provided in the box continued to break whether we used a power screwdriver or tried to install them by hand . Fortunately , we never had a problem with the Home Depot screws.Please , I beg you not to waste your money on this product .	-1
I purchased this step stool along with the `` Munchkin folding stepstool '' . I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height . The stool arrives set at the lowest setting , and to make it higher , you rotate the top 180 degrees . An intersting design ! However be warned ... the top is somewhat rounded , and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall . This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools , the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier ( has not tipped yet ) . Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool , there are better options out there ... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath ! Hope this helps !	-1
We used this once.. It was just not needed ... roll some receiving blankets and viola ... I would not spend the money on this again .	-1
The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib , including any of these sleep positioners or wedges , because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars . The truth is that you will probably not need it . Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way . I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it . He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again , but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary ! ! My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this .	-1
This is a great concept , but ... My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two . He would be half out of the top after an hour or so . It just did n't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway , it may actually be dangerous.Also , ( he was a June baby ) the polyester type material made him very sweaty , which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings . I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product .	-1
I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower . I thought it would be wonderful . I was wrong . My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner . In fact , a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides . SCARY ! This started happening after about 3 weeks of age . Until this age she was fine with it ... but by 3 weeks ... she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part . I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow . Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone . It 's not worth the risk .	-1
I bought this for my son to try and get him to sleep properly but he ended up finding ways to escape it . I tried this on him for three days but I would get up to find him slid out of it , giving me his mischievious grin . Luckily I was able to return it and get back the money I wasted . I think it 's useless . Babies are too smart for this . They will find ways out of it .	-1
The first night I tried this , my newborn slid down in between the bumpers . This product is dangerous .	-1
i registered and received this item , but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest , but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me , and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over , and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one , which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib . this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom , but a waste	-1
We have this positioner in the porta crib and the Air Flow positioner in the bassinet . The Inclined to Sleep positioner is n't our favorite because our 3 week old slides down in it while sleeping and wakes up crying and uncomfortable . ( This does n't happen in the Air Flow which is 1/2 the price ! ) The Inclined to Sleep looks comfortable , but not when the little one wakes up crying and uncomfortable !	-1
We returned it because we really were unhappy with it . Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in . We purchased the `` First Years Air Flow '' sleep positioner instead and love it .	-1
I am not too impressed with this product . It was okay for the first week , but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up , which defeated the purpose . The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep . Another problem is with washing it . It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off . It is like it does n't fit properly . My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I bought this when my daughter was a month old and had terrible reflux . Not only did it not help the reflux , but I do n't feel it was safe and it did n't hold up in the washing machine . On several occasions , my daughter ended up sliding down in between the side positioners . She was very small , born just over 5lbs , and did not fit to well in this . Because of her reflux , I needed this to stand up to repeated washings . Even with putting absorbant materieal on top of this to try and protect it , she still spit up right through it . When I washed this item , it ended up being deformed . Save your money and find something else . This product is not grea.t The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is my daughter seemed somewhat comfortable in it , that it until she fell in between the positioners .	-1
I registered for this item before my son was born because I was a nervous first-time mom who , like many , was terrified of SIDS . I wanted to make sure that my baby would be safely positioned on his back and would not inadvertently roll over during the night . What nobody told me was that my baby would not roll over as a young infant ( because he simply was not strong enough yet ) , and that he would also wiggle around in a sleep positioner and end up in a very different place than where I left him.I used the sleep positioner in a bassinet right next to our bed , and I frequently found my baby scrunched up at the bottom of the positioner against the base of the bassinet . Once , I found him with his head hanging precariously over the top edge . After that , I took the sleep positioner out of the bassinet . I used it for a grand total of 6 weeks . Knowing what I know now , I do n't think I will be using it for my next child . I know now that my young infant will be able to stay on his/her back without artificial aids . I know now that babies slide down inclined surfaces . And I know now that the SIDS Alliance recommends NOT using sleep positioners in your child 's crib . So I would recommend passing on the sleep positioners ( unless instructed otherwise by your pediatrician ) , and making sure your child 's sleeping environment is as safe as possible .	-1
This was fine for the first couple weeks , then I realized that it actually did n't do much help . Sometimes it would slide up or down and just was n't long enough for him ( and my guy is a short guy ! ) . I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him . Worked perfect !	-1
This product does n't get the job done . My son slid down it every night . I finally gave up . Also not matter how I placed the side things he always mannaged to roll onto his side . Once he got older ( 2 months ) if he was n't sliding down it , he was pushing himself up it . Then his head fell off of the top and got wedged in between this and the bumper ! That is when I stopped using it.It 's a great concept , just not practical .	-1
I wish I had done more research before buying this item . After talking to the hospital staff & reading parents ' comments here , I do not plan to use it for my newborn . SIDS experts do not approve of its use for the very reason many moms are talking about here ... it is made of soft foam and can suffocate babies . ( especially given that the baby can slide down the incline and get there nose/mouth covered by the soft side cushions . $ 20 wasted for me !	-1
Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner . So I stopped using it right away . I do not recommend this product at all .	-1
I purchased the 'rest assured ' sleep postioner for one of our twins girls & was given this 'inclined to sleep ' from a friend , so decided to use that for our other twin girl . I have to say I do not like the inclined to sleep at all.When I place my daughter on it she manages to slip down the angled pillow , so when I go in to check on her she is scrunched up at the bottom of it . Kind of acts like a slide . Also if the baby spits up & you have to wash it , then it takes a long time to dry the foam insert.Our other twin daughter has been using the 'rest assured ' sleep positioner & I love it , so I just went out today & purchased a second one so they can both have a safe good nights sleep .	-1
Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it . I could tell that she was not very comfortable . It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to . Also it is very small in size . If she did like it , it would not have lasted very long .	-1
This was supposed to be a universal for the classic connect system , but it really is n't . We had to return it for another Graco car seat base .	-1
We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget . Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times . After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1 ) It is NOT particularly lightweight , and even though my son was a smaller baby , it still got really heavy really fast . After about 3mos . I refused to use it anymore . We put it in hubby 's car and put the convertible seat in mine.2 ) The straps adjust from behind , and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually . So , if the season changes ( or you just live in a variable region like we do ) you 'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie . THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm ( lighter clothes ) day . And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you 're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time ! 3 ) The handle was not very steady . What I mean is , these seats are pushed and pulled constantly , usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip . I found that after just a few trips , the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side , and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4 ) Last thing , but definitely my biggest concern . The anchor strap slips ! You do n't notice it the first few times , and you probably wo n't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally . Because it was in my husband 's car , we did n't notice it at first . Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE ! The strap ( it was the LATCH strap ) had gradually gotten looser and looser , even though we used a towel to even out the seat ( as recommended ) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible . We fixed it , then found that several weeks later it was loose again ! I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat ( since I 've never heard anybody else complain of it ) , but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again . Go with Britax or Chicco !	-1
I have a snugride 35 carseat . Apparantly not all snugrides are considered equal when it comes to the base . I purchased this model thinking I would save money on my spare base . Now I have to return it and wait for the more expensive one to come . How hard is it to include in the product information that it excludes , or will only fit certain models ?	-1
Folks , I am NOT kidding ! A local TV channel 3 affiliate here in Ohio ran a story the other day about a couple that had one of these that greatly malfunctioned . The new mom interviewed said that the product started emitting a burning smell , and when she looked down at it , she could n't believe her eyes ... the plastic around where the power cord plugs in was completely melted ! Then to add insult to injury , they claimed that Evenflo would take a while to send them back their refund . Perhaps this was a 'fluke ' , but I felt obligated to tell all of you about this . My wife is expecting our first child in August , and we will be looking at breast pumps as well . But not Evenflo .	-1
This one is a total waste of plastic . I used it once a day and it lasted 7 . I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway . The motor weakened by the day . IT IS LOUD ! ! ! ALL NOISE NO WORK ! I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little.I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min . When I called the company ( which has the worst hours ) , they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out . It took 2 wks for them to arrive . Parts made no difference . First they said no return . I said like hell you wont . Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping . I still have the damn thing . Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping . I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC ( if I had only asked from the get go ) . With that one , I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min . Next time around , I will fork out the money for the electric medelas . Cost more but they know what they are making .	-1
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PUMP . I 'M A FIRST TIME MOM AND DID N'T REALIZE THAT IN SOME CASES SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY WITH BABY SUPPLIES . IN THE HOSPITAL I WAS SUPPLIED WITH A MEDELA HARMONY PUMP TO USE AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT , I THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK THE SAME AT HOME . I WAS VERY WRONG ! ! ! I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN AND WE HAD A 3 HOUR RIDE HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL . BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED HOME I WAS VERY ENGORGED AND DESPERATE . MY NEWBORN HAD LATCHING ON PROBLEMS AT FIRST SO AS SOON AS WE GOT HOME I ASSEMBLED THE PUMP AND SAT DOWN TO USE IT . NOTHING HAPPENED . I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING LETDOWN PROBLEMS SO I TRIED HAND EXPRESSING AND WAS SUPRISED TO FIND THAT I WAS SPRAYING MILK EVERYWHERE ! THERE WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH POWER TO PULL OUT THE MILK . I WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT WASTING MY MONEY . IT 'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A RETURNABLE ITEM . LUCKILY THE HOSPITAL HAD SENT ME HOME WITH A MEDELA MANUAL PUMP AND THAT WORKED GREAT UNTIL I COULD FIND A DECENT RENTAL . PLEASE LISTEN TO THE LOW RATINGS ON THIS PUMP . I DID N'T AND I REGRET IT . I COULD 'VE SPENT THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND PURCHASED A GOOD RECOMMENDED PUMP . I ENDED UP THROWING THIS PUMP AWAY AND I CRINGED WHEN I DID IT , IT FELT SO WASTEFUL !	-1
I registered and recevied these baskets for my baby shower . I thought the were cute and would look cute in my sons room . I had planned to use them to hold diapers and baby toiletries . They would nave even worked nicely as little toy baskets , but I will not use them . The paint chips off VERY eaisly . It makes a mess of the whole house and fills up the baskets . I would n't want to put anything of my sons in them for fear paint chips would get on his things . I thought they would be better quality considering the price . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I got this hamper as a gift . I returned it the next day . The white paint chips off all over .	-1
I registered for this product because I have a small house and did n't have a good place to store a full-sized baby tub . This does fold up nice and small , but it is useless . The bottom of the chair sits an inch or two above the sink or tub- so in order to have the baby in any water , you need to fill up the sink quite a bit . With so much of the baby out of the water , my baby got cold very quickly . The mesh seat wicks the water all over , so she was sitting in a very wet chair . It was a disaster ( think screaming , cold , baby ) . I ended up using a regular old baby tub , which if I twisted just the right way , fits under my bathroom sink.I was using this with a newborn , perhaps it would be better with an older baby .	-1
This seat is not at all sturdy . The bottom portion will not stay down , and I 'm not about to put my baby into it . I bought it yesterday , and I 'm returning it tomorrow . It does not seem safe at all . It is so light that it seems like the baby could easily tip over .	-1
the frame is nice ... the compound sucked.It did n't even take the mold of the foot ... it just looks like a square of clay next to a picture of our babyMerry Christmas Grandma !	-1
This product is worthless ! I had to try and `` lightly press '' my daughters foot into the plaster no less than 9 times and each time it barely made an indentation . We tried everything , from rolling the plaster a little thicker for more cushion while pushing , pressing her foot a little harder and nothing worked . We could have thrown our $ 30 for this product out the car window and gotten more satisfaction and a better memory than this piece of junk will provide . We ended up with a very faint , almost unreconizable imprint that will most likely be replaced with an ink impression if we can find it soon enough . Save your money and buy something else if you really want a true memory of your child 's foot or hand . **UPDATE : I emailed the manufacturer Pearhead , after receiving this product . They sent another plaster packet out and we tried it again . We followed the directions as noted and it still did not work . We again were left with a horrible , barely there print . This product truley is a waste of money . We ended up ordering the Inkless print kit from another company for much cheaper , worked great and we got the keepsake this product/company could not deliver on .	-1
Impression material does not work . Would not keep the impression , it springs back . The frame is nice but not worth it if ca n't get an impression .	-1
Bought this two years ago for my first son and it worked great . This time , the clay to keep the impression was awful . Not sure how to describe it , but it would n't allow for a visible footprint . Sent it back and got a new one . Same problem . Must be an error in the current production . Do not buy . I ended up using an online recipe to make my own with salt and flour .	-1
I agree with the previous review from `` Meesah '' . My daughter just turned 4 months and she is 15 pounds already ... if I had n't returned this car seat when she was 8 weeks old , weighed 11.13 pounds & was 24 1/2 inches , she probably would be falling out of it by now . I agree that the canopy does absolutely nothing to shield infants from the sun . It is a joke . My daughter seemed uncomfortable in this car seat from day one . I decided to return this car seat and the Venezia stroller to BRU when my baby was 8 weeks old ... best decision I made . I also had several problems with the stroller ... I was walking in the mall one afternoon and 2 screws just fell off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( this was one of many problems ) I was horrified . Luckily , I stopped to see what it was . I almost kept walking assuming it was something that the wheels ran over . Right at that moment I knew I had made a huge and very expensive mistake ... because of all the issues , BRU accepted my return and we bought the Eddie Bauer system instead . My husband and I are very happy with the safety and comfort features of the Eddie Bauer system . Wish we bought that one from the start . Money does n't always buy quality . We learned our lesson the hard way . We are much happier now and our daughter is too .	-1
My husband and I were ecstatic when we received a Peg Perego travel system for our shower . We love the stroller and infant seat together , BUT the infant seat base is unable to be installed properly in our Subaru Forester . Our seatbelts are too thin and the accessory that is supposed to take care of this problem is to large to properly fit on the belt between the base and the latch . As a result , the carseat slides from side to side . The fire dept . personnel has recommended we not use the infant seat in our car .	-1
After learning my lesson the hard way on my previous car , I decided to start off on the right foot with my new car , and get a Seat Saver as soon as possible . After just a day of going `` naked '' , my leather seats were already showing pinch marks.My interior is black and tan , and I picked up theBritax Parkway SGL Booster Seat , Nutmeg , which matched brilliantly . I thought this would be pretty close , but the color is n't really beige or grey , despite the box showing a color that actually comes reasonably close to matching my actual interior . `` So the color 's weird ? Big deal . '' Besides the color , the product itself just screams of mediocrity . Getting the base portion on was no problem , and it does a fine job of protecting my seats . The back part , though , is something you basically have to align against the car seat and child seat when you install it . Unless you 're driving an '83 Ford EXP , there 's just no way it 's going to cover properly when the base piece and back piece are attached to each other -- unless you have teeny tiny back seats.Normally , I would n't be so harsh on a product for something like that , but when it costs twice as much as base seat protectors , the back should be as good as the base.This Seat Saver gets the job done , but only barely . And the awful color has me looking for something else to replace it .	-1
We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby 's carseat . Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad ( putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly ) , the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way ( knee in seat , tugging hard ) , and the carseat did n't budge a bit.Our car has fabric , not leather seats , but the seats are contoured . I think because of the thickness of the pad , it does n't conform to the shape of the seat , but becomes an additional surface , which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else , much cheaper , for the back of the seat , rather than something underneath the carseat , and that worked great . I think using a towel could work fine , underneath the carseat , for some protection , without sliding issues .	-1
We tried to install his under our car seat , but it did n't fit easily under the seat base in our small car , and seemed to make installation more difficult . Rather than risk it , we have n't used it .	-1
I bought this for my son 's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him . It looked very uncomfortable . Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item . I have to say that it is a waste of money . There are no instructions in the package , thankfully it 's easy to figure out . I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly . I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable . If I had the packaging I would return it . I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better . I ended up using a rolled up receiving blanket and that worked much better . Save your money . I would have given it zero stars but the lowest is one .	-1
This was a great diaper bag ... except that the routine my husband and I developed was that I always ended up carrying the baby and he always carried the diaper bag . He did n't mind carting it around once in a while , but after a while he began to protest that he was always carrying a purse around . : ) We ended up getting a more unisex looking model that both of us liked . ( Also , this does n't have a refrigerated compartment , which is important if you 're carrying stored breastmilk ) .	-1
Overview : I bought one of these about a year ago and it 's fine . It included batteries and it really helped out when we needed to travel . The current version is worse in many ways , and I do not recommend it.PROS : > It 's a nice size , and easy to use. > It does what it says > It 's fine if you have an outlet and your power never goes out.CONS : > The power cord is now PERMANENTLY attached and can not be unplugged. > The battery compartment CAN NOT BE USED . That 's right , YOU CAN NOT USE BATTERIES WITH THIS UNIT . If you want to travel , or if the power goes out , this machine is useless . On the older version of this machine , if you unplug the power cord , the batteries can be used . However , if the power goes out the batteries do NOT take over automatically. > This is noticeably quieter than our old version of this machine . While the volume buttons both goes up the same number of times , our old sound machine feels like it has 2-3 louder levels . This new machine stops getting loud at about half the volume of our old unit . As a result , it is barely loud enough to drown out background noises in a house. > One oddity : There is a `` demo '' switch on the bottom , and when traveling it often gets hit , which causes this unit to turn off after a few minutes . It 's not a big deal , but it 's a hassle.WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN ? > No , I would not recommend this item. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- For what it 's worth , the serial number on our old machine is 0409 and the new one is 1412 . Otherwise they appear identical . I am disappointed that the new one falls short in so many ways .	-1
I always take the product reviews with a grain of salt , but I clearly should have paid more attention on this one . The sound is really mechanical when you turn it all the way up , which you have to do to hear the darn thing . It also loops , so once my brain picked out the pattern through the baby monitor I could n't sleep !	-1
Bought an used Ipod touch instead . Downloaded whitenoise app . Worked better . this was not loud enough . Was not impressed at all .	-1
The idea is there ... BUT the sounds just sound so fake ! I tried to sleep to this last night and i wanted to throw it out the window . I do n't expect my infant to like it . Horrible noises . The volume goes pretty loud for a quiet infants room , but when you turn it up the horrible fake noises sound even worse ! This is going back tomorrow . I guess i will continue my search !	-1
I bought this before my daughter was born thinking that the `` heartbeat '' sound would be soothing for her . I liked this better than the teddy bears with the heartbeat sound because it also had other soothing sounds that my husband and I might enjoy as well.I hated every sound it made . The heartbeat was loud and annoying . All the other `` natural '' sounds seemed very unnatural and mechanical . My baby slept much better when I stopped using this . If you want nature sounds , I suggest you invest something other than this product.We now use an old clock radio tuned to AM static and it works better than anything else .	-1
The AC adaptor and sound selections are great , but the sound is way too low , even on the highest level . I foolishly bought this , knowing that others thought it was too low ... but it really is SO LOW you ca n't hear it 4 feet away . Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me .	-1
Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out . I returned it immediately .	-1
I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly . However , this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise . You have to put the thing directly into an infant 's crib ( making the cord a choking hazard ) in order for them to even hear it . If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house , you need something a lot louder .	-1
I am actually really mad that I wasted money on this item . We have been running a CD player with rain sounds in our son 's nursery for months now . We were getting worried that the CD player might just die , so we thought this white noise machine would do . I was worried about the volume when I ordered it , but other reviews made me think it would be loud enough . NOT TRUE . This thing wo n't block out ANY NOISE . The puny little speaker is just not big enough . We 'll just buy another CD player I guess . The rain sound is also very disappointing and just sounds like crackling sounds . Extremely disappointed .	-1
I 'm a dad of 14 month old twins . I PROMISE you one thing - these bottles are purchased only by first time parents ( like me ) . Anyone who 's on their second or third would tell you to save your money.I realize that every child is different , and some burp up more than others - but they ALL burp up and they ALL get gas . Some more than others.Parents get so frustrated and worried about their babies that they try ANYTHING different . One thing seems to 'do the trick ' when the problem was ready to stop on its own.We tried every bottle gimmick sold on Babies-R-Us . This one takes the cake . How has humanity survived so long before the advent of disposable liners ? I warn you - your child will 'empty ' his bottle , but when you screw the lid off , you will see the bag was no where near empty . This is because the bag collapses and creates pockets of food that never get eaten . Wonderful if you 're pumping breast milk and trying not to waste any.Since our twins were 2 months , we have been using the plain old Evenflo bottles from any grocer . They cost about 99 cents each.They work great . There 's a bottle , ring and nipple . All of the gimmick bottles have half a dozen parts that need to be individually cleaned , or come apart , or leak.Think about it - Playtex , Gerber , Avent , Evenflo - they all sell the same simple three-piece bottle , but they also sell some sort of state-of-the-art bottle that 's supposed to cure all of your baby 's ills . Why in good conscience would they continue to sell those cheap , gas-inducing , old-fashioned bottles ? Because they work ; because all of the repeat parents buy them ; and because all new parents eventually need to buy a bottle that does what it 's supposed to .	-1
At first I really liked these , until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week . It 's not easy to squeeze the air out . Since I keep track of how much our baby eats , how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up ! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out . I 'm sorry I ever bought them .	-1
These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners , but that is about the only pro I found . When you are trying to squeeze the air out ( which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway ) , sometimes they bust and you have to start all over ... not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk . Second , once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle , it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out . Third , there is no way to heat these bottles in the car . I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it does n't work on these bottles because of the liners . The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it . Not very convenient for long or short road trips . I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby . I did n't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed , but I see a big difference now .	-1
After breastfeeding my son , I decided to use the Playtex Nursers for bottlefeeding . I thought the bags would be convenient and make clean up easy , plus the bottles are supposed to be like the breast right ? Well , my son got a lot of air with these bottles and did not like the nipples . Also , I tried both the Playtex bags and Wal-mart brand . The rim of the Playtex liners is very thin and I had several leaks because the liner shifted as I squeezed the air from it . I tried the Wal-mart brand , which has a sturdier liner rim and did not leak . However , these cheaper liners are smaller ! If you compare them with the Playtex ( both the 4 oz and 8 oz ) , the Wal-mart liners are smaller in circumference and will not hold as much . I absolutely could not get the 4 oz liners to hold 4 oz or the 8 oz liners to hold 8 oz.Also , if you need to sit the bottle down for a minute , the air comes right back in the liner and you have to squeeze it out again before you can resume feeding . I thought these bottles were a lot of trouble and aggravation . I would rather scrub regular bottles .	-1
I really want to like this product . I want to be able to use it . They take the baby 's temperature under the armpit at the hospital , which is why I bought this one- there are hardly any of them out there . My baby is 5 weeks old and caught my husband 's cold . She 's coughing , sneezing , and sounds really congested . When I called the doctor , she told me to keep taking her temperature . As long as she can breathe and does n't have a fever , then she told me not to worry . So I pulled out my thermometer and have tried it all day long . I get the exact same reading every single time . Even when I try it on me or my husband . I find it scientifically impossible that all 3 of us are the exact same temp down to the tenth of a degree . It keeps saying 97.5 . Annoying .	-1
We ended up chucking this last week and i wanted to be sure to warn others . It was all over the map thermomoter wise . It would say 100 when we thought she was slightly hot , so we 'd get out hte 'freebie ' from the hospital and it ' would then say 98.4 . Oh , since we were nervous we 'd then get out another one and do the same thing and it would then say right around hte 98.4 . Unfortuantely , this was not the first time it had done this to us . Save your money ! We invested in the ear thermometer scan hospital grade from braun . holy goodness . piece of mind . it 's worth the 50 ! ! you figure you 'll need one thermometer per kid with this type , the ear one is for hte whole family . Yeah , I 'm sorry I spent the 12 originally and tried to cheap out because this caused way to much worry .	-1
This is one time I should have listened to the reviews . This is junk and it 's cheap . I prefer the rectal thermometer for my baby instead . The temperature always varies and is not accurate at all . Do n't waste your money on this product .	-1
I bought this pump months before my son was born because I could not afford to pay almost $ 300 for the Medella . I had a manual Medella pump when my daughter was born and did not want to go manual again.When I returned home from giving birth to my son , he stopped latching on well , so I pulled out my new electric pump and went to work . It was great . I could adjust the suction , and my breasts were healing from my son 's poor nursing . I was even getting out 5-6oz of milk from each breast . The whole process took about 20-30 minutes.After 2 months of constant use , 4 times a day , one day last week the suction would not work . The motor was running but no suction . I took all the washable parts off again and put them back on 6 times , before it started working again . But then it also pulled some milk down the hose , luckly it did not go into the motor.Now when I use it , the suction is not as strong or as efficient . It now takes an hour or more to pump the same amount of milk I had been getting . And it still does n't have anough suction to completly empty my breasts . When I finish pumping I have to express the remaining milk maually.I am going to call the company , I really hope they make this right .	-1
If you have a crib that has rounded ends as we do , it is difficult to attach , although we did figure a way . My son likes to look at it , but it has WAY TOO SHORT of a song and spin cycle . We took off the music and motor and reattached with just some string . Now our son is able to watch it spin for a much longer time and he prefers the ocean aquarium music anyway .	-1
After reading the negative reviews of this mobile ( and seeing its `` flimsiness '' for myself at a local Babis R Us store ) , I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif . I found several , but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy `` Twinkle Twinkle '' bedding set . It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars ... [ ... ] Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I 'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price , but good luck ! I was so excited when I found it !	-1
Certainly not worth $ 40 . It 's cute because it matches my baby 's stars/moonbeams nursery theme but it 's not the best quality . You have to assemble the hanging moon & stars yourself which is a bit tedious . I have to say , my baby loves looking up at it & enjoys the music . He kicks his legs & coos like crazy . But ... the music plays only a short time , which is a pain because I have to keep winding it . A mobile should have music that lasts longer than this !	-1
I had this pump with my first baby born 2 years ago . I thought that it would be a better deal than Avent and boy was I wrong . I got it home and cleaned it and started using it and it made my already sore breasts hurt even more ( cracking and bleeding ) and made my problems even worse . The first time I used it came apart during use . And the 5 times I used it after that too . I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude to me , interupting me while I was trying to explain my problem to her and all she did was explain how to put it back together . I took it to my lactation consultant and she said that she hates that brand/model and that she had 5 other mothers have the same complaints about it . The store I bought it from has since stopped stocking this model . Yeah it has a design similar to Avent but trust me there is a reason why this product only costs $ 20 its junk . The breast funnel is hard plastic and very uncomfortable might as well use a kitchen funnel , This time I went with a hospital grade pump Playtex Embrace and I love it	-1
I noticed that some gave this pump high ratings but over all this pump gets just 3 stars . Maybe some have had better luck with this than others but I noticed that more people stated that it did n't work well . I bought this pump and right away I had problems when I would be pumping it would fall apart . It made my breasts hurt like they have never hurt before with any other pump Ive used in the past . You get what you pay for if you are going back to work you might want to invest in an electric Breast pump , I bought the Playtex Embrace double breast pump and it works wonderfully.PS When I called TFY about my problems the lady just told me how to put it back together ( that was n't the problem ) and got off the phone quickly with me . This went into the trash where it belongs	-1
First of all , we had to use a pipe wrench to get the thing unscrewed ... it was so tight neither dh or I could get it to budge and even w/ the pipe wrench it was a challenge ... Then , there was no way I could get the arrow to line up w/ the square , unless I used the pipe wrench ... hmmm ... not sure I want to carry a pipe wrench around with me when I need to pump ... Oh , and the suction is horrible . I have the Avent Isis but wanted something I could pump directly into the Soothie bottles , stupid choice ... the Avent is about 10,000 times better , even with more parts to clean , well worth the time and money ... With the Avent Isis I can pump 6-10 oz in 5 minutes ... this one I was lucky to get an ounce in 5 minutes , do n't waste your money .	-1
Same problems as everyone else . I bought this as an `` easy '' way to pump . I originally bought an Ameda electric pump . I love it , but wound up not using it very often , as it has a lot of pieces to wash and put back together . As I got more and more used to breastfeeding , I just stopped pumping . Well , I 'm going to be out of the house a little more often and decided I should start pumping and storing and just wanted to do a little pumping at night before bed . I figured a manual pump would be a little easier to use than hooking up the electric pump . This pump is HORRIBLE . It fell apart , and I pumped and pumped and I got less than 1/2 ounce .	-1
I was breastfeeding my son when just a few days after birth the nurses gave him a bottle against my wishes . He never latched on again after that . I still wanted to feed him breast milk but naively thought I could buy just any pump . I did n't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a pump but I should have . This pump was terribly uncomfortable ( I ca n't compare with other pumps because I never used any others ) . I never had discomfort breastfeeding but this pump made me cringe every time I used it . The suction was poor and my milk supply actually decreased the longer I used this pump . If you 're going to pump , spend the money on a good one .	-1
returning this because it was gigantic.it 's also too thin so better for summer use . I bought it for the winter . I love these halo blankets , but these are just way too big .	-1
I love halo sleep sacks , our twin boys still wear them every night at 16 months . Unfortunately one of he sleep sacks we received has a small defect at the top of the zipper making it a huge pain to zip up every night while wrestling a squirmy baby . We needed them ASAP so we just kept it , but still annoying every night trying to zip it up . Normally these sleep sacks are wonderful , we just got a dud . I recommend Theseus anyone , just make sure your zipper works !	-1
This Halo Sleep Sack is rough , thin and not what I would expect a baby to wear . The pattern is awesome but the fabric is just awful ! ! ! ! I 'm sending it back TODAY	-1
I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer . Big mistake . Do n't waste your money . The cotton is not pre-shrunk , so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks , the zipper ends up being too long , which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up . Very disappointed .	-1
I own three halo sleep sacks , a cream colored one , the one with sweet peas on it , and this baby blue one . The other two are wonderful , soft and cozy ... .but for whatever reason this blue color feels terrible ! ! It 's rough and scratchy and stiff , I hate touching it so we 've stopped using it . I know , it makes no sense . But if you 're thinking of picking this blue one maybe pick another color or a blue one from another listing instead .	-1
I have both the Halo fleece sleep sack and this cotton one . The cotton one is very flimsy and does n't compare in quality to the fleece one - if you want a cotton sleep sack - why not just put the baby in a nightgown ? The fleece one , however , is aweseom ( even though I like the LullaBag slightly better than the Halo fleece sleep sack )	-1
The product as promised keeps the wipes warm . But there is a problem with the warmer the lids keeps popping up and does n't stay closed . Since the lids always opens on its own I have drives bunch of packages of wipes ! Because of the problem with self opening lid , I would n't recommend this product !	-1
This warmer broke after only 2 months of use . It as extremely hot on the bottom and every time you grab a wipe , it opens so you end up having to use two hand to operate . The whole warmer is quite heavy and when moved it 's cumbersome , not for easy diaper changes in another room . Only wipes that worked in it were Pampers , all other we have to pull out by opening it . What a waste of money ! I have since purchased a Munchkin Warmer and was VERY pleased with that one thus far . That model has a lock on the door , as to not fly open every time you grab a wipe !	-1
I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes . I still think wipes warmers are a good idea , just not this one ! This warmer heats from the bottom . I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top . I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling . I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store . The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom , which keeps the top wipes moist and warm , just as they should be . It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other did n't have . All around it is a better purchase !	-1
I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing . Well it wasnt . I should have read more into it . It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder . I dont really know how well it warmes up as I have n't been able to use it .	-1
I had this for less than a month before it broke . It 's really easy to use and they did the job , but it broke so quick and I have no idea why . I would recommend buying a product with more quality than this , it 's worth it . Thank God that it 's the summer time now , so my son does n't really need warm wipes for now .	-1
Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer . Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use . Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard . We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day . Not worth the hassle . Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time .	-1
The wipe warmer case failed to close after 5 months of normal use . We have to use a paper weight to keep it down . I truly wish that this product is more durable.And on a related topic - the warmer pad : I would like to let you know that it 's the second time I noticed mold growth on the pillow . I 've owned the warmer for the past 9 months . It 's being used as instructed . The current one is not due for replacement till January 4th while I found the mold on December 14th . The pad also turns yellow , slimy and slippery and have a smell after a month . It 's very disappointing to have a mold problem with the warmer as it 's a product for little babies . Babies could possibly get very sick from this .	-1
I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug . I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer , which does not use a wall wart . Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts ? Because it 's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device .	-1
I bought this because the winter I had my first born the wipes were always so cold and he would have a fit every time I wiped him . I thought these would be great but they are not for me . When I assembled everything and put the wipes in them they were nice and toasty warm I thought `` perfect '' but then I took one out and it took 2 seconds and it was cold , colder than room temperature cold ! ! I did a test to get one out and put it on my leg and it was like the rapid movement made it colder . I was so disappointed and returned it	-1
I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom . Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel . The concept works but the design is worthless .	-1
If you are a 1st time mom with a crying baby and you are doing this by yourself and you cant have 10 eyes , this is a waste of money and I am sure glad I did not spend my own money on this but I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift . You really have to be on your toes about it and who has the time , nevertheless ; the ENERGY !	-1
OK , I got this at my shower , and I thought it was pretty neat . But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box , because it 's too much of a pain to do the warming part . There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist , and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water . So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that , with no warming . It looks really nice in my nursery , nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something , but not worth the money to use just like this . I would n't have bought it myself , so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus , I like having my baby used to room temp wipes , because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes , she is used to it and does n't throw a fit . She did n't like room temp wipes at first , but now she expects them at room temp and does n't mind diaper changes at all !	-1
OK , so it heats wipes , and is comfy for the babies , but I hate this thing.The door NEVER stays closed - to the point we always put something on top to keep it closed.I tried bending the tab , and that worked for a few days , but we 'd always go to reach for a wipe , to find a dry one because the moisture evaporated , then through out one or even two to et to a 'wet ' one , and then the frequency of having to add water to the sponge at the bottom made this thing a chore.I was so glad the day the kids grew out of diapers and was happy to recycle this , I did n't even want to give t to someone for free .	-1
Do NOT buy this ! This is a fire hazard . Look at the other reviews for the same warmer . My , along with far to many others , ac adapters are burning , some say melting , yet still running . Thank God we all found them . A very scary reality !	-1
We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better . Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well . The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time ; no easy flipping like the Dex . Not worth it !	-1
The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy , there was no in between . Furthermore , this thing is really a gimmick `` you must have this for your child to be a good mother ! '' piece of junk . YOur baby wo n't die of hypothermia if you do n't have a wipe warmer . If the thing is that cold , hold it in your hand for a few minutes . Sold mine on ebay . Do n't waste your time or money . Put the twenty bucks in your kid 's college fund instead . It 's a much better investment	-1
This item is one I have seen time and again on new mom 's baby registries . I had this one and it worked for all of three months . we never really used it because just holding them in your had for a minute really does the trick and you can save the twenty dollar item on something you really need and something that is actually useful . I have 4 sisters all of whom registered for this and all of them got everything on their registries but this item ( they all had big registries with at least 89 items experienced moms were smart enough to realize it was a waste of money ) Also the thing about them yellowing and drying out is true . and even putting them in 1/3 does n't help . Adding a 1/2 cup water to it does , but then were back to ITS NOT WORTH IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Just hold them in your hands for a minute and there you go instant heat up . Also if you have a summer baby the wipes will heat on their own with this summer we have been having . And most wipes when you open them up anymore are n't that cold at all .	-1
I bought this when I was pregnant thinking I really needed this . It turned out to be a bigger pain to have it . Do n't bother . Buy more wipes or diapers with the money you save from buying this .	-1
I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here , but I am not impressed . It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate . The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really were n't all that warm . I have to say there needs some improvement .	-1
Returned it right back after couple days . It never warmed any wipes , barely fit any wipes -- What is the point of even having it ?	-1
I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT THE LID POPS MUCH TOO EASILY . NOW I JUST USE WIPES THAT ARE NOT LINKED AND LIFT THE LID . ALSO , THE WIPES ARE COLD ALMOST INSTANTLY SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST TO GET THE EFFECT OF A `` WARM '' WIPE .	-1
Warmer keeps wipes warm but the top pops open repeatedly no matter what we try making the top wipe cold and ultimately drying out the wipes . I would n't buy this again	-1
I originally did not want a wipe warmer for my son ... . I 'm paranoid about leaving things plugged in while I 'm not home - especially if there is any type of heating element involved . When my son was about a month old , we used a friend 's wipe warmer ( the Munchkin one ) and my son really seemed to enjoy the warm wipes . On a whim , I purchased this one a few days later ... . because it promises not to dry out the wipes or turn them brown . It has a little spongy thing in the bottom that you keep wet and replace which is also supposed to help with the drying out . Please note , the spongy thing at the bottom DOES turn brown and dry out - you 're supposed to re-wet it every week and replace it every 3 months , but I did n't find that it lasted 3 months and replaced it after a month and a half ( refills were $ 8 for 2 - FYI ) .It takes a few hours to heat - which would n't be such a big deal if the warmer held more wipes ... . but I feel like I am constantly refilling it - so my son is n't always getting the benefit of the warm wipe anyway . I like the pampers wipes because they smell good and seem more moist in general , but my husband prefers the Huggies wipes because they 're thicker and textured so that 's what we 've been using - and because the wipes are thicker , not as many fit into the warmer , and subsequently - not only do they get stuck and tear from time to time - but I refil the warmer about every other day.I feel like the design of the warmer could be better - since not all wipes are made the same ... . Overall , I 've continued to use it since my son seems to like it , but it 's still not my favorite item , and definitely not a necessity ! UPDATE : Not 2 weeks after my review , I feel like removing another star . Occasionally , the warmer stops ... . well ... . warming . It just turns off . It 's still plugged in . And every time this has happened , I 've had to move the changing table and give the plug a little jiggle . It usually turns back on after that , but for how long is anybody 's guess . I 'm pretty disappointed with this product . My son does like the warm wipes , but the product is pretty much crap - just keepin ' it real ! ! !	-1
This thing worked for about a month , then it stopped working completely ! Shame , I thought I 'd finally found a wipes warmer that worked ! I 've tried the munchkin and had to send that one back to ! I recommend just staying away from wipe warmers at all , and warm your babies wipes with warm sink water , none of the wipes warmers I 've given a chance have delivered ! Buy at own risk !	-1
I used this when my son was just born but it made the wipes too moist . I 'd have to dry him off before I put a diaper on or it would cause diaper rash . I ended up switching to just a regular wipe holder and it 's much better .	-1
When we first got this wipes warmer we were mostly pleased with it . Our only complaint was that you had to add water to the bottom pad every time that you changed to a new packet of wipes.Fast forward 8 months later and it became a pain to close the lid completely as it would pop back open . That meant that the one wipe that would be at the top would be hard and dry by the time of the next diaper change . Multiply that to about 6 changes a day , that meant I was loosing 6 wipes a day or 180 a month . Not acceptable ! Then by the time our baby was 16 months old the wipes warmer stopped working completely . We tried several outlets , and the light would still be on as if it was working but it would not warm the wipes anymore ! This while we were in the middle of this crazy Polar Vortex winter with so many days of record low temperatures and many snow storms that I lost count.I was hoping this warmer would last us for a longer time than 16 months . So We DO NOT recommend it to anyone and would try our luck with a different brand next time around .	-1
I had this un-neccessary nursery item thinking that my November born baby would be more comfortable . . .boy was I wrong.The first time I used it , I pulled a wipe out and noticed that they seemed a bit too warm for my baby 's bum . I had to wait a few seconds before touching him with the wipe . This is my first big gripe . If it was a big job , I had to either pull a few of them out when I started chaning him or wait a few seconds before each wipe . . .a pain ! The second thing I noticed is the lid would not stay closed . So now , not only did my wipes get too hot , but I could not use the top wipe because it would be too dry . Wipes are not cheap and wasting a wipe is for that purpose is silly . That was strike two ! The thrid and final straw , and what made me throw this money wasted apperattus away was that when I got the bottom of the stack of wipes , I noticed that the wipe on the bottom was brown . 20 or so wipes were not as wet as they should have been , but the last one was fried.Not worth the money or hassle !	-1
I like the idea of warm wipes for baby ... but I was very disappointed with this product . First of all , the dispenser is useless . We got so frustrated trying to get the wipes to dispense properly out of the top that we just gave up and opened the whole unit to get to them during changes . Second , the wipes are cold again about a second after you remove them from the container . I think this is defintely one of those products that you can do without.We have now just unplugged the thing and use it as an attractive wipes holder !	-1
This was one of the first things I purchased because I had read everyone 's reviews and everyone seemed to love it and called it a `` lifesaver '' . WOW , what a waste of money ! If purchasing this item make sure you can place it somewhere where there is an outlet , be able to place it on some sort of protector to protect your changing table from water damage , and also be prepared to also buy the travel wipes warmer because your little one will get use to their bottom only being wiped with warm wipes which is not always so convenient if your out and about or traveling . I did n't know why my Mother laughed at me when I told her I purchased this and now I know why . Save your money and purchase something your baby really needs .	-1
I always thought wipe warmers were kind of silly and frivolous . But my husband wanted to get this item because our newborn boy screams whenever a cold wipe touches his bottom . It had good reviews so thought we would give it a try . When we got it we were excited to see if it would help and got it all plugged in and set up . Based on what another reviewer said we only put a few wipes in instead of a whole package . Well we 've only had this warmer a few days and we hate it ! ! ! We change baby on the floor and the warmer is on a stand right next to where we change him . By the time you get a couple wipes out and go to use them , they are cold . Literally 2 seconds later . I suppose if you have this warmer sitting like 6 inches from where you change the baby and can grab them instantly before you wipe their bottom , it MIGHT work . But we also noticed even when you take the wipes out , they are n't all that warm to begin with . I expected a lot more , and pretty much this item is useless . : ( Really disappointing .	-1
First of all , we cloth diaper and wipe - so this review is based on our experiences using it with cloth wipes and home made wipe solution ( distilled water , olive oil , baby wash , and essential oils ) . Because of this , issues like browning and drying out did n't really apply to us.My baby was born in November , and it was pretty chilly around here at that time . We started out using just water and cloth wipes on him , and it seemed to take forever to get the water to run warm in the bathroom in the middle of the night . I hated to put cold water on his little bum when he was already so upset at the indignity of having his diaper changed . I thought a wipe warmer would be a nice thing to have - this despite the fact that just a few months earlier , I thought the idea was ridiculous and unnecassary.We started using the wipe warmer when he was maybe a week old . By then , I thought it would be OK to no longer just use water to wipe him with , so I began using the warmer with my cloth wipes ( baby washcloths ) and home made solution.First of all , the warmer seemed to warm very inconsistantly . Sometimes the wipes would just be room temperature . Sometimes they were quite toasty . This was n't a huge deal , as the issue was really to get the chill off , but it did seem kind of weird.Second , with home made wipes , you ca n't use the pop-up feature . I knew this when I bought it , so this did n't upset or surprise me . However , when you open the warmer in the non-pop-up fashion ... as others mentioned , it does leak water from condensation building up inside . This was pretty irritating.Third , the warmer made our wipes smell downright funky . I do n't know if this is an issue with store bought , disposable wipes , but it was pretty nasty.After using this warmer for about two months , I ended up moving my wipes to an old Pampers wipes container . I also began adding white vinegar to my solution , which might have taken care of the funkiness issue even with the warmer , but even without this issue , I do n't think the warmer was worth my while ( or money ) .My baby has no problems with room temperature wipes . The warmer might reappear next time I have a newborn in the house , but I doubt it .	-1
I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom , but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up . It drives me crazy ! I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me , but the latch just does n't keep .	-1
But it is truly terrible . I did n't even get to use it because the lid does not stay on ! It keeps opening and the wipes start to dry out . Pointless , really . Just buy a different one .	-1
This is a horrible product ! ! ! ! The pad burned to the bottom , and the wipes did n't stay warm long after leaving the warmer . What 's the point ? Terrible .	-1
I am so disappointed with this product . First off , it does n't really warm the wipes . Sure it 's not as cold as regular wipes but its like room temperature and not a warm room either . My baby still protest when I use the so call warm wipes but not when I dunk the wipes in warm water and then wipe her . I assume that 's how it 's suppose to be or how it 's suppose to work . Too bad I threw away the box and packaging or this would be going back to amazon for a refund . Save yourself the money and just use a bowl of warm water to warm your wipes .	-1
I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children . I assumed her kids liked this toy and that 's why she 'd given us one ( I had n't requested it on our registry ) . Unfortunately , our baby has never been interested in this toy . I 'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things . However , I can understand why she 's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother . Personally , I do n't find that there 's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional , moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium ( my daughter 's very favorite crib toy ) . Moreover , the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud . When we first used this toy ( at night ) , my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that 's how loud and grating the sound was . We figured out , however , that it 's simply the noise of the pictures turning . Unfortunately , to cover up that horrible noise , we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes . Overall , I wish I 'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could .	-1
These bottles are the worst . All they do it leak all the time . I tried everything the company told me to do to stop the leaking but nothing has helped . They even sent me new bottles and I shipped the old ones back but the new ones leak too . Went to the cheap evenflo bottles for 3 bucks and they are soooo much better . Do n't waste you time or money on the hype that surrounds these bottles . IT is not worth it ! Save your $ $	-1
I spent around $ 50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse . The nipples is big and hard ( she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first , now she is on all bottles ) . I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too . Next ... ... they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher . I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft , smaller , more like the breast , they do n't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in , easy to clean and most important , her gas problem was greatly reduced . The downside is the cost of the liners . I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child 's colic problem	-1
i love the lavendar bedtime bath , but these are too harsh for babys skin , especially excema ... go with aquaphor baby wash .	-1
I NEVER REALLY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH THIS THIS SLING . I THINK MY DAUGHTER IS TOO SMALL . WITH ALL THE FABRIC IT JUST SEEMS AWKWARD . MUCH PREFER THE FRONT CARRIER .	-1
I own this product and the Baby Bjorn . My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects . This product is more difficult to use and less secure . The position of the baby can shift with your movement ( ie : if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ) ; that disrupts and upsets my baby . Although you can breastfeed in it , I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing ( but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public ) . The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that . For an infant , the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs . Maybe I 'll like this product better when my baby is a little bigger . I do use it at times when I do n't have to also deal with my toddler , but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling . It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn . It is also better if you are eating , reading , or writing because the baby rides much lower .	-1
I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him . I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work , so i thought this would help . It did , as long as I was sitting down . It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age . This sling is okay , but i really did n't use it much because it hurt my back . I ended up using my front carrier more , it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure . I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back .	-1
My son hated it . He LOVES the Gerber Transition cup ( 7oz ... not the other Gerber cup . ) and he 's okay w/ the Avent cup . They both have very soft pieces that go in his mouth and feel good ... not rock hard ! Most sippy cups are extremely hard to get anything out of , this is one of them . Skip it !	-1
I bought these because they were only cup that my toddler would drink out of but after washing them one time they leak like crazy . Unfortunately I had already bought 8 of them . They are supposed to have an arrow on the top that lines up with the bottom to prevent leaking but it does n't work . These are horrible .	-1
First of all , I totally missed out on the Color May Vary warning , and that was my fault . I originally ordered this for my son but the color that arrived was pink . But , I figured , we will only be using this cup at home and color really doesnt matter as long as it worked . It was horrible . Water was pouring out from the area between the lid and the cup . There was no was no tell if it was aligned or not because there was a lock sign at the lid but none for the cup . the spout in itself didnt leak but the cup did . I was so disappointed with this product . Maybe I got a defective one but I am not taking the risk of wasting my money in buying another one .	-1
This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees , so that you attach velcro ( included ) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons . It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side , reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons . I understand , but it was still too big . I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.25 inches high . So since the guard would not lay flat , there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player . I thought about putting a book under the player , but I think he would just lift it and get into it.If your dvd player is less than 2.25 inches high , this will not work for you .	-1
We have a toddler and we were told that we just had to get a guard for the DVD , and for other electronic things as well . It seems that babies like to push buttons . Well , that figures . Our boy has been trained with a bunch of musical toys that require button punching and he learned rather quickly . He loves them ! It 's only a matter of time before he gets to the stereo , TV and DVD player , hence we bought this Parent Units DVD/CD guard.I 'm annoyed by this product . It 's just a piece of transparent plastic with a couple small velcro straps yet it cost 20 % that of the very sophisticated DVD/CD player . What goes ? Second , if we use it as illustrated , we will have to remove the guard before each using in order to get the little disc drawer to open . Furthermore , our DVD player is on a small shelf and we can not remove the guard without removing the DVD player from the shelf first . What a nuisance ! I 've gotten around this by using the guard upside down . The long flange of the plastic goes under the front legs of the DVD player and the short flange then covers the controls . OK , but we still have to remove the guard before each using of the player It 's an annoyance . We 're considering putting the DVD player at a higher level out of his reach.Gary Peterson	-1
I 'm not sure why I thought this would be any different than it turned out to be , but it 's just a piece of plastic . And it covers the place where the DVD slides in and out of the player . Baby was n't more than 1.5 ( probably less ) and quickly figured out how to move the DVD player so that she could still push all the buttons . This product was not the solution . The solution was to put that DVD player out of reach . Why did n't I think of that first ? ?	-1
I purchased 3 different guards at once and I sent them all back ! ! Not one of them worked - this was the most expensive of the 3 and you can still push buttons through it ! ! I have now made my own guards out of clear dvd cases - works better than this junk ! !	-1
I loved the bright colors . The container is of a decent size perfect for kids but the lids do n't fit well .	-1
I have now thrown all of these cups away because I am tired of cleaning up messes . 3 times the lids have fallen off of these cups and has soaked a child , my stroller or my house . I have enough to do without adding to the mess .	-1
These are fine for meal time , but I would never put them in a diaper bag . They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily . If you do n't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage , which really does n't amuse them : ) We use these as back-up cups only .	-1
This is the worst pad I have tried . They do n't even have adhesive strips so are constantly slipping . Go with Lansiloh or better yet Johnson and Johnson if you can find them . I ended up throwing away the rest of the box ! ! !	-1
As a new mom with a VERY heavy milk flow , I have tried several different breast pads over the last few months . Here is my overview of each : Johnsons baby nursing pads - 60 Ea : These are my FAVORITE pads for daytime use . They will not hold as much as Ameda , so they are n't as reliable overnight . However , they are very soft and comfortable against tender breasts , They also have a nice shape that is more discrete than other brands . I also love that they are not packed in pairs or singles , just all lumped in the box together . Yes , this means they are not as `` sterile '' as the other brands , but they are n't a haste to unpack each time you need a fresh pad , and you do n't risk waking up baby with crinkly wrappers . They do have an adhesive to keep them secure in your bra . Also , they are the only pad I know of with a nipple indentation , meaning they are a little less abusive to already sore nipples.Ameda 50 Count Noshow Premium Disposable Nursing Pads : These are the most absorbent pads I have found . In fact , they are the only ones that keep me dry overnight . However , they have no shape to them at all , and are extremely obvious if you wear a thin bra . They have no adhesive , so they will move around in your bra . Also , they are packaged in an extremely crinkly wrapper , so if my baby is asleep I have to take them in another room to open , so as not to wake up the baby ( and he is a heavy sleeper ! ) The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct. : These are the best pads for early stages of nursing , when the lanolin will help soothe sore and cracked nipples . They are very cool and comfortable on your nipples . However , they do not hold quite as much as the Ameda . I did find that these needed to be changed pretty often to avoid feeling damp . Also , the edges of the pad are scratchy and can be a bit uncomfortable throughout the day.Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads , 60-pack : These are a good all-around pad . They will hold a good bit , but not as much as the Ameda or J & J . ; They do have an adhesive strip that will help them stay in place in your bra , and are a very good value to use long term . Be sure you get the `` soft '' version , as the older style is much more scratchy and uncomfortable.Evenflo Comfort Select Nursing Pad , 48 Count : These pads are very absorbent , but not very comfortable . They have an itchy material inside that tends to stick to cracked nipples when removed . They also are very obvious through thin bras.Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack 100 Count : WORTHLESS . These pads do not absorb even a single let-down if you have a heavy flow . They would instantly soak through and my shirt would be wet . Also , they have no shape so they will bunch up and show through your bra and shirt . They also have no adhesive , so they will move around . Overall , completely worthless for a heavy milk flow .	-1
I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them , but I was very dissapointed ; my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours . I 'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do .	-1
I do n't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are . It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device . I 've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once . I prefer to just hand wash our bottles , pacifiers , accessories , and breast pump parts . It 's a good idea but ehh , not a hit .	-1
I liked the convienece of these pads with the lanolin built in but the pads irritated my skin a little . The edges of the pads were not soft . I would n't purchase these again . I 'm going back to the Johnson and Johnson pads .	-1
Shipped through low cost carrier `` LASERSHIP '' which is notorious for losing packages ... ..like this one . Never received product .	-1
It is a little too thin for my taste , but most covers seem to be . It easily gets snagged on rings and jewelry so now I have to take my jewelry off before changing him . It is pretty thin so it does n't absorb or protect against any wetness . I use a small pad to help protect it . It is basically for design now and to match my son 's bedding .	-1
We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both . The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package . After washing it as directed , it has gotten even worse . It has strings hanging all over it . It 's a very useful item , but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! A friend of mine had the same problem , and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand ( less expensive and better quality ) .	-1
I am disappointed with the quality if this item . I have two and they both looked old , faded and worn after the first wash. Not happy .	-1
It 's too small for standard contoured changing pad ! Plus , it shrinks in the wash ! It is also very poor construction , the stiching around the elastic that secures it was coming loose when I opened the package ! Needless to say , we returned it !	-1
We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke . I guarantee they will break off with little effort .	-1
This seat was recommended to me by someone who owns a caravan and who had luck with it . Unfortunately i have a Mountaineer and this car seat just does not fit comfortably anywhere in the back seat in the rear facing position.Problems : The latch cord was n't long enough so we had to do the seatbelt install instead.The seat is so huge that our only option was to put it behind the front passenger seat . In order to have it reclined correctly , we had to remove the base , use 3 pool noodles AND a blanket ... .but now the person in the front passenger seat is too close to the dashboard . For a family of long legs , this does n't work out too well.The buckle is very tricky ... ..with practice , you eventually get used to it and the straps keeps twisting.Good things : Seat is comfortable and safe . Height adjust is super easy , especially in New England weather ... when baby may be wearing a snowsuit one day and a sweatshirt the next . Fabric is easily washable.I wish i had talked to other SUV owners before i bought this one to see what else they recommended . I will be much happier with it when we can switch to forward facing in 6 months .	-1
I bought this for my six month old son , since he grew out of his infant seat . One of the main reasons that I bought it was because of the review I read where the man said it saved his daughters life . Maybe as a foward facing seat this might be a good car seat , but I have not had a very good experenice using it rear facing . When I first took it out of the box I noticed how bad the fabric smells . It smells like some sort of chemical . I understand that some new fabrics smell , so rather than return it I let it air out for a few days . It still smells but not as bad . I had the hardest time threading the latch hook through one side of the car seat to the other . They tell you to lift up the padding to do it . Sounds easy , but it is so hard to get the padding off . Once I finally got it through , it was even harder to install in the car . It is very big . The latch belt does n't tighten enough to where I feel it is safe . The harness buckles are very hard to put in and get out . It takes a million tries of pushing the red button as hard as I can to get the buckles to come undone . When my son is in the seat he kind of looks like he is just `` floating '' . If he falls asleep , ( even with the seat all the way reclined ) , his head ends up in his lap or on the side of the car seat . I rode in the back seat with him one day and it just does n't look safe to me . I am not happy with this seat . I bought the graco comfort sport for half the price and it has worked out much better .	-1
Because of the bright colors on this items , i though my daughter will love it . On the internet , it looks like the teether was small enough for a 5 and half month old child to hold . But when i got it , i was not impressed at all . It was too thick for her to grab , and will not even fit her month either . So , now it is in the box with the rest of the useless items that will never be used again	-1
it is too big and too heavy for my 6-month-old baby to hold , and also the materials seem too hard for my baby to chew . My baby himself is not interested in it . a bad buy .	-1
My baby does not like this teether . I guess she finds it big for herself . I suggest you find a smaller one which can be easily grasped by your baby .	-1
Too thick for him to put in the mouth or hold in tiny fingers.. the soft rattle noise gets his attention for 20 seconds max..i like the thinner necklace type item better than this one .	-1
I thought it would be great and interactive but my 8 month old is not really into this . She 's picked it up a couple times but that 's about it ... .	-1
I saw this toy and immediately loved it . It 's bright , well-made , and fun to play with . But my children disagreed . And , since it 's a teether and toy , their opinions are the ones that matter.While babies , neither of my children used it for teething . It might be because it 's pretty big for a baby to handle , or maybe the textures just did n't work for them . The now-toddler ( 29 months old ) is not interested in playing with it , either . It just takes up space in our toy area now , even though I bright it out every few weeks to reintroduce it and try to drum up interest.If you 're looking for an all-around awesome teether , try theSuper Yummy Teether . If you 'd like a smaller , multi-purpose teether-type toy , tryLots of Links . Both of these are easy to hold ( even for little ones ) and fun to chew.Bottom line : Skip it . There are better teether/toys for your baby and better twiddly desk toys for you .	-1
The product pretty much only has 2 textures , rubber & plastic . The product overall is a good size but each section is small , too small for the baby to get a proper & # 34 ; bite & # 34 ; on the section he may be interested in . To top it all off , the & # 34 ; twisty & # 34 ; of it actually made the product less enjoyable as the baby could not get a consistent grip/bite as it would twist as he grabbed/bit.Do the baby a favor & just get him the cheap little teethers that are filled with water .	-1
my girl didnt like this toy at all , it was not good for teething ! there 's no soft material for her to bite on ... she was not interested in it , and it was basically a waste of money .	-1
I thought this was a neat idea until my little guy started manipulating it and collapsed it into the figure 8 and pinched his fingers -- hard ! Not using it with my youngest .	-1
This is too thick for baby mouth . It is hard for him to bite it and does not help with teething . At the same time it is at least fun cause it is bendable .	-1
I bought this ( 2 ) months ago to keep at our house for my now 8-month old grandaughter . It 's terrible for a couple of reasons.~ Way too big for a teething infant to hold never mind put in their mouth - what were they thinking ? ~ Ca n't be put in dishwasher or soaked in the sink ( just run it under water ) Overall , a total waste of $ 5.00 . I 'd recommend seeing teething products in stores before randomly picking something out on line like I did . There are definintely better products for the price out there that your baby will be able to handle and enjoy .	-1
We have several rattles and never used this one . The Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle and Bright Starts Start Your Senses Play A Tune Piano Toy were the favorite and pretty much only used rattles in our house . Different children definitely enjoy different things but all the children that have been to our house have liked the same ones that my daughter did and we had a lot to chose from . This was a bad purchase for us .	-1
I bought this teether for my five-month old , but ended up returning it because it was not dishwasher-safe and ca n't be submerged in water to clean . I wanted to be able to do both , so this teether was not good for me .	-1
Okay , I got this for newborn . It 's CLEARLY stated it can NOT be used for sleeping , remember that . In fact , my baby distinctly disliked it . Now , if you have any good car-seats , etc . they come with quite good head-rests , etc . Thus , I really did n't have a need for this . Also , infants really do n't `` travel '' much for this to be useful , as it 's only supposed to be used in strollers , car-seats , bouncers , etc . This is CLEARLY stated in their product tag on the product . Now , as the child grows older and the need rises for these products , i.e . strollers , car-seats , etc. , does this product is still needed ? NO ! Why ? As I see it , it 's during the 1st . 6 months , that there 's an urgent need to have something in place , helping the child 's head in developing to a correct shape . Thus : I am not sure of the product 's usefulness .	-1
It broke in 3 different parts within the first week . The wood is very weak and breaks very easily . This does n't do well for a toddler ... they need to make it with real wood or stronger material !	-1
With all the baby accidents on the clothing that gets put into this hamper , it gets a bit `` gamey '' . So I washed it , in cold water and did n't put it in the dryer . Well , it shrank so bad that it no longer reaches the bottom of the legs so you can velcro it . I ended up tossing it . You ca n't put a bedding change in it with anything else in there , it just does n't have enough room and the frame is very cheaply made I was afraid it would break . Not worth it .	-1
I had high hopes for these , but have yet to find a kid who will play with them ! Both of our kids find them boring , and older ones as well . Great concept , but probably too complex for the age group advertised .	-1
The netting on the hoop loosened and is coming off on one side and the balls are just ok . I thought that maybe since it is a bath toy that there would be no holes in them to let water inside . Every time my son would squeeze a ball black gunk would come out . I threw away the entire set , waste of money . Would have given a better rating if it were n't for the balls that allow water to sit stagnate and get moldy .	-1
The netting ripped right away and my daughter was very gentle with it . Also the balls ripped along the squirt holes . We were down to 1 ball within 3 months .	-1
My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy . The hoop is just a net , so the balls do n't come out of the bottom . You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out . When my son or I did this , the hoop came off the bathtub wall . I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached . The right suction cup worked fine , so the hoop was always falling sideways . Also , the balls have small holes in them and take in water . I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls ... and at bathtime , if you squeezed the balls , a ton of mold flakes come out . Unless I cleaned them out before bath time , I really did n't want them in the tub . I 'd suggest going with another brand .	-1
I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born . I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor 's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion ! Even changing stations did n't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static ! I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped . When you turn up the volumne , even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms , they will make a horrible sound as though they are still `` too close '' , so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static ! I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP !	-1
We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately , we were not pleased with it . When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it does n't seem to matter where in the house you try it . Do n't waste your money ...	-1
We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced . It always has static and background noise ( including our neigbors ! but I 'm told a lot of monitors do that ) , so the red light is always on . My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it , but for my own piece of mind , we 'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room . One that does n't have so much background noise and static .	-1
This product is horrible . When we first plugged it in it worked ok . Within hours we were getting horrible static . We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it did n't get any better . We finally found two places where the static is n't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there , plugged in and turned on ALL the time ! One night , when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep , I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station ! Maybe that 's the cause of the static . Horrible product . Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores !	-1
This montior does work well . I can hear my son breathing , and dogs barking and all of that very clearly . It works outside , upstairs and down . The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries . When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound . I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house . So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive .	-1
My baby has had some fun with this toy ( 3-5months ) but it definately ranks far down the list of toys he enjoys and I 'm sure there are hundreds of others I could have purchased instead of this one and gotten more playtime out of them . The suction cup works but only if you have a place to suction it that your baby ca n't reach but can see and it does n't frustrate him to not be able to touch his toys . All the pieces come apart from each other which is nice but also a problem if you 're trying to keep it together . Most babies are stronger than velcro and magnetic clasps . It 's also just not as interesting to look at or chew as many other toys we 've tried .	-1
I read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive I hoped that was an old ( solved ) problem . The chest arrive and was spacious and cute . My tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it . But the smell was noxious ! It smells like just produced toxic plastic . I aired it out for 2 weeks ( ! ) in another room . Then taking drastic measures ( realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box ) i dunked it into a cold bath . After it dried ( which it did without any problems btw ) it still smelled . So did the toys left in it overnight . Sadly the chest went to the curb ...	-1
I was really excited to use this item since my son was born in December but it was so diffuclt to figure out how it fits on to the car seat I just gave up and returned it .	-1
I registered and received this gift for my baby shower . I put it on the car seat and was looking forward to bringing my baby home in it . Fortunately , my hospital has a car seat safety inspection station and they told me to take the Bundle Me off immediately . They say because the Bundle Me goes under the baby it interferes with the safety restraints . The straps that go around the baby may appear to be tight , but the Bundle Me may actually bunched up under the straps and therefore the restraints are n't as tight as they should be . Then God-forbid there was an accident , the force could cause the Bundle Me to shift -- loosening the restraints and baby could come lose . Kinda defeats the purpose of a car seat if you ask me . When there are so many safe covers ( the ones that are elastic and go over the car seat , but not under the baby -- for example the Eddie Bauer Carrier Cover , which is what we ended up with ) , why take the chance ? I 'd rather error on the side of safety .	-1
The fleece ( polyester ) that lines the inside comes off so easily . My little one had it all over her hands . I did n't want her to swallow it or inhale it so I sent it back . I use the Bundle Me Lite and that works great ... no fuzzies that come off .	-1
Our daughter was in the NICU and before we left , she had to have a car seat challenge . When we brought in her car seat , we had the bundleme in it and we had to take it out as it was a safety hazard . These are not safe for any child as they are made post manufacturing of your car seat , and therefore have not been safety tested with your car seat . Many infant carriers/car seat warranties will be voided if you are in a wreck and using a bundleme or other type of infant 'blanket ' that goes between your child and the car seat .	-1
I returned the product . It is way too bulky to add to a car seat . I brought the car seat with the Bundle Me installed to my local fire department for inspection of proper installation . My husband got an `` A '' for proper car seat installation . I got an `` F '' for having this product in the car seat . It has too much cushion , causing too much give in the event of an accident . The inspector told us to get rid of it . Perhaps this product is good for a stroller ?	-1
I would be very careful when purchasing this ! This product is made of very good material ( heck , I 'd like to be bundled in one myself ! ) it is soft , washable and looks great . The downside is that you should not be putting anything between the baby and the carseat because the carseat was not crash tested in such a manner . Additionally , we have a Britax infant seat and because of the additional head support used in that carseat , there is barely any room for my daughters head and she 's only 8 weeks old ! Sadly , we are returning this product and we 're going to try one of the covers that only goes over the seat .	-1
I bought this wrap based on the praise it received . But I think it is way too expensive for what it is . It is also time consuming and cumbersome to put on . You do get the hang of it but it still takes time to get it just right and drags the floor in the process . Also my 18 month old did n't seem that safe in it . I felt like he was about to fall out all the time . And I wondered if the bunched material under his butt and back hurt him . It pulls up on your shirt so make sure you wear a long one ! And it left black looking fuzz all over my hands and clothes every time I touched it . I washed it several times and even lint rolled it and it still did n't help . It 's also made of a thick t-shirt like material and made me and my son hot . The only thing about it I liked was that it did n't hurt my back or neck like other baby carriers.I am still on the search for the perfect baby carrier ...	-1
Do n't bother with this one . It 's too complicated to put on .	-1
My husband and I are smart people , but even after reading the instructions and following them closely , I do n't think we ever got this to work correctly . We tried it when our daughter was 1-2 months old and no matter which way we had her in the carrier , she hated it . We never tried another carrier , so I do n't have a point of comparison , but we hated this one so much , that we brought it back to the store .	-1
**UPDATE**I love this type of wrap for the reasons I explain in my original review , below , but I have found a better wrap that does not have the problem I had with the Ultimate Baby Wrap , which was that it would get loose and cause my baby to hang too low . The Sleepy Wrap is made of much better material that stays taut and supports your baby much better ! **ORIGINAL REVIEW**The ultimate baby wrap is so easy to throw on for errands and pop my daughter in and out at each stop . On a recent trip I wore it all weekend and it was so nice and easy . My shoulders did start getting sore after wearing my baby for several hours , but she is 22 pounds and I usually do n't wear her that long anyway . I love the pocket . I put my keys and cell phone in there when we go out for a walk . The only drawback is that after a few wearing sessions it stretches out and my baby hangs low , but I just wash and dry it to get it snug again . Not sure if I 'm supposed to wash AND dry it , but I do regularly and it 's held up well for a long time . Just recently I did notice it tearing a bit where the pocket is sewn on . When I wear my baby it does stretch that area quite a bit , and like I said I wash and dry it a lot which is n't that great for any fabric .	-1
what a pain to use ! who wants or can spend all the time needed to properly attach this item to yourself and still take care of your sweetie ? can not seem to get it to wrap tight enough to make me feel secure to tote bubbies around . i would not buy this item if i where you .	-1
I did n't really use this so it was a waste of money . It took too long to wrap it around the body and get it on just right . Would not recommed to anyone . It was comfy to wear though .	-1
To be fair we did n't have this for long . We tried the carrier on 16 month old ( at that time ) and it took to look to put on and immediately began to sag . I wanted mainly for a sling , so that in public I could nurse without attracting to much attention , but it was too long and too much of a hassle to put it on so we returned it . I have yet to fine one that will fit and still be a reasonable price .	-1
This wrap is easy to use & fairly comfortable , except that you are constantly having to adjust it tighter . The pocket in the front seems great at first , but then starts creating little holes in the wrap at the pockets corners . My 10 pound baby bounced more than could be safe , & gradually sagged lower and lower , requiring constant tightening.I returned it & ordered an Ellaroo from Peppermint.com -- it is so much more comfortable & more secure , the baby does n't bounce or sag , and it 's beautiful .	-1
I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times , but to no avail . My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort . Though he 's only 11 lbs , my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes -- I guess the straps are not padded enough . I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn ! I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely -- just did n't work out for us . I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing .	-1
With all the great reviews , I had high expectations for this product . Upon assembly , my husband pointed out that the slits made to take the cards apart are actually just slightly too small and will cause ripping . Poor design.Secondly , and more importantly , the mobile would n't fit on our crib or changing table as it is apparently designed for a crib with a short bar at the top . We have a Babyletto brand crib and changing table , so nothing weird or unusual . So sad . Now we have to return it.Before buying , make sure your crib or changing table has only a thin bar at the top in order to accomodate this mobile ! I 'm sure if this were n't the case I would have otherwise been quite happy with this product !	-1
As an ophthalmologist , I can attest to the functional utility of this product . Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns -- but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it . The plastic cards are badly made -- 3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together . In addition , the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I ca n't get them attached . If motivated , you could probably make your own sturdier mobile -- the patterns are available online .	-1
I was hugely disappointed when this mobile did n't fit on my crib . I 'm certain I have one of the most popular cribs in the US , I got it at Costco after all , and the mobile simply will not fit anywhere on the crib . So then I tried it on the bassinet , did n't work there either . So then I thought , maybe somewhere on the dresser above the changing table ? Nope . I 'm going to have to figure out a way to hang it from the ceiling , probably using fishing line and screw hook . Also , it 's made with a very cheap looking white plastic , which will bother people looking for a stylish mobile to compliment their professionally decorated nursery .	-1
I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life . My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price . The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked ( many arrived already cracked ) . The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly . And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well .	-1
I bought this for our 3 month old , and the concept is obviously great -- lots of stimulating patterns and contrasting colors . However ... once I had it out and assembled , the pieces are so flimsy and there are flimsy 'small ' parts . I just did not feel comfortable leaving her alone in her crib for even 30 seconds , while that was over it . Yes , she could n't reach it yet , but still -- It made me nervous . I think I 'll return it and get something soft with less small parts . It 's a shame , it is a great idea .	-1
This product came with the wrong parts and it is unusable without the correct parts . The two plastic parts that make the cross which the cards hang from were incorrect . There are supposed to be two different parts and this one came with two of the same part .	-1
This product is terrible . We bought it looking for a less-crazy , more modern-looking alternative to the noisy , pastel-printed alternatives . But there is n't really any part of this mobil that works . The cross bars are prone to breaking ( we had to superglue them twice while setting it up ) . The cards are supposed to be interchangeable , but I spent 20 minutes trying to swap out a single card , only to give up and spend 20 minutes undoing what I did . Even if you leave the card alone , they do n't really hang flat . And the attachment mechanism is worse than other mobiles that are in the same price range . Terrible !	-1
I like the idea of this mobile and would have definitely liked it if it was made a little better . But the whole thing seems kind of cheap and plastic-y . The way two cards are put together causes one of them to split a little in the middle and the cards do n't really hang down straight . I ended up returning the mobile because it just did n't fulfill its purpose due to its poor quality . If it was cheaper it 'd probably be ok . I do n't know why something so innovative that being recommended on so many websites would n't be of higher quality ! ?	-1
I do n't have a super unusual crib . It 's one of the Babylettos , but plenty of other cribs I have seen will have the same problem that mine did . The problem is that they made it only to fit cribs that the top part ( where you would connect the mobile ) is only 4 inches tall ( wooden piece ) or less . ( The part where the crib slats meet the top ) . Ours is around 6 inches and I honestly ca n't say that we saw any mid-range crib that was different.If you try to put it on with it not fitting properly , it is not very secure . My guess is that it would be a very short period until the whole thing falls on your baby 's head . And no , that 's not being overly dramatic - it fits that poorly on the crib types I have mentioned . It 's hard to describe , but it does n't screw properly since it has to be at an unintended angle . In addition , as other users have mentioned , the way the hard plastic cards interlock with each other and onto the mobile is done poorly . I can see the plastic cracking and leaving small hard plastic bits in your crib unexpectedly.We received this as a gift after placing it on our baby registry . After having twins , it 's not worth the hassle of the return . I will say that the patterns on the cards are interesting , so to make it not a complete waste , I will be using them as flash-cards . The babies ( very young ) seemed interested , so at least there is that.Overall I would highly recommend AGAINST this product if you have the crib type I mentioned or if you feel you will be changing out the cards frequently . If you just installed them once and left them alone , then it would probably be ok ( with the right crib ) . It 's just disappointing to have so many design flaws on a product that I really wanted to like . Had it fit my crib , I still would have been disappointed in the plastic cards , but would have rated a 3 star.P.S . There is no sound/music that goes with this mobile . Not a big deal , but I did n't realize that when I put it on my registry - which makes it seem even a cheaper quality .	-1
I bought this high chair for traveling to grandmas houses . It did n't fit my mothers table or my mothers-in-laws table either . We had to use it on the outside patio table . After a few uses it broke . When it did fit the table it was n't bad .	-1
I think the chair would serve it 's purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage/travel seemed way too cheap for me . The paint on the metal was scratching off when I twisted the arms to fold it . I only tried it on a counter so I ca n't say how it works on a table with a skirt but I returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by Phil & Ted called MeToo . The Phil & Ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but does n't come with a travel bag where this one does . I can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me . And the MeToo chair does go on my table with a skirt .	-1
This wo n't work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way .	-1
I ordered this product because I had used one with my sister 's 3 boys when they where very yough but by the time my youngest nephew 's little girl came to visit she was too young to use it & then the next time she came to visit she was over the wt reqmt . So its never been used & that is why I only gave it one star . However , I would highly recommend this product . It easy to use and u do n't need a chair to fasten it to first ... just slide the arms of the portable highchair onto the top of the table , tighten the screwers to ensure the chairs stays upright and fastened to the table ... when done , reverse all procedures , slide it off the table , and away u go .	-1
I was looking for a chair to use at grandma 's house , and ordered this one . At home we use the Phil and Ted 's Me Too everywhere we go , and love it in every way . We like to have the baby at the table with us . The Regalo is clunky , difficult to install , the fabric feels cheap , the baby sits too low and his head hits the metal piping on the top of the chair . He cries whenever I put him in it . This chair is going back .	-1
I bought this for an upcoming trip because I wanted something that could pack in my luggage . Once I got it , I tried putting it on my kitchen table , but was n't able . I think our table might have been too thick for this chair to be compatible . So we ended up returning it and instead got the My Little Seat Infant Seat .	-1
I really should 've read the reviews on this , but I did n't see how I could go wrong . It 's described very well and the pictures really sell it . I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet . There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length . Once I put it together , there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table . It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further . I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5 ' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present . For now , I am content with the bumbo . Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping .	-1
This item does not work on any table that has any kind of skirt . After many reviews saying that it did I ordered 2 for my two children . The is only about a 3 1/2 inch gap to maneuver the chair under the side and skirt of the table . I 've read many reviews saying that people were able to use it over a table skirt as shown in the picture of this product but have n't the slightest clue how they were able to get the chair under the skirt . I am very disappointed and will be going with a different product .	-1
We got it for the price and unfortunately , we paid the price ! It does not fit most tables and it 's a huge pain to put on and off ! We regret it ! We bought a fisherprice booster with a tray and love it ! Do n't waste your money !	-1
This chair is cheaply made , does n't break down for travel at all , and does n't attach sturdily to the table . Unsafe in my opinion .	-1
I wanted an easy to use travel seat . This seat does not fold up as easily as I expected -- you have to dismantle it and remove the arms in order to take the seat apart and get it to lay flat . That 's a step that I was n't expecting . On our first use , it would not attach securely to the table that we were at . I could get it on the table , but the angle between the part that goes above and below the table did not allow for the seat to be pushed forward toward the table enough so that the seat was secure . The seat might have been safe , but I did n't trust it , and in any case , there would have been a large gap between the baby and the table and I 'm sure any food would have went straight into that gap onto baby 's lap or the floor.I wish I would have spent a few dollars more and gotten the chicco seat that my friends have . That seat works very well and folds flat with ease . This seat was not a good purchase .	-1
This chair is fairly simple to attach and remove from a table . However , I put my 9 month old 20 lb infant in the seat and he was visibly uncomfortable . There is virtually no support in the seat or back of the chair , so he sinks down in it and has trouble moving his upper body around . He sinks into the chair , and ends up hunched forward . I might try using this chair again when my son is older and taller .	-1
I have been holding onto this item for so long now . I have not sent it back because I have not had the time , However , I have not used it because it does not feel very secure and does n't fit to any of my tables or restaurants , etc . The material annoys me . Although it seems easy to clean , it 's very cheap . However , I new that the item was inexpensive and tried my luck . It just sits at the bottom of my stairs staring at me each morning waiting for me to return it .	-1
Initially I thought this was a good deal . Although the color and the material was n't ideal , it stayed put and provided adequate support for my 20lb baby . Unfortunately , it broke after just two months of use . I 'd like to replace it but & # 34 ; broke after use & # 34 ; is n't an option in the Amazon drop down menu .	-1
We bought this thinking that we would prefer its high back to the Phil and Teds lobster chair . Though this was much less expensive , the material is cheap and the unit was annoying to set up . It did n't fit either of our tables , so back it goes .	-1
Bought this item for my child 's crib but found that it just seemed huge . I decided to return it and search for something smaller in which to place a few toys to keep her occupied during naptimes and in the mornings .	-1
I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples , which are larger than average nipples . These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket . I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket . The latches to open the different compartments are very snug , making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand .	-1
These things annoy me pretty frequently because of how flimsy they are . Maybe it 's by design , but its just weird getting things to snap back together . Its just cheap feeling ... very cheap feeling..Also , one of the containers have this compartment that folds out from the bottom ... which is also annoying . Its made worse because you 're doing all of this snapping and swinging with wet parts spilling all over the place . It 's messy and awkward.The round thing seems to waste a whole bunch of space , I assume its the perfect design for something specific , but I have not figured out what that is just yet.We bought this item to help with Dr Brown 's bottles , and it does very little to help.. nothing fits anywhere and I 'm always just rigging stuff in there.Save your money..	-1
I 've used the small round one in the dishwasher twice and the clasp that keeps the cover closed snapped off . The hinge seems tight so it might stay closed enough even without the clasp but they 're definitely not as sturdy as I 'd imagined .	-1
I do n't really like these dishwasher baskets . I also have the munchkin brand , and it is much sturdier . The Lion baskets are not as sturdy , they are flimsy and do n't close easily due to the flimsy quality . I do n't even use these anymore because the munchkin is so much better .	-1
This item is SO frustrating . What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time . The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame . I spent a half hour trying to get it on and then a half hour driving it back to Babies R Us . I am going to see if the store has another one and put it together before I leave the store !	-1
My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own . However , we switched to Dr. Brown 's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion , since I am nursing . We ca n't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown 's bottles . Our son 's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion . The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby . Dr. Brown 's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET ! Pass on these ... do n't believe the hoopla .	-1
I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone . I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast . They do just the opposite . There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them ... because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky . I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them . The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent . Over all , the Avent bottles are a waste of money !	-1
I chose these bottles admittedly because it 's a well known brand . However upon using these bottles I became increasingly frustrated with leaking issues . The caps leak frequently and waste the formula that should be ingested by my baby . It also appeared to create gas which made her miserable . I would never buy Advent again .	-1
While I 'm a stubborn Anglophile , I 'm very disappointed by Avent 's products . The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands ( or stubby fingers ) to hold , and the worst part is with the nipples , which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies . I think Dr. Brown 's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better . Even Gerber 's one-use disposable nipples are way better .	-1
These bottles are awful . And they leak , even if you follow the directions . I spoke to an Avent representative and they do not refund , they send you a box so that you can send them the bottles for a test . If they leak , they send you new ones , if they do n't you get yours back . I told her I wanted my money back and she said they do not refund because they know that they do not leak . I am wondering why they make such a difficult-to-assemble bottle ? Why , at 3am , do I have to worry so much about the collar of the nipple being just so and not overtightening and this and that . Can Avent please just make a bottle with fool-proof assembly at over 4 bucks a pop ? ? ? I know that some babies are picky with their nipples , but mine is not and she does n't care what the milk comes out of , just make sure it comes out . So we have switched to some cheapy bottles that amazingly do not leak . I think they cost $ 1 a piece . Keep it simple , stupids.UPDATE : I sent the bottles to Avent . They left me a message on my machine . I called them back . They told me that my bottles do not leak ( surprise surprise ... but oh do they leak ) and that it looked as if I had been using a brillo pad when washing them . I used their stupid brush that was included in the kit . So they sent me back my bottles . No new bottles , no refund , nothing . I told them that I was disappointed with their product and that I had spent all sorts of money on it and that I was very perturbed that they can not make a product that is simple to assemble and does n't leak . I also told them that I had purchased some bottles at Wal-Mart for less than a dollar each that also have anti-colic nipples that are easy to assemble and do not leak . Whatever . I am just so upset that this company does not aim to make their consumer happy.I highly recommend using a different bottle system , unless you want a soaked kid .	-1
I had to switch to bottles because of low milk production and having to supplement soon after my son was born . I love the look and feel of avent bottles but my son has a small mouth and was unable to get a good suction on this nipple . He would leak milk everywhere or squirt it at us , it was very messy . Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles.I also do n't recommend buying many 4oz bottles , my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces , and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles .	-1
I have been a loyal Avent customer since the birth of my now 2 1/2 year old son , and I have always recommended their products to anybody I know ( and even some strangers I see shopping ) . I absolutely loved all of the products , despite their higher cost and more involved assembly procedures . My children , 2 1/2 and 11 months , both love ( and loved ) these bottles . in fact , they are the only bottle that either of them would use . However , the past several months , as I have been trying to make the transition to sippy cups with my daughter , now 10 months , I have been having the most awful experiences with their sippy cups . I have been using the Magic Cups with nipples instead of sippy spouts ( in order to get my daughter first accustomed to the new shape , then to the new spout ) . Whenever we go to feed her , the cup leaks profusely from the neck of the cup , below the base of the top piece , and often leaves her so wet that we have to change her clothes , occasionally three to four times a day . We have tried reconnecting the lid ( sometimes up to ten times ) and often , it STILL leaks . We have since gone back to using the bottles , and I have told several of my friends about the problems I am experiencing not just with one cup , but with all 6 cup and lid combinations that we have . Also , the problem is not just limited to the sippy cups and bottles when used with the bottle nipples on the sippy cups ( as I had thought could be the case , ) but even with the sippy spouts that we have , the problem still occurs . I have not yet been able to find a way to remedy the situation completely , as we have had several , albeit fewer , problems with the bottles as well , but my daughter will not accept any other bottles ( or sippy cups , much to my dismay ) so for now , we are stuck using Avent products , which I am unfortunately , very disappointed with this time around .	-1
The tiny lip on the nipple does not count as breakthrough technology in preventing the baby from swallowing air . I recommend Dr. Brown 's bottles . They cost more , but they 're worth it .	-1
My baby had terrible gas and colic and i was using the Playtex Ventaire natural shape bottles . someone gave me an avent bottle to try . I was desperate to find something that would releive her but this bottle was not it either . i didnt find that the bottle itself leaked but the milk came out too fast and caused my baby to choke and spit up all over . i was disappointed because the Avent bottles seemed as though they would be easier to clean and assemble than the Vent Aires . after this i reluctantly tried the Dr Browns bottles and i am glad i did because they worked great the first day , no gas or colic and baby slept all nite : - ) i just recently tried the wide neck Dr. Browns and like them even better than the standard dr browns . You Avent users might like the wide neck Dr Browns also b/c they are easy to clean and pour milk into like the Avents , there are more parts but so worth it to releive colic . Too bad the Vent Aires didnt work b/c they are the cutest bottles of the 3 though .	-1
These bottles look so nice and are so durable BUT they only offer one kind of nipple and are not compatible with any other system , so if you child does n't like thier nipple , you 're heavily invested in a huge set that is useless . And Avent is SO expensive ! Niether of my boys liked these bottles/nipples . I primarily breastfeed and the shape of these nipples are nothing like mine . The silicone is the wrong texture too - nothing like the real thing.If you really like the look of Avent and think you want to use them , buy just one bottle and nipple to start until you are sure they work.In my opinion , a much better starter system is the Playtex ( I use the Drop-Ins ) - it comes with several different nipple shapes to try , including latex , which has a more realistic texture.I foolishly bought the Avent starter set because someone somewhere told me that they were the most breastfeeder friendly and that companies that make bottles AND formula only want to sabatoge your brreastfeeding efforts - - what a silly and paranoid accusation that turned out to be !	-1
We purchased over 20 Avent bottles for my daughter before she was born because we had heard so many great things about the bottle and also saw the good reviews.My daughter took the Avent for about two weeks ... then she all of a sudden decided that she did n't want to take it anymore ! We tried every single bottle on the market and the only bottle that she will take is the Playtex Deluxe Nurser . The nipple is soft on her gums and it acts exactly like a real breast nipple acts.My advise to new or expectant parents is ... do n't buy a lot of any one bottle until you are sure that your baby is going to latch on well ! Trust me ... I have over $ 100 in unused Avent bottles that are collecting dust !	-1
I found the nipples EXTREMELY hard for a new born baby to suck on . I used the Playtex bottles w/ the disposable liner and it made my life much easier . In the playtex starter pack , there are also nipples of different sizes and shapes so your baby can decide whe one she likes .	-1
When using these bottles with my newborn , stage 1 flow was very fast for her . The nipples are very hard ( not like the breast at all ) . She would get alot of gas when using these bottles . I switched to Platex Ventaire and we both loved them . Those bottles are a hundred times better .	-1
These bottles are the worst I 've ever seen . My son could not get latched on correctly , the nipples were too small , and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly . And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right , not to tight you know . Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night . We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better . Yes you have the bags , but there is no leaking and no extra air . I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt , because they do n't want to stay screwed to the pump . ERRR ! ! Very frustrating .	-1
I used these bottles for expressed breast milk to give my husband a chance to feed our baby . The bottles do not leak , like I have read in the other reviews . But , I used the # 1 nipple which takes my daughter 45 minutes to finish and she constantly falls asleep during feeding . The # 2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after she was done even though she was burped several times during feeding . I switched to Dr. Brown 's bottles which eliminated the gas problem all together .	-1
I used these through out my daughter 's infancy , largely because I bought a whole set of them , the milk storage contraptions , the breast pump , and the pacifiers . Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she would n't take any other kind.But the bottles routinely leaked , ruining several diaper bags , clothing , and nighttime feedings.Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM ! My daughter did n't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about , but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months.All in All , I think the paci 's are great , the rest of it I could do without .	-1
These were terrible . They leaked everywhere . I must recommend the tri-flow !	-1
Although they have a good reputation , they definately have a drawback . They are short and fat bottles , so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple . Now that my son is holding his own bottle , we do n't use them for that fact-it 's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple , he gets too frustrated . All in all I 'd say buy a different bottle .	-1
They sometimes leak and it 's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick . It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated ! ! ! Think of nightime feeding ! ! ! !	-1
I love the regular take and toss cups , so I was excited when I saw these . I got the boy color four pack for my 2 year old son and at the first usage I realized that these were a bad idea ! He can pull the straw out and then the liquid comes out , what is tee point of having a removable straw ! ? I 'm going to try the straw cups with the twisty top instead , do n't waste money on these ... cheap as they may be !	-1
The chair is nice and nicely made , but my son did not like it at all . We used the aquarium swing more than anything .	-1
This is by far one of the nicest LOOKING baby seats out there . I received a barely-used one as a pass-along-gift from my girlfriend . Now I now why it was barely-used . Her son did n't like it . Neither did mine ! I did n't get it -- it was warm , soft -- he did n't care and wanted nothing to do with it -- preferred this hideous baby seat every time . The back is very flat- so I never felt like the baby was really `` in '' a seat , more like leaning on it . This may work for much smaller babies , but at 8 lbs. , my baby was done with it by week 3 .	-1
I would actually give this fewer stars because we 've gotten NO use out of it ... but I think it 's one of those personal preference things . My son just does n't like it . We really thought he would - it 's so soft and snugly . Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer . He LOVES it . I think it 's the massage feature that he likes so much . Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down .	-1
I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting . It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died . After finally figuring out to replace them ( takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot ) the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks . Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing . Not really worth the extra expense , stick with the full size or another travel model .	-1
This swing does not recline , so if your baby can not completely sit up on their own , they slump down or tip to the side . When they tip to the side , the little hanging fish hit them in the face . There are also delightful little fish swimming on the sides of this device . When your child leans over to explore , their little heads get stuck between the fixed post and the swinging arm and get banged over and over . The only nice , safe feature is the lights . Do not buy this Swing . Buy something safer .	-1
My son hates this swing . He never liked it . As mentioned from quite a few other people , it is very difficult to remove a baby w/o hitting their head.My son tore a neck muscle when he was delivered and b/c of that he `` tips '' to one side , and the toys were always hitting him in the head . It was awful.The swing does move quite quickly , also . Setting # 2 was all I could use for a long time b/c it moved so fast.It may fit some babies , but definatley not mine !	-1
My baby 's head falls to the side in this swing ! It does NOT recline enough . This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own . Not , NOT for newborns ! ! ! Needs to be re-called . If you are going to use this swing , make sure you are within eye sight of your baby , do n't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side , even with the net there .	-1
I did n't register for this gift but received it at my shower . I kept it because I thought it would be great for visiting relatives ' homes . We used it for the first time over Thanksgiving and we were truly disappointed . Our daughter , Esther , is 3 months old and on the large end of the scale . She is also fairly strong with decent head control for a baby her age ( but far from sitting up ) . When we put her in this swing we were quite surprised by how bad it was . It does n't recline at all and she kept slumping to the side . When she slumped to the side one of three things would happen : a ) the toys ( which do n't come off ) would whack her in the headb ) her head would bang into the frame as it swungc ) both.We tried supporting her with blankets and taping the toys out of the way but nothing worked . My 3 older daughters wound up putting their Care Bears in it and using it for a toy . Maybe it will be better when she is older but it stinks right now . I gave it 2 stars only bc she did seem to enjoy the blinking lights . I read the instruction manual cover to cover and had my husband do the same . It does not say anything about how to make it recline further . In fact , you can see by the way the mesh is at the sides of the seat that it is impossible to recline - the angle is fixed . I have already thrown out the box but am going to phone Fisher Price to see if I can return it to them . I think this swing borders on unsafe and I would n't feel comfortable putting Essie in it again .	-1
I bought these to use with my Kleen Kanteen 's - and although they do fit they leak like crazy . If the bottle is not upright the water just flows out . I was so disappointed .	-1
I bought Avent bottles because of their ability to be used as sippy cups . Trying to save myself a little cash and the nuisance of more cups . Alas , my kids just have no interest in these what so ever . Not to mention Avent bottles barely screw together so my kids can way too easily take the tops off . If I could go back I would have bought a different brand of bottle . Ultimately a waste of money .	-1
Our daughter , now 7 weeks old , has yet to warm up to this swing . There is n't anything fundamentally wrong with the swing ; it is what it is . Our daughter just does n't like it . The motor is n't particularly powerful , the music is n't very soothing , and I do n't think she feels secure being so close to the floor .	-1
I received this swing as a shower gift . My son was born weighing about 5.5 pounds so we put a neck supports in the swing he seemed to love it lulled him to sleep and the swing is easy to store . I was ready to give it a 5 star review until today . He is now 6 weeks old and weighs a little over 9 pounds , he ca n't hold his head up for extended periods of time and he is n't incredible active . He was napping in the swing while I did dishes , I heard him make a little noise so I turned around ... much to my horror he was hanging sideways out of the swing ! He was buckled in , and I was using one of those head support things . I feel that this is a safety issue , if you have this swing or get this swing please do n't ever take your eyes off of your baby , I was in the same room just with my back to him . Luckily my baby was fine I was more shaken up that he was in fact he was still asleep . I have read other reviews and I know other people have had the same problem . ** This is the first and ( at this time ) the only review I have written	-1
I have 2 sets of twins . With the first set we just bathed them in the tub ( kinda a nightmare ) So with the second set my husband brought home Euro Baths ( WAY TO BIG AND EXPENSIVE ! ) So we thought that a tub sid seat would be good . We it works , I can bathe them at the same time , BUT ... I have to fill up the ENTIRE tub , for two 8 month olds ! I can not clean their bottoms or thier backs . Their legs get scratched and so do their , privates . I get VERY nervous that the seat will fall ( so I put a stool under it just incase ) . Its a nightmare to clean out , ( SOOO many nooks and crannies , what bright light thought to do THAT ? ) . All in all I liked the idea , but it needs ALOT of work . Now I just use two tub rings that stick to the bottom of the tub ( Less water , dont worry about them falling ) And now I just have to pick one up at a time to wash their bottoms ( need two people , one to wash them and one to be ready to hold one when the washer has to get the second ones bottom clean ) . Its pretty much the same thing , but its in ONE piece NO NOOKS AND CRANNIES and my boys LOVE them . I suggest this for all parents of multiples who bathe at the same time ! If your a parent of one child I recomend one of those big tubs . SKIP THE TUP SIDE THING AND USE THE REGULAR RING ! ( to keep my back in check I use a step stool to sit on , or I bathe/shower with them !	-1
I was about to buy this one , and found that this item had been recalled back in 2005 . Recall : Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seats : [ ... ]	-1
This was a waste of money . We could n't get baby to stay still in it .	-1
We were looking for something for our son when he out grew his little baby tub and thought this would be great b/c he could sit up . The seat itself is a bit slippery so we had to put something on it first so he would n't slide ( washcloth will do ) . He loved that he was able to sit and splash in his new tub seat . However we found it very difficult for just one of us to get him in it . It ended up that both of us would have to be present to get him in the seat . One holds him while the other worked his legs into the seat . It also was hard to wash his privates as he was sitting on his bottom and you ca n't just lift him to wash it and his front privates were to squashy to get to . We ended up washing his privates on his changing table before puting him in the bath and that was just becoming too ridiculous . We have since bought a mini blow up bath ( Babies R ' Us or Target ) and he loves it and it is easy to wash him and no troubles . However it was much easier to control and felt safer with him being secure in the tub seat ... .	-1
( ... ) When your child outgrows the infant bath ( between two and six months , depending on size and activeness ) , get a bigger baby bath . There are several models ( though none via Amazon , that I see ) that rock , including one we found that 's inflatable - it holds thrice the water of the infant bath but still a small fraction of what 's needed in the entire tub.Besides , you want the water to flow and be replaced for a baby , NOT have an infant or toddler sitting in a tub full of dirty and soapy water , which may contribute to genital and rectal problems.Related : With this seat , you either suspend the baby *above* the water or waste dozens of gallons getting the water line high enough to *reach* the baby . Either way , the baby 's butt is inside a chair and difficult to reach or see , much less clean.Still not sure ? Try wiping his or her buttcrack while they 're in a high chair . You 'll instantly realize that a chair such as this is *not* the best way to bath a child .	-1
This seat is not designed to fit over the tracks of the door , therefore it becomes unstable . The seat does not swivel easily ! You really have to push & pull hard to get it to move at all . Also-I took mine back because my son kept getting his arm stuck between the seat and the arm that hooks over my tub ! No serious injuries to him , but he did get a bunch of scratches from the sharp seam on that arm . All in all-not a good design at all . I would say , buy anything else but this .	-1
This product does not fit all bath tubs . We have an oval tub and it did not come close to fitting it due to the crazy arm on it . There was no way to remove the arm and the seat does not have suction cups on the bottom so we had to return it .	-1
the shower is extremely weak and the water flow is so slow that i stopped using it few minutes after the first time i tried this product . the tub is small to begin with and having the shower pump/spray inside the tub all the more makes it small . my 2.5 month-old 's legs ended up either banging the shower contraption or simply hanging out of the tub ! worst tub ever , not worth it ... i bought the Eurobath instead ( by Primo ) which , on the contrary , is the best tub ever !	-1
I do not own this tub , but used it for a week when I was visiting my girlfriend who has it.I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a `` shower '' like this one . And , although it 's a great idea , when I tried out this tub at girlfriend 's , I did n't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well as others ( which I 've found to be SO much more important then a `` shower '' ) My daughter was 4 months at the time , and was too big for the `` net '' ( her legs had no where to fit ) but without it , there is no recline option , just plain basin tub , which was difficult because she could not yet sit . It ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash . I was also dissapointed with the `` shower '' as it was diffucult to get or keep running , and was not more then a few trickles . My girlfriend said she and her husband have taken it apart and tried everything to improve upon the shower , but they have had little success with it too.Perhaps if they improve upon the actual tub design , or make a better `` shower '' we could have the best of both worlds . Until then , hands down , Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub ( or a similarly shaped tub ) has my vote !	-1
I bought this tub for my friend and she said it was a terrible product . The sling was poorly made and the sprayer broke after 5 uses . She told me she should have listened to me and just used the kitchen sink w/ the sprayer . At least that does n't break .	-1
I bought this tub because i liked the idea of the shower part and roominess of this tub but unfortunately the shower part is useless , i broke within a couple uses and when it did work it was just not worth the extra money . My suggestion is to buy the tub that looks like this with out the shower part.Good Luck !	-1
I echo all of the problems pointed out by the negative reviews : the shower sprayer has never worked , and the tub is too short with the sprayer unit in place in the tub . I 'd add that the plug leaks , which is more than an inconvenience . Also , the hammock has torn , even though our baby is well within the weight limit . Overall , I 'd say this is one of the most disappointing products we have purchased since the birth of our two month old baby . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I received this as a shower gift and have used it three times so far . The shower portion of it stopped working after the second use . The button needed a lot of pressure to make it work and then it gets stuck . When you release the button , the shower continues to spray . Now it no longer works at all . It 's also difficult to hold the shower head and hold the button down , they could 've had a better design there.The size of the tub is n't great either , but then again my baby was born at 23 '' so I guess a smaller baby would fit better . The sling they give you is n't so great for a newborn either , my little one slid down and rolled side to side and he appeared to be very uncomfortable . So , I bought the BRU teddy bear sponge to put inside the tub and he lays on that much better . The shower idea is great , it just need a lot of improving .	-1
I love the tub and sling but I find the shower attachment to be a huge waste of time . The water does n't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub . The button that you have to press for the shower should be on the side , it would be easier to use . I have found that a little plastic cup works much better to rinse baby off with . That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower .	-1
I really wanted to like and keep this tub , and at first , I did ! I wwas n't sure what all the bad reviews were for . I loved the fact ( and still do ) that it has a spray . That makes bath time so much easier . However , the spray button is the biggest PAIN ! ! ! you have to use your index finger to press it and its actually hard to do so . Why do n't they make it so your thumb presses the button like on a sink ? ? ? Dont know . ALso , it takes SO MANY batteries , it 's ridiculous . You get scared to run the batteries down b/c there are so many to replace and hard to get in and out . PLus , I felt like it was a big production to set the bath up at night . My baby was only 2 months and I already had to move the water tub out of the bigger tub to make room for baby , and my baby 's legs were still cramped . I changed the batteries for the second time and they ran out after ONE use ! Now I know that is the batteries , b/c they were a lesser breand then I usually buy , but it just shows how much battery power that it takes . That is TOO expensive . I finally just gave up onit and purchased the aquarium bath which I really like . They need to improve this tub .	-1
So far this is n't useful to me . I went out and bought a sponge thing for my son to sit on . He is 2 1/2 months old right now and when we first used it he did n't like it because he was n't in the water . You fill the tub up and they still sit out of the water . Also , do not let the hose hang down when getting the water prepared because you will come back to it and find a big wet puddle on your floor . For some reason it leaks out of the spary part . But so far this has n't been useful but the bath does seem like a good idea . So we will see how it works for us in the future .	-1
I registered for this tub when my 10 month old was born because I thought the shower feature would be very handy . Unfortunately , it only worked twice . The spray was soo light that by the time I finally got all of the soap rinsed off , she was screaming taht she was ready to get out . As she got a little taller , around 4 months , there was n't room for the shower attachment AND her legs . The sling was very helpful ( the only reason this tub got 2 stars ) when she was n't able to sit up , but even then , she was n't immersed in the water much . She got cold very quickly . Also , like other reviewers stated , the sling does n't fit in my sink like they suggest . If I had it to do over again , I would purchase a tub with a built in seat . This tub 's blue circle looks like it would prevent slipping , but it is n't all that effective .	-1
The sling is too small for my my 12 weeks old daughter . It 's hard to hold her steady in the tub because it is too slippery . The spray is useless . it 's like it is tangling my fingers when i press to spray , too difficult to hold , should 've made it bigger.i think i will return this item because i ca n't really give her a bath in this tub .	-1
The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea ... but I think they need to redesign the shower handle . It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray . Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down . The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot . I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that does n't work that well . A cup or washcloth will do the trick .	-1
I did not like this this tub . It is very small and the sling is awkward and does not hold the baby securely enough . I never even tried the shower because I switched to another tub which I am very happy with .	-1
I did n't care for this at all . The thing that really turned me off to it was when when it came out of the microwave , it had this plastic smell to it . It does n't hold many bottles , especially since I use the Dr. Browns bottles . Trying to get everything to fit in it is a pain and time consuming & I have to do it in two or more rounds . I prefer to do it the old fashioned way ... boil a pot of water & dunk everything in .	-1
After watching my one-year-old tumble down the entire staircase ( no real injury , thank God ! ) , I 've decided the design flaws in this gate are severe enough to note in an online review.First , I must note that the hardware-mounted gate was open when the fall occurred . But , since she is capable of climbing down the stairs safely , this is not unusual . We retain the gate to block off the upstairs / downstairs when needed , not purely for safety any longer.What happened , though , is that she stood up and pushed against the gate which swung Through its catch , out over the stairway . Unsurprisingly she overbalanced and went with it.This is my analysis of the design flaws:1 ) The mounted catches - little cup-shaped socket dohickeys designed to mate with the rubber-tipped and adjustable pressure extensions on the gate - are designed to be `` sort of '' one way . That is , you mount them such that the lip is a little lower on the side where you want the gate to swing , and a little higher on the side where you do n't . Solution : In my opinion , they should be designed to be far more one-directional , which a much higher lip on the `` no-swing '' side . Any potential benefit of a dual-swing gate is more than offset by the safety problem introduced . I can not think of scenarios in which you 'd want to both hardware mount the thing and really need it to swing both ways anyway.2 ) The exact fit of the gate is adjustable both by macro adjustments to the sliding panels , and micro adjustments to the aforementioned rubber extensions at the top and bottom . These guys are finger-adjusted by a screw-rod , which my eldest had learned how to mess with rather before his first birthday . In other words , they 're frequently out of whack and must be fixed by an adult before the gate will latch at all . When too much slack is allowed , the swing-through problem occurs as described above - but it is n't intensely obvious it will happen , because that narrow little lip on the socket Usually catches the thing . Solution : Redesign adjustment mechanism to be more child-proof . These should n't have to be re-adjusted with any frequency , and again the safety flaw introduced outweighs any reduction in convenience.On top of the two more serious flaws , we did have a lot of trouble with installation when it went up 18 months ago . As others have mentioned , it came with a drilling template that should have made it a snap . And it would have , if it had been more accurate ! I had to drill multiple holes , in other words.Secondly , others have also mentioned that it comes with little spacers to help you work around baseboards . Indeed it does , but for my home ( a 8 or 10 year old tract-built box in the 'burbs ) the spacers were completely inadequate . My baseboards were too wide , and I ended up having to appeal to my father for custom ones made from wood . Frankly , having the top and bottom tension rods at different extensions to compensate for the baseboard width is a real pain - it 's always been a bit crooked and out of true , and usually either top or bottom is maladjusted and will swing through . I 'm not sure what the manufacturer can do about this - houses are different , of course ! - but moving the bottom socket and extension up about 2 inches would be a major help . I do n't think you 'd have to move it nearly high enough to present a fall-under risk - not one that is n't already there by the fact the silly tension rods extend something like 3-4 inches ! So , overall , we 're not looking to replace this gate now that it 's purchased and in place and both kids are walking . But I am almost wishing we 'd spent just a little more on a better model that addresses the above issues . Assuming one exists , of course !	-1
It just would n't fit in our living room because the screws do n't extent out long enough to deal with baseboards . I consider that a serious design flaw . we returned it for that reason . it also did n't strike me as totally sturdy compared to a more expensive Kidco gate that we settled on .	-1
we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . We did n't want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . It clearly said & # 34 ; Can be hardware or pressure mounted & # 34 ; . Yes they are correct if you are NOT planning on using the door function to this gate . If you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . Therefore you need to remount the gate . I 'm not 6 feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if I just climb across.Bottom line , it 's misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .	-1
The picture of this gate makes it seem as if it would be easy to get by it using one hand to open and close it . Not true . We are very disappointed . You ca n't step over it and you ca n't open it with one hand with a baby in your arms . It is only good for an opening that you do n't need to get past easily . But if you put it at the top of your stairs and you 're trying to get down the stairs with a child in one arm and one free arm , it is useless . I do not recommend it and ca n't figure out why it got such good ratings .	-1
My 6 month old is a cranky eater ( we cant feed her fast enough ) so we did n't think much of her crying tonight at supper , though she was crying harder than usual . When we started to remove the lap tray we noticed she had jammed two of her fingers between the tray and the washable insert - they were swollen and I could tell she had lost feeling in them , she also had serious indentations in her fingers that were already turning blue . She was hysterical when I got her out , presumably because the feeling started coming back in her fingers . I felt AWFUL . This happened because the insert only secures to the tray in one spot and she happened to wedge her fingers in right by that spot . If it secured in more than one place , this would n't have happened.I will simply toss the insert to remedy the problem but I do n't want any other Little 's to go through this !	-1
Hi , we bought this chair as our baby 's first but we received a used product which had cleaning starches and marks on it . It 's a plastic product , we could have bought it used from a cheaper price . As our place is distant from UPS and we do n't want to carry it back , we have to keep this BUT this kind of trade is not good ! ! ! SO , beware that you can also receive used product !	-1
I think my biggest issue with this chair is that my baby is very uncomfortable in it . He would scream every time I tried to put him in it . I ended up buying a regular high chair with a padded seat and he has no problem sitting in it ( though he has no problem sitting in hard restaurant high chairs ) . He 's 6 months old now , so perhaps when he 's older he 'll like it more . The only advantages of the fisher price booster seat are that it 's very portable , inexpensive , and might be good for people with do n't have an extra 2 feet of space for a high chair . But it does n't matter how portable or inexpensive it is if your baby hates it .	-1
I know it 's inexpensive , and maybe it passes industrial tests as suitable for kids - but it 's nothing I want my kid sitting in .	-1
I do n't have a whole lot to say about this booster , but wanted to note to other buyers that there is a potential tipping hazard with the seat.We visited with friends for lunch one day and they pulled out this booster and attached it to a folding chair and brought it to the dining room table for us to use . I sat next to my 10 month old daughter the whole time but simply did not react fast enough when she leaned forward and tipped the entire apparatus ( the high chair and the adult folding chair ) forward . Since the chair was facing the dining table , she ended up busting her lip right on the edge of the glass table . The booster with tray can be quite front heavy , so please be sure you only attach it to a very sturdy and preferably wide chair . And insist on it if you 're visiting others ( we are often too polite for our own good ) . My daughter is not a very active or bouncy baby , but she managed to tip it over while leaning forward . There are n't warnings to this effect on the booster seat , but I wanted to make the issue known to other parents to whom it may not have occurred .	-1
I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents . I really liked the features , but did n't like it once i put my son in it . I loved the idea that it folded up , had a carrying strap , could come apart easily to clean , and the different trays . I thought that the back could be a little higher , he still needed some support , and could n't sit straight up . Also he is an average size baby , and when i put him in the seat he had just fit , and the seat looked really small with him in it . I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back .	-1
I took the booster seat out of the box & put the strap over my should & the strap broke loose from the base . Looks like the thread used to seal the strap into the base broke free . I had to redo the strap & secure it.Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box .	-1
I returned this seat due to a defective strap ( one of the straps that attaches the seat to the back of the chair came out of the seat with the slightest tug ) . I also did not like that this seat did not fit our dining table chairs . I was surprised about the defect because we 've been using the Fisher Price Space Saver chair and have been very pleased with it . This booster seat was supposed to be a replacement for the Space Saver , and as a second chair to use on trips ( since it folds , which the Space Saver does not ) . The tray on this seat is very small compared to the Space Saver . In my opinion it is a far poorer product , although to be fair it is significantly cheaper . In any case , I have returned it and am not asking for a replacement . Would rather find something else .	-1
This is the second fisher-price product I have bought on amazon that arrived in bad condition . I am so very disappointed because I was getting everything together for my child 's first solid meal and opened up the box to clean it . Once I took off the plastic wrap I could tell right away this was a used product . its scratched up pretty bad and there is dirt in the scratches . At first I thought it was just minor dirt from the factory but then I turned it upside down and the little feet underneath it are filthy and show clear signs of being worn down . I guess when someone uses it and decides to return it , amazon just repackages it and sends it to another unsuspecting person . I would give zero stars if I could	-1
The seat buckles are on the bottom part of the bum on this one , unlike the red version . Id ont ' like that becuase my son can lean all the way forward . He would n't fall out but it still seems dangerous because he can lean over a lot farther . I have to always keep the tray in to make sure he does n't lean over so much .	-1
This monitor was terrible . Even with the volume turned all the way up we could n't hear our baby- Sometimes he would cry and we would hear him from the other room but the monitor was n't registering it . We exchanged it for a Fisher Price Aquarium Monitor- also terrible , a real waste of money . We now have the Fisher Price 900 mhz and it is THE BEST monitor ! We have a 14 mo . old daughter and a 3 mo . old son- we love this monitor so much that we bought it for both kids . It is so sensitive we can even hear the babies breathing- the reception is crystal clear . Do n't waste your money on this one- buy the Fisher Price 900 mhz .	-1
We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2.4 GHz devices around the house . It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty , when the parent unit broke ( the switch , apparently ) . We could n't return it , and could n't repair it . Stuck with a child unit , and figuring it was just one of those things , we decided to buy a replacement pair , and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement . Gosh , what do you know , the new child unit broke down , and we had only one parent and child unit , and then the second child unit broke down.We did n't drop , wet , or otherwise abuse any of these units , and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T.Whatever the reason for the breakages , and however much the features may appeal , I do n't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable . In fact , I call it awful . Avoid at all costs .	-1
At one time , we were using both a Hands Free gate ( upstairs ) and this prouct ( downstairs ) . Both door openings were equally wide . Both products were equally easy to install . We ended up returning this one , and buying a second Hands Free . Here 's the comparison : Extra Tall Gate:1 ) Comes with extensions ( built into price ) . Do n't be fooled by any of these products - you will ALWAYS need at least one extension.2 ) Self-closing , BUT it is very easy to get the gate out of alignment . When this happens , it wo n't always self-close in one direction.3 ) Although latch is very simple , it DOES require one hand to open it . Picture yourself carrying a 20 lb child in one arm , and a jug of formula in the opther , and consider how you will open the gate.4 ) Because these gates use compression ( instead of drilling into walls ) they have a bar across the bottom . The bar on this gate is thicker , and more of a tripping hazard . Hands-free has a ramp.5 ) The gate misaligns EASILY , even when securely pressed between walls or door openings . This is because when it swings shut , it usually slams . Enough of this and it always knocks the assembly out of alignment . By 'alignment ' I mean all four pads that contact the wall must be in a perfect plane . Misalignment means one of the pads ( usually the top ones ) slipped.6 ) When the gate slams shut , it makes noise . Therefore , you always need to close it gently -- or worse , sometimes leave it 'closed , but not latched ' -- so as to not wake sleeping babies . The danger in this is that other people may think the gate is latched and safe . Mom might have left it unlatched to not wake the baby ; dad later thinks it 's closed and locked because it 's self-closing ... Not good.7 ) Yeah , it 's tall ... Extra-tall even ... In fact , it 's about 4 & quot ; taller than most gates . Are they implying that most gates are unsafe since they are shorter ? Hands-free1 ) You will NEED to buy at least one extension . No one in America has doors narrow enough to fit the gate alone ... A gate + 1 extension equals the price of the Tall Gate.2 ) NOT self-closing . This might sound bad , but if the parents leave the gate wide open when the kids are sleeping , it is obvious to all that it is open.3 ) Bar at bottom has an anti-tripping ramp.4 ) Truly hands-free ! I can carry my twins - opening is extremely simple with your foot.5 ) These just do n't seem to ever get out of alignment . Remember , the gate is never slamming shut , so there is no force to misalign it.The Hands-Free gate just has too many things going for it . Check out the super long list of 5-star reviews . The only 1-star reviews complain about a poorly designed foot pedal for the latch . The models that are being sold now have fixed that problem.While there is nothing truly wrong with this gate ( assuming no one leaves it unlocked ) , the Hands-free is simply much better .	-1
We purchased this gate to replace the First Years Hands-Free Gate when the foot pedal broke after 1.5 years of heavy use , however , we quickly returned it and got another hands-free gate.1 ) The weight of the bars on the extra-tall felt flimsy when compared to the hands-free . It just did n't feel sturdy . My son would pull on it in an attempt to enter the kitchen and you can see the bars give a little.2 ) The self-closing feature sounds like a good idea , but it slams shut making a really loud noise and if you 're trying to direct your child out of the room , you have to make sure you hold it open for them and it does n't slam in their face when they decide to change directions.3 ) The latch on the gate we got was very sticky . It took two hands and quite some force before it would open . Upon investigation , we think the self-closing mechanism at the bottom of the gate caused this problem because it would n't let you lift it high enough to unlatch smoothly . It seemed as if it was in the way and prevented the gate from lifting . This was a problem since we used our gate between the kitchen and the living room so if we needed to rush in between either room , it was very frustrating trying to get the gate open.4 ) This gate did come with extensions so that is a deal if you need them to fit your doorway.In the end issues # 2 and 3 was enough trouble to make us go back and buy the hands-free gate again .	-1
The gate does not swing back , does not close by itself and only the bottom lock works	-1
I thought this one seemed like a great idea - it 's tall , self-closing , not plastic . But the self-closing thing , as it turns out , is more trouble than it 's worth.Annoying : In the morning , for example , when I 'm running upstairs a thousand times to get 'one last thing , ' and baby is downstairs all morning , I do n't want to deal with the gate clanging shut behind me or opening it up when I have arms full of stuff.Noisy : The gate 's hinge is loud - I 'm sure I would apply some WD40 if I were to keep it , but it 's brand new ( and we 're not keeping it ) . Louder still is the sound it makes when I shut the gate . Even if I 'm super careful , there are contact points up top and at the bottom that are metal-on-metal . If those parts had been plastic or somehow padded , it would be a better model.Weak : But it still would n't fit our hallway . We decided to block the hallway next to the top of the stairs instead of the exact top of the stairs - works better for full hands to have a nice landing up there . Although this gate says it can be expanded the full range , the truth is that right in between sizes the gate is either really weak ( the little bolts that screw out are wobbly when the gate is pushed on ) or if we add the other section , the gate is too big .	-1
We purchased this at another store , but I wanted to make sure people knew the issues surrounding this gate . We did a hard install on the bottom step of the stairs . Initially this gate seemed perfect and easy for me to use . I wanted Mini-Me to be able to open this without issue and after a few minutes of showing her and practice she mastered it.Less than two weeks later we were having issues . The gate secures at the bottom and top- and the top clasp does not secure itself even when you try to help it . I wish I had n't purchased this gate .	-1
I returned two of these Summer walk thru gates . ( one was the extra tall but same gate ) . There is very little plastic on these gates but for some odd reason one of them is the hinge at the top ! I can honestly say that this gate was used normally with no abuse . After the first two , I returned to the store but there was little else in my price range and not much selection so - for a third time I purchased the same gate ! And I am sad to tell you the plastic hinge at the top broke again . Summer would have a fantastic product if only this one piece was improved . Very disappointed .	-1
We registered online for this bag because we thought it was stylish . Little did we know that it is really hard to find anything in this bag because of all the little tiny zipper compartments and the main compartment only zips down the side so you have to take everything out of the bag to actually see what you are looking for . It 's really hard to do all of that when you are out with your baby !	-1
I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs . It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle . This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby . It also did n't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about . I 'm 5'4 '' and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and did n't hold still .	-1
I like the size , price and lightweight aspect of the Badger Basket . However , I regret purchasing it because the natural material it is made of has a strong smell that I did n't want my baby to have to sleep with and the gingham bedding fell apart after the FIRST wash and dry . It came out in stringy shreds . I recommend that you do NOT tumble dry the bedding , and possibly you 'll have more success with it . I wish the company would make higher quality bedding .	-1
I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet . I found this product had terrible static . In comparison , the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent .	-1
This monitor is `` staticky '' . I mean if it 's the only one you have then it 's fine because you can still hear your child , but the amount of static is annoying and kind of distracting if you are trying to do work . I would suggest that parents shop around before purchasing an item that is cheaper .	-1
These monitors were priced reasonably , but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality . My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it . If we touch it , the static seems to decrease . I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around , but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing . Many other reviewers say that it may be their area . Where is a monitor that will work in anyone 's area ? ?	-1
I was given this as a baby shower gift . Its reception is HORRIBLE ! All I can hear is static , no matter what channel I use or where I place it in my house ! ! The static is so loud , you can barely hear the baby . Also the on/off switch is impossible to use . I am returning this today to try a different brand !	-1
I received this as a gift and was thrilled that it came with two monitors ( a real plus ) , but can not stand how much noise it makes . It constantly emits static , so that my mom can not even tell if the sound receiver is off or on .	-1
Perhaps it 's because we live in a high traffic area , but we have nothing but static using this monitor . If you walk by the receiver using the cordless or cellphone it completely loses all reception and all you hear is static . The receiver also seems to have trouble around our direct tv boxes.With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference.The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor . I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby 's room . I jumped out of bed and was ready to run into the baby 's room when I heard the guy talking to a girl in what appeared to be a cell phone conversation from who knows where . Talk about almost having a heart attack on the spot ! FP should just stop making this model period .	-1
You can turn up the volume to hear the baby , but you will be listening to a lot of static and wo n't be able to sleep at night . We tried this monitor in 3 different areas of the US , and static everywhere . Very poorly designed . Do not buy it .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR . It is horrible . All you hear is static . So much static that sometimes I do n't even hear my baby . The lights are always going on because of the noise from the static but sometimes the lights do n't work & ofcourse that is when my baby is making noise . I try to sleep with this on my night stand but ca n't because of the static . There are 2 channels . One has static and the other is the worst sound you will ever hear . This monitor makes me crazy listening to static all day & all night . I am going out tomorrow to purchase a new monitor . Do n't waste your money . You get what you pay for !	-1
This is the worst . We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months . Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor . It is n't even in the same league . With the voice activation feature you hear nothing , I repeat nothing , unless the sound registers over a certain decibel . Amazing ! ! It was definitely worth the $ 50 . Just wish we never registered for this product .	-1
This monitor is terrible ! I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay . But , it sucked up 9 volts like you would n't believe . I finally decided to buy another and bought this one . It 's going back tomorrow and I will buy more 9 volts.The static is UNREAL ! We ca n't even hear the baby !	-1
Granted , I know this is a soft mirror and given that ... they can get scratched , dented , and the like ... BUT the quality of this mirror is terrible . I bought one recently to see if I could replace the Fisher Price one I had been using ( the Fisher-Price Deluxe Auto Mirror With Mirror & Lights ... which is a great mirror but sits a bit high so the view out the back window of my Subaru Outback is blocked more than I 'd like ) . At first I thought the Baby In Sight mirror was a decent mirror ( 3 stars-ish ) -- not as secure as the Fisher Price one I have but not bad . However , as soon as my baby managed to sneeze on the thing and I had to clean it ... well , my impression changed completely . Even using a soft cloth ( as directed ) , I managed to scratch the mirror . Before I did any more damage , I grabbed a camera lens cloth to clean the rest of the mirror 's surface . Well , the whole thing ended up scratched -- so bad that it looked cloudy ! I could n't believe it . I mean , how much softer of a cloth are you supposed to use ? ! ! No matter how carefully I tried to be while wiping it the silver mirror surface came off easily . Thankfully , BRU has a great return policy and so I returned it *immediately* for a full refund . My recommendation -- do n't bother with this brand/style ... go with a Fisher Price type as they are much more durable products . ( And believe me , chances are that at some point your baby will sneeze , spit up , or the like in their car seat and the mirror will get it ! )	-1
I bought this wanting to see my son in a rear-facing carseat . First , I could n't properly secure it with either the latch or velcro . Since we have a jeep grand cherokee and he was in the middle of the backseat there was no place to attach it . I finally managed to rig something up though but after just a short time the mirror surface was fogging and unclear . I certainly could n't see him in the tiny rearview mirror attachment .	-1
I registered for this mirror to use in the car while my baby is in a rear facing car seat . It gave me peace of mind to glance back and see that baby is ok . But , in the first week after my son was born , we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected/installed correctly . The police officer did a wonderful job securing our car seat , instructing us on the safest way to bundle baby in the winter , etc . But he was adamant that child view mirrors are a safety hazard . He said that in a severe impact , the mirror could detach and become a projectile object that could hit the baby . Even though the mirror is break resistant , it could still cause injury if it came flying at his head.As for using a mirror to check on the baby while driving , the officer also mentioned that if you think the baby is in distress , the best thing to do is to pull over . If you are looking at the baby in the child view mirror , you are not looking at the road ( his words , not mine ) . He then went on to advise against other things we had in our car , like the sun shade , and a couple of car seat toys ( all can become projectile in an impact ) .So , as a first time mom , I was probably a little paranoid . And I 'm sure he was just doing his job to warn me about possible safety risks . But sure enough , he managed to put the fear of God in me , and I went home and stripped the car of everything that could potentially hurt the baby ( my husband thought I was nuts ) . Now the only thing we have in the backseat with the car seat is a foam squishy toy that hangs off the back seat - safe during an impact.Now we 've been 6 months without a child safe mirror . There are times when I wish I had one . And once I even did pull over to make sure that my son was ok . But , I 've gotten used to NOT having this mirror . So , even though the mirror was a comfort in the 4 days we got to use it , I 'm glad we 're not taking any chances .	-1
I have been using this mirror for about a month and a half . About a week ago -- the mirror started to ( what I thought was ) fog . I touched the mirror and it was n't fog . I am in the process of trying to find the contact information to complain right to the company . I ca n't even see my daughter now because the mirror is coated with something which wo n't come off . I am frequently in stop and go traffic so it is nice to know what she is doing back there . I would n't buy this product again .	-1
This product is one of the biggest wastes of money in baby gear I have purchased ! It does not stay securely in place and is constantly moving so that baby is either out of view or it completely falls back flat . I 've completely stopped using it at this point because I got tired of constantly messing with it . Whoever thought it would be a great idea to secure a mirror over a baby using velcro was n't thinking things through .	-1
Read the directions first ... after taking the protective film off I wiped it with a soft cloth because it already seemed foggy and even that left scratches on it . They are n't visible from the drivers seat but come on , I was following strict instructions of not using water or anything but a soft cloth to AVOID scratches and it still scratched.Do NOT buy this if you have an SUV unless you have a middle seat head rest . We have baby 's car seat in the rear middle seat and once we go over any little bump or slightly uphill/garage/parking lot- it falls backwards into the trunk area . We have 2 older children who sit besides baby so we can not put baby seat near the doors as the children get in and out of the car for school and the fact that the middle seat had a smaller belt width , one child would never be comfortable . I tried putting the mirror on the side headrest and the angle it would have to be at to face the middle requires the tether to be very loose and again pointless because the angle shifts when going over bumps . When I secured the tether tighter on the headrest all I could see was the passenger seat and not baby.If there was a way for it to be secured in the middle I would n't be complaining so much . They need to fix this issue and add another tether or something , anything to make it safe and useable.It gets one star because I can actually see baby just fine before I go over a bump or uphill . That 's about the only good thing .	-1
First of all , you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident ( as the police officer who installed my car seat told me . ) Second of all , When you buy this mirror it comes with a `` protective '' piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror , but when you remove it , you see that the mirror is very foggy . I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth , thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic , but it made it worse . Now the mirror is foggy , scratchy , and totally unuseable.It 's going back to the store today .	-1
Within less than 1 week , the mirror fogged up . I followed the cleaning instructions that accompanied the mirror , but to my dismay , nothing worked . Please , do not buy this product .	-1
I purchased this mirror to keep an eye on my rear-facing 5 month old ... It attatched easily , is very large , and simple ... no flashing lights or remote controlls . My son seemed entrigued with his reflection ( as all babies usually are ) and I was able to keep a close eye on him.Well , we recently purhcased him a convertible carseat ( hes still small enough to fit in the carrier though ) and had it checked out by highway patrol ( we installed the mirror AFTER we checked out the carrier ) . They congratulated us on a good installment , but were soon telling us that many toys/objects in our car are dangerous , and had the patential to break off , or hit someone ( mainly our baby ! ) in the event of a car crash , which , I was sad to say , included the SafeFit Baby in Sight mirror.I went home and removed the mirror , and many of the harder toys , and a few other `` needed '' objects ... and I did feel a bit silly afterwards , but it gave me a peace of mind . The officer who inspected the car had told me this ( I 'm paraphrasing people ) `` Mirrors , toys , and other objects for baby in the car can potentially cause hazard to anyone while in the event of a crash , they could become projectiles and injure your child . Also , when you see in the mirror , you take your eyes off of the road . So I reccomend just pulling over if you fear for your babies health '' I will admit that a few times I DID pull over , and he happened to be fine , just whiney . I found that you will KNOW if theres something wrong with your child , or my 2 and 4.5 year olds will tell me if somethings wrong with the baby . And by the way , your baby can STILL have toys , just completely soft , and harmless ones.I can completely understand if you still want to purchase and/or use a baby mirror like this one , but for the dangers , I would highly reccomend not to .	-1
I bought these on Amazon thinking that they would offer a little faster flow than the medium flow and allow cereal to come throught the nipple for my 4.5 month old . They just seem to be sooooo slow ! The nipple hole itself seems to be big enough , but no luck for us anyway ! : (	-1
I bought this nipple for using with thickened milk but it did n't work . The nipples collasped easily and baby got really frustrated .	-1
My baby hated these nipples . He had to really struggle to get anything to come out of them , and then they gave him bad blisters on his upper lip because he was working so hard . I threw them out after only two or three uses .	-1
This pump is terrible . First of all it is loud . Second of all it is not at all powerful . It will NOT empty your breast . I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk . The more I pumped the less milk I got out . I was losing my milk supply fast ! ! ! ! ! ! I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply . That did n't work this motor is not powerful enough . I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis . I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked . Do n't waste your money on this pump . It looks great but I ca n't say anything else positive about it . I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give . I really give it zero stars . It is very expensive . I suggest renting a hospital grade pump . It is much cheaper & will definately work .	-1
My husband and I bought this because I was co-sleeping and we were both scared of something happening to our son . Unfortunately this product did n't not help us sleep any better . The velcro does n't match up on it and it 's really soft so our son kept rolling over into us . The bottom half of it has no support at all . It 's just a soft peace of material . I would say spend more and get something firm	-1
My baby did not like this . It was a good idea but just did n't work for us . It didnt give my husband and I enough head room on our queen size bed . I could just easily roll receiving blankets & put under my bed sheets to guard the baby from us rolling over on him . This would be great for travel . Baby grows out too fast to fit this . IMO .	-1
I tried this a few times . It does n't have a firm base under the padding , so the surface is n't flat on a mattress for the most part . I cut a piece of MDF to fix that.It 's highly susceptible to tilt - if one of you is much bigger than the other in the bed , it may well tilt to the heavy one , and that means baby will roll to the side.When the baby rolls to the side , DD 's little legs pop right out the unsupportive mesh panels . What 's more , Mommy was worried about the sides near the baby 's head not being appropriately breathable . I think it 's probably fine , but you might side with Mom.Finally , the materials ( e.g . mattress cover ) are poor . Polyester and velcro that tears apart the poly the first time you wash it.Buy a laundry hamper and use that instead .	-1
We bought this because we have a king-size bed , but really no room in our room for a bassinet . It worked okay , and we did use it for about 7 weeks after my daughter 's birth , but I think I 'm getting rid of it . We ended up having to place rolled up receiving blankets on both sides to keep her from slipping down and out of the mesh sides . Neither one of us is large , and we 're about the same size , so she would work her way down and out of either side very regularly before we started using the improvised bolsters . It also seems pretty short for its intended use . My daughter is in the 25th percentile on weight and height , but she was as long as the sleeping area after only 3 or 4 weeks . In fact , when we brought her home from the hospital at only 5.75 lbs , we were both surprised at how well she fit in it . I 'm not sure my son , who was 7 lbs 3 oz at birth , would have ever fit in it.On the plus side , it was easy to take with us when we traveled , and we did n't have to worry about whether there was room in our room for a pack-and-play or something like that . And it was n't very expensive.However , I never really felt comfortable with her in it , and I do n't think she was very comfortable either . In hindsight , I wish we 'd have gone on and made room in our room for an Arm 's Reach co-sleeper or traditional bassinet . I think we 'd have all slept better and been happier in those first weeks .	-1
I purchased this to aid in co sleeping with my baby . I washed it once I received it , and I feel after the wash , though I followed the instructions , it did n't seem to fit together all that well anymore . We tried it in our bed once and it was just way too cumbersome for us to use . We are now using it as a changing table for when we travel .	-1
I purchased this for our newborn so he could sleep on the bed beside me . This sleeper has no support and you really need to have it on something perfectly flat and really firm ( like a piece of plywood ) otherwise it is saggy and twisted . I was also expecting that the sides would be taller and also that it would be wider as it did n't fit our baby for more than 2-3 weeks . Buy a bassinet instead of this silliness .	-1
It 's way too short ! My son outgrew it by the time he was 3 weeks old , and he 's average length . Also , he rolled to one side in it . Big waste of money !	-1
I carefully evaluate product reviews on just about everything I buy ! Against my better judgment , I went ahead and purchased this product despite the negative reviews I read out of desperation to safely co-sleep with my newborn ! This product is NOT a good everyday option for parents who co-sleep on a nightly basis ! It is made for smaller babies as it is not long enough to grow with your baby , and will not be useful for more than a month or so unless your baby is on the smaller side of average.Also , the sheet is a pain to wash ! I had to purchase a lingerie mesh bag in order to wash this , because there Velcro strips on the sheet that will literally stick to everything in the wash ! Also , you can not use regular bassinet type or smaller sheets , as this is the only sheet that will snuggly fit this product.In addition , the mattress pad is VERY noisy and flat . My baby woke up every time he moved due to the noise . Also , it just seems uncomfortable and not very firm like most baby sleep pads or mattresses . I understand that the product is made to be flimsy in order to fold for travel purposes , so just beware if this is a product you are purchasing as an everything thing ! I ultimately kept the item because we travel , and it works for just an overnight stay in a hotel . My baby still does n't sleep the best on it , but it 's better than putting him in the hotel bed with us .	-1
I loved the idea of having our newborn in bed with us , without the risk of rolling over onto her , so purchased this product for co-sleeping . When we first unwrapped the product , it appeared to be a bit warped -- the mattress was squished along one of the sides from what appeared to be a bend or manufacturing defect in the frame ( it did n't look flat like the photo ) . Before realizing it was a defect , we tried using it for a few nights but our baby kept rolling onto her side so we promptly returned it . Aside from the specific issue with ( hopefully only our ) product , the idea of co-sleeping like this is not very practical . Even on a king-sized bed , the sleeper takes up about 1/3 of the space . This does n't seem to be that big of a deal , but once you take your baby out for feeding , you 're left with little room for the two of you on that side of the bed . I ca n't imagine this working at all on anything smaller than a king bed , unless it 's only mom and baby on it . If you have the top of this bed up to the top of your own bed then your baby is often higher than you are , so you have to look up to see them . If you 're really keen to have your baby in bed with you , some suggest getting a bed rail and have the baby sleep between that and the mom , rather than between parents . After returning this product , we purchased a separate co-sleeper bassinet , which worked great .	-1
When cosleeping with an infant , this adds and extra sense of security . The top half of the sleeper is great , formed out of a rigid plastic tray , but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath . Because of this , it tends to cause a downhill slope , and baby slides down.We gave up on using this within a week , and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper.The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling , but it has limited value in an adult bed , or at least it did for us .	-1
I loved this product when I first got it . Of course , with a baby , you are going to have to clean it at some point . When the time came , I followed the care directions for washing the mat cover . Unfortunately , it was ripped to shreds and could not be repaired . I contacted the company about the flaw but never got a response .	-1
I received an envelope with three small disks in it just as another reviewer did . There was nothing else in the envelope just the three disks . I was also surprised how lacking they were , they really do look like the free disks you get from some places . However , the smell is good but I am not sure how they will work in the nursery for our daughters diaper pail since she is not here yet . They are not very strong so I hope they will be able to mask the odor from her diapers . I am glad they were so inexpensive so I do n't really feel like I wasted much money if they do n't work .	-1
This disc works great for about 2 weeks . Then it mixes with the smell of urine and causes the diapers to have this rotten/rancid orange smell . I would suggest not bothering with these and just using a bit of tea tree oil in your pail .	-1
I know these are cheap , but they did n't help with the horrible diaper odor . I would not recommend spending your money on these items . When I opened up our diaper pal there was still a bad smell .	-1
Wish I had not purchased these . They look very old and definitely do not smell like citrus . What a cheap product ... do n't waste your money on these . Buy the carbon odor absorbers instead !	-1
These deodorizers do nothing to stop the diaper pail smell in the bedroom . I have found that it works better to wash the diaper pail with Lysol and then spray the whole thing on the inside with Febreze .	-1
I guess I was expecting more than just the disks ! There was no packaging or anything , just three tiny disks in the envelope ! They looked like the free things you get from the car wash . I was expecting a better quality product . The smell is as expected and I know these things were cheap - but they are just surprisingly lacking !	-1
Puchased nine months ago to use for my cloth diaper wipes . Bought a set of bumgenius wipes at the same time and the bumgenius ones have held up much better . The edging has come loose on several of the OsoCozy wipes , and I will need to replace some soon as they fray away . Pay the few extra bucks and get the bumgenius flannel wipes , they are better quality .	-1
I 'm giving these wipes 2 stars only because if you 'd like to use them dry , they 're very soft and a great price . I use them as baby wipes as my son is allergic to any other prepackaged baby wipes with the exception of the Earth 's Best . Those are expensive so , I only use them when out of the house and I use wash cloths at home . At first glance , I LOVED these wipes as they SEEM super soft . After wetting them , they change IMMENSELY . They get even worse after being washed . I had to stop using them every day as they were rubbing my son 's little bottom raw . In addition to all of that , after only 4 washes about half of them are falling apart . So , if you 're desperate for some filler wipes then go ahead although , I would n't suggest them for every day use on baby skin .	-1
I like the flannel wipes that are not too thick for diaper wipes . These were great at first , but after a couple of months I noticed the colored thread around the edging was starting to unravel . I was willing to overlook this , though . Recently I 'm seeing that they 're starting to tear on the edges and the fabric is thinning significantly . The bumgenius wipes we have been using for just as long ( 10 months ) are holding up so much better . I know what I 'll be replacing these with .	-1
We have been using these and another brand of wipes for the past ten months . I bought two brands to compare , since this was my first time using cloth diapers and wipes . These do get the mess off , but are very thin and feel rough . I do not prefer them . They also seem to pill more compared to the others I purchased . Would not buy again .	-1
I rarely use these . I usually wait until I HAVE to to pull one out . They are too thin , I always end up using two . Bett	-1
Pros : Save moneyRoughly the same size and thickness of typical disposable wipesCons : Threading is already coming offMaterial is already pilling and feels rough ( baby was born in May , it 's been 2 months ) I wish I did n't buy it . Feels like a waste of money .	-1
These wipes were soft at first but then became very rough after washing a few times . I did n't notice any frayed edges as some people stated but they were extremely thin and disappointing . I have had a more difficult time removing stains than with other wipes I 've tried that never stain . I agree with another reviewer who compared them to wet paper towels . I still use them on occasion but find if I use them for every diaper change my baby 's skin becomes irritated . I was surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews these wipes received as Amazon reviews rarely let me down . But , I feel there are much MUCH better wipes out there !	-1
These wipes are nice and soft , however after 5 or 6 washes they start to leave a lot of lint on my baby 's bottom ! Not very happy with that ! It took about 2 months of 2x week washings to get all the lint out . I like my two-sided BabyKicks better .	-1
I love osocozy ! I use their prefectfit prefolds ! Thought I would live these ! Nope ! They are very thin ! & after a couple washes the fabric starts to ball up ! Would n't purchase again !	-1
I wish they were thicker . I still use them but will not be buying a second pack . I do like that they are soft but not very absorbent and often need a second wipe to finish the job .	-1
I have and love the OsoCozy pre fold diapers , but these were disappointing . They work fine , but the lovely rainbow edging came unravelled on several of the wipes on the FIRST WASH . The flannel is also a bit too slippery to catch poop , so I 'm investing in the textured grovia wipes , as well . For pee or face wipes , though , these are gentle , soft , and work great . They 've withstood quite a bit of heavy washing and high heat drying . Just do n't get them for the rainbow edging .	-1
I ordered these solely because of the price , and the flannel its made of . I have made many wipes of my own out of flannel . But with this baby I simply did not have time too . So I decided at this price I ca n't go wrong . But I do not like these . I do not know what grade flannel they made these from , but it ca n't be a high grade . They got rough and all pilled up in about 3 washings . I would rather have less wipes and high quality ones . Wipes is not something that makes cloth diapering pleasurable if they are cheap , low quality . I do not recommend these.I do however love the OsoCozy company . I love LOVE the betterfit prefold diapers .	-1
while these are thin , the cloth folds on itself and creates 'sharp ' edges . The cloth is not soft enough to manuver easily around baby 's bottom . Also they are on the rough side , which might be good for a sticky poo , but they are not absorbant either and just smear the poo . If you are looking for a nice wipe , go for the Prince Lionhart Wipes .	-1
I am a mother of 8 and thought I would try out cloth wipes since I use cloth diapers and these are horrible , they leave the baby 's skin red from one rub and I have tried everything short of using fabric softener , which you can not use on cloth anything , please spend the money and get a better wipe .	-1
I am going to compare this to 2 other options : Baby Kicks Baby Wipes and Gerber Baby Wash Cloths.I had recently started cloth diapering and received both the Babykicks and the Osocozy wipes as gifts . The Osocozy are so thin in comparison . They feel flimsy and if you are dealing with a poopy diaper they do nothing to help `` grab '' what 's there . In comparison , the BabyKicks are thicker and sturdier and allow me to easily take care of messy diapers even though they are just as soft as the Osocozy wipes . I also picked up a pack of regular Gerber baby wash cloths and found them to be superior to the Osocozy as well ! They are not as soft as the Baby Kicks , but they are certainly just as good at `` grabbing '' the poop off my little ones rear.UPDATE : I finally figured out why Osocozy wipes are a hit . My product review was based on my experience with my 1 year old . Now that I have a newborn , I am totally a fan of these Osocozy wipes . They are all that 's needed to clean a little one 's bum when they are n't eating any solids and are still just having breastmilk . The Babykicks and Gerber washcloths are a bit overkill for a newborn ; too much bulk gets in the way when you are on diaper change duty . This is not the case with Osocozy wipes . They are just the right size and perfectly adequate for any newborn diaper change .	-1
Yes i read the directions . Yes i followed them . And No this didnt work . It came off the first time my 9 month old ( at the time ) took his first nap . Pulled it right off . My son is no Hercules . Wish it would have worked . Great concept .	-1
Peeled right off even though we followed the instructions to the letter . Disappointed but at least it did n't damage the crib coming off .	-1
Since my little guy is now standing and constantly chewing on his crib rail , this seemed like agreat product and I actually had people recommend it . When it came in , I followed ALL the instructions to the T. I let it sit for the recommended time before leaving my son in his crib because I knew he 'd go straight for it . Well , before the I had even put him in the crib , the gummi was popping up in places . I used heat to try to get it to stick ( as suggested ) . My son wasn'tin his crib for 5 minutes and the thing popped up , enticing him to pull it up even more . When I checked on him he had the `` sticky '' part in his mouth . It 's been a few days and no matter what it will not stick like it'ssupposed to , despite following ALL instructions . Very disappointed and complete waste of money . It really would be a great product if it stuck !	-1
You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail , becuase this thing does n't stick . Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking , I figured that they could n't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying . I was wrong . These do n't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice .	-1
Used this on our crib ; lasted MAYBE 2 months . It yellowed , pulled off , and stripped the paint off the crib too . DO NOT waste your time or money with this product .	-1
My son ripped this off within 5 minutes . It 's interesting because obviously the adhesive is not great but at the same time some of the finish on our crib came off with it ! Pretty disappointed .	-1
This is a terrible product . It does not stick- it failed within 24 hours ! I had hoped we would n't have some of the problems with sticking that others commented on , but we did . Do . Not . Buy .	-1
We very carefully followed all the directions for these after reading all the reviews . They have been on our convertible crib for about 5-6 months now and they are peeling off and really do n't look nice , even where they are not peeling off . Next baby will have something different . I think maybe a cloth option would be better . They DO protect the crib where they are on though .	-1
I bought these rails in spite of the fact that they had bad reviews . Lesson learned . I diligently cleaned the crib rails with rubbing alcohol before I applied the rails . I applied them and let them cure overnight . The next morning , the edges were already peeling up . That afternoon , when I went in to get my little guy out of the crib after his nap , I noticed the edges were now completely detached . This product does not work as advertised and is a total waste of money .	-1
The idea of this is really good . It comes in a roll , so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is . I used it on one of the short sides and the front , which is where my baby stared to chew . I used the adhesive like the directions stated , and let it set before I let my baby near it . He used it for about a week before it was off completely . Maybe it 's not typical , but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail . So finally I took the rest of it off , and with it came the paint off the crib . Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it .	-1
When I put these on I was actually really impressed with them -- they were pretty mesh with the crib sides , and did n't stick out badly on a quick glance and make the crib look horrible . However , they were on the crib for 1 week before my 9 month old get them off . Problem ? The edge of the gummi rail goes down on the inside of the crib rail JUST enough to sit perfectly where bottom teeth land when chewing . He popped them right off then just chewed on the silicone .	-1
It came off the crib within a week , I applied it according to the directions . I would n't purchase this again , However seller was great to deal with !	-1
product did n't stick to the crib , making it useless . I would not suggest getting this product at all ! I ended up getting a fabric crib rail guard and its been working out much better .	-1
Do n't waste your money on this product . I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib , and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails . It did n't even stay on for a day . Money down the drain , since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover .	-1
After I received this item , I read the box and it said something about how they can not guarantee the item wo n't damage your crib finish . I paid a lot for our crib and it 's one that will turn into a full size bed some day so I did n't want to risk ruining it . I would like this product if they could figure out an adhesive that wo n't ruin the finish . Plus , it 's HUGE . Unless you want it to overhang the edge of the crib a lot , you should go with the regular sized one .	-1
This crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib . It stuck on well enough , and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too , but the plastic has a sticky feel to it ( even the upright side that is n't supposed to stick to anything ) . I noticed when putting the baby in the crib , her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it . I ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine . I 'd recommend the cloth tie-on rail guards over this one .	-1
We bought this several times at a baby store and had to toss them all out . It did n't stick and would pop up in spots after a while , even though we followed the directions each time ...	-1
The product works well , in theory . Locked the food in place with no problem . Easy to grip . But the mesh is super thick and large . My little girl , who loves food and puts everything in her mouth , did n't want to put this in her mouth . She tried it , made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again . I introduced at 6 months , and then every few weeks after that . I 've since given up.I do n't blame her . I tried to eat an apple slice through it . I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross . Very unappetizing.Maybe if they had a thinner mesh ? ?	-1
Awful product . I would not recommend it to anyone . It 's not only poorly designed ( too many parts , too many little crevices that food can get trapped in that make it a pain in the you know what to clean ) but it 's also poorly constructed -- the mesh bag is not completely finished on the inside . It has a raw edge which helps the fabric unravel fast , posing a danger to your baby if you are not careful with it as another reviewer wrote earlier .	-1
This is only my 2nd Amazon review , EVER , and I shop enough to get the Prime . But with this product I HAD to review it ... . I struggled with the ANNOYING childproof lock that makes it virtually impossible to take it apart and it hurts to open it . I have to soak it EVERY time to get the food out so I can open it , but I would deal with it . But that is NOT why I am writing . I just discovered that this product will fit perfectly over his mouth and nose , like a match made in heaven . Which is pretty bad because it could easily suffocate him . These lids are going in the trash . I will continue to use them WITHOUT the lids ( lest someone else let him play with them . However , given the hassle that it is to open it I think we may just go with the Munchkin ones . Very upset about this .	-1
This thing is HUGE ... ..My daughter has a hard time with it . I gave it to her a few times , and gave up ... .Went to donation ... .What a waste of money . One thing its also heavy with the litte cold pack that is built into the handle . Another thing that kind of ticked me off is the picture has 2 of them on it , but you onlu get one ... .I know it 's my fault for not paying attention , but still a little deceiving if you ask me ... ..	-1
I 'm an exclusive pumper , so in addition to bottles and nipples , I also have lots of pump parts to deal with . This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems ! Sadly , my dreams of an organized countertop , with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels , were not to be . I brought this home , popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using , and took it out , eager to assemble it . Unfortunately , not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken.I immediately took the item back to the store . Very disappointing ( and my kitchen is still a mess , too ) .	-1
Only holds a few bottles at a time . Gets the counter soaking wet because it leaks . Definently did n't work for me , sent it back the next day .	-1
We used avent , Playtex Ventaire adn Dr. Brown 's with our daughter . This rack did n't work with any of them ! The Ventaires did n't fit well on dryer adn would wiggle all around and fall off if it was jiggled in the least . It did hold all of the Ventaire part well which that would be the only plus for this item.The wide neck bottles fit better in the dryer but still did n't fit well . But then the collars and nipples were really too big to work with this rack . The Dr. Brown 's were even worse becasue of the inside pieces.We never really were able to get stable enough to use in the folded position and we were never able to get anyting to hang on the hooks without falling either . We also had to buy 4 of these toeven find one that was n't broken when we took it out of the box . The first two were broken and the basket would n't hook on and the third one was broken and could not bend in the middle . This rack leaves alot to be desired to say the least .	-1
This product is definitely not a neccessity . The wipes stay warm once unplugged for about an hour only , and it 's way too big for a travel case . There is also a too-long cord that hangs off of the case , it 's really annoying . It would have made more sense to have it unplug directly from the case .	-1
Takes too long to heat up the wipes , and then they lose all their heat as soon as you pull them out of the container , before I can even get them right over to my baby . Waste of money .	-1
This and the ultimate wipes warmer where two of the things that I purchased right away because I had read all of the reviews and everyone said they were `` lifesavers '' . Well , out of all of the items I have purchased these two were the BIGGEST waste of money and are more of an inconvenience than anything . This warmer needs to be plugged in to stay warm and when unplugged does not stay warm for long . If using these items make sure you always have a warm wipe because your little one gets use to the warm wipes which is not always so convenient when your on the go or traveling . My advice is save your money and buy something your baby REALLY needs .	-1
As a new mother , I wanted to get everything that would make the baby comfortable . As the months go by , I realized that there are some things I could have done without ... this is one of the things . Quite frankly , I think it drys out the wipes , and only warms the first two on top .	-1
I bought this to warm bottles that were currently being kept cool with ice packs . In that case , the thing did not work . It got warm enough to knock the chill off the milk , but did n't come close to making the bottle warm enough that my son would actually drink it . However , I switched my approach so now , if I know I 'll be giving the bottle in an hour or less , I 'll heat the bottle at home and put the already warm bottle in this bottle warmer to KEEP the bottle warm . In that case , the thing works like a charm . I do the same thing to keep baby food warm . It really does stink if you 're trying to heat something that 's cold . I imagine that if the bottle started out room temp , it might get fairly warm . And if the bottle or food starts out warm , this will keep it warm . For that last reason , I love this thing . I use it at least weekly . But for an actually warmer ... to make something warmER , it stinks .	-1
We go to a lot of outside events ( car shows ) where a bottle ca n't be warmed so easily . I bought this bottle warmer after reading the ratings and thought that I could prevent the metal disc from activating itself . The first time I used this warmer I was very careful how I placed it in my diaper bag and I was also very careful not to bump my diaper bag . When I went to use it , I was very surprised to see that it activated itself . I did give this bottle warmer a chance ... ... ... I tried it about 6 times and it only worked one time . Needless to say , I returned it to Babies R Us . If you do decide to go against this rating , please keep your receipt . I think you would have to put this warmer in a steel case before placing it in your diaper bag in order for it not to activate itself ! It would be a great invention if it would n't activate itself ! I also would n't mind boiling the bag if the product would work .	-1
I own one of these things and have used it once . To be perfectly honest , it is rather a pain . Yeah , it 's cool that it heats up and all , but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks . It is also not very lightweight . I do n't know about you , but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag , the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down . I have found that keeping a clean bottle , a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula ( save your scoops ) work the best for feedings on the road . And if you are at a resturant , it is far easier to just ask for some warm water . Then you do n't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing . I would n't buy it again .	-1
I bought this so that I could warm bottles for the baby and because it came recommended from another mom . I like it at first , sure it was a pain to have to boil after each use to reset the heating mechanism but for the convenience , I did n't think it was too bad . I 've had it for a few months now and I really dislike it and am going to return it if I can.Problem # 1 -- You need to plan to use it because it will take up to 20 min to warm a bottle fresh from the fridge and a little less if it 's at room temp . If you baby likes a warmer bottle , then it can take longer . So , if you baby is n't on a really predictable schedule , this is n't the warmer for you.Problem # 2 -- I packed it in the diaper bag and then went to go use it only to find out it had been activated . The activation disk is very sensitive to being bumped or rubbed and will activate the heating crystals easily . So I was scrambling to find away to heat the bottle at the mall with a screaming/hungry baby . I ended up having to find a place to breastfeed which is n't easy if you have a baby that is a messy/distractable nurser , there is not a private enough place for these kiddos ! Problem # 2 -- It 's heavy . It will definitely add weight to your diaper bag that is noticeable and it 's not petite in size.Problem # 3 -- the annoying problem of boiling it after each use takes on a whole different level of annoying when you have to spend 20 min boiling it when you have n't even used it because it was activated by accident ... .stupid sensitive activation disk ! Problem # 4 -- Not a big deal , but if you have older children this becomes a cool toy . They get amazed to see liquid turning to crystal and getting hot ... this is just as annoying as it getting accidentally activated ! So for the amount of times I have actually used the item ( twice ) v. the times I 've had to boil this item to use it ( at least 10 ! ) I would n't buy this or recommend it to anyone .	-1
Very useful if you can transport it without `` clicking '' the disc that activates the warming solution , and if you do it is useless if you are somewhere without a stove and a pot of boiling water . But it does warm bottles really well , just have to learn to be extra careful with it .	-1
1 . Too heavy to lug around in diaper bag.2 . Too big to fit in average size diaper bag.3 . Gets activated with the slightest bump - not good if baby is not ready for a bottle ! 4 . One time use then you have to pull out a pot and boil the thing , then lay it to cool.I would n't have bought this product if I had known what a pain it would be .	-1
I was attracted to the idea of having a bottle warmer that does n't require electricity or a car adapter . But , while traveling , you do n't always have the ability to boil the product . And then , it takes a LONG time to heat up the bottle . Babies often ca n't wait that long . My newest technique is simply to use tap water already at my baby 's favorite temperature and put it in a thermos . The thermos keeps the same temperature for several hours ( or I make the water really hot if I think that I wo n't be using it until later in the day ) . Obviously , not helpful for those using pumped breastmilk , but much less hassle for those using formula .	-1
I thought I was buying a different `` L shaped '' TV guard , not some tiny rectangle of plexiglass . This is completely worthless to us . Save your money and go to Walmart and buy 2 of those clear 8 x 10 photo frames for 2 for $ 5 . That 's what we did in the end to protect our components ( DVD player and receiver ) . We already set our LCD tv up higher out of reach , but the components were the problem .	-1
I BOUGHT THIS FOR TEN DOLLARS AND WHEN I INSTALLED IT , I REALIZED THAT IF I JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC PICTURE FRAMES THAT STAND ON THEIR OWN , IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING . I BOUGHT A PANORAMIC SIZE FRAME AND RESTED THE STANDING PART UNDER MY TV AND NOW IT 'S BLOCKED ! ! ! THE FRAME WAS ONLY TWO DOLLARS AND IS MORE STURDIER THAN THIS FLIMSY PIECE OF PLASTIC !	-1
The lids are so hard to screw on straight . You think they are on tight , then when you hold them up at eye level you will often find that they are on crooked . Also when you twist the lid open or closed , it is hard to get a good grip because the gripping area is very thin.They are expensive too , a total waste of money . Who wants a disposable system where you have to keep ( and wash ) the lids ?	-1
It 's too bad I did n't know how impossible it would be to get the lids off before I had stored a week 's worth of milk on these . Neither my husband or I could get the tops off ... even using screwdrivers and various other tools to try to pry them off . The only one that came open was the one that dropped on the tile floor as I pulled it out of the freezer , of course , it only came open because the container cracked and the milk cube went flying across the kitchen floor ... our dog loved his treat !	-1
I did n't like these for a few reasons . They take up too much room in my freezer . They take too long to thaw . I do n't care for the avent isis pump . I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker .	-1
They are flimsy , crack , break , and the lid does n't screw on tight enough , so they leak . I tossed them out and started using baggies to store my milk .	-1
This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on.They tack nice and do n't take up too much room.Fit right onto the Avent pump.Store nice and works well for freezing.Great stackability.Easy to write on in pencil and erase ( to know which batch comes first ) .HateThey were hard to screw on ( the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked ) .Leaked too much milk ( and as any BFing mother knows ... losing milk is well like losing money ) .	-1
This trainer cups do not work very well . I love Avent products but these sippy cups require a lot of suction . My 8 month old can not get anything out . I could barely get anything out when I tried . I tried taking the plastic disc off on the inside but then the fluid just dumps out . I just bought a step 1 Nubby sippy cup and that is working much better .	-1
These Avent sippy cups were fantastic ... until our toddler realized she could poke the nipple part down into the rest of the cup and break the seal , spilling all the water everywhere . I bought these awhile ago , but I 'm upset about the bad design and am going to try to return them for my money back .	-1
The description and pictures for this product do not match the item I received . I bought these wanting the item showed and described -- the cups with the white soft spout that come with the valve . I was sent the newer style with the silicone spout , with the flip top lid . That is definitely not what I was wanting and I returned them.I do love the avent magic cup , it 's great . But this is n't it .	-1
The product description says that it is 7 oz cup , but I received two 5 oz trainer cups . However , I did not return it and keeping it as the product is good otherwise .	-1
These work well enough as sippy cups and it is nice that the parts are interchangeable from bottle to sippy . However you do n't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups . The real problem is that there are too many parts . Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced . There is the bottle itself , handles , screw cap , mouth piece , valve , and finally the cap .	-1
unless your child drinks their cups laying down , which is highly not recommended , this cup is useless and frustrating . i tried for 6 months to make them work and they just do n't .	-1
The venting mechanism designed to relieve the negative pressure makes it impossible to draw any liquid out unless the cup is tipped back far enough so that the liquid inside completely covers the underside of the lid . So it works fine if the cup is really full . If anything less than 50 % full , baby needs to tilt his head waaaaaay back , or else he will just suck air . Returned the product .	-1
The cup comes with a rubber valve ( which is the `` spill proof '' mechanism ) . When the valve is on the cup , there 's no way to suck the water out , which defeats the purpose of drinking anything from it . If you take the valve out , then the cup is not spill proof . My baby just turns it over and the water comes gushing out . This things is useless . We ended up buying another cup at Walmart that works wonderfully ( totally spill proof no matter what my baby does and easy to suck as well ) , I just do n't know the brand of it becuase it 's not on the cup itself .	-1
This does n't work for Swing model either . I box says it works for all models except TWO ... it does n't mention that it does n't work for the swing model , but it does n't . LUckily , I only needed the valve and membrane and was able to use part of the item ( just paid too much )	-1
This valve did not work on my medela breast pump ( i have the dual pump ) . i did n't return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump . do n't buy here . just go to a brick and mortar store ( like target ) to purchase . it 's not amazon 's fault ... it 's the supplier 's issue .	-1
We have had the original Co-Sleeper for 2.5 years . Our first son slept in it for 2 months and then refused to sleep in it . Our second refused to sleep in it period ( even padding it with a small quilt ) . I assume that they make it completely uncomfortable to help prevent SIDS ( your baby might has well be laying on the floor because it is not padded very well at all ) . The fitted sheet can not be dried in the dryer , which is inconvenient . Most of all , I hate assembling and disassembling this thing . I never complain about assembling toys , gadgets , playards , etc ... but this thing is horrible . I actually beat it with a hammer when I took it down after my first child quit using it . It is now put away and I will never put it up again . The only good thing I will say about it is that it 's extremely sturdy ( probably why it 's a pain to assemble ) . I would suggest scouting ebay , yard sales , and second-hand stores instead of buying a new one . It is not worth $ 200 .	-1
The design of this cosleeper is ideal for anybody who wants to cosleep and is afraid of crushing the child , does not have room in the bed , or wants a system that will make it easy to `` wean '' the kid off the bed in small steps.The problem is the implementation is so cheap and shoddy , it is not worth it.The structure is rickety at best -- and this without using those wobbly leg extensions other people have complained about . The cosleeper is too low for my bed as well , so I have to break my back and arms to get the kid out at night . I wo n't risk making the cosleeper even MORE rickety by using those cheap plastic extensions.What is with the metal bars ? the metal bar on the side that you can collapse is low enough that the kid can eventually bang his head on it -- and it is barely covered with the thin fabric with which you cover the entire structure to keep it together.The mattress IS very hard , as other people commented . My problem with it is not that it is so hard but that its waterproof cover is so unpleasant and squeaky even with the sheet on that my child hates being on it . Can not blame him . I have put more than one sheet on the mattress so it does not make that nasty plastic sound or has that plastic feel.And yes , the ridiculous sheet that comes with it ! It is so scratchy you could sand your house with it . But that is not the worst -- it does shrink so badly when you wash it that it wo n't fit on the mattress -- it will squish the mattress both at the head and the foot of the bed leaving gaps of over one inch at each end . THis is ridiculous and unsafe and so easy to fix.All in all , it is clear that this brand , in spite of charging a hefty amount for Ikea quality stuff ( bunch of metal poles and fabric with velcro , is all you 're buying ) does not hesitate to save an extra cent by giving you scratcy shrinky sheets that will make the crib unsafe for your child.As I said , great idea , terrible implementation . Get something else if you find it .	-1
We bought this to take on vacation but did n't realize that it should n't be used once your infant can crawl out of it . It 's also pretty rickety with the extra feet to bring it up to the level of the bed at the hotel , and one of the sides fell down when our son pulled himself up on it.We ended up bed sharing with this sidecarred to the bed `` just in case '' our son rolled , but there was no way he 'd stay in it.Personally , I do n't see how this is better than having a pack n'play next to the bed in bassinet position . Once your babe can crawl , you are supposed to lower to playyard level anyway !	-1
After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions , we 've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months ( not attached to the bed , as some people do ) . My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine . However , we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently . What a nightmare to collapse ! Again , the directions are of absolutely no help . It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up . Also , this thing weighs a ton . I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling . How annoying . Bottom line : if you 're going to set this up and never take it down , it 's fine ( once you initially get it put together , that is ) . However , if you think you 'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home , forget it !	-1
Although I love the idea , there 's got to be a better way to co sleep . When I unpacked the co-sleeper I was really excited because our daughter sleeps in our bed right now and the idea of having her so close but not in our bed was a wonderful thought . Once the co-sleeper was put together next to the bed I had my doubts , it was huge ! I tried this a couple nights but It just was n't worth it . It was difficult to get her in/out at night , laying next to her and reaching over the divider was awkward , I no longer had a staging area for the night time feeding on my night stand ( bottles , pacifier ... there is a pocket on the end but it was n't sufficient ) and then scooting down to the end of the bed to get out was ridiculous.I had a c section with my daughter which was the main reason we started co sleeping , I had to roll out of bed because my stomach was n't ready to lift me up and out of bed . There is no way I would 've been able to use this in the beginning after a c section . Even now , my daughter is 3mo 's old and getting in/out of bed with this thing is too awkward . The only way this would functionally work is if I slept in a twin or double bed by myself so I could get out on the other side.The co-sleeper is really well made and a fantastic idea but it totally did not work for us . It is a great sleeper to have in the room with you but its still large . I would have loved the smaller size co-sleeper but the weight limits on that one were too low to justify the price . Oh well ... Some people love it , some people don't.My suggestion before buying one is to put a standard playard next to your bed a couple nights , to get the feel of the size , then you 'll know if you can deal with it .	-1
I am an avid Dr Sears fan , I bought the arm 's reach original before my baby was born . Little did I know that I never find use for it as a co-sleeper . My baby refused to sleep on this for 3 months , think it is way too big for a new born and the mattress `` pad '' that comes with it must be really uncomfortable to sleep on . We ended up sleeping side ways on our bed and had baby in bed with us . While the arms reach laid empty for by our bed for 3 months . Not safe and believe only baby slept.Right before I went back to work I finally bought the Mamadoo playard topper and got him to sleep in it . So he did use this for almost a year but mostly in the playard position . In the end , I still have to buy him a crib . So why pay so much money for this ? ? If I can do it all over again , I 'd get something like the Fisher Price Rock N Play sleeper for new born stage , a good crib when baby is bigger and a pack n play for a portable sleeper .	-1
We got this and a chicco play yard and my son does not like this as much as the chicco . The chicco appears to be softer to sleep on .	-1
I bought this to put under the car seat in my new car . I had hoped it would help alleviate dents in the seat , as indicated on the product package . It did not . The car seat was in place for about 3 weeks and has left indents in the seat in spite of the protector . It is also not really large enough to catch spills . I use a Diono Radian , so the seat is about as narrow as you can get . Only a couple of inches stick out on either side . I also find the mesh pocket useless . The kid can not reach it . And anything I might store in it , such as tissues , would get soggy and gross from dirty shoes . I am sure this is true of any protector , but installation can be tricky . It takes time and patience to get the car seat installed snuggly while keeping this protector in place . I usually have a good experience with Munchkin products , but I would not recommend this . I do n't know if it 's a case of & # 34 ; you get what you pay for & # 34 ; , but it definitely did not do the job stated on the box .	-1
Whatever dye is being used on these protectors ends up rubbing off on the upholstery . Your seat may be protected from wrinkles and creases but they 'll end up discolored if you have a lighter color interior .	-1
This monitor is awful . All I hear is static . The threshold for hearing baby is quite high ( meaning he has to make a lot of noise before I hear him ) . With my old monitor , I could hear every sound without static , but it was unreliable , while this one is quite reliable so far . It does n't switch channels or beep incessantly like my old monitor . But for it 's primary purpose , to pick up and transmit sound , it fails miserably .	-1
My wife and I were looking for a monitor at the store Thursday night and this seemed like a reasonable buy . I guess at the price it is . But the static is so bad it is going back on Saturday . We may have to pay twice the price for something that sounds better ... but we will . It 's my fault for not checking the reviews on Amazon first .	-1
My baby loves , loves , loves this swing . We love it because it swings two ways . If he gets fussy swinging one way , we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now , the reason for the two stars : the motor went out ... Twice ! We purchased the first swing in December 06 . In February the motor went out and we had to get another one . Then just today , April 25 , 07 the motor conked out AGAIN ! We do n't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him . All he ever does is swing . I do n't think we got a lemon ... . TWICE ! I think it 's a flaw in the motor.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy . It does n't feel sturdy but it is . It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing . We 've never had any problems with it breaking down . We only have motor issues.At $ 159 the motor should not go out . I 'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways , do that . That 's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it .	-1
If I could give it 0 stars I would . I was really excited about getting this swing for my baby shower . My husband set it up and it was adorable . We put our son in it for all of 10 seconds , took him out , packed it back up and returned it . The speed of the swing is absurd . The lowest setting was almost catapulting my newborn out of it . I thought maybe the speeds were backward , so I put it on the last speed , and it was insanely fast . When we returned it , my husband told the cashier at babies r us that Six Flags should buy the rights to this swing , and that it tried to kill our son . He was a little dramatic , but this swing in my opinion is very dangerous and I would n't recommed it to anyone . If you do buy it , good luck and I hope you have better luck than we did .	-1
**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS REVIEW IS FROM 2005 ( SEE DATE WRITTEN ) ... I am a HUGE fan of Fisher Price products and think this was just a bad batch of motors . I am adding this info to my review in Jan of 2011 so parents do n't read it and freak out thinking the problem still exists ( although I do not know ) . I would delete the review since it is an old problem , but I want to leave it for parents to read and keep in mind crazy unthinkable things can happen and to always be looking for them ... when something does n't seem right , investigate immediately ! Children are precious , it only takes one mistake/accident to change our lives forever . Original review follows ... When we first got this swing for our big baby boy ( 3 months and 16 pounds already ! ! ) , I loved it . He had room to squirm around and he could swing in 2 different ways . It was n't until I started putting him into it in the middle of the night that I noticed there is a MAJOR problem with this swing . When the room is slightly dark and I turn the motor on after sitting for awhile , the plastic behind the dial would glow . I was confused because there are no lights on this swing . It would only glow for a mili-second . As time went on , the glow would last longer and longer . Then I smelled something funny . The glow is the motor sparking ! ! It smells awful like the plastic is melting inside . I have spoken with other owners and they have had the same problem . Fisher Price does n't want to admit there is a problem with the swing and only offers a small gift certificate for your problems ( $ 25 ) , which is n't even CLOSE to the purchase price ( at that time was $ 125 ) . Something needs to be done about this before some innocent sweet child gets hurt . I often hang blankets over the swing , thank goodness nothing has happened so far . If anybody else out there has had the same problem , PLEASE contact Fisher Price about it and complain . I plan on getting with the Better Business Bureau to find out what more I can do since this is not a rare incident .	-1
I was very very disappointed in this product . From the reviews , I expected a very nice piece , but the actual toy box was very poorly made . I ordered the pink and white polka dot , and the fabric was a really cheap furry fabric that looked absolutely awful . You would have to use your hand to make it all go the same direction to look even halfway decent , and in some areas of the box , it was stretched funny and the polka dots were more oval . The inside is n't lined with anything and is just particle board . I have bought much nicer boxes from Target for less money . I think I 'll stick with those . Thankfully Amazon has free returns because this one is going right back .	-1
First off let me just start by saying that this item arrived very quickly but unfortunately arrived damaged . Upon inspecting this item I also noticed that it is very poorly constructed . I ca n't see anyone receiving this item undamaged . It is made from pressed wood which feels almost like thick cardboard . I ca n't imagine anyone being able to keep this for years of use . If it did n't arrive damaged , I 'm sure my son , who is 1 , would have this destroyed in a few days . I would def . steer clear of this product . I liked the idea that this was microfiber instead of painted wood which was what attracted me to it in the first place . I hope I can find a similar but well-made product . Not worth the $ 106 that is on the price tag . More like a $ 25 product .	-1
I 'm disappointed in this chair because I think Baby Trend usually makes good products . While it is easy to use , it seems geared toward bigger kids . My 10-month old always falls to the side of the chair and the tray is too high on her chest ( she 's average height and has been sitting up for months ) .I have been able to get food stains out of the fabric by washing the entire cover on Delicate cycle and then air-drying . However , the cushion on the bottom has bunched up inside the fabric and I have not been able to flatten it out.My nephew has a Graco Contempo , which my daughter has used , and I like it much better because she sits up higher and the tray comes right to her at the appropriate height . When my daughter is done with this chair , I think I 'll sell it in a garage sale and get a Graco for the next kid .	-1
I can not stand this highchair ! It was way to difficult to clean . The tray sits up to high for baby ! I went with another one after using this one for 6 months !	-1
I purchased the Genie II after fighting this thing for 6 months . Sorry I wasted so much time fighting this thing . You need 2 hand to operate this thing , and 1 hand to hold baby and another hand to hold the new diaper . I 'd say , if you get this as a gift , take it back and get the Genie II or just use a large , lined trash can . If you 're going to buy , there is no comparison , get the Genie II.The Genie II is so much easier to use : 1 . You can open the lid with one hand , where as the original has a button that has to be pushed while you 're opening it ( take 2 hands ) . 2 . You just push the diaper through the trap door , instead of having to push the diaper through the spring loaded hole and having to turn the `` crank '' on the top to seal in the diaper . 3 . The unit opens in the middle , which is the top of the part that contains the dirty diapers , instead of having to open it from the bottom ( tip the entire unit over and pull the chain of diapers out ) . 4 . The cutter is much easier to use , no buttons to push , just slide the top of the bag through the razor and tie it off , instead of having to push the button and crank the dial on top and turn and turn until it finally cuts through , then having to unlock the cutter so you do n't continue to cut the bag instead of twisting the diaper in . 5 . Unloading a single tub of dirty diapers is MUCH easier than pulling out pearls of separately twisted diapers and trying to find the ends , gather them all up ( touching everything to keep the diapers together ) while carrying them to the trash.As far as the odor , I think they are about the same , both work pretty well . Someone wrote that these style only holds about 30 diapers and the new style holds about 180 , I find that NOT to be the case . Both hold about the same number of diapers before having to empty , and for me , that is about 20 of the size 4 diapers ( or so ) .BTW , This IS the ( so called ) newest diaper genie twist away pail system . I ca n't believe they made one worse than this one . It is a PAIN to use .	-1
We absolutely hated the diaper genie . It never worked right . After suffering with repeatedly having to retie the knot to start the sausages over we finally took it to the dumster . We started using the regular trash can and emptied it nightly until we got the diaper champ . We highly recommend the diaper champ . Do not waste your money on the diaper genie .	-1
I really liked the diaper genie at first . It is easy to use and def . hides odors . However , now that my son is in size 3 diapers it gets fulls so fast . I have to empty it every other day and it now goes through the refills really fast . I have stopped using it and am looking for another diaper pail system !	-1
only specified bags , really messy and I see no point to doing this when you have a garbage can and hopefully you do not leave your garbage for a day or 2 in the house so when you take the garbage out , you take the dirty diapers . Please , I have it , my daughter is 9mths old and ask me how many times have I used it ... ask me ! ! ! I 'll tell you- NONE ! Thank you to the gift bearer , it was a great idea , thought , gesture and surely appreciated but the system sux..	-1
Contrary to other reviewers , I prefer the Diaper Genie to both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Dekor , in part because of superior containment of smell . As one reviewer notes , there are a number of steps involved , but they 're easy to learn , become second nature , and most importantly they *work* . We actually have to Genies , one of the earlier model and one of the purportedly `` new and improved '' Diaper Genie . The latter model , however , is not an improvement.The redesign allows the bag inside to be turned using the closed lid rather than by holding the bag on the inside . But the lid wo n't twist the bag if there 's is n't much weight ( at least 4 diapers or so ) in it , which means it does a poorer job of containing the smell *and* occasionally makes a mess of the bag when you try to cut it ( by pressing a button on the lid while twisting ) .The old design has one main problem : That inner ring that used to be used to hold and twist the bag , which is softer plastic , rubs against the bag/refill package , which is harder plastic . Over time ( 2 years , in our case ) the bottom edge of the inner ring has worn and warped from collision and abrasion with the refill package , and has become quite difficult to enter . But I 'm planning to sand it down a bit , which will probably resolve things - and THAT will be our preferred `` new and improved '' Genie .	-1
We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted ( 2 sets of refills every month ) . After using the Genie , we switched to the Diaper Champ which uses regular trash bags ( we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies ) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate ! With the Genie , you have to fold the diaper into a teeny , tiny ball before you can shove it through the opening and keep shoving past the teeth into the belly of the pail . Then twist the top and close the lid . At the end of the day , you twist the outer lid and cut the bag with the sharp blades inside the pail.Not only did we not like having to `` handle '' the diaper so much ( yuck ! ) , it bothered me to have a diaper pail with sharp blades in my nursery ! The thought that someday my daughter might be under the care of a sitter and accidently get into the pail , possibly cutting herself on the blades made me banish the Genie altogether . Call me cautious , but it was one last strike against the Genie that I felt just was n't worth keeping it ! After that we switched to the Champ and no more twisting , shoving or cutting - simply drop and flip . Why spend so much time with a diaper when there is a better alternative out there ? I would definitely advise against the purchase of the Genie and recommend instead , the Diaper Champ . It 's safer , cleaner and cheaper to maintain .	-1
We registered for this product after hearing raves from other people . We could not be more disappointed . Among other things , we were never able to figure out how to get this thing to work . My husband and I have four masters degrees between us , and my father is an engineer . And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work . Out of depseration , we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out . How much genius does it take to make a diaper pail this complicated . We are much happier with the diaper champ .	-1
Well I actually read from the site that the Diaper Genie was good and bought it . Well..nope . Here are the things that stink ( no pun intended ) about it..1 . You are supposed to be able to twist the dial at the top to seal the diaper up . At almost every playgroup I go to ( and my diaper Genie as well ) the top has not sealed the last diaper so when you go to put your new diaper in , you get the wonderful aroma of aged poop . Lovely ! 2 . The blade that is supposed to cut the bag so that you can empty the contents has never worked the first time . You have to sit there and push the button over and over again . It is pretty silly.3 . The replacement bags are expensive and they have different types for different ages in order to be more complicated . I guess one has to be picky when it comes to diaper trash bags ! 4 . All diaper trashcans are going to smell . Both Diaper Champ and Genie cut down on the smell but you are asking for a miracle if you think you are never going to smell poop in your baby 's room.Anyways , after buying the Genie , I bought the champ and I am perfectly happy with it . Plus it is kind of fun flipping the top to get the diaper in . ( simple pleasures ! )	-1
This thing smells , is a waste of plastic , and not mommy-easy for when you want to get rid of that dirty diaper while you have a child moving around on the table and only one free hand . I have resorted to using my grocery bags for the smelly diapers and wrapping them to throw in the main garbage . Then the wet diapers get tossed to the regular garbage and taken out daily . This is far better than even thinking that I have this wonderful thing that is never supposed to smell . It is horrible .	-1
This was one of three diaper pails I tried while my daughter was in diapers , and my least favorite of the three . Sure , the idea of twisting the diapers into their own little sausage-like casings seems appealing , but all that twisting led to some real issues with my elbow - very painful . And the hefty price you have to pay for the replacement bags ... what a rip-off ! I ended up using the Diaper Champ and was really happy with that diaper pail - no special bags required and all you do is drop the diaper in and flip the handle over .	-1
We registered for this and believed that it would be an absolute necessity , but I wish we had n't , at least right away . Because if you breastfeed your baby , the diapers really DO N'T stink that much ! It 's not worth the extra money for the expensive refills , so we 've just been plopping diapers in the regular trash can which goes out a few times a week . I have noticed no particular odor since we started doing this . However , once she starts solids , I 'm going to get the diaper genie back out and use it again.My other complaint is that the cutting mechanism does n't work properly . Every time we 've tried to empty it , we ended up getting out a pair of scissors .	-1
Typically , it works alright . However I have problems with the cutting mechanism almost every time I empty it , it will only partially cut through the plastic ( and that was on the stage 1 ) . And after I empty it , I re-tie a knot and twist the top and the next time I put a diaper in , it just spins and spins with out actually tying up the diaper .	-1
While I have n't tried the `` new and improved '' Diaper Genie , in reading the reviews it sounds like they have n't improved on the biggest issue , which is setting the thing back up after you empty it . As someone else pointed out , most of the time you end up with what my husband and I refer to as `` the giant poo-poo sack '' because no matter how many times you twist that first diaper , the next one you put in just falls on top of it . What I 've had to do is lay the thing across my lap , push in the second diaper with my right hand while my left hand is holding the first already twisted diaper in the bottom of the pale . It just should n't be all that complicated , you know ? I 'm also really sick and tired of having to buy the refills . I think I 'm going to get the Diaper Champ to keep downstairs where we do the majority of our changes and keep the Genie in the nursery ...	-1
Do not waste your money on the Diaper Genie . Even the `` new and improved '' Diaper Genie ca n't compare to the Diaper Champ . The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills . I ca n't speak for anyone else , but personally , the idea of having to constantly buy expensive refills for my diaper pail , when we already have trash bags in the house , is nuts.As for the `` smell '' issue . Let 's face it - diapers stink . And regardless of brand , ANY diaper pail still needs to be emptied on a regular basis . As for the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ , I have seen no difference in odor control between the two brands - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel , but neither are odor proof .	-1
I 've owned this for almost 2 years . Based on the description , I do believe I have the `` new and improved '' . Here 's my opinion : - Works great for infants . Mine was breastfed and never had stinky poop til he was mostly on solids , about 14 months . I hear complaints about costly refils but I refilled mine maybe 3 times . The trick is to throw pee pee diapers in the garbage can and just put the poopies in the genie . The nursery never smelled like pee so I thought this was a good way to go.- Once my son was on more solids than breastmilk , about 14-15 months , his poop became too stinky for even the diaper genie to contain . The genie would have only one poopie diaper in it ( I emptied the genie every 3 days or so ) and it still stunk up the room so bad . I am using the stage 2 refills , or whatever they 're called . The genie itself when opened from the bottom to empty was terribly stinky no matter how much lysol I sprayed in there . Now I just use plastic grocery bags or small garbage bags to immediately bag the poopie diaper and throw the tied up bag downstairs in the kitchen garbage can . I 've since put the genie away but will probably use it for the next kid in the early months , if I can get the stink out ! Just a note about the diaper champ since a lot of people are comparing the genie to that , they used this at my son 's daycare . It stunk too and I consider it unsanity , the way you have to touch it , if that makes any sense . I at least felt the genie was very sanitary , as your hand always touches clean bag and no part of the genie comes in contact with the diaper other than the bag.All in all , the genie is useful but I would n't buy one again if this broke or something . I 'd just take stinky 's downstairs in a plastic garbage bag and throw pee pees in the nursery garbage til garbage day . If you live in a one-story house YOU DEFINATELY DO NOT NEED THIS . Hope that helps .	-1
The Diaper Genie is the worst piece of crap I have ever used . When it works it is fine , but the stupid inner funnel ring has broken and had to be replaced 3 times already . The people at Playtex were very nice about replacing it , but come on ! Do you know how many diapers a baby goes through between the time this thing breaks and the time a replacement part arrives ? We did n't even do anything to hurt the ring , sometimes if you just open the unit too roughly it will shear the edges and then it wo n't fit back in the top . We have given up and bought a diaper champ .	-1
I have not used any other diaper pails so I am no expert on this . I am used to the operation of Diaper Genie and do not find it that difficult to use `` butt '' I do n't think this pail contains the smell really well . Before Katie was born I bought a plug in wall freshener unit in a pretty rose smell and her room always smelled so nice . Now it smells like a diaper and she only makes # 2 every other day and I empty the Genie at least one a week . I am thinking of trying the level 2 refills before I buy a whole different unit though so maybe that will help . Wiping the Genie out with disinfecting wipes and spraying with Lysol helps a little . I can change a poopie diaper like a pro but everytime I empty out the `` strand of pearls '' I gag .	-1
Do n't get suckered into buying a contraption that forces you to spend money on proprietary bags . You can get a much better product , called the Diaper Champ . It 's very easy to use and you can use whatever trash bag you want . You really wo n't need it , but if you are so worried about the smell , you can buy the Glad Oder Shield bags	-1
We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ . It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids . The smell would leak out . We clean the diaper genie every week . Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills.It 's not a bad prouduct , I suggest emptying it out daily . I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell .	-1
I bought a diaper genie for my baby , despite numerous people telling me it wasnt worth it.. It was fine at first ... My baby is only a month old and im already giving it away ! My first complaint is that the first few diapers wont stay wrapped ! As soon as i put another diaper in it unravels the first diaper and the second drops down with the first.. IT keeps doing this until the bag is too heavy and wont wrap at all ! My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work ! It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work , so i end up cutting it with scissors.. This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail ! ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too . In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL ! ! ! ! I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE ! ! I bout the diaper champ and it is the greatest pail ever ! BUY THE DIAPER CHAMP !	-1
I wish I had done my research before wasting my money on the Diaper Genie . This is the one thing I own that I really do n't think is worth the $ . It really does n't work as expected . I 've had mine for a year , so I 'd say I 've given it a fair chance . When you 1st start a new `` sausage '' it takes at least 5 or 6 diapers for it to start working properly & twisting them individually , in the mean time all of those smelly diapers are just hanging there in one large `` sausage '' bag together . By the time it really starts working like it 's suppossed to , it 's time to empty it for trash day , then you 're right back at square one . Since my son is a year old & older babies do n't poop near as much as newborns , it can take several days to get enough diapers for it to start working right , consequently when you open it to put in a new diaper , the smell of nearly a weeks worth of dirty diapers will knock you over . ( I only use it for poopy diapers because wet ones do n't really stink , so why spend the $ on the film for wet ones . ) Also , the plastic is scented , so the combo of dirty diapers & `` flowers '' is more disgusting than the dirty diapers alone . It 's so bad that I 've quit even using mine . I just use the regular trash can . In the long run , I think they smell less when they are in the fresh open air of a regular trash can than when the smell is confined to the diaper genie.If , even after reading this review , you do go ahead & give the Diaper Genie a try , one thing to consider is that poopy diapers of breast fed babies do n't really stink , ( I know , I thought that was crazy too the 1st time someone told me , but it 's true . Not like toddlers ' diapers anyway . ) so why even bother spending the $ on the film for the 1st 6 months . I put mine away until we started on solids , & just when I need it the most , it fails me ! Also , the film may be expensive , but if you do n't waste it on wet diapers , I have to admit , a refill will last a long time.This is a great concept if it would work , the only problem is that it does n't work !	-1
This thing is junk and a waste of space . It does not twist correctly . The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it . Do n't waste the money .	-1
We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents seem to do for some reason and we hated it ! The new design is jsut as poor as the original ! It 's a total pain to empty and change the bags . And the bag get a bit costly after a while ! And no matter how we spun the thinkg we still ended up with one big bag of nasty diapers ... not `` sausage links '' for us ! It was a total waste of money ! We returned ours after a couple of weeks and got the Diaper Champ . We love that thing ! No bags to buy and no stupid spinning ! Save your time money , and sanity ... go with a Diaper Champ !	-1
Total waste of money ! ! I recommend anything else that requires regular trash bags instead of expensive refills ! ! We just use a regualr kitchen trash can now instead !	-1
Well , I put it on my registry and got it , and I wish I did n't ! The handle does not twist the bag , so it DOES N'T lock in the smell . It just does n't twist . It does n't cut through the bags , you have to use scissors to do it . The refills are really expensive . And it does n't have a foot peddle for no hands disposing . My son 's room always smells like you know what . And it does n't hold a lot of diapers . I feel like I 'm constantly emptying it , which is n't the simplest procedure . I down right hate it , do n't buy it !	-1
I found this to be a huge waste of money . The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail . The worst part was the odor . It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it . I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper , better option .	-1
We HAD a Diaper Genie , it 's a total waste of money and plastic . The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and did n't do anything to stop odors . My son 's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage . And the fact that you have to buy their `` special bags '' added insult to injury.We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM . It 's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie , and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son 's diapers without NO yucky odors . WOW ! ! We love this product so much . Our son 's room smells clean with no poopy odors , and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags . It 's also very easy to change -- no confusing bag twisting.STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE . You 'll just end up having to replace it because your baby 's room will stink terribly .	-1
This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth . I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain . I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing . The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours . It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away .	-1
Cup does n't seem to be of very good quality . Leaks all the time . I would have gave this 3 stars but I went with 2 since you could be like me and get a pink cup for your son .	-1
My son 's bottles leak when they are tipped over , this thing is like a slow faucet , 10-15 minutes and it 's empty . I thought it was just a fluke , so I bought a second one and it does the same thing .	-1
I got these because of the one piece no leak lid . but just returned them today . The lids do not stay on after being screwed on . You can pop the top right off like a tupperware lid . It is especially easy to do if the bottle is slightly squeezed to change the shape of the threaded lip . As a matter of fact if you tighten too much the lid actually clicks through and opens back up . I bought a two pack and thought at first that I one was a bad egg but the same thing happened with the second so I consider it a design flaw .	-1
I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter . It tries too hard . There is way too much going on and she gets overwhelmed when reading it . At 9 months she would still rather read the more simplistic Squishy Turtle book .	-1
Bought this for my daughter at 6 months and she showed no interest in it . I purchased it for a plane ride where we could sit and discover the book together but she was unimpressed , even now it remains in her toy bin untouched . She enjoyed other cloth books but this one was a dud .	-1
I washed this book in cold water in our washer on delicate cycle . Not to label directions . Who makes a cloth book that you ca n't wash thoroughly , that your child will drool , chew and drop on the ground ? I was appalled to see how faded the book became once it air dried . My child was sucking on the corner of that book . How much dye was she ingesting ? What other substances/chemicals were in the books pages ? I am not pleased with this and will not buy Manhattan Toy cloth books in the future .	-1
I was just about to buy this for my 3 month old when I noted a warning label-it stated that this toy is not intended for children under 3 years of age . Generally I LOVE the manhatten toy company ... but , I do n't know why they would create a book that is obviously for a baby but allow for a possible choking hazard.So , be forwarned about it . I do appreciate that the warning label is listed for this product ; however , it would be very easy for someone to not see the warning since you have to scroll down to see it ... .Next time I suggest it being near the price of the product !	-1
It was n't worth the money . The sensor was not very strong , we basically had to hit the side of the crib to make it start .	-1
I purchased these in my quest to find something to help my infant daughter fall asleep apart from me , as right now she will only sleep if she is next to me . I purchased one for her and one for my other kids , as i knew when they saw hers they would want one too . However , this was a total waste of money , and I have returned them to Amazon for a refund . For something so expensive , it is totally impractical for its intended purpose ... 1 . The music box part can not be left within reach of baby , according to the package directions . It clearly states several times throughout the instructions that baby should at NO time be able to get hold of it . The design is such that the music box part goes inside the bears back ( held closed by VERY flimsy velcro ) . How do they expect to keep a baby ( especially an inquisitive one like mine ) from getting to it , if the back is easily accessible and opened ? ! ? Any baby who has any curiosity at all will have this open in a matter of minutes ( mine did ) . It suggests that when baby is old enough to access the music box , that the box be velcroed out of reach somewhere on the bed , leaving the bear to be able to be snuggled . Two problems with this . first of all , where on a modern baby bed can anything be velcroed out of baby 's reach , except under the bed ? and secondly , the bear then has a back that can be opened by baby and placed over their face , arms stuck , stuff other items in , etc.2 . There is NO way to turn this off once baby is asleep without taking the bear out of the bed ( and room ) without moving or bumping it . It is activated by movement and sound , so if you accidentally bump it or move it too fast , or make any sound , it kicks back on ... since the whole point is to lull baby to sleep , this was VERY frustrating , because you creep quietly in to get the bear , so that baby does n't roll over into it and kick it back on , which would wake them back up again ... it should have a remote control , so parents can turn it off without having to take it out of the bed , so baby stays asleep ! All in all a very poorly designed product for its intended use !	-1
We got this for our daughter and took it to the hospital when she was born . It is cute and you can take the sound box out of the bear , which we did , and attach it by velcro to railings such as the baby bed at the hospital . It sounds great but it wo n't stay on . It lasts for about ten minutes and then it stops , usually right as you or baby are almost asleep , leaving a deafening silence . Then you have to reach over and bump it to make it come back on , over and over . Tedious ! ! Also , the batteries ran out after less than a week of use and as they dd it just got quieter and quieter . We found much better results for the same price when a friend gave us the Homedics sound maker and projector : Homedics SS-3000 Soundspa Lullaby , WhiteThis not only plugs in , wth NO automatic shut-off , but also has several sound settings as well as beautiful and colorful discs that project wherever you aim the device ( wall , sofa back , bassinet cover , etc. ) . Our baby has watched it since she was three weeks old . I highly recommend this instead of the bear ! !	-1
I think I jumped too quick with this product . It 's super cute and cuddly , but it turns off after like 5 min and then is activated again by movement . So , I turn it on , baby falls asleep . It turns off , baby wakes up . Baby starts to move , it turns on and scares her . Then I have a crying baby . Not the ideal situation . I ended purchasing the Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound Machine . It has options to turn off or stay on . Works much better for my little one .	-1
We purchased the Slumber Bear for our two-week-old daughter in the hopes that it would help lull her back to sleep when she awakened in the middle of the night . While the bear itself may eventually be of use as a generic toy , the audio pacifier has not been at all effective in the anticipated pacifying efforts . The audio/motion detector is only triggered 50 % of the time when our daughter screams directly at it , and oftentimes I 've needed to give it several good , solid whacks to get it to play . When it does play , the audio track of womb sounds has had no impact on her crying . I acknowledge that it may work better for some children , but ours is not one of them . I should note that our daughter is not what would be considered colicky or otherwise overly fussy .	-1
I do n't know why this thing got such great reviews . After a couple of rather sleepless nights , I 'm ready to throw this thing out ! ! ! I got both the Slumber Bear and Cloud B Sleep Sheep as baby shower gifts . I opened and used the Sleep Sheep first and have it in the nursery . It works great . My 10 week old is consistently sleeping almost completely through the night , waking only once a night for a feeding.Last week , we had to go to stay with my parents ' house for an entire week . So I decided to take the Slumber Bear thinking I could leave it there and have one sound machine at each location . My baby , who consistently sleeps great was restless all night long for first two nights . I had to get up to check on her six or seven times a night . At first I thought it was the change in environment and we 'd have to tough it out . Then I decided to sit by her on the third night , to see what was happening . Boy , was I surprised ... As soon as I turned on the bear , her eye lids got droopy and she started falling asleep . I did n't even have to cradle her in my arms . Five minutes passed and the bear turned off . The change between the swooshing and pumping sounds made by the bear and complete silence was too abrupt and this startled her awake before she could fall into a deep sleep . Her eyes wide open and staring at me , I tap the bear to get it started again . Within a minute or so , baby 's eyelids began getting heavy with sleep again until the bear turns off after another five minute span . And my baby 's eye were wide open again . We did this about 4 or 5 more times and each time , the same thing happened except baby started to lose patience and became cranky . She began to cry every time the bear turned off . And her crying would also reactivate the bear . So this is when I realized that the previous two nights of restlessness was not because of being at grandma 's house . It was the bear ! She 'd fall asleep . Then the bear would turn off prematurely . She 'd wake , cry and the reactivate the bear ... all night long , without ever getting deep sleep.Who came up with such an absurd design ? A sound machine that turns off in 5 minutes ! ? ! ? ! No one can fall asleep fast enough and deep enough in 5 minutes . I 'll admit that even when I was sitting with my baby , I was dozing off . And like her I would wake up as soon as the bear turned off . UGH ! ! ! When I figured it out , I got my cellphone and downloaded a sound app . Then she and I were sleeping great again , even at grandma 's house. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Slumber Bear VS. Sleep Sheep -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -1 . The bear has only one sound and the sheep has 4 or 5 . But the unique womb sounds of the slumber bear works better and gets baby to relax and fall asleep faster than any of the nature sounds on the Sleep Sleep2 . Slumber bear is designed to run for 5 minutes and then is reactivated by either motion ( baby kicks ) or sound ( baby crying ) for 5 minute intervals at a time . The Sleep Sheep has two choices -- 20 or 40 minutes duration and does not automatically turn on after that . I use the sheep at 40 minutes . After the baby falls into deep sleep , she does n't even know when the sheep turns off and she sleeps through to her next appropriate wake time.3 . The bear does not attach to the crib as securely as the sheep . The bear is attached via a small patch of velcro on it 's paws . It has short arms that are stiff and overstuffed ( See # 5 ) . Getting the arms to wrap around one of the rails on the crib is not that easy . And can be impossible depending on how wide the rail is on a particular crib . Even if you get it to wrap , the stiffness of the arms can create enough force to undo the velcro . The long velcro strips on the sheep is a much more generous design and can wrap around anything securely.It wraps around the rails of my crib 1.5 times . I could n't attach the bear to my crib . I attached the sound box and left the bear on a nearby shelf.4 . The bear has the edge on cuteness over the sleep sheep and comes with a satin/velour lovey blanket.5 . The bear is overstuffed and quite stiff . If you plan on giving the bear or sheep to baby to hold and play with at some point , the lamb is a lot cuddlier.6 . Both bear and sheep are battery operated . I 've been using the sheep for 3 weeks now . Twice at night and 5-6 times in the day time for naps . Each time at 40 minute intervals . After 40 minutes , the sheep turns off automatically . I 've been using the same batteries and they are still going strong . Other reviewers says the bear uses up a lot of batteries even though it only runs in 5 minute intervals . This makes sense . Even when the bear is not making noise , it is on . The sensors are working 24-7 to detect motion and sound . So even with no noise , the bear is not off unless you turn it off completely.Overall , I like the Sleep Sheep A LOT better than the Slumber Bear because when baby sleeps through the night ... so do I ! I have to admit that I like the sound app I downloaded WAY better than the Bear or Sheep since it has tons of great sounds and useful features , timers , alarms -- so many ways to personalize it for your use . The app was $ 3.99 . But because I need my phone and ca n't let it be a noise maker for baby all the time , I might just get an adult sound machine to use at grandma 's house like a Homedics and forgo messing with these cutesy plush sound makers.I hope this helps ! I wish I knew all this when I was putting together my baby registry !	-1
This product , IMO , is a waste of money . I bought this when my baby was ~1 month old and VERY colicky . I found myself horrified that newborns are not nearly as easy and fun to care for as I in my delusional first-time pregnant state imagined them to be , and equally horrified that COLIC does not neccasarily have anything to do with gas , does not always respond to gas drops , and sits back and laughs at the suggestions in `` Happiest Baby on the Block '' ( another great bit of bunk for first time parents ) My baby wanted to be held and nursed all the time and if he was n't being held or nursed during the day , he cried . I thought this was a problem that needed a solution . Turns out that 's just how some babies are.When I got this , it did n't come with the `` silky '' - but I am laughing at the idea of it . You do n't need to BUY something special for your child to have your scent near him . And I am not convinced that this current practice of selling new parents something with which to give their baby a bit bit of the parents ' scent has any basis in fact . I just ca n't wrap my head around its being useful . Your baby loves your scent because he loves YOU . He 's not stupid enough to think a scrap of material that kind of smells like you is the same thing.Anyway ... the heartbeat function of this bear was useless . I tried really , really hard at first to make myself think it was doing SOMETHING . The first time I used it , I had it out of the bear , had the baby in the Bjorn on my chest , facing me ... strapped the heartbeat box to the Bjorn , danced around with the baby , he fell asleep ... it was working ! ! ! I thought . But I really do n't think it was . I think my baby was just happy to be near me because I was never able to repeat the experiment - and believe me , I tried . I attached to ti his car seat . To his stroller . To the Bjorn again . Put it in the bear and next to him in his cradle . Never made a difference . He was fussy or not , depending on his whims and nothing else.I give this item two stars because at least the bear is adorable . Very cute , very soft , very squishy ( if you take the hard plastic heartbeat box out ) . At 19 months my baby has JUST started to get attached to stuffed toys and he really likes the bear . He has a duck , a baby doll , and this bear that he likes to have in his crib . But given that all this item has ended up being useful for is a stuffed animal , I do n't think it 's worth it.This is just another product preying on the insecuritues and pocket books of new parents . Caring for a newborn is HARD . If you are reading this and thinking there is some nifty modern gadget that will make it a breeze , WAKE UP . Do not spend your money . Your baby wants to be nursed and cuddled and held and rocked and talked to and sung to . Your baby wants YOU . It is not easy . At times it will seem like sheer hell . But that 's the way it goes . It passes . Save your money , give your baby the gift of yourself , and someday , with or without modern gadgets , you will look back on these days and actually ... sort of ... miss them .	-1
I ordered this basket because my 6 week old daughter does not like to sleep in her crib and I thought a basket like this would make her feel more secure . When I opened the package my first thought was - this thing ca n't be safe for babies . The lining and foam pad seem to be cheaply made . The lining was too loose around the sides of the basket for my taste , and the foam pad was not a snug fit into the basket either , creating the risk of the baby getting their face stuck between the pad and the side of the basket . There was probably a one-inch space between the pad and the sides of the basket . I put my baby in it to test it out and she immidiately rolled to one side where her face ended up against the side of the basket ( obviously at 6 weeks , she is not capable of rolling over herself , must be something about the level/grade of the basket that makes them roll ) . I would not feel comfortable leaving my baby in here unattended for fear she would roll into the space on the sides or up against the side and not be able to breathe . It also did n't look that comfortable anyway and the overall appearance of the basket was not appealing . I sent it back to Amazon the next day . I do not recommend this basket for anyone . I ended up getting a Nap Nanny and absolutely love it .	-1
This is my one baby purchase that I really regret on Amazon . If I did n't have a two week old , I 'd take the time to return it . It just feels dangerously cheap . It 's hard to get it to sit level , and it 's hard to get the mattress inside to sit perfectly level . The bows that hold up the liner are also made of that slippery material that unties easily , I 've already caught and had to retie two of them . That was scary because those ties are holding up liner that could have fallen on his face.I bought it to go with the Jolly Jumper stand because I wanted something reasonably priced that I could keep next to the couch in the living room , but I really would n't recommend this . Do n't know what I would recommend instead - still think the stand is great - but definitely avoid this basket if you can ( it also does n't fit the Jolly Jumper perfectly , it 's a little short ) .	-1
My son was having a hard time sleeping when we brought him home from the hospital . We call the nursery @ the hospital & asked them why ? They told us to have him sleep w/ us . We did & it worked . He got some sleep but I did n't . I felt it was too dangerous . So my husband foud this Snuggle Nest & bought it . It took up so much space in the bed , it was also very hard & very dangerous ! Suffication waiting to happen . My son hated it . He would rather sleep alone than sleep in this thing . We returned it . It is also VERY HOT . Everytime he slept in it he woke up soaked in sweat . Save your money . Put your baby in the crib or bassinet those are the only safe places for him/her .	-1
Looked good in the pic , hence bought it . Very poor quality . Did not even withstand 1 wash/dry - got very pilly and unusable .	-1
I purchased this in store and needed it for my 6 month old who was n't crawling yet but rolled all over the place . It was easy to set up and is very sturdy , but it does n't actually swing open . It worked fine for us semi-closed for a few months but once my daughter started crawling she refused to stay in such a confined space for more than a few minutes at a time . Now we broke it in two pieces to fence off certain areas but in a few more weeks when she is strong enough to climb on it , it will be completely useless.Do not get it if you ca n't climb over it . It does n't actually swing . Do not get it if you plan on folding it up . It is SOOO difficult , feels like it will snap any second . I also doubt any child/baby would be happy being confined in it for longer than 10 minutes . I wish I thought more long term and purchased doorway gates instead .	-1
This item is not 34.4 sq . ft. as advertised . Upon noticing the significant size difference between this play yard and our 32 sq . ft. play mat , we took measurements . This item is actually 29.9 sq . ft. and incorrectly advertised . Have scheduled a pickup for return .	-1
I bought this for my 7 month old son who was crawling everywhere . I was hoping it would keep him in one place . Within a week of the purchase , he started pulling himself up and `` cruising '' at which point I realized this would NOT work for us . Its extremely wobbly and does not stay in place . When he leans on the panel , it leans forward ... forcing him to loose his balance . My son is way to strong and active for this . If your child is stationary and does n't move around much , this might work ... .otherwise DO NOT buy this .	-1
This gate is too flimsy for our baby , we returned it and ordered the more expensive metal gate by another maker . I hope it works out better . Also after seeing the quality of this gate/play yard , my wife and I could not believe it cost just under 100 bucks ! Seriously , this thing should be about $ 29 MAX !	-1
My daughter can knock this right over . Needs to be made stronger , I wouldnt trust it to keep an infant or toddler from getting out . I also have another play yard made of metal that is much sturdier , made from Regalo , ( 4 in 1 metal play yard ) but North States also makes one that looks the same .	-1
I did n't care that the play yard is ugly . I just needed it to be functional . However , while putting it up , one of the corner `` joints '' shattered . It was so frustrating ! We ended up sending back the piece of garbage , and we bought a beautiful bronze metal play yard . Sure , this yard is much , much cheaper . However , it did n't save us any money , because it turned out to be so fragile that it was useless for our purpose .	-1
I bought this item about a month ago and really have loved i it . A nice spacious area for my 6 month old to play in safely ... .until I tried to fold it back down to travel for the holidays . The 8 panels are connected with joints . Unfortunately , in trying to fold the joints , the panels did not fold at the joints , instead the plastic seemed to just snap . This happened in 6 of the 8 panels . It produces sharp shards of plastic . Clearly not something that is safe for use around a child.I am disappointed because it was great having a large area for my daughter to play in . But , it certainly does not open up easily or fold down without issue.Back to looking for another safe play yard ! !	-1
I bought this for my 13 month old son to keep him safe at my mom 's house which is not baby proofed . It is very difficult to snap the pieces together and then even more difficult to get them apart . The hinges also have a clicking mechanism that hold them in place , so that if you want to change the angle between them it is also difficult to do . So if you are planning on using it in a way that you would be changing the shape or opening and closing frequently , it is a real pain . It is very lightweight and so easy to carry , but then again you would have to set it up when you get where you 're going and that 's a huge pain . Because it is so lightweight my son just pushes it around with him . We actually ended up building a small square of just 4 panels and he just pushes it around the house ( wood floors ) . That way he ca n't get to the dog or anything else that is n't baby proofed , but he can still get around a little to follow us as we move around . However , since the sides have the small mesh , he is now learning to stick his toes in there so that he can climb the sides . All in all , a pretty disappointing purchase . We have the other style at home where the panels are thicker and look more like a fence with straight up and down panels instead of the lattice work . It is much easier to open and close and reconfigure if needed , but obviously heavier and less portable .	-1
First of all , and the greatest problem , my son freaked out when I put him inside of this . He cried and hung on the side the whole time until I `` freed '' him . It does work and is a good size , but it is so cold , utilitarian , and almost ugly in it 's bare functionality . It is an eye sore in the living room . It is really better suited for a pet than a baby or toddler . I have n't used it again after the first time .	-1
I bought this to add to some old panels and was glad they are compatible , as one panel did not get fully assembled . The first customer service person was downright rude , but the second time I called , I was helped by a courteous woman who agreed to send a replacement panel as it was unclear which part ( s ) were missing . I have yet to receive the new panel and that part is frustrating . The product is well constructed and compatible with a set I had purchased for dogs years ago . The mechanism used to separate is a tad tricky to do initially , but after a few tries we had success .	-1
I got this to keep my child safe while she plays but this thing came missing parts to put together . Nothing a trip to the local homedepot could n't fix but a bit of a hassle to put together when everything should have been in the box .	-1
This could be useful for the right space . We were constantly opening it up to go in and out , which was cumbersome without a door . I think newer models have a door , which would be much better . You also need a very large space to fit the full size play yard , and it overwhelmed our living room . The other way to use it is open straight as a barricade to protect stairs , electronics , etc . but it is n't very sturdy that way ( and the company does n't recommend it ) . Good idea but not what we were looking for .	-1
The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound . Audio does this nicely . Video only works if you watch it , and if it has audio , as this one does , then why even HAVE video ? ? Video is an unnecessary expense , because just what is there to SEE inside a baby 's crib anyway ? There should n't be anything dangerous in there anyway ! ! ! ! Save the $ and get an audio . As someone else pointed out , reception is n't always good on this model either . Sell yours on ebay , spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor , and put the rest in baby 's college fund where you 'll get much more use out of it .	-1
It 's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer , our monitor is losing the sound more and more . It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned . We have only had this a year and paid $ 176 for it . WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen . I would expect this from a $ 50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred .	-1
I 've now purchased 2 of these . The first one we took with us on vacation and the video monitor screen failed . I thought it was a fluke and retured it.The second one I purchased about two months ago and is completely useless . It is entirely static because of some interference with either the cordless phone or the wireless internet connection in my house .	-1
I purchased this for my newborn expected to arrive next week and spot tested it on my hand and my husband 's ... My husband reported a burning sensation and after washing my hands twice I can still smell the extremely strong floral fragrance . I 'll be using virgin coconut oil to moisturize my little one . This purchase is going back ASAP !	-1
I bought this b/c I heard good things about this brand . Too drying and overpriced . I do n't recommend it at all	-1
I do n't know why this product is so popular . It 's full of chemicals that you do n't want to put on your baby skin . More than this when I washed my baby with this it made my hands very dry and itchy . I 'm sure baby 's gentle skin feels even worse than this .	-1
Smells good but does n't last as much . On top of it , had some irritation from the product . I tried to return it but was unsuccessful in that attempt since the seller declined to do so ... Will definitely check the return policy from some particular vendor before ordering from 3rd party in the future .	-1
We have many allergies in our house , and the scent on these cloths is one of them . Would be great if these were fragrance free , but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies . Caution to those .	-1
it has a place for colorful Bears , but no mention on how to get them . There is a place for them . But , no paperwork on ordering them .	-1
I first heard of the boppy pillow when a friend of mine had a baby . She allowed me to use it to hold her baby without straining my arms . I thought it was the greatest thing . I had never had a baby before and never held one and I thought there would be no way I could breastfeed without it . Little did I know at the time I was pregnant . I registered for a pillow and did n't get one , so I paid the outragous price and shipping because I thought I would n't be able to live without it . Pre-pregnancy I was a size 1-5 or extra small . I gained probably 60 lbs . When I brought my baby home , the pillow would not even fit around the fat left over from pregnancy . Once my uteros ( sp ? ) did go down quite a bit , it fit a little better ( it still does n't fit quite right ) and I could try to use it . I have large breasts ( about DD ) and I still had to prop a blanket under my baby 's head to reach my breast . She would fall into the gap left in the stomach area all the time because it did n't fit right . I eventually just set the pillow aside and do not use it . She is now a little over a month old and it is really easy to set her in my lap and she reaches the breast on her own . Do not be fooled that you will get your money 's worth out of it . I 'm really dissapointed a read so many good reviews and turned out I wasted money that I could really use for other things like DIAPERS ! I would have given zero stars if there was the option .	-1
Just so you know , this product does not work with the hygeia pump . I know there are not many hygeia pumpers out there but just in case , save yourself the time and the money and do n't buy it as it does not convert for the hygeia threading . The packaging does not indicate that it will work , it does not list Hygeia at all .	-1
When I first started using this product I loved it ! It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner , rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner ( what a mess ! ) .However , there were several cons to them:1 ) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2 ) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer , plan on spending a LOT of money because you can not just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit , and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles ! 3 ) if you have a double breast pump , you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor ! I like the playtex premium nurser , and wish the storage kit was more economical ( and even if not economical , I 'd like it if they did n't leak ) I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles , which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive . I have n't seen them online , but you can buy them in BRU . These are more expensive than buying the Medela or other brand storage bags - but those bags are such a pain IMO . The bottles are great because you can easily pour them into the liners .	-1
I bought this kit because I have been using an Avent pump and pouring the milk into the Playtex system ( a pain which kind of defeats the purpose of having a pre-sterilized system , but the pump makes me happy and the Playtex nurser makes my baby happy ) . I bought this kit excited that I could use the adapter and just pump straight into the Playtex drop-ins . However , it is only ever mentioned in small print on the box that the adapter does not work with Avent and First Years pumps . Since these are two popular brands , I wish they 'd note that on the Amazon site and more prominently on the box !	-1
We got this mat for our 9 month old so while she was playing the surface would n't be as slippery.. It smells after 2 months of use everyday so I 'm disappointed .	-1
It does n't stick well to the tub , it 's slippery , and it turned yellow from I assume the heat of the water ?	-1
I did n't use the brand of bottles they are referring to , so it 's partially my own fault , but I could only get 4 Born Free 8-9 oz bottles in this cooler . Additionally , the `` ice pack '' they send is tiny and the 4 bottles are only cool for a short time before the milk would go bad . The cooler itself does not keep the bottles cold at all.This is a glorified lunch box that is too awkward to contain anything but bottles ( because it 's deep ) and it 's not wide enough for more than 4 of most standard 8 or 9 oz bottles . The top part is nice , but you need another ice pack for that if it 's something like yogurt or anything that needs to be kept cool.Unfortunately , I 'm not impressed .	-1
We punches this one and a ( what we thought was a much smaller pack ) one for long trips- this one- and the other for a few hour outings . This one is not as big as it says . We have to use a flat ice/gel cooler- the thick ice packs do n't fit w multi bottles . And 6 bottles ? No way ! Maybe 4 . The positive of the pouch is you can put the spoon , Cheerios pack , etc things that do n't need to be chilled zipped into the top compartment . Save your $ $ on this one and get a smaller version and stick with your usual travel small soft coolers you had from college days	-1
I have had this product less than 2 weeks and the inside liner is pulled apart on the seams already . I have never been more disappointed in a product . I have n't really even used it to carry to capacity only a few bottles back and forth to daycare so I was really disappointed to notice that the inside was already ripped .	-1
I was excited when I found this cooler . I have twin boys , so I need double the bottles no matter where I go . Basically , long story short , when the desciption said it would fit `` standard '' bottles , I figured I was using the right type . Apparently , Avent bottles are not `` standard . '' This cooler wants tall , skinny bottles , but unfortunately I ( and everyone else I know ) use short , stalky bottles . I think this product was designed a long time ago when tall , skinny bottles were popular . If you use Dr. Browns , I 'm sure they would fit ( although they might be too tall ) , BUT ... if you use Avent , Tommie Tippy , etc ... then look else where . I 'm pretty disappointed . I will continue my search , I guess . On the up side , the price here is cheaper than Babies-R-Us .	-1
This product looked so beautiful online . What a waste of money it was.- It was very annoying to put together and it does n't fit through doorways , so it needs to be assembled and disassembled in the room where it is used- It was cheap materials - the `` mattress '' was so thin the baby was basically laying on plywood.- The bedding fell apart when washed ( ribbons frayed & they were n't attached high enough to hold the bumper to the frame beacause after the wash , the bumper sagged over into the bassinet ) - The way the canopy works is incredibly crappy - it 's like a coat hanger- I did find the round sheets but they were also threadbare and crappy- My daughter outgrew it way before the manufacter suggestions - she was n't very long , but always needed to be perfectly centered in the bassinet or else would touch a side	-1
I like the idea of pumping directly into bags for storage . In theory , it should save on the number of bottles that need washing , which is appealing to me . However , it just does n't work for my lifestyle for the following reasons:1 . During the workday , I only get 2 oz per side at each pump session . As a result , I combine the two sides together so that I can freeze or refrigerate in 4 oz portions ( since that 's what my daughter eats ) . It 's a total waste to use these bags during the workday since I end up with twice as many bags and only 2 oz in each.2 . In the morning when I pump at home before work , I get anywhere from3-5 oz per side . If I consistently got 4 oz from each side , these bags would be perfect , but because of the variability , I like to choose how I recombine the milk and how much I need to be frozen vs fresh , etc . In addition to the fact that I might not want all of it to go into freezer bags ( I do n't use these for refrigerating , since I can use reusable bottles for free ) , recombining is hard because of the fact that I do n't like to trust the measurements on the bags , so the more that I pour between bags , the more I am layering estimations on top of estimations.3 . The hooks feel precarious . I ca n't just lean back and rest while I pump .	-1
The attachment makes it top heavy , which means you spill . If I had a 3rd hand while pumping , this may have worked well . Loved the idea of expressing straight to the bag though .	-1
These bags are nice in concept but fail in reality . Yes , you can pump into them , but the top will basically be open so unless you 're really careful , they are easy to spill . I now just pump into bottles and pour the bottles into the bags.The zip-top seal is very hard to close tight , you 'll think it 's sealed but it 's not , or else it pops open after you close it . I 've had multiple spills and leaks because of this.If you fill the bag to the 5oz line at the top , when you freeze it the contents will expand and open the top.Also , the measurement lines on the bag are not accurate at all unless you fill the bag - in which case you do n't need them . The first several times I pumped , I thought I was getting a lot more than I was ... imagine my frustration when I poured the bags into a bottle and discovered I only had about 2/3 of what I thought I did.I 'm going to try the Lansinoh ones next ... these are not worth the price .	-1
I nurse my baby exclusively and I pump for two other babies and donates milk . I go through several milk bags each day . I wound up with a package of these Medela bags after only having used Lansinoh bags before . I have several complaints about the Medela bags.Filling these bags is very difficult . It 's hard to get them open and they are difficult to pour into . I also find that sometimes when I pour , the milk goes right out the holes in the tab . Wasted milk = angry momma . I also do not like how they only have a single zipper seal . If there 's just a tiny part not completely zipped they will leak when you turn them on their side . These bags are smaller and do not freeze flat . This is annoying because they take longer to thaw out and also because they take up MUCH more precious room in my deep freeze . Due to the shape of the bags it is difficult to squeeze out the excess air to get a flat bag and to minimize freezer burn.WORST OF ALL is they LEAK . They are rated up to 5 ounces . I froze 5 ounces in one the other night and opened my freezer the next morning to find the bag had either busted from freezing or leaked due to a faulty zipper . 5 ounces of liquid gold gone to waste . Now one of my donor moms will have to resort to 5oz of formula : ( and a HUGE mess in my freezer . Not really sure how I am going to clean that mess ... NEVER AGAIN , MEDELA ! I plan on returning the second box I was given to my local big box store and buying Lansinoh instead .	-1
I have these bags because they came with a bottle set . I would not have purchased them alone because of the price . The bags themselves are a good concept , but are a different texture / material than lansinoh or Gerber NUK bags . I use the Gerber NUK bags because I love the quality and the durable texture of the bags . These medela bags feel like they would crack if you dropped a frozen bag . I did use a few but have not thawed any of them to check for leaks . I have a medela freestyle , and so these will work with the pump with the screw on attachment . However , I 've found unless you are careful , the milk that splashes into the bag as it drips can bounce up and get in the zipper . If you do n't dry it out it can cause trouble later I 'd imagine . I would suggest just cutting slits in a good bag like the NUK ones , ( cut a slit just above the zipper ) then attaching them to your pump using the medela adapter . It 's cheaper and probably easier that way . That 's what I do ! Since I cut my slit close to the zipper , I can use the adapter and do n't have to worry about splashing into the zipper .	-1
I stored some in the freezer for when I go back to work . After only two weeks in the freezer , I defrosted one to see how easily things would go , needless to say , after warming it up , the smell was horrific . I had some Lanisoh bags and I defrosted one of those , much better . If you end up with this box , I would not suggest freezing , store in the fridge with the four day rule then toss .	-1
I decided to buy Medela bags because I have their pump and I trusted the brand name . Unfortunately , these bags did n't live up to my expectations . They are small , making it difficult to pour milk into them without spilling . The pump attachments work fine , but it 's difficult to juggle the horns and the bags at the same time , and there 's no way to set them down without spilling , especially if you 're pumping both sides at the same time . Finally the zip-lock is terribly unreliable . I ca n't tell you how often I set down a bag that was `` sealed '' , only to have it dump over and leak . These bags have been very frustrating to use .	-1
I never used these during pumping , but a coworker gave me some of these that his wife had left over , so I used them up to transfer my milk into at the end of the day . I only put a max of 3 oz in a bag , because that 's as much as my daughter will eat at once . Even at that , I felt dangerously close to overflowing the bag when flattening it to get the air out . The material is much stiffer than Lansinoh bags , which makes them stand up well , but makes getting the air out before sealing harder . The ziplocs suck and take several tries to get zipped correctly . I ca n't comment on how they thaw . I have some in the freezer , but it 's just my excess stash and have n't had a need to use any of my frozen milk yet . Glad I did n't buy these myself . I will stick with Lansinoh for now .	-1
I had a huge over-supply so I ended up freezing over 2000 oz . I used several different bags - I will only comment on the ones I used 150+ bags which were : Medela bag , NUK bags , and Lansinoh . NUK bags were by far my favorite.Medela : Least Favorite . SOO expensive . I was freezing so much , I was almost paying the same amount for bybreastpump bags as I would be paying for formula . 1 out of every 6 leak . Not bad , I still got most of themilk , but they do leak . Take longer to defrost and defrost unevenly , due to the fact that they freezestanding up . The top half defost quickly , the bottom thick part is slow . Kind of tricky to pour out of , due to holes for pumping right into the bag . And it might be that these bags were what I used first , so thefrozen milk is the oldest but my LO prefers the taste of the other frozen milk . Also take up the moststorage room , due to the standing up aspect . Only have one zipper for sealing . Difficult to get the airout for better freezing . Only hold 5oz , which is really more like 4oz . It is nice that you can pumpdirectly into the bag , but I just used the connector with the other bags and it worked just as nice ! Lansinoh : These are more reasonably priced , have two zipper seal , holds 6oz , and freeze lying down . Allthings I really liked however I had problems with leaking . I rarely filled these all the way up andstill have problems with leaking . I would say a 1/8 leak at least.NUK : By far my favorite . These bags worked great for me . I loved that they hold 6oz . My LO is a eater , soI had to defrost multiple Medela bags for one bottle . These we are one and done . Love the two zipperseal . Super easy to get the air out for better freezing . IMPORTANT KEY : Freeze lying flat . Helpsprevent leaking . Also makes for super easy , equal , and quick defrosting . In cold water , normally takes 3-5 min . Great for storage b/c they can be stacked . 1/15 leaked . Does not stand straight up quite as goodas the Medela for pouring , but is good enough and once you figure it out its quite easy ! With my next LO I will only use NUK . Highly recommend !	-1
These bags are a waste of money . Yes they can stand on own when filled with milk but takes up to much room in the freezer . Due to the shape of the bag and remaining space when filled to the 5oz line they are unable to lay flat . I would recommend the Lansinoh storage bags they can hold up to 6ozs of milk , lay flat in the freezer and are cheaper than the medela brand.The time you spend trying to be careful when removing the adapter that you pump directly in can be spent just simply transfering the milk from bottle to bag . Save your money and do n't buy this item unless you have money to waste .	-1
I love all of Medela 's products except these bags ! ! Do not waste your money because they will leak ! I woke up to 4 ounces of breast milk all over my fridge . What a mess ! These bags are a big headache .	-1
I am 14 weeks pregnant , still nursing my 15 month old and my milk supply has pretty much dried up . I still try a few times a day though . I am almost to the end of my freezer supply and I just wanted to share a few things about my experiences in using up my freezer supply.1 . You can never have enough frozen . There is no & # 34 ; too much & # 34 ; .2 . All of the frozen milk I have fed her over the last month has been 13 to 15 months old . In a deep freeze . She drank every drop , not a bad bag . So I question the 12 month rule.3 . Double check your bag is sealed before you freeze , keep the seal dry . Many popped open while thawing.4 . I used 3 kinds of bags and lots of empty bottles . I will NEVER buy Medela bags again . They are the only ones that the sealed opened on and 4 bags so far either broke or the seal on the bottom of the bag leaked while thawing in hot water . No problems with Lansinoh bags . Not sure if Gerber still makes bags but I used some that were 7 years from my first baby and NO PROBLEM with Gerber bags .	-1
I have used these bags and the lansinoh bags and I prefer the lansinoh bags.My complaints with the medela bags : Only holds 5oz . While 5oz may be good for younger babies , my 10 month old goes through 2 6oz bags at daycare.These bags are not very tall so when you are trying to get the air out before closing it is very difficult to do so with out spilling milk . Especially if you fill them with 5oz , you hardly have any room to squeeze the air out at the top.I find the seal difficult to close , I am always running my fingers over the seal to make sure it is properly closed.They do not freeze flat , the bottom of the bag 'puffs out ' . It 's a minor complaint , but I store my frozen bags upright in a rectangular tupperware container . Freezing flat allows me store more bags in a container.I prefer to pour milk from my collection bottles in to the bags . The way the top of the bag is designed , I find it hard to pour the milk in without splashing the top part of the bag . I always have to use a napkin to wipe milk away.I really like medela products as a whole , but their bags just do n't impress me . On the plus side , they have never leaked .	-1
I had gotten these bags to use with a rented Medela Lactina while my preemie was in the hospital . If you are pumping for a NICU baby , nurses do not like to handle the bags to transfer the milk into the volu-feeders/small hospital bottles ( if you 're lucky enough even to be in a breastfeeding-friendly hospital ) . Nurses are still handling a bodily fluid and it 's extra steps for them if you 're not the one handling all of the feedings . Also , the bags do not stand up on their own , which is frustrating if you 're truly pumping straight into the bag . Like other reviewers , I found that the top tab tore poorly also . They are good for fast backup if you have no other sterile reusable milk storage container , but I ended up using theMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage ( *BPA Free ) 12 Pack of 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging # 87061long-term and was very happy with them .	-1
THis new design with the holes is ridiculous . If you forget they have holes on the sides you can easily unintentionally spill all your hard-pumped , precious milk.Medela bags are thin so they break easily . Freeze them and count on them leaking when you defrost the milk.Get Simplisse . It 's the best bag out there .	-1
These bags are terrible . I thought they 'd be such a great idea but they 're NOT , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! -They do n't actually hold 5 ounces unless you fill it all the way to the ziploc then spill some closing it-The measurements on the bag are so far off it 's not even funny , what it says is 5 oz is more like 3-The ziplocs are terrible , you think it 's closed but really it 's only 1/2 closed . I make kid lunches every night , I know how to use a ziploc , these are terrible-Milk gets above the zipper area , probably ok for pumping and feeding the next day , but not for longer term storage-5 ounces is not enough , need to be bigger ( and as stated above they do n't hold 5 ounces anyway ) These seem like a great idea and maybe if they were made a bit better they 'd be worth it , but they 're not . Do n't buy . I wish I could return but it 's too late now .	-1
Thought these bags would work so well since the Medela pumps are top of the line - but every bag leaked at the seams after freezing ! If filled to the top line they most definitely leaked when thawing , and sometimes even when there was less in the bag . Also almost always ripped the top at that hole when opening to pour the milk out - just made a mess . The Lansinoh bags are so much better , do n't leak , and freeze flat ( which I discovered takes up less room than these bags that have a different bottom ) .	-1
Ca n't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags ? It 's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed . For the price , Medela should really come up with something better .	-1
Rip off . Do not waster your money.These work well but are overpriced.We started buying HoneySuckle bags which work just as well , you only need to cut a small hole in the top of the HoneySuckle bags to make them fit your Medela pump.For $ 45 you can get 300 HoneySuckle BagsB004V903RG	-1
The product feature states these bags have the stick strap . These do not . These are the new model with the adapter which is not what i wanted nor ordered .	-1
I 've used Medela Pump & Save bags since our 4-month old was born and I can not WAIT to run out of them . They do n't hold very much at all . It 's labeled to hold 5+ ounces , but in reality , they barely hold 4 . They 're made of a thin plastic and I worry about ink contamination . They also do n't lay flat easily for freezer storage .	-1
I have been using these for quite some time . For some reason I decided to smell the inside of the bag . There is a strong plastic odor inside the bag . I put some water in one and froze it . Then I thawed it as I would milk for my son . The water absorbed the odor and tasted funny . I have about thirty bags left in the package and am throwing them out . Who knows what chemicals are leaching into the liquid inside . In addition , I noticed that the packaging states `` Packaged and printed in the USA '' ... but where is the actual plastic used to make the bag made ? ? ?	-1
Beware . The bags are expensive compared to other bags . I have had problems with leakage when I thaw milk . Also , it 's hard to pour milk out of the bag . I 'm disappointed in this product	-1
These bags were the most expensive and holds the least amount of breastmilk . It does not freeze flat at all unless you put 2 or 3 ounces in there . Just horrible and waste of money . Good thing I only bought a 20 pack .	-1
I bought this pillow to try after a friend told me how great it was.We also heard about it in our child birth class . I was n't having any trouble using the boppy , but am new to breastfeeding , so I thought , what the heck . At first I thought I was using it wrong . Since it is so firm , it felt awkward around me like I was stuck in an innertube . I did get up to test it out with my baby on it , and the buckle came undone ! Luckily I was able to grab my baby before he hit the floor.My baby was only 10lbs at the time . ( I am a petite person ) Because of the head/pillow supports on each side , and the firmness of the pillow , my baby looked so uncomfortable when trying to eat , plus , his head kept rolling off . His feet also were elevated because they rested on the supports on either side . He looked so uncomfortable ! I could sense his relief when I switched back to the boppy.We keep one on every floor of our house , for multiple uses , and are very happy.Other reviewers act as if you ca n't do anything else while feeding and using the boppy , but I disagree . I 've been able to write thank you notes , pull myself up to the kitchen table and eat dinner with my husband , read , and relax all while using the boppy . I can still walk around with it , I just need to hold it . With My Breast Friend , I still felt as if I needed to hold my son , so he would n't fall off.We brought our boppy to the hospital , and have been using it now every day for the past three months.I prefer the boppy for many reasons : It is soft and plush so you are able to conform it around your body to your desired position , level , and comfort.My son has reflux , and needed to feed at a slightly elevated level , higher than his feet ( not at the same level , as my breast friend ) .I can position his head higher in the boppy and still feel he is secure and comfortable against me while nursing.My son would fall asleep , and since he has reflux , and needs to also sleep on an incline , I was easily able to transfer him from feeding , to his crib in the boppy , where he would sleep in it and still feel like he was elevated in my arms.The cover on the boppy is much easier to remove and cleanWe use our boppy for more than just feedings . He sleeps in it , eats in it , and plays in it.My husband even uses it when he rocks our son , or feeds him a bottle.I think for the money , this pillow is an excellent , comfortable choice .	-1
This can be a suffocation hazard toy , it is a plastic inflatable toy , do not use unsupervised . Our boy is still small but he sits up on his own but he slumped down where he was on his side inside of the ring , he managed to get his body stuck on his side down inside of the ring , so he could not stretch or roll out of it . He was stuck , ( in a 1/2 circle shape ) thank god I was there when it happened . So Not recommended for smaller babies in size.On THE POSITIVE , HE LOVES IT ! LOVES COMFY FEELING OF IT THE GREAT COLORS AND TEXTURES ! That is why I gave it 2 stars	-1
This May we went on a three week trip to Europe with our twenty-seven month old son . Aside from the wisdom ( or lack therof ) of that decision , I panicked about two weeks before the trip . I 'd given up my diaper bags a few months ago , but did n't think a big purse with a couple of diapers would be sufficient for sightseeing in a couple of cities . So I started the frantic search for an appropritate baby backpack.Can I say the Baby Sherpa was a disaster . I swear to God it was the worst baby thing I 've bought in the time I 've been a parent . First , the bag came broken . It was probably my fault for not noticing that the bungee cord had no tightener , but honestly , I ca n't remember the last time I 've used a bungee cord . Second , it came with a couple of laminated pages that recommended that you keep extra Ziploc type bags in the bag . Apparently , whomever designed this thing did n't think to make waterproof pockets and had you bring some bags as an afterthought . Aargh.The cold/food pouch at the bottom ? Useless . The main packet ( which is tiny because of the food pcocket ? Useless . The side water bottles Velcro add-ons - a pain in my you-know-what . The changing pad in the back mesh area ? Useless . It kept sliding out and was bulky as all get out.I ended up using my purse most of the trip and my husband 's backpack instead . ( I highly recommend the DadGear bag ) .This has got to be the worst $ 75 I 've ever spent . It 's going right back today .	-1
I do n't get it . The bag is huge . There 's plenty of pockets and nooks/crannies . And yet , there 's not enough room for even the minimal amount of baby stuff ! I have a smaller bag that actually holds more ! I think they way the pockets are situated makes less room . If it was just wide open in there like a backpack should be , it would be perfect ! But once you fill up one pocket it makes no room in another . Glad I bought this one used on eBay because I would have wasted a lot of money if I bought it new .	-1
I asked a question about this item before I purchased as I could not find regular camo ANYWHERE else , so I wanted to make sure this was the & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; and not the & # 34 ; digital camo & # 34 ; . ( As I had ordered it elsewhere and was told the & # 34 ; regular camo & # 34 ; was discontinued . So , from the answer I received from the customer , I went ahead and ordered ... Super excited because I was going to give it to my husband : ) So when I received it I opened and was immediately disappointed ... IT WAS DIGITAL CAMO . I contacted Amazon and they informed me they did not carry the regular camo anymore and gladly refunded me 100 % I had an amazing experience with Amazon , but the product is NOT Described correctly and the picture should be changed so this does n't happen again !	-1
I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses . It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I 'm complete `` backpack person '' and I never had anything else but a backpack.. Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it .	-1
There is no seatbelt for this booster seat . Becareful , if you child does n't listen to instruction and move around , he /she may fallI would prefer this one.it has a seatbelt and is much much safer in my view.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZBHXP4/ref=as_li_tl ? ie=UTF8 & camp ; =1789 & creative ; =390957 & creativeASIN ; =B005ZBHXP4 & linkCode ; =as2 & tag ; =travguid0ca-20	-1
This booster chair never made its way out of the box . Its chemical smell was too noxious to warrant even a peekaboo . Even the best designed chair fails miserably when you ca n't stand to get near it for the fumes . My search continues ... .	-1
Hard to keep this item on a dinning room chair . Especially with a three year old moving around constantly . Needs to be held down somehow .	-1
So , first off it 's more gray than brown . Second , everything leaves a mark on it . I have to scrub it like crazy to clean it ( you cant just wipe it ) and even then it does n't get 100 % cleaned . The only reason I did n't give it one star is that it actually works as a booster . I 'd choose either a different color or brand .	-1
I would not recommend this furnature , after a year of use it has not held up well . Very disappointing	-1
The finish is just as described , fairly simple but time consuming to put together and perfect for a small amount of clothes . This is not a long term dresser by any means , Two knobs refuse to tighten and the drawers do n't line up quite right . It 's being used as a dresser in a nursery . Eventually , my two children will share and room and I 'll be getting a matching suite of furniture but in the mean time this does do the job .	-1
Just bought this for baby number 2 's room and thank goodness my husband is good at figuring things out . The instructions were completely missing . We checked the box twice to see if we missed them . I then went online to hopefully find them on Graco 's website or from some other poor soul who 'd ran into the same issue and uploaded and shared . I found nothing but an e-mail contact , which you could write to and receive instructions . Seeing as it 's a holiday weekend , I guess we will take our best shot at it and hope it all works in the end .	-1
I purchased the Storkcraft furnature for my daugher 's room , after over a year of use I am really disappointed in this furnature . The finsh scratches really easily , the drawer gliders are coming apart , this is just very cheaply made . I wish I would have purchased something else .	-1
This dresser is a pain in the rear to put together , no doubt . I did it alone at 7 months pregnant ... .it just took me a couple days . It is very pretty and goes well in my baby 's nursery . It does n't seem flimsy and although it 's not an heirloom piece of furniture , I believe it will hold up for at least a few years . At this price , I ca n't complain ! Update February 2013 : Well , I changed my review of this from 4 to 2 stars . My son is 19 months old and the dresser is falling apart . The drawers wo n't stay together for more than a day before the hardware starts popping out again . I 'm really disappointed .	-1
Usually , you get what you pay for , but in this case this should have been worth $ 70 if I were to get what I paid for ! Where to begin:1 . The description of the product was misleading . Solid wood would make you think decent quality . It turns out the `` solid wood '' aspect is 2 % of the entire item . ( The Top shelf , and front of drawers. ) 2 . The internal of the drawers made of `` Wood products '' is super cheap/flimsy . We have a cheaper , very nice looking 6-drawer chest from Target ( definitely no hardwood ) , with the interior really solid-feeling pressed wood , night and day compared to this product . That drawer chest was probably $ 80.3 . Some places where there should have been holes for the screws , did n't exist . Trust me , there was no error on our part.4 . After it was assembled the second drawer was n't level ( holes not aligned properly for the railings ) , so the left side of the drawer has a slight gap compared to the right side of the drawer when you look at it face forward.5 . The Honey Oak color was a little darker than we expected.Just DO NOT BUY . You 're better off getting something from Target ! It 's too late for us to return and get full refund.I 'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 , because some use will come out of it and will fulfill it 's purpose , short term .	-1
I wish I could give this dresser a 0 rating as it is the worst quality dresser I have ever seen . My husband had to replace all of the rails with new ones from home depot , we had to use wood glue on the knobs , and it scratches SO easily . Its truely horrible . Truth be told , the dresser that I got in a nursery set for my first , from walmart that cost me 200 $ total is a much better quality dresser than this one . That set came with a crib , changing table , and dresser- all for 200 $ . I will never buy from stork craft again .	-1
Overpriced and falls apart ... WASTE of money , drawers do not stay on track at all.. Very small for it to be almost $ 200	-1
Cheaply made ! One of the boards were completely broken , the instructions had NO words on them , just letters and numbers but the actual pieces were n't labeled at all . Took my husband 5 hours to put it together . By that time he was too pissed to take it apart and send it back , so I 'm stuck with an over priced piece of crap dresser . The color is nice . That 's about it ...	-1
Ok , so the dresser was only $ 200 ( plus shipping ) , but I would have rather had a little more drawer space . The fronts of the drawers measure almost 9 '' , but the insides are only 3-1/2 '' deep ! ! ! ! As others have said , the front of the drawers and outer casing of the dresser are pretty solid , but the drawers themselves are particle board . It took about an hour to put together and according to my husband , the instructions were easy to follow and there were no pieces missing . I would only recommend this item if you are looking for a dresser that looks nice but do n't need a lot of storage space .	-1
We bought it 6 months before my son was born and probably got 6 months of actual use out of it . The particle board legs have broken and the drawers no longer stay on the tracks . It scratches and warps very easily . I wish I would have spent a little more and got a quality piece of furniture because this is useless now .	-1
I wish I could give it 0 stars . Very flimsy , horrible ... unfortunately there is no way I can dismantle it and pack it back to return , ... what a waste	-1
Received this dresser as a gift for our baby 's nursery and I spent a couple of hours putting it together myself ( not too bad considering I 'm 8 months pregnant ) . The directions were clear and the dresser is sturdy enough to work well for clothing and baby blankets.One major negative to me is the depth of the drawers . They are only a little over half as deep as the drawer fronts are tall . Why not make them a couple of inches deeper so they can hold more ? Does n't make sense , even as a way to cut costs.Overall the dresser is decent for how much it costs . We could n't afford a high quality dresser this time around , and this dresser should do just fine . We 'll see how well it lasts over the next couple of years.UPDATE , 1/2014 : I would not recommend this dresser . It 's so cheaply made , especially for the price . The veneer is peeling off in 2 spots and the surface scratches incredibly easy . There are marks around all of the handles caused from fingernails , and not just the fingernails of adults ! I am constantly having to tighten the screws on the handles the handles , we 've almost lost a few . I 'm on the hunt for a new dresser because this one is about to fall apart .	-1
We ordered this product because it is so hard to find black nursery furniture that is a reasonable price . We planned to use this as a dresser and changing table . Basically you get what you pay for , this item is made of processed wood/particle board so it is not the best quality . I knew this before I ordered it so I 'm not giving it a bad review for that . My husband and I are not pleased with the dresser because it has a million pieces to it and the company put the wrong screws into the package . It is frustrating when you begin putting this dresser together only to discover part way through that they gave you the wrong screws . We tried to call the company but they were closed . Ultimately we can wait to get a hold of the company and I am sure they would send us the correct screws , but we do n't really have time to wait . It is just a hassle to not have all the parts you need for the item . So now we have to try to find screws that will fit from a local hardware store . If we can not find them we will have to wait for the company to send us the correct screws . I am sure the dresser will be sufficient once it is done but basically I am giving it a bad review because it is a hassle.UPDATE : After finding screws that worked and getting it put together I would NOT recommend this dresser . The wood is very cheap and cracked in a few different spots when tightening screws . We are not idiots and did n't screw them too tight , the wood just would not hold up . Also , we purchased the hutch ( top part ) for this dresser , it was actually better than this piece , but be aware that the top and bottom part do not match up perfectly . You ca n't really tell with the naked eye though . Once the hutch is on you can not used the dresser as a changing table , as we would have liked to . It cuts a few inches off so therefore unless you have a very short changing pad it will not fit .	-1
I decided to go with a cheaper piece of furniture as this had some decent ratings at the time . We only used it for about 6 months and the back legs have broken off ( cheap particle board ) . When putting it together , you can tell that it is not a sturdy piece of furniture . Very disapointed . I know it is cheap in comparison to a lot of furniture but we had hoped to get a little more use out of it .	-1
We have had this dresser/changing table for 18 months . It 's sturdier than Ikea and that 's all I can say for it . It worked fine for almost a year , but gentle regular use is showing the poor quality of the construction . One of the drawer slides keeps popping out of the track and leaving the drawer jammed shut ; the cam locks that hold one of the drawer fronts on wo n't stay secure , so our daughter kept pulling the drawer apart , finding little pieces of hardware , and popping them into her mouth . Wood glue did n't help , so we 've just taken the drawer out , leaving a large portion of the dresser unusable , wasted space .	-1
I purchased the Floppy Seat at Babies R Us because I knew that I really wanted something to cover those `` cootie infested '' carts now that my son is old enough to sit up . I recieved a Shop & Play cart cover for a shower gift , but it is more for entertainment than protection from germs . I did n't do much research or compare different types of cart covers before making this purchase because I did n't think there could really be that much difference in cart covers . As long as it was one that covered the entire seat , I figured it would be better than the Shop & Play . When I got home w/ the Floppy Seat I got it out to see how it looked & worked . GOOD GRIEF , it was a WRESTLING MATCH just to get it pulled out of itself where it could be used , ( it stuffs inside itself & makes a bag for carrying ) & trying to stuff it all back in was EVEN HARDER to do . I was just sitting at home on the couch , so I could tell it would be IMPOSSIBLE to do w/ one hand while holding a baby ! I guess it would work it you get the cart in the parking lot & put the Floppy Seat on before you get your baby out of the car , but if you tried to actually carry your baby into the store & then put on the Floppy Seat while holding your little one it would never work . I plan on returning the Floppy Seat . I 'm not even going to waste my time and energy trying it on a cart . Trust me it would be next to impossible to use w/ out dropping your child . After reading online reviews I plan on purchasing the Buggy Bagg . I wish I had done more research BEFORE buying the Floppy Seat . Yes , the Buggy Bagg is more expensive , but I can tell it will be worth the money if it means not dropping my baby on his head while trying to install the Floppy Seat . I gave this 2 stars because , in all fairness , I never actually tried it on a cart & I figure it would be better than no cover at all . All in all , I 'd say the Floppy Seat is a `` flop '' .	-1
After reading all the positive reviews I went out and purchased this item and was disappointed at how difficult it was to use with one hand . Think about it ... .in most cases you 're going to be holding a squirming infant in one arm and trying to put this thing on a shopping cart or high chair with the other . It does come bundled up in it 's own cute little sack , but it takes two hands and about 30 seconds to actually work the thing out of it 's sack . Once out , it 's not super easy to get on the cart with one hand but can be done . No biggie there ... the real trouble comes when you 're done shopping and you once again have your squirming infant in one arm and are trying to remove and repackage your floppy seat . This thing is not small and trying to get it back into it 's cute little sack takes some doing . And because it 's so big , it 's not the kind of thing you want to keep out all the time , loose from it 's baggie . Too much work I say , for something that could and should be more convenient . I exchanged mine for a Buggy Bagg . At first I balked at the price of the Buggy Bagg but later realized it is worth the extra 20 bucks . Super easy to open , set up , remove and store all with one hand . Plus it 's got a ton of room in the diaper bag compartment so when we go out shopping or dining we do n't need a diaper bag anymore .	-1
It really does n't attach well to the car seat or stroller . I have a Graco Quattro Tour and the straps are n't long enough for either . My daughter does like the music but it does n't play long enough and it is irritating to have to continue to activate ( she is n't able to ) . I still get some use out of it though . She likes to pick it up , shake it and then toss it on the floor . *Update*I had to update this posting because this toy has become a big hit in the last few months . Around my daughter 's first birthday she began to play with this . Now in the car she hits the button and plays the music over and over again . It is her favorite car toy . I 'm actually glad I purchased it . Of course it still does n't attach well to the car seat , but boy does it keep my daugher occupie . My opinion on this toy has totally changed .	-1
My son loved this toy on his carrier . But , one week after we attached it to the car seat , it started leaking ! I was so disappointed because my son really like the music , and especially pushing the beads back and fourth , and making them rattle.I also found myself constantly attaching it and removing it to be able to get him in and out of the carrier . While it was at a fine height with the carrier handle raised , it hit him in the face when the handle was moved back so that he could be put in or taken out of the seat.A really disappointing product from Baby Einstein . We love and own many of their other items .	-1
It did n't fit well on my Graco snugride . My daughter loved it , but the song was so short . I could n't reach the button to restart the song from the driver 's seat . After I used it for about a month , my pediatrician told me not to drive with it attached anyway . That it is a safety hazard if I should get into an accident .	-1
This product is awful . The seam digs into your shoulders . It does not really support your back because the pillow separate as you move around . Also you have to take your arm out from under it to change sides ... This is hard because the pillow is bulky . Switching positions is not easy . Worst is that it was too short . The pillow barley reached the upper part of my legs and I could not wrap it around like in the product photos . My legs were not support and I developed hip pain . Do n't buy this ! , , ,	-1
This tore in the center the very first night I used it . There is an awful , hard seam because of the angle . It would n't matter if you bought a different cover for it since the interior pillow has this seam as well . Also the & # 34 ; belly & # 34 ; supports on the side are a joke . They were flattened into the rest of the pillow within 3-4 days . About a week after purchasing this , I saw the & # 34 ; One Piece Full Size Comfort U Pillow & # 34 ; and wish that I had bought that instead . I do n't think I can return this now since its damaged and been used . Sad , waste of my money . If I had seen the other pillow first , I would have bought it instead , even if it was $ 30 more .	-1
I am 5'8 '' and it just does not work well . If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs , if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled . I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great . I had high hopes for this but just not long enough . I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding .	-1
I thought this would be a great solution to my comfort issues I 've been having in pregnancy but I was way wrong . The pillow is WAY too big & bulky & honestly , it 's not comfortable at all . The cover is not soft & the pillow itself is too stiff to mold to your liking . Also , the head part is too bulky to use with your own pillow but too flat by itself . Altogether the pillow was wrong wrong wrong.I only gave it 2 stars because Amazon 's shipping/cost was awesome as usual .	-1
I researched beyond belief and found a really good deal on this pillow . I was SO excited to get it ... until I tried it . There 's no space in it , you 're stuck in this pillow cocoon , which I thought was going to be a positive as I wanted front and back support . I 'm a back/stomach sleeper so finding a spot for my arm without cutting off circulation seemed impossible . The cover was scratchy . The pillow was firm with no softness/squishy ness for comfort . There was no room in the bed for my husband so I tried it on the couch ( trying to avoid a return ) but it did n't fit . I 've never hated a product more . It was returned immediately . I used 2pillows instead and they were much more comfortable !	-1
I was thrilled to receive this maternity pillow because of so many good reviews and claims to alleviate back and body tension . So far it has failed for me in every category and I am very disappointed I wasted the money . List of complaints below : CONS : -Ca n't lay on your side with it comfortably because the large weight of the pillow cause your arms to fall sleep or go numb . ( Needs thinner sections there like the Boppy maternity pillow has ) -Causes added pain to my lower back instead of helping-BURNING HOT , causes me too sweat since the fabric is horrible and pillow so large.-ITCHY fabric cover , despite having washed several times with various fabric softeners-no cover available for it , needs to have a soft cover option available because one that comes with it is horrible itchy-bulky and huge , do n't recommend for anyone who does n't have a king size bed . ( I have a king so least of my issues with this pillow , but notable for queen or smaller beds ) PROSHolds thickness shape.Synopsis , do n't waste your money on this pillow . I have honestly yet to find a maternity pillow I really like , but I do think my Boppy maternity body pillow provides far more comfort for side sleeping than this pillow ever could . I can NOT side sleep with this pillow .	-1
I think the biggest problem with this is that its so overstuffed . This does n't seem to be an issue except that at the very top the inner piece of fabric is so tight that it cuts into your neck . It really hurts ! And if you try to move some stuffing around there is nowhere for it to go , so you are just stuck . We washed the cover and could barely get it back on . I have thought many times that i just want to cut it open and pull out some stuffing.Also if you dont sleep in a king size bed dont expect another person to sleep in the same bed with you .	-1
I wish I could give this pillow a 0-star rating . It seems from the reviews people either love it or hate it . I 'm with the other reviewers when it comes to complaining about the seam that bites into your shoulder . No matter what I tried , the seam would cut into me . If I moved it far enough away so that it did n't cut in , then the pillow no longer reached to my legs . I 'm not a tall person either ... 5'4 '' . The pillow was WAY overstuffed and I got a crick in my neck trying to lie on it . I tried turning it the other way ( so that my head was at the open end ) , and it was just awkward . I tried it for several nights to see if it was a problem of getting used to it - I slept worse with the pillow than without ( which is saying something ) . Also , it took up most of the Queen-sized bed . There was no sharing the bed with my husband when I used this pillow . I really regret buying this pillow . I ended up buying a body pillow for $ 20 and being much happier . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I hate this pillow . It takes up way to much space on the bed . I am too tall to use it between my legs . I did not find it comfortable during my pregnancy .	-1
As other reviewers mentioned , the seam along the top digs into my shoulder . Nothing I did helped with the issue and I had to return it .	-1
Well , its big and soft . It did support my back a bit . That 's pretty much the end of the good points . I did n't sleep well at all . You need a really long neck to be comfortable using it . It dug into mine . Also , I 'm a short person ( barely over 5 feet tall ) . Yet this seemed too short for me too . I can only imagine the difficulty a taller person must have getting it between their knees .	-1
It 's hard enough to move around when you are pregnant.. the first night I fell asleep great feeling snuggled , but then I had to get up and go to the bathroom . several times . I felt trapped in the thing and got really frustrated ! Also , my husband could not fit in our queen sized bed . We are totally average sized people . I returned it right away .	-1
I thought I would really like this one , but I found that I was constantly fighting it . I hated washing the cover , because it was such a huge pain to try to get it back on . Also , half of it kept sliding off the bed . It was n't as comfortable as I hoped , and I could n't seem to get it positioned correctly to help support my growing belly .	-1
This thing is HUGE ! It did not work for me . I think part of it was no matter what I used there was no way I was going to be comfortable . Pregnancy just sucks that way , you are just in pain sometimes and nothing will help.You will have to kick your partner out of bed to use it and there is absolutely no use for that big goofy thing once the baby comes.Save yourself the cash and just get a massage .	-1
This pillow is HUGE . I am married and in our queen there was hardly room for my husband . It kept sliding off the bed which made it impossible to lay in it properly . It irritated my tremendously so I returned it . Too expensive not to be awesome . I was 5 months pregnant when I bought it thinking it would help me from sleeping on my back ( because you are not supposed to ) and it made my sleep more uncomfortable then sticking one of my regular pillows in between my legs , which I 'm back to doing now . Try a boppy if you 're pregnant instead ?	-1
I would n't say I am very happy with this pillow . Maybe that 's because I am not used to very thick pillows and it hurt my neck after I tried to sleep on it . Also , it 's a little bit short and I can not place my legs comfortably . The cover is made of polyester and everything sticks on it , and it was very unpleasant in summer - cotton would be much better and healthier . But I sewed cotton covers myself . The only 2 points I am giving to it - it gives great support to my back when I sit - I am experiencing some lower back pains during my pregnancy , and for that purpose it is great . So , I hope I can use it much better when I will be breastfeeding my baby - at least it would not be waste of money then .	-1
First , polyester cover - scratchy and not very soft.Secondly , there is a weird contour of the pillow that pokes right at your stomach . I do n't know why they contoured it this way . Is this supposed to support your breasts ? If so , it 's in the wrong place.Lastly , too short ! I 'm only 5'2 and I really have to bend my knees inorder for my legs to be supported by this .	-1
The pillow is nice and fluffy . My biggest problem with it is the seam by the neck area ( as previously pointed out by others also ) . The seam digs into my neck/shoulder which makes it uncomfortable during sleep . I like that it 's just about my body length - I 'm 5-ft tall . However , I do wish that the seam were maybe stretchy or more contoured - more comfortable . I honestly barely use the pillow . I only use it to lean on when I 'm sitting on the bed . It gives great cushion for the back while seated .	-1
The smell of the pillow when it is first opened is really strong . I aired it out with a fan for a few days and it still smelled strong . I tried to sleep on it and the fabric on the inside seam cut into my neck so much that I could n't use it . I even tried to cut the fabric at the inside corners , but it still cut into my neck . The fabric is also kind of rough . Leachco needs to move the seam to the outside , use a softer fabric , and address the chemical odor of this product .	-1
I was getting desperate for additional support and based on all the postive reviews , bought this pillow during my sixth month of pregnancy . The first moment I tried it out , it felt comfortable , as it is very stuffed and does offer support . Within minutes , however , it became uncomfortable and then painful . The problem lies in how the top u-shaped portion is sewn -- it is sewn so tightly and stiffly that it digs into your neck . When I pulled myself down a little bit to avoid this , the pillow became useless for two reasons . First , the side was n't long enough to fit between my legs for support . Second , it did n't provide enough support for my head and I needed another pillow . This defeated the entire purpose . If only the pillow were either longer or had more flexibility/was sewn differently at the u-shape ! I am five nine , and it was too short by several inches . We have a queen size bed , and it 's true that this pillow takes up so much room that it 's like having a third person in bed with us . If the pillow worked properly , it would have been worth it . It 's winter now , and I was worried that as it got warmer , it would make me and my husband too hot .	-1
I am a first time mother . One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern . I love the Windsor pattern , so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print . I recevied them all . The item I like the least is the swing . It was n't exactly easy to put together . The mobile was the hardest part . Once you think you get it on , it just keeps falling off . I got so aggravated , I just gave up and kept the mobile off . When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap , no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in . It sure is n't a quiet swing , it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth . It goes through batteries like crazy . My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out . I 'm not happy with it at all . The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice . I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing , which I love and am completely satisfied with . Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set , you may end up with something you hate : )	-1
A lovely and well-made toy , yes , but not safe for babies who like to swing/rattle/shake things ( which I assume is every baby ) . My baby liked it at first , was intrigued by the colors , but soon started to whip it around at which point it became essentially a weapon ! The design -- long and wooden -- makes it especially dangerous . I ca n't believe they 're marketing this as a baby rattle !	-1
This should not be marketed as a rattle for babies . We were impressed with the workmanship when we got this toy but as soon as our baby started playing with it -- shaking it and whipping it around -- we realized how dangerous it is ( for her and for anyone nearby ) . A few thunks on the head and slaps on the hand later , this toy is now retired to the bottom of a drawer somewhere ... . Not for babies ! !	-1
Our baby loves this ... but mama not so much , because quite a lot of the colored paint has vanished from it after just a few days of use . I like that its made of wood , would be the best ever if it was just natural wood . I was concerned about the paint coming off and tried to return it , but could not . I also tried contacting company that made them , but did not get any answer . Great idea , but worried about where that paint went ! Update 9/15/2012 Still not reply from company on why paint comes off ...	-1
I bought Haba 's Ballino for my daughter sometime just before she turned one . As a huge fan of anything ball-like , I thought it would capture her fancy.The toy itself is essentially 6 wooden pieces strung together on a very thick rubber cord . Each piece is separated by a small wooden ball to give even spacing . The pieces can be clicked together , and because it never forms a perfect ball , ballino can be rolled on the floor but will go in a fairly random direction . I thought this aspect would pique my daughter 's curiosity , but it did not.The first day she received it , she played with it a little , but it has been virtually untouched since then . I assumed perhaps she was too old for it , but having read the other reviews on Amazon , I do n't think this was the case . Since this toy is too large and awkward to be chewed or easily manipulated by the hands of a young baby ( 6-9 months ) , and does n't have any entertainment value beyond rolling it a bit for a baby older than 9 months , it becomes less a practical toy with possible play value and more a pretty and rather pricey bit of toy box decor.It is pretty and well made . It will probably last forever - or at least a few decades until the rubber cord dry rots . But if I had it to buy again , I would absolutely pass it up . There are far better toys out there with much more long lasting play value . In fact , Haba 's plain wooden balls have received far more play time than this fancy and seemingly more interesting toy .	-1
I only buy toys made out of wood or other natural materials , and am painfully aware of the cost of doing so . Yet , I 'd rather buy fewer quality toys than lots of plastic junk to trip over.Well the Haba discovery blocks are just too pricey and not durable at all . When I opened the box , I thought to myself - 30 dollars for THIS ? To add insult to injury , my boy only was interested in the block with the bell . I read one of the reviews here pointing out the presence of arsenic in the bell ( ? ) . Had no time to research this claim , but hid the block with the bell anyway for peace of mind . Only a few weeks later , the corners of the blocks were all discolored from mouthing and chewing . I am hoping Haba paints are truly nutritious , or else my boy is in trouble . A year later , the blocks are rarely played with , and yet they look awful . Get some natural wooden blocks finished with beeswax ( on Etsy perhaps ) , and pass on these . In fact , even painted Plan Toys or Maple Landmark toys hold on a lot better than Haba ( and are cheaper ) .	-1
This was one of my baby 's favorite toys until I found the outside ring cracked all the way through yesterday . I love that Haba makes toys that are wood AND colorful for the baby to look at but if it cracks after less than a month , this particular toy was n't worth it . We have the triangles as well and we 've had no problems with them . I considered purchasing again bc my baby loved it but I worry that it will crack while he 's chewing on it and pinch him . My experience seems to be uncommon though , I still love Haba , I 'd just recommend inspecting the toy each time you give it to your baby .	-1
It 's not bad - it does what it does but if the pressure mount is n't strong enough , my 22lb son can climb onto it and pull backwards causing the gate to fall on top of him .	-1
I HATE this gate . It is nearly impossible to adjust . There is a little metal thing that goes into the plastic groove to hold the gate at a certain width , but getting it out is incredibly difficult . I have to pull and pull and when it finally pops out I usually end up getting hurt . Also , unless you are putting the gate in a really easy place , like in a flat-sided doorway with no trim , it does n't stay up , or if it does stay up , falls over when the baby pushes or pulls on it . I just hate this thing - it 's sitting in the basement right now and is n't likely to come out anytime soon .	-1
About two weeks after sending the last of my easy to use First Years baby gates to the Goodwill , we decided to get a puppy . I looked around for those same baby gates , but could n't find any . I found this gate and , while it is absolutely hideous , it 's was cheap , which is good since I did n't know how long I 'd need it for.I realize some people here have found this gate easy to use , but I am not one of them . I ca n't imagine how people are able to operate it one handed . Sure , it 's easy to unlatch and remove from the door frame one handed , but setting it back up is a challenge . Maybe it was just my particular gate , but it did n't slide easily AT ALL . It took quite a bit of effort to pull the one side out to make it larger , then I would have to carefully tap it down to the size I needed so it would fit the door frame again , since the four rubber stoppers prevented me from just slipping it back into the doorway . At first I thought it was just me , but even husband , a naval nuclear engineer , struggled with it ... so that made me feel better . Again ... it may just be our particular gate , but my experience with it has been mostly negative.In the end I 'm glad I went cheap because we ended up not really needing it ( puppy is kept in the bathroom at night with the door closed instead of a gate up ) , but we 'll keep it around just in case . If you 're planning on using this for a child , I say pass ... unless you 're going to put it up in a doorway and leave it there . In that case it 's a great gate because it 's so cheap . But it your planning on removing it frequently from wherever you put it , look elsewhere .	-1
If you 're anything like me and do n't have a lot of time to set up or take down a child gate then do n't buy this one .	-1
I ordered this gate based on other Amazon customer reviews . It seemed most people liked it and only commented on the ugly appearance but were happy with the functionality . Yes , it 's ugly . Are n't most gates ? But this gate in particular is also clunky and hard to use . We already had a great gate , although it was priced a bit higher and we got it at Target . Our other gate looks very similar ( gray , plastic ... ) but works like a charm , while this one and its weird `` memory '' clip make it difficult to set up and take down.I hated this gate so much that we just donated it to charity . I did n't even want to bother returning it through Amazon because come on - what a pain ! I would have to re-package it and lug it to the post office . I would not recommend buying this gate - get a tension gate that locks into place , as it 's much easier to use .	-1
This gate is very difficult to handle . I can not get it to spread apart without turning it on its side and putting my foot on it and pulling up on it toward my chin . I do n't find that the memory feature works in the longer positions . I wish I had never purchased it . This also does not work with our baseboards . I know that this is a problem with any gate of this style , but something to consider prior to purchase .	-1
It took me forever to put this thing together properly , and it 's not good for small doorways , there were so many panels I had to take two off . It came missing a part which really threw me for a huge loop ! ! ! It works now , but too many screws come with it , and I would have preferred a gate that did not need to be screwed into the door frame .	-1
I sent this right back upon opening it . I had ordered it as a gate for my living room to keep my 9-month-old twins in . I did n't even bother to put it up -- it looks like it 's made of big toothpicks , feels super flimsy , and I 'm really dubious about it keeping attached to the wall as it does not screw directly in . This is probably useful if you have a small dog , but not for babies ! It is also really short compared to other gates -- I pictured my boys being able to climb right over it in a month or so if they did n't mow it down first .	-1
The area this was intended for was 98 inches . The gate did not come close to the 98 inches and definitely did not reach it 's max of 103 inches . Had this product work for us , it would have been returned , because of the flimsiness , being so long without a better bottom support . While unpacking the gate , there were small splinters of wood in the packaging , as well as falling off of the gate while we attempted to set it up , I would n't want our little ones getting splinters just from pulling themselves up on it . I own another North States gate that we used with our eldest child and still use , and love it , which is why I was inclined to purchase another gate from the same company .	-1
We sent it back . When my husband finally wasted time and effort drilling holes into our walls to hang it , the kids came to lean on it , and in mere seconds we realized our 18-month-old could clobber this thing and rip an even bigger hole into the wall . The only way to get a good WIDE gate would be to make sure you can secure it to the floor somehow in the middle . Otherwise it 'll just blow and rattle back and forth with no support . This is not the kind of gadget you cheap out on . I should 've known .	-1
I really did n't like this . The whole thing has sharp edges and it is just not safe to use for your baby , in my opinion . I sent it back .	-1
At first I really liked this deck guard -- it is very easy to install and its see through so it really is not as ugly as others . However , I was very disappointed recently . I 've had the deck guard installed now for about 7 months , and my deck gets direct sun light in the afternoon for about 2 to 3 hours every day . And now the plastic is chipping off , with very little effort I can pull on the guard and it crumbles at my fingertips . Where is the safety there ? My daughter is walking all ever the place and I defiantly do n't want her to fall off the deck , but also now I 'm worried about the tiny scraps of plastic from the guard all over the place . Buy something different , do n't waste your time or money ...	-1
this is NOT even close to being invisible . it looks like cheap plastic chicken wire and is not even half as nice as the other products i purchased for deck/balcony safety .	-1
Would not stay on the table . The baby has no trouble peeling it off in the few places where it does stick , either . Besides , this ruins the table 's finish . Overall , a waste .	-1
My daughter can easily pull these off the table due to not enough tape being provided . You would think that the tape would be cheap enough to add some extra . Oh and she was doing this at 8 months old ... I ca n't wait until she is stronger ... they will all be gone .	-1
When we heard about this blanket , we were very excited . Our daughter loves to be swaddled , when we get it right - however , the blankets that we have ( even the ones that the hospital used to swaddle her ) were not very helpful for easy swaddling . And she works herself loose because she 's getting stronger every day.We hoped a blanket cut for swaddling with the velcro would be the solution ... However , two problems:1 . It does n't fit properly and she works herself loose despite the velcro - the velcro contact patches are very small - there should be a broader strip of velcro to attach to so it is more adjustable . Our daughter is small , and it is just too big on her . She swims in it . We hope it will work better when she gets bigger.2 . Fleece - decent winter solution , but terrible in the summer . And terrible if you keep your house over 60 degrees . If only it came in a lighter material ( we have n't found it ) .Oh well ... it definitely seems to work for some , so do n't use our review as your only basis.THAT BEING SAID , HOWEVER , we found two other options:1 ) When our kids were very young ( - > 1 month ) we used a large waffle weave blanket from Target ( ~ $ 5 ) and it worked wonderfully ... we can wrap it tight , and she does work herself loose after about 3 hours , but it is better than any of the previous solutions.2 ) the Amazing Miracle Blanket ( another swaddling blanket ) , was our by far favorite swaddling blanketOne other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled ( usually by an expert ) she loves it ... We initially told some folks who have a lot of experience with children that she liked to have her arms loose . the response we got is that most babies behave that way , and it really is the small minority of babies that do n't really like swaddling . Now that we know how to do it properly , we would agree .	-1
This was one baby gift I wish we would 've returned before using - a recieving blanket works much better . I recommend waiting to see if your little one wiggles out of the blanket and needs this before buying .	-1
I bought this , I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this . She didnt cry more , she screamed more when I tried to swaddle . The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1 , receive 1 and if your baby likes it ... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me ...	-1
Maybe our baby was too small but it did n't seem like I was able to get this product tight enough on our newborn . The Carter 's waffle blankets worked better for us and are a better value because they can be used for other purposes as well . After reading all the positive reviews I 'm going to try this again so may update my review again now that he 's bigger .	-1
My baby will NOT stay wrapped up in this ! Even when she was just a few days old , she was strong enough to wiggle out . And while velcro seems like a good idea , once she gets it loose , it could scratch her.The Magic Blanket is a much better product , and I can even do a better job swaddling traditionally , with a large , lightweight blanket .	-1
I bought this thinking that it was the answer to my swaddling prayers . When I brought my 8 pound newborn home , I wrapped her in it right away . She wanted her hands out , which was no big deal . But then I noticed that she kept waking up because there is too much leg room and she was kicking herself awake . There is no way to wrap the legs tighter . I decided to swaddle her the old fashion way in a flannel blanket then wrap her with this on cold nights . The second night I used this blanket , the velcro stopped sticking . What a waste of money .	-1
I do n't think every newborn likes to be swaddled . My newborn did not like being swaddle , he liked his hands to be free . I received this as a shower gift and tried using it the first few days when he came home , but he really did n't like feeling constrained . I really would not register for this product again . Most newborn outgrow swaddling that in my opinion it is not worth buying this product in the long run .	-1

We also just ordered the Amazing Miracle Blanket to try ( another swaddling blanket ) , which came highly recommended.One other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled ( usually by an expert ) she loves it ...

I received two of these as a gift . As a first time parent , I thought they looked great for `` swaddling for dummies '' ! We used one for about two weeks only to discover that our baby ( who only weighed 7lb 8oz at birth ) was too large for it ! The velcro attaches acress of the chest/arm area even though there is tons of space for growth at the feet . In order to get it to close , we had to scoot her down and then fold over the extra fabric at the neck . It kept flipping up and covering her face while she slept . So , we switched to using the sleep sack we received instead and it worked MUCH better . Do n't waste your money ; just swaddle the old fashioned way w/ receiving blankets .	-1
I am a professional nanny of about 10 years and I have come to view swaddling as one of the best baby care tricks you can ever use . I have NEVER dealt with a baby that did not sleep better when swaddled . There have been many babies who strongly fought the swaddling process if they were not used to it but after a few times it worked like a charm to keep them alseep . I have cared for dozens of babies including several sets of twins and triplets and truly , I could not have survived if I could not swaddle . Many parents told me that their baby did not like to be swaddled because they would always get out of the blanket within a few minutes . I always tell them that just because the baby gets out does not mean that they dont like it . You just have to find the right products to help keep the baby wrapped up tight . I have found that the Swaddle me does not do the job very well for most babies , but the Miracle Blanket really does ! I love the miracle blanket , I have only found one baby who could get himself out of it and he usually only removed one arm so it did not wake him up . It is pricey but very very worth it ! The Miracle Blanket will change the way your baby sleeps for the better so it is worth the money . The Swaddle me just cant get the job done , or at least not as well so I never recommend it to any parent .	-1
I purchased this for my 8 week old son who is 10 pounds and growing longer everyday . I saw the good reviews and was so excited to get it . Well ... Pros : Soft , warm , and cute.Cons : A little too big , ( he can break free EASILY ) , I 've found my son with it over his mouth and nose numerous times , not good ! ! The baby is able to wiggle down despite it being velcro and TIGHT.I would just use a large flannel blanket or something else , this is n't worth the money.UPDATE : Unfortunately , I can not change the star review or I 'd bump it up to 4 stars + . I gave this product more time and sure enough , my baby is addicted . I do n't know truly if it has to do with the swaddler but he is swaddled and sleeping soundly each night . What a dream come true . He likes to free his hands at night but the blanket keeps him covered and warm and it kind of hugs him .	-1
I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good ... I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little , and we LOVED it . It was much softer , and much larger . It was completely round along the sides , without this weird S-shape , and it definitely caught more food.The newer models are n't as soft . The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby 's hair caught in it ( ouch ! ) , and worst of all , the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib , and not in the bib pocket where it should go . All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side , these bibs do wash really well . I 've even stuck them in the dishwasher , and they came out just fine.So here 's my plea to Baby Bjorn : RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK , PLEASE . They used to be much much better .	-1
I bought these because I loved the idea that they would be easy to clean and would catch falling food . Unfortunately the stiff plastic was super uncomfortable for my son , and the bib always seemed to be bumping against the table and poking him at odd angles . We basically never used them after the first few tries .	-1
I really like the material of these bibs . It makes them so easy to wipe clean . However , these do not work for us because of the pocket . The pocket sticks out so much that it wo n't fit between my daughter and her high chair . She is one now so maybe when she gets taller the pocket will be above the tray enough so she can wear it . But for now they are useless for us .	-1
My baby 5 months old pulled this bib off and chewed on it . He does that every time and within seconds of putting it on . I buy from amazon several times a month for years now and this is by far the highest rated yet poorest performing item I have . This is the only item I feel a strong need to rate at 1 star . There is a version like this but with Velcro he does not pull off and the top part is fabric so your able to use in a high chair . Both kinds clean well in my dishwasher .	-1
I can understand the premise and I like the premise.However , I just do n't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.While they are not hard , they are not soft.The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever does n't make it into baby 's mouth . It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn 's plastic snap closure.Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier , while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.But ... Oxo can be rolled up for travel .	-1
I was sold on a waterproof bib which I could rinse under the tap - but I did n't realise how heavy these bibs are ! These bibs would cause a strain on my baby 's neck , and he 's not a small lad either ! I 'm sticking to the cloth ones .	-1
Other people might '5 star ' these , but our little one couldnt stand them . I wanted to love them because they wash up quite easily and the idea is great , but all they did was act as a distraction during feeding time . Plus , our little one could pull it off quite easily ( realize its supposed to break away if theyre choaking ) , but this would come undone when it even bumped against the high chair tray .	-1
My friend recommended these to me , but I could n't find them anywhere . So when I saw them on Amazon I bought them right away . Too bad they are WAY too small for my almost- 2 year old ... I guess I 'll save them for my newborn and hopefully they will live up to expectations.EDITED ONE YEAR LATER : I thought I 'd make more use of these with my daughter , but they are just too tight around the neck . A waste of my $	-1
Good idea , but heavy . My son hated them so much he ripped them off immediately . A waste for us . Maybe a more gentle child would do well with these .	-1
Soft baby bib is anything but soft . Put my 1 yr old Grandson in his high chair and this & # 34 ; soft & # 34 ; bib was jambed between tray and his tummy and almost choked him . Adjustable strap is made of heavy rubber that you slot to loosen or tighten ... not a nice fit . Does n't work well in highchair or feeding seat ... I would never let him walk about with it on ... Pass on this ! I feel it is unsafe ! !	-1
my twin grand daughter do n't like it , it seems bother them around the neck , it needs to be softer around the neck .	-1
These bibs look great in the picture and description but they do not work well with a highchair or booster chair . The are not soft and comfortable .	-1
I figured with all the great reviews these bibs would be awesome . I feel like I really wasted my money . I used these with my daughter when she was around 6m old . She pulled it up and started chewing on the neck part . If I made it tighter she just tugged and tugged on it . Plus , I figured they would be bigger and a bit softer . They are too stiff and do n't fit comfortably in front of her in between the tray and her body . She is now 13m and we still do n't use them . Wish I could get back what I paid for them . The food pocket catcher is nice , but if it ca n't fit down between her and the tray it does no good . Now I 'm searching for a good long-sleeved bib .	-1
I love this bib . But there is one design flaw . My baby takes it off on his own as soon as I put it on . Therefor it does n't serve it 's purpose . It would be the perfect bib if it was n't so easy for him to get off .	-1
The clasp pinches if you try to get it on close enough to the chin to keep food from going down the neck , the crumb catcher doesnt fit above or below the highchair tray , and every time the bib shifts it yanks the baby in the neck . Every time we put them on the kids , they end up a teary , tortured mess . I cant believe so many people love these , we simply could not use them at all . After this we bought the Kinderville Silicone bibs which are softer , and that was a perfect solution .	-1
Kids hate it , too rigid , very high quality though , maybe your kids will like but there is no flex to is at all .	-1
After reading the reviews , I thought this product would be great but it did n't work with my little one . The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality ( hence the 2 stars ) but it 's not easy to put on and once it is on , my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar . It 's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use . They are soft and easy to work with . If you prefer plastic , the softer ones are better .	-1
it 's not big enough to cover the chest area and too stiff . my baby keep wanting to pull them off	-1
I bought two of these bibs after my oldest was interested to feed himself . He would not wear this for more than a few minutes . I find it very uncomfortable as well around the neck loop , so I ca n't blame him for not wearing them . We gave up trying them on him after a few times of him crying and begging for us to take them off.Fast forward four years later , still have these sitting there , almost brand new tried them on my youngest one year old little girl , she would not let me finish closing the bib . Screaming and snatching it off her neck on first try . So back to the fabric ones we go.Big waste of money	-1
The bibs were far smaller than I thought , and the baby felt like choking . He pulled it and cried every time he wore it . They are very cute but were of no use for me .	-1
I got this bib because my baby was messing with the flimsy plastic ones too much and I thought the inflexible design would work better and catch more of the mess . The bib does n't fit my baby while he 's sitting in the highchair because the bib is too long and there is n't enough of a gap between my baby and the high chair tray for the bib to rest . It ends up resting at an angle on top of the tray . It also makes it impossible for himn to bend forward to reach food on his tray because this bib gets in the way . Overall I 'm dissapointed with this purchase . I guess I 'm stuck giving my baby a bath after every meal .	-1
I know that I 'm in the minority here , but these bibs were not the best for my son . They are quite stiff and would get caught on the high chair tray quite often ( we use the Chicco 360 high chair that attaches to the table top ) . The neck piece also does n't seem too comfortable . I use fabric bibs that slip on over the head almost exclusively and they seem to be more comfortable as well as catch more of the mess around the arms/shoulders ( he 's learning to feed himself , so we have food everywhere ! ) . I 'm sure these work for some , but not for us .	-1
I sent these back , because I was looking for something flexible . The description was misleading & said they were flexible , but these are a thin hard plastic- only slightly flexible . It looks like the description has been corrected now . Silicone would have been nicer . These were also quite small , so they would n't be good for use with a toddler . They probably would be better for spoon fed babies .	-1
I hate to leave a negative review , but I bought these since other reviewers said they were hard to take off and could catch food ... both things I want so I do n't have to play bib-patrol all the time . My son got this off in 8 seconds . I tried it a few times , and he either pulled it off , or acted so annoyed since the thing is so giant ( I tried these when he was about 10.5 months old , and my son is in the 85 % size-wise ) and sticks out , making it harder to reach the tray . It also looks pretty uncomfortable . I may try them again soon ( I 'll update my review if I do ) , but all in all , I wish I 'd kept the packaging so I could return them . I wish bibs came with snaps .	-1
She snags this off each time I put it on my 13 mo old . Guess I should 've bought it when she was first introduced to solids . Will try again with the next one .	-1
I am a mother with 3 young children and I wanted to know which bibs worked the best . I have compared the Bumkins Superbib , the Babybjorn bib , and the Bibbity bib.With my first child , I quickly realized that using cloth bibs and putting them in the laundry after each meal was a terrible idea . They would get moldy and I had to own a dozen bibs . Then I switched to Bumkins Superbibs . They are very easy to use . I just wash them in the sink after meals and hang them on my bib drying rack . The bibs are dry and ready to use again by the next meal . Bumkins Superbibs are lightweight and my babies never mind wearing them . Since the pockets are soft , they do n't work well if the bib has been kept flat in a drawer . I always kept my Superbibs hanging upside down by the pocket on the bib drying rack . So , the pocket dried in the open position and worked better . Now my third child is 8 months old and is eating mushy baby food . Even with the Bumkins Superbibs , there are still always some oatmeal spills on his clothes . I rarely have to change his entire outfit after a meal , but I wondered if there was a better bib available . So , I bought a BabyBjorn bib and a Bibbity bib . Here are my results.Both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bibs are SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs . The Babybjorn bib is made of hard plastic ( like a cup ) . It says `` soft '' in the description but that is just nonsense . The Bibbity bib is softer , like rubber.The Babybjorn bib is difficult to put on the baby because it is so hard . Even the neck strap is made of stiff plastic . I had great difficulty adjusting the neck hole because it kept hurting my son 's neck . I never could get the hole small enough to keep food from escaping onto the clothes below his chin . Plan on baby crying the entire time you are fiddling with his bib . The pocket of the bjorn bib is great and always stays open . However , because the pocket is so rigid , it clashes with the tray . My son sits on a chair that clips onto the countertop . The bjorn bib pocket kept getting caught under the countertop and then it would yank my son 's neck . He really hated wearing this bib . The BabyBjorn bib is super easy to wash in the sink . It is easy to dry with a towel so you do n't need a bib drying rack with this bib.The Bibbity bib is much better than the BabyBjorn bib . It is softer and feels like rubber . It was awkward to put on at first and my son was mad . However , he got used to it . I was able to get the neck hole small enough to keep most of the oatmeal out without hurting my son 's neck . The pocket stays open pretty well . However , since it is soft , the pocket would close up when my son leaned forward and the pocket hit the edge of the countertop/tray . So , food did slide past the closed pocket and land on my son 's lap . The Bibbity bib is about 1 inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and is 2.5 inches shorter than the Bumkins Superbib . It is very easy to wash in the sink and dry with a towel.In conclusion , I think the Bibbity bibs and the Bumkins Superbibs worked equally well . There were always a few drips of baby food on my son 's clothes after meals regardless of which bib I used . I suppose that is inevitable . All my children liked to wear the Bumkins Superibibs . My 3 year old still wears the Bumkins Superbibs but said the Bibbity bib was too uncomfortable to wear . I think most babies would get used to the Bibbity bibs but I think most babies would hate the Babybjorn bibs . ( I 'm sorry BabyBjorn . I LOVE to wear my son in your carrier : ) ) UPDATE : At 14 months my son refused to wear the Bibbity bib at all . He also pulls off his Bumkins superbibs , throws them on the floor , and laughs . I bought a bumkins sleeved bib which is fabulous . It provides excellent coverage and ties in the back so my son ca n't take it off . I wash it out in the kitchen sink and hang it on my bib drying rack between meals . It dries in about 2 hours so I can use it again at the next meal . Here is a link to the drying rack that I am talking about.Mommy Genius Drying Rack -- Dry or Display Just About Anything ( Baby Bibs , Plastic or Reusable Food Storage Bags , Kitchen Dish Towels , Bathroom Hand Towels , Washcloths , Mugs , Sports Water Bottles , Herbs , Mittens , Children 's Boots , Lingerie , Holiday Orname ...	-1
the bibs are too long for a 7 month old in a high chair !	-1
I wanted to love these bibs . I really did . They have so many good reviews . But , the instant I put one on my 7-month-old , he was able to rip it off effortlessly . At least with other bibs , sometimes he would leave them alone and not try to take them off . But with these , the stiffness and obtrusiveness of the bibs drove him to remove them immediately , every time .	-1
My baby never liked to wear this bib . He is now 10 months old and average size . It was never comfortable for him to wear .	-1
After 2-3 uses we started started hating these for two reasons : 1.My daughter has a problem with the way the neck strap feels . If its almost touching her neck , she feels annoyed and if its loose , food will fall in between the space on her dress and we are annoyed . 2 . She has a Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat and even when the tray is in its first setting allowing largest gap , the bib wont fit in the gap but will be raised up on the tray pushing it towards her neck making it even more annoying for her . Very disappointed .	-1
My baby ripped this right off . I could not even try it out since he could easily slip it right off .	-1
too hard as rubber , my baby does n't like it . if you are looking for some soft bib , this is not the one .	-1
I am not a fan of Mustela newborn products . They are over priced and the smell is so strong ( think old lady ) and lasts forever ! I know we each have our own personal preference when it comes to smells so I suggest you try before you buy .	-1
There are two sound settings on the little learning table - one is way too loud ( could easily damage your babies ears ) and the other setting is way too low ( ca n't hear it at all ) .	-1
This sorter has shapes that are a precise fit making it more difficult to line up with their respective holes . The shapes have to be put in from the top of the drum because the internal parts are in the way when you try to put shapes through holes at the sides . When you push down on the trunk the shapes are supposed to empty out but they sometimes get stuck . A fun concept but frustrating for my 11 month old .	-1
This is supposed to be an `` activity '' triangle , but it really only has one activity on it . That is spinning . You spin the mirror and some shapes . The only other thing you can do is rattle it , but it is too cumbersome for a baby to pick it up for that . I did n't like this toy at all and my child thought it was boring as well .	-1
My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained . I read all the glowing reviews , and thought this would be a hit . So far , this has n't been the case . The toy itself is bright , cheerful , and very very durable . I also like the fact that it does n't need batteries . However , apart from a few things to spin , and a few shapes to fiddle with , there really is n't anything to sustain her interest . At first I was pleased to find a toy that was n't at all noisy , but , given the lack of visual stimulation , I do n't even think that that 's a bonus . Also , the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side , and a kind of `` cage '' design on the other . I think it 's supposed to be an optical illusion when it 's spun , but it does n't work at all . Hopefully she 'll find it more interesting as she gets older .	-1
The round rattle with the ball cut the inside of my daughter 's mouth . The plastic separated at the seam and was not readily noticeable . Not a safe product .	-1
i order this because my LO eat her hand often . i decided to give her this but she cried because its so hard . before i gave it to my LO i boiled them for 2 minutes . the mirror broke , the teether with rubber melt . i guess it was my fault . but i used to boil everything i bought before i gave my daughter .	-1
These are cute , but we are not impressed with the quality . These are a baby toy , and as such are going to get dirty and need cleaning . I briefly submerged these in soapy water and all except the butterfly got water inside the `` tube '' portions . They have taken several days to dry out and that 's during the winter with low humidity . Mold and mildew are going to be a serious consideration . Also wondering what 's going to happen once she starts chewing on the toys -- is saliva going to work it 's way in , too ? Would be an ok product if they were sealed better .	-1
This purchase was a waste of money for my . My son has had these for 4 months now and has never paid any attention to any of these . They are made of very hard plastic and not good for teething accept for the squishy part of the butterfly .	-1
I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line . This is a great product - sturdy , good-looking , but there are better products out there . I own this one , but my mom bought one for her house that has so many better features . My daughter got bored with these toys FAST . And lets face it , they get dirty . Evenflo has removable and REPLACABLE toys . You can get new ones . And this Baby Einstein one needs the baby to be pretty tall to start using it . Evenflo starts much lower for shorter babies and it lets them jump a little too - something kids love to do . Good product , but better ones out there for less money	-1
We registered and recieved the Baby Einstein Center thinking that we were getting the most edicational product for our child -- atleast for stationary entertainers . We were wrong . You ca n't understand the spanish and quite frankly it is boring . A friend had bought the Exersaucer ( new model ) for her son and my daughter fell in love with it ( even at 4 months ) . So , we packed up the Baby Einstein and took it back and came home with the Exersaucer . Yes it is more money , but it is also more fun and you can buy different toys to stitch in and out . Invest in fun -- -being a kid is not all learning spanish and english but also learning what fun is as well as cause and effect ! !	-1
I bought this for when we transitioned my daughter from her crib to a twin mattress . I returned it after trying to make it work for a few weeks . No matter what we tried , we could not get the rail to fit snug enough to the bed ... there was always a gap . The metal bar that goes across through the middle pushes against the mattress and creates a gap . We always had to stuff the gap with blankets and even then I felt that it was hazardous if my daughter were to get stuck between the mattress and this bed rail . It got to the point that my husband and I both thought that it would be safer for her to fall out of the bed than to get stuck at night inbetween the mattress and bed rail . We returned it and have n't missed it , she did fine with just putting a row of pillows along the edge of the bed ... thankful for the free return , but wish I saved myself the trouble and just used pillows in the first place .	-1
Product should clearly state ca n't be used on a platform bed , or any bed that does not need a box spring . Rail must clear box spring or lip by a significant amount in order to work . Had to return the item and had to pay a restocking fee . Really Annoying .	-1
Well , I was expecting to get 5 in one for price of one ... had to return the item ... . Flimsy construction and music and vibration do not work , moreover , all fabrics is 100 polyester , smells like factory and it is not possible to remove for washing ...	-1
My daughter slept in this bassinet from birth to around 4 or 5 months . She never had a problem sleeping in it . There is a comfortable pad for her , a night light for checkups in the middle of the night , and a vibrator feature . That said , this thing annoyed my husband and I so much , we cursed it almost daily ! The vibrator feature seemed to have a mind of its own - if it felt like it , it would go on , if not , we were out of luck . I put this item on our registry because I was looking forward to being able to carry around the top from room to room and to wheel it around when necessary . Well , the top weighs a ton when there 's a sleeping baby in it , so I did n't even try to lift it as I was recovering from my c-section . And the wheels seem to only want to go forward and backward , so when I would move it around the room ( which I had to do every day ) I had to shove it with all of my might to turn it . All in all , it was way too much money for the limited use of all of the fancy options that you pay for . A stationary bassinet with no removable top would have been just as good , and a lot cheaper .	-1
My son only slept in this when we took him into the living room in the carrier . He would cry and cry even when we used the vibrating or music feature . Be careful b/c you will trip on the legs ! Just put your baby in the crib do n't waste extra money on a bassinet !	-1
This bassinet is useful for a newborn , as we could take our baby from room to room , but I wish the mattress was sturdier . You can see the dent in our baby 's head makes daily . What 's worse is that when the bassinet basket is placed on the stand , as in the pictures , the mattress and frame dip in the middle . It 's built w/o a sturdy bottom so that it can be converted into a seat for older babies and is a major construction flaw , in my opinion . It helps to place the bassinet basket on a flat surface like the couch or floor , but then we ca n't wheel it it around .	-1
This is a great idea but they do n't stick to the toilet . As soon as I sit my daughter on the seat , the cover pulls off . It 's easier ( and cheaper ) just to put toilet paper on the seat .	-1
I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower . I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $ $ $ back . But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time . Baby Bjorn worked better .	-1
This was not usable at all for me with my newborn . It is complicated to put on and adjust , and my tiny baby was completely enveloped by it , and I did not feel she was very secure in it . I 'm sure this would be great for an older child , for travel , or being out and about , but for trying to hold a small baby while doing chores around the house ( or anything else , for that matter ) , this one 's a no-go .	-1
This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller . The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps . When this does happen , the straps dig into my shoulder . Also , it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward . He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward , but my baby did n't mind facing me . Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier .	-1
I got this as a shower gift and returned it ! My little girl hated it ! She screamed when I put her in it . I think it squeezed her . It was really hard to get on and off and not comfortable for her or for me . Her head was right in front of my chin too . Even if she had liked it , I would have worried that I would hurt her head with my chin . I do n't think this carrier works well for short women with big babies ( she was 8lbs . at birth and we tried it then . )	-1
This product is terrible . I tried it on once . My baby slid to the bottom and her face was completely covered . There are too many snaps and buckles . I got a sling from Hotslings instead . It works great and is MUCH LESS COMPLICATED . I found that when having a baby , keep it simple and LESS IS MORE . If you want a less complex way to carry your baby , go to [ ... ] and check them out .	-1
This carrier was not for us . It was awkward and difficult to use . My son was not comfortable in the carrier either . I exchanged it for the model below and love it ! It 's super easy to use and my son loves it !	-1
We received this carrier as a gift , so we did n't have much input on the selection . We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier , however it just does n't seem to work with our bodies . Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack . The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure , so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free ! We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this ! ! !	-1
it was too big on my small frame and my son 's head wasnt well supported . It was akward to put on and I couldnt see over it ! I am not that small , 5'6 '' and 120lbs ... I dont like it.. I ended up getting a Infantino Spft Carrier instead .	-1
I used this once when my baby was about a month old and the carrier was really tight under his armpits . His arms were forced upward , looking like a bird trying to fly . So I tried it again when he was 4 1/2 months . Now the openings for his legs are not big enough ( facing away from me ... like the bigger babies are supposed to sit in it ) . His legs looked like they were losing circulation , so I had to take him out . This product was not thoughtfully made in my opinion . Not to mention , the clasps that open and close so you can put the child in are not easy to use . I wish I 'd bought something else .	-1
I received this as a gift . I was registered for the baby bjorn . Since it was a gift I decided to keep it . I used it once . It was horrible . it was hot outside , but my 6 week old daughter was sweating in it . It says it 's breathable , but in 80 degree weather it was too hot . Also it made my back sore . Okay for quick trips , but if going out for several hours I suggest investing some money in an adjustable baby sling or pouch like Maya Wrap . There 's several brands out there .	-1
I received this off my baby shower registry . Luckily , we we 're over some really cushy carpet . The right latch ( when facing forward ) did NOT latch tight compared to the left one.My daughter fell out the right leg side , and hit the floor . If you own this , CHECK the strength of the left latch to the right.PLEASE just spend the extra dollar to get a carrier that has an actual locking mechanism . This thing kind of just slide latches into place and offers no real security . Please , please , please - invest in another one and if you own it check the integrity.I really ca n't stress this . Just check the strength , please ? I do n't want to read any other reviews besides mine of a baby falling from this carrier . You 'll be able to tell if its faulty by just comparing how easily the left side comes undone to the right one . If they 're both loose.. Than geez I do n't know.Good luck .	-1
I ca n't wear this item for more than 30 min . at a time b/c it hurts my back so bad ! I 've never had back problems , so that 's not the issue . It just does n't have any back support . Save the $ 20 !	-1
I have tried using this since day one and every time I have used it , it has hurt my back . I do n't find it useful at all . For me , it 's easier to just carry my baby rather than put him in this . If you are in the market for a carrier , go for the Bjorn . It 's so much better , especially on your back !	-1
Our little one had reflux and anytime we put him in the carrier it was a royal mess . There was just enough pressure on his little belly to turn it into a projectile mess . I always felt like his little head was pressed to hard up against Mommy , or if folded down , it jabbed him in the chin . Great theory , but my little man just was n't comfortable .	-1
I received this 5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child . I loved how the birdies were projected onto the ceiling and I loved how sweet the music sounded . It was n't too loud and my son loved it . After he outgrew it I took the batteries out and stored it carefully . Now that my second child is due to be born in a few weeks I took this soother out of the closet and put new batteries in it . The only thing that works is the music and lights . The birds no longer move and the light show does not project . Such a bummer . They just do n't build things to last anymore . So while it did last for about a year with my first child it no longer works and I do n't know why . I just think these baby items should last through more than one baby .	-1
Fisher Price has a great concept , but needs to go back to the designing steps . Rubberized balls would be much quieter and much smoother rollers than plastic . I took our toy apart and lined the spinners with felt so they would not wobble which was creating a noise even without the balls on them . We use racket balls with the toy now and my 6 month old does enjoy the activity.Hope Fisher Price reads these reviews.apep @ chartermi.net	-1
My son loved this toy . Too bad it was n't made to Fisher Price standards . It did n't last . I guess it just wore out - no more spinning . My 18 month-old was a little rough with it holding down the spinning circles and trying to spin them himself . I did n't give it a second thought because you know , it 's Fisher Price . It should be able to handle an 18 month-old ! Sigh . He was getting frustrated it did n't spin anymore I had to get rid of it . What a waste .	-1
My mother purchased this chair for my son and when it came , I was disappointed on the quality of the parts . It 's cheap metal and plastic . My son has issues with gas and reflux so he is in the chair a lot when sleeping as I am afraid to lay him down , the chair is ok as he is only 5 weeks old . My daughter wants to sit in it and when she gets in , it sways . She is 23 months and only 24lbs , it should n't be that flimsy ! The screws are as tight as they can be , but the plastic is just cheap . I will be buying another chair as soon as we can . I just do not trust this chair to hold my children.We had purchased a Jeep brand travel bouncer for my daughter from a tag sale and it is sturdy ! 2 years later it is still intact and usable .	-1
This rocker is cute but does not support babys head from falling to the side . Not suitable for infant . My baby is 11lbs . When he sits in it his chin touches his chest and it looks uncomfortable . Im sure he will grow using it but not now ...	-1
The craftsmanship is iffy . When put together , some of the screws do n't actually screw into anything -- they just sit there . This is probably a defect , but speaks to the lack of quality of the product . Unfortunately , there is so much of this crappy stuff flooding the market .	-1
Bought for us by my father in law . and i hate it . it 's not a swing , not a bouncer , just a chair that vibrates . our son is n't even born yet and i do n't want him in the chair . The toys that hang come off when you barely touch them and are heavy plastic . i also heard it 's very dangerous and tips over . i hate this chair .	-1
Too bad i received a defective set . The legs does n't balance , thus the stopper can not be used because it does n't level with the ground . Returned it and bought another Fisher-price rocker which can recline in 2 positions ! Maybe it 's a blessing in disguise that I 've gotten a defective set haha prefer the new one which I order since it can recline for NB to sleep in	-1
This chair is eh . My daughter was bored and it seems cheaply made . I love Fisher Price products and we have a ton , but this just did n't work for us .	-1
We 're disappointed at the quality of the rocker . In picture , the rocker looks comfortable and cozy . However , when it arrived , we immediately notice how cheap and thin the material is . The cover over the chair frame is very thin , offering little or no cushion at all . My six month old can barely sit in it for more than 5 minutes . The frame and set up of the chair results in very awkward postures . Of the hundres of orders we placed recently , this one was pure dissappointment .	-1
At 8 or 9 months old , my son was strapped into this chair and threw his body forward with enough force to face plant onto a hard wooden floor with the chair on top of him . I was able to watch it on the monitor that has replay and it was totally scarry . Avoid .	-1
I was really disappointed to find that this darling chair has the standard flame retardant label affixed . So I asked the seller what type of flame retardant was used ( hoping for something safer like hydrated silica VS the conventional halogenated ULTRA TOXIC flame retardant ) and got no response . Toxic flame retardant is very controversial due to its probable negative effects on brain development of children . Unfortunately it is in most baby items that are considered furniture . I hope that it is n't used in the item but the lack of response makes me think that it is .	-1
I have this chair but in a different color . I registered for it before I had a baby , so I did n't know much about anything . No , my son is 8 months , and I 've had time to form an opinion . The following are some things to note : -This chair only has one vibration strength- other chairs have several.-The chair only play music if you pull the center elephant-Your baby wo n't be able to pull on said elephant for several months-This means , you must keep pulling the elephant-In fact , baby wo n't be able to play with any of the dangly toys for a while ( my son probably did n't reach for them until about 6 months ) -By 6 months , we were n't using this chair much because my son seemed to want to climb out.-The rocking position is only for kids that can stand up and have legs that reach the ground-The toy bar comes off- if you are lazy ( like me ) and want to slip baby in with the toy bar on , you are likely to bump baby on the head-Baby will not enjoy said head pump . This makes mama feel terrible for being lazy.So , I used this chair a ton in the first 3 months while I showered or cooked . It worked out okay . My baby never fell asleep in it . My parents and my sister had different vibrating chairs . My baby tried those out , too . I have to say , he liked those so much more . He was always falling asleep in the one at my parent 's house . Theirs had ocean/water sounds and a cool ocean scene to watch that seemed to relax him . My sister 's offered a stronger vibration which he also seemed to like more than what this seat had to offer.In the future , I will see how he liked the seat as a toddler . Until then , it 's a dust collector in the corner .	-1
Junk junk junk . I do n't know why so many good reviews . It looks so comfy on the picture , but it is just a piece of plywood covered with nylon , no cushion at all . All the `` fluffness '' you see in the picture is the nylon fabric folded around the metal frame , giving the illusion of cushion . My baby is a chubby 4 month old and slides to the sides because the back is straight with no pillows or any cushion on the sides . My toddler ( 2years old ) likes to climb in the chair but I have to remove the toy bar all the time ... pain the the b . Now I understand why there is another model where the toy bar just swings in and out , without having to be removed . I want to return it but the assembly was such a pain as well , that my husband will be furious to have to unscrew everything again !	-1
i rate this 5 stars for the fabric design , 5 star for the quality but 1 star overall because YOUR BABY WILL TOPPLE OVER ON THE ROCKER MODE.One review said `` Used correctly , this seat is perfect ! , '' and that is true.It is even perfect to rock your infant . And I agree , it is perfect for my toddler . BUT the thing is ... ..my baby can now sit up , ( the reason why babies topple over ) and she loves to bounce herself . She 's now 25 lbs and the max . the Graco Soothe & Swaddle Baby Bouncer will take . I bought this rocker to replace it and it would have been perfect if they put those extra harness over the body/shoulders ( just like the Graco ) to prevent them from toppling over.In short , this rocker is perfect for little infants who cant move , and for big toddlers who can stand up by themselves . What happens to the stage in between ? That means , for safety reasons , this rocker is useless or goes to the storage for about a year ? ( my first born walked at almost 18 mos ) I would suggest Fisher Price put an additional harness . Then it would even be 10 stars : )	-1
Maybe if you are not into the flashing lights , and the music , this would work great . For me , I would like ot be able to keep my baby occupied while I get a couple of things done , and at this stage ( 3 months ) , this still did n't do the trick . She jsut looked at it , expected it to do something when she kicked nothing happened , so boredom set ini . I brought it back . She has a kick and play bouncer ... thank heavens . It keeps her busy for up to an hour before she starts fussing . ( see my review )	-1
Low quality work , the finish is not as nice as it looks in the website photo . The changing pad shape is non standard so you better take this into account because buying another pad or a cover is very hard ( if not impossible ) . The pad that comes with the table is very cheap , I would not recommend using it . We ended up returning it .	-1
We bought this for our infant carrier and it hangs very low and close to our baby 's face . The clip also slips and does not hold on tightly to the bar , and the velcro is not secure enough to rely on alone.We also thought it would be good to hang on our pack n ' play , but it is too heavy to clip on anything . We returned it and found that just hanging little animals on the bar are better than swinging a heavy mobile an inch or two from her face !	-1
First off , the sheet fist well for the DaVinci min crib mattress . However , beware you might not get the print ordered . I have ordered the pink geometric print twice and both times received purple and pink flowers . Not nearly as cute a print as the one pictured . Looking through other reviews it appears that others have had a problem getting the correct print . That is why I gave it a low rating . The sheet is self is great if you do n't care about what print you might get .	-1
This thing BARELY fits a crib mattress . I was disappointed in the size and quality of this item . You really have to fight to get it on the mattress	-1
I guess I did n't read the specs on this one . Really small ball . My one year old boys ca n't find half the time . Dont think I would buy again .	-1
This is the size of a racquetball and the little pieces ( those little heads are about the size of a pencil end ) will only come out from gravity - meaning they only pop out on the side that is facing away from the baby !	-1
I bought this peek-a-boo ball for my then 5-month-old because I thought it was cute and it would be fun for my daughter to manipulate and roll around . We had played with it less than 5 times when one of the circular wooden pieces just fell off along with the little head ! Attached is a picture . I am so thankful that my 5-year-old noticed it and brought it to me . My baby would have definitely put this in her mouth and choked on it . : ( I will definitely be contacting Wonderworld about this product . They really should take toy off of the market . Parents , please do not buy this toy .	-1
I wanted to love this but sadly it went in the trash this past weekend . The product is meant for 12 months and up but Amazon has their own `` choking hazard '' warning stamped on the product page stating the toy is suitable for 3 years and up . I suppose I should have taken more notice . When this toy arrived , I opened the box to find one of the rings had fallen out and one of the little smiley face figures was rolling around at the bottom of the box . I put it back together , thinking it was sturdy and dropped it on the floor several times to see if it would come apart again . It did n't . However , if I tugged a little on it the ring would come out and with it , the smiley figure . So unfortunately , this cute little toy just went in the trash because it really is a choking hazard , per Amazon 's warning . I do not recommend buying this toy : (	-1
I have a 2 month old and I just do not feel comfortable using this carrier . I bought it because it was cheaper than baby bjorn and I thought that it would be the same , but I just do not feel that it is that sturdy . My baby is 14 pounds now and I just can not use it , he does not like it , and I feel like it is going to rip or I will hurt my back using it .	-1
We returned this carrier . The straps kept slipping when we put our son in it , for some reason , we could never get the settings right to get the strap to stop slipping ! Very irritating . My son would get so frustrated that we just gave up and returned it . We 're going to get the Baby Bjorn instead upon recommendation from other parents . This one is a decent price compared to others , but very uncomfortable so not worth it even if it is better priced .	-1
My daughter is now 3 months old and has fallen out of this about 4 times . She is strapped in and correctly positioned , but the straps do not hold a baby in place to where she ca n't fling herself over the side . Just last week I looked over at her and her head was hanging over the side while her feet were still on the bouncer . The toy bar gets old fast , and already she is not interested in it . The only good thing about this chair is the vibration , but definately not worth the $ 40 .	-1
We have not had ANY luck with Fisher-Price products . When this P.O.S . worked for about 6 short weeks though , it was a good product . Ours broke without warning , and now the aquarium part does not work at all . We get music , sound effects , and the blinking lights , but no bubbles and fish/starfish movement . It really sucks to see ( and hear ) the dissapointment on our baby 's face as the aquarium suddenly stopped working ! Also , our other bouncer , a Fisher-Price 'Flutter & Chime ' bouncer , has this plastic bird that vibrates excessively and makes a loud , annoying noise . It is not affixed properly to the product to begin with . We also were dissapointed in the Fisher-Price 'Aquarium Cradle Swing ' , since the swing goes much too fast , even on the slowest setting . All in all , 3 different products by Fisher-Price , and all fell short in expectations and useability . Bottom line- look elsewhere for a better quality bouncer . Clearly , Fisher-Price quality is not too good on many of their seemingly shoddy products.UPDATE : 1/2/2006 After taking this thing apart , and fixing the loose connections inside , I have been using this the past few weeks , and yesterday , my 13 pound , 4.5 month old daughter managed to thrust her head over the side of this bouncer , and she hit the floor ! Despite tightening the straps to the correct length ! Folks , even if you are there supervising your infant , they can thrust themselves off the sides and get hurt . All it takes is a second . This is a FLAWED and DANGEROUS product ! There should be some sort of side-guards or higher side bolsters in order to keep infants from falling off the side . I was lucky in this case , since my infant apparently did not get hurt . I am throwing this product out immediately , and destroying it so nobody else gets their hands on it . It 's that potentially dangerous ! Just read every other review here . So many others have mentioned the same shortcoming . This product should be taken off the market immediately !	-1
Piece of junk . Very noisy . Poor quality . I took it back and got another brand .	-1
We purchased this toy when my son was 3 weeks , prior to buying the swing . My son has never liked this toy . He 'd cry within minutes of being put into it . He 's also very active , which may be the reason why . There is n't much activity other than the vibrating chair , and watching the water bubble up to music or sounds . He just was n't interested . If you had to choose between the swing or this due to money or space , I 'd choose the swing . He loved it .	-1
This bouncer is ok . When my baby was younger and I could n't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep . Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long . It is boring . There are no lights or upbeat songs . There is nothing going on with it , nothing happening , nothing exciting . I wish that there were more lights , along the sides , top , etc . and more activites .	-1
Finding a gate to put in our house was an act of congress , considering that our stairway is wide-set and yet the railing is too low for a standard gate . We needed a gate that was short and long , and finding one was terribly difficult . Add to that the fact that I am far from handy , and you had about four returns ( of gates that I could n't make work ) , a few sets of drill holes in my stairway and a major headache before I finally got this ` Safety 1st Perfect Fit ' gate installed.Right off the bat I had some issues with the way the gate closed . The adjustable end , that can tilt to accommodate an uneven wall , is incredibly annoying to maneuver . This is not a door you can simply open and close . This is a door that you need to open , then adjust in order to close again , fiddling with it to get it so slide into the wall brackets correctly . Oh , that reminds me , I MOUNTED THIS TO THE WALL WITH SUPPLIED HARDWARE , so in case you are thinking of using this as a pressure mount , this review may not apply . This was an irritant , but it was a last resort type gate anyways , and if it kept my kids from stumbling down the stairs then I 'm happy ; even if I have to continually mess with the thing in order to use it.But , then came my biggest issue . I 've only had the gate up for a week , and in that week I noticed that it was starting to come loose . You see , there are no anchors supplied with this gate . Anchors are pretty necessary when securing something this heavy into a wall . I realized that after the screws started coming loose from the weight of the door hanging open throughout parts of the day . I went to screw the screw back in tighter and the whole door came off the wall.THAT 'S NOT SAFE ! What if that had been my kids pushing on the gate when it came loose ? I mean , these gates , especially ones that are advertised as being safe for the top of the stairs , should factor in the fact that some children ( most children ) are not going to want to stay behind that gate . My youngest pushes on that gate a lot , trying to get out . I expect that the gate is going to protect them , keep them locked in so that they do n't take a tumble down the stairs.I think it 's safe to say that I 'm not happy with this gate . I had to go buy my own anchors and redrill in order to make it safer for my kids . At nearly $ 50 , this gate should come with everything needed to make it work . I should n't have to spend MORE MONEY in order to makeshift this gate into being what it should have been to begin with.UGH ! To be fair , there are a few things I do like about this gate . At first I was a tad put off by the bulkiness , but I actually like the look , and the locking feature really does lock ( that pressure lock is tight and does n't budge , which is a real plus ) . Besides , it is not a gate that my kids can unlock , even my oldest . It needs an adult hand in order to get it open , and that is important with a gate intended to keep your children safe . My only wish is that this gate as a whole would have come together in a more satisfactory way .	-1
my mother purchased this gate because she didnt want to put holes in the wall , and it is similar to the hardware mounted gate i own and love . the one she bought is a piece of crap , after trying to put it up for 10 minutes , and it still isnt secure .	-1
This gate does not keep enough pressure to stay in place , my toddler can knock it right over w/ little effort .	-1
Once again the world of baby gates shows that they have very little grasp on how real live houses are built . I bought this gate for the `` adjustable '' feature - I have baseboards throughout the house and needed a gate that could handle those . I thought I had found the gate . Brought it home and discovered the adjustment is available only on one side - rendering it useless . How difficult would it have been to make both sides adjustable ? How often is there baseboarding on only one side of an opening ? This design strikes me as a good idea but the execution is ridiculously bad . The designers apparently sacrified the 'adjustable ' feature of the gate in order to make it both pressure- and wall-mounted . That was a very poor trade-off in my opinion . It 's so hard to find gates that can handle uneven fixture points ; this gate should have stuck to that feature alone.Most irksome is that the product 's packaging intentionally obscures the non-adjustable side so you ca n't see it 's non-adjustable . I thought that was sleazy . This gate is going back tomorrow .	-1
I wanted to like this gate- I like the features but sadly it did not meet my hopes . first off- its way cheaper elsewhere . also the plastic is very cloudy- not see through at all which I expected it to be . I use it for the bottom of my stairs and I looked everywhere for a walk- through gate that did not have a bar that goes along the floor since I am very clumsy . I used it pressure mounted first and it pulled the paint off the wall from being too tight a fit or fell over being too loose a fit- it never seemed right . so we mounted it to the wall and that was a pain ! I give 2 stars since when it is hardware mounted it does swing nicely and my kids can not figure this gate out- they have been able to figure out the other gates opening mechanisms ! I would only recommend this gate for specific circumstances .	-1
I bought this as a Christmas present for my pregnant wife . At first , like many reviewers , she loved it , but as time went by it fell flat ... literally . The pillow is filled with cotton fill , the kind you would buy at a department store if you were going to make a decorative throw pillow . This means the pillow falls flat and gets divots where there is constant pressure . My wife is petite so she is not wearing the pillow down , it is just poorly made . Not really worth the money , but it is a nice alternative to the larger pillows . My wife did like it before it fell flat and she does still use it from time to time .	-1
I got this about 3 years ago and used it through my last pregnancy . I started using it again for my current pregnancy and am recalling the frustrations I had with it . ( who needs the added frustration from a pillow when you 're pregnant and uncomfortable ? ! ? ) The shape of this pillow is nice , but the widest part is a little too wide & takes up a lot of space in bed - bulky . The slip cover is nice & washes well ( gentle & cold ) .I agree with others - the stuffing separates and clumps up . It 's also too soft & squishy to give enough support . I expected it to be firmer , like the regular Boppy pillow , but it 's no where near . It quickly flattened-out in the areas where I needed the most support , so I end up fluffing the stuffing every time I try to use it and then folding over the widest part to get more support.I tried it for nursing , and my son just sank down into it - WAY too soft . I used it under the regular Boppy a few times when I needed him a bit higher than just the Boppy would support . I like it best as a back support while sitting up to nurse in bed.I got the other , bigger Boppy pillow for pregnancy , but it was also way too soft , and took up entirely too much room.I 'd recommend to get this if you do n't need much support and like a squishy & very soft pillow . For most people , I 'd say to try something else . A regular , comparatively inexpensive bolster pillow combined with a small toss pillow under the belly has worked best for me !	-1
I bought this despite hearing that it is too hard , and now I wish I would have listened . I am in the last half of my 2nd trimester , so maybe I 'll use it more later , but for now it works best for back support when I 'm sitting on the couch . When I have used it for sleeping I wake up with a sore abdomen , because the wedge is hard . I also have a snoogle pillow , and find that it works better alone , instead combined with the wedge . I hope the manufacturer will improve upon this wedge by making it with a material more like memory foam , which would make it softer , but still supportive . I am only 5'2 '' , with a very short abdomen , so maybe the wedge made me sore because it went under my ribs , which were the most tender when I woke up .	-1
The wedge is nice if I am sitting on the couch for my back , but not that great for side sleeping . I found a simple pillow does best .	-1
This only provides basic to support to the very side of the belly , nothing to help with the rest or the top .	-1
I was going to order one of these but ended up finding one still in the package at the thrift store . I 'm really glad I did n't pay full price for it because it 's way too hard to sleep with . I 've had it since about 5 months and now I 'm 8 months and having major sleep issues again . The only way it 's of any use is to put it under your back if you have another pillow under your tummy . It 's just not comfortable though and I end up ditching it for a regular pillow after about 10 minutes . It 's not a pillow it 's a hunk of very firm foam .	-1
This has a loud , annoying squeak and does really bounce all that well . My MIL bought it for a visit and ours ( Graco ) is much , much better.We 've had no problems with safety issues .	-1
I originally wrote a review about this giving it 5 stars , but since my son has learned to jump using his Graco Bumper Jumper at my house , he ca n't figure out how to jump on this one at his dad 's house and ends up getting very frustrated . The toy bar is great . He loves it and likes looking at his reflection.It 's built backwards , if you will . Most jumpers have springs that coil together as the child jumps up , and stretch as the child comes back to the ground , allowing him to be pulled back into the air- allowing him to jump and giving him the assistance needed to jump off the ground . This jumper is built backwards . I 'm not sure if it 's my jumper or Evenflo built this one funny . As the child is placed into the jumper , the coils come together . The top of the sheath ( this holds the straps ) over the coils is on top of the coils , which allows the jumper to be built the way it is . So picture this ... the child is trying to jump , when usually , he can be pulled into the air . For the child to get started jumping on the Evenflo , in theory , he has to pull himself *down* to get the spring action to jump up . For a baby , this just does n't work.I 'm giving it two stars because the toy bar is great and my son eventually figured it out . He still LOVES the Graco Bumper Jumper much better , and it even has the pads to prevent him from hurting his fingers . Please consider the Graco instead . Your child will thank you !	-1
This item i not sturdy and is universal , which means it might fit some seats and not others . It comes off easily from our seat .	-1
I was very excited to receive this but it was a huge disappointment it was not well made smaller than I expected . Over all not very good , I tried to return it but I was told to dispose it and I got my money back .	-1
My son is on the large size . He is 37 '' tall & 39 pounds . These seat is too small for him . The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard . The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks . He hates it . He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole . This one will be placed on Freecycle . I only recommend this for those training very small children .	-1
well . it 's cute and all but my daughter is 2 1/2 and almost fully trained but the opening is a bit small causing a few accidents here and there.I would n't recommend it or buy another one of these .	-1
This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it . The handles offer added security for early potty use . We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet . However , the less-used one recently split at the seams ! Sadly it 's past the return date.The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles.My parents bought theMommy 's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it 's much comfier , much easier to clean AND it 's only $ 10 . Oh , and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use . I 'd recommend that one instead .	-1
First , I did n't like that I had to put it together . The soft ring itself is crappy . My daughter weights 25 lbs and it 'flattened ' after 2 days of use ( exposing the plastic underneath and making it uncomfortable for her to sit on ) . It is VERY poorly made and to be honest , I am surprised it 's even on the market . Went to Target and bought a REAL one ( which cost me $ 2 less than this POS ) and is made a million times better ( and comes complete with a potty hook for the toilet ) . I did n't feel like dealing with the return so I just threw it out . What a WASTE of money ...	-1
I like the look and feel of this seat , unfortuantely that is the only positive things I can say about it . First , the seat does not fit properly on a standard size toliet , I 've tried every possible orientation . It slips and slides all over the place , not helpful when trying to convience a toddler that the toliet is a safe place . Second , the `` potty whole '' for lack of a better term is really small , if my toddler was able to use it , I 'm not sure all the `` yuck '' would not get all over the seat . Lastly , my son hates the pee-pee shield on the front . I think this is a good idea to have with a little boy , but because the whole is so small the shield ends up scrapping and agiating him . ALSO , this shield should be removeable , you just do n't need it for a little girl . Needless to say , I 'm now looking for a new potty seat . : (	-1
We got this as a second potty seat so my son would have child sized potties on both floors . Assembly is easy and the seat is very soft but the hole is significantly smaller than the other seats we have , forcing us to use the splash guard which my son does n't like . As other reviewers have mentioned , clean up is messy , and the seat can be wiggly .	-1
First thing ... ..they mailed me a blue one with black on the seat but it was still Disney red car . Second ... you have to assemble the seat : the plastic seat , the cushion , the pee guard , then the sticky tab . I particularly do n't mind assembly ... but this was annoying ... .because all I could think was how in the hell I was going to rinse this clean every time . Too many disconnecting parts ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This gym was given to us at a shower , and I was excited because I had read some good reviews ... plus it was like $ 70.00 and no way would I have ever paid that ! We started using it when my son was around 2 months old , and he had no interest in it . He 'd look at the water box and lights for a few seconds , but it was hard to get it to play music ( you had to literally slap it , and I think it should have easily came on when the gym jiggled ) and the music was really low . We tried new batteries , which did n't help . The 3 toys it comes with are really uninteresting ... one is a plastic fish that like Morgan 's Mommy 's review stated `` Resembled a dog toy . '' The stuffed turtle did nothing , and the little plastic book was n't very interesting since my son was 2 months old . The toys just hung there ... and he was not happy at all . The flaps on the bottom of the mat might have been interesting later on , but there were 3 different languages on them and since my son ca n't it seemed a little pointless . I tried several times letting him play in this gym , since just because it seemed boring to me , did n't mean it was to him . But , at every attempt he laid there and looked and the gym for a couple of minutes , and then his attention would go to looking around the room , the tv , the dog , or other toys laying near.I took this gym back to Babies R Us , and it was on clearance for $ 40 ( not really surprising ) . I exchanged it for the Fisher Price Rainforest Gym , and my son loves everythig about it and so do I ... and I totally recommend it !	-1
We received this as a shower gift and have tried over the last 4 months to get our son to use it . The mirror is the only part he seems interested in and it only entertains him for a few minutes . Colors are way to dull . Wish we would have done a little more research before registering for this .	-1
This product says 100 % cotton right at the top in the details , but it is not ! ! I ordered it just for that reason and was disappointed to find that it was 60 % polyester , 30 % cotton ... I returned the item and received a full return in about two weeks . Was kind of a hassle though , wish it was advertised correctly !	-1
Just received my mini co-sleeper sheet . Will return it . I did not notice but it 's 65 % polyester . I myself would never choose to sleep on a poly sheet . Why should my baby ? Hardly anything could be better than cotton for a baby 's sheet ! .	-1
The velcro that attaches to the mattress does keep the sheets snug , but getting the sheet off requires some force and can pull too [ ... ] the seams of the bed . I do n't trust that no damage is going to occur.I bought the expensive organic sheet from Arm 's Reach for the mini co-sleeper , and I like it because the velcro does not attach . Maybe that 's a flaw , but it is so much easier to get on and off ( and avoid damaging the bed ) , and it 's plenty snug . Plus , no pesticides used with it .	-1
Arm 's Reach really knows how to rob people . These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them . I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind . But considering that this is an item that you 'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up , it pains me to pay full price for them . The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed ( possibly b/c of all the velcro ? ) . I 've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage . But , if you 're the type of person who does everything by the book , the air drying can be inconvenient if you do n't have another clean sheet on hand .	-1
I 'm not satisfied with Madela pump in style ! It 's very expensive but it does n't work well , you need to wait an hour before you can pump the amount of milk you want . I do n't like it at all ... I called madela and offer no help . What a peace of junk ! ! !	-1
I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often . It 's a hassle to secure in place , and most times it is pretty flimsy if you ca n't get it 's `` spring locks '' to lock into place . It 's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth , teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it . And sometimes it 's almost impossible to `` unlock '' it to take it down , and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children ; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things , or is up walking around . It would probably give way if a child tried climbing , leaning , or pulling on it.Not very good at all ; definitely not worth the price . You could find something much better for around the same cost .	-1
It 's ironic that my son would break his arm over something I bought to help protect him . He was 2 years old . I wanted a gate that was wide , could expand to a wider width on top than on bottom to accommodate the baseboards . I did n't want anything with footholds that he could use for climbing . This gate fit the bill nicely.What happened ? My son tried to climb the gate anyway . He was able to get his leg over the top bar and when he did , the material on the top bar slid over and around the bar . He could n't grip the bar and slid right over the top , breaking his arm . Try gripping a metal bar with a loose padded nylon sleeve and you will see how difficult it is to grip the bar . Is this just a freak accident ? Probably , but I ca n't see myself giving 5 stars for a safety product that my child defeated.Pros : +expands to a wide width up to 60 inches+can make the top and bottom different widths to accommodate baseboards+easy to expand via a twisting motion+does not mar doorways+pressure mounted , is portable+mesh panel has no footholdsCons : -no door- can not be used at top of the stairs because it is pressure mounted-if the kid gets over the top , he will fall right over ! ______________________________UPDATE : So it 's been a few years and I 'm no longer afraid my son would fall over the gate . I have a dog and was trying to prevent the dog from going into the dining room from the kitchen . Out comes this gate . My son was 7 and my daughter 4 . The kids never went through that door per my instructions . Well , you know kids . This time , it was my daughter who tried to climb the gate . She also had the problem of not being able to get a grip on the top bar . She slid over the top and fell smack right on her face.Thought it was a fluke the first time . This gate really is n't made for climbers .	-1
My daughter has reflux and we purchased this wedge in the hopes that she 'd be comfortable sleeping on her back in the crib while slightly elevated . This is not helpful . We placed it under her sheets and mattress cover but all my daughter did was slide right down or off to the side . You can probably get the same effect from strategically folding towels . I would n't recommend this to help your baby with reflux sleep.Ultimately , we purchased the the Fisher Price Rock 'n Play for our daughter instead after reading a bunch of reviews from parents with refluxy babies and our daughter LOVES it . It sits at an angle , cuddles the child 's sides , and allows you to physically rock the baby back and forth as she goes to sleep . Unhappily , our girl loves it so much that she 's still sleeping in it at 8 months and we ca n't figure out how to get her to a crib -- but the wedge is n't the way to do it .	-1
If was totally useless in our situation . Did not help with baby 's burping and in addition my baby kept sliding down .	-1
My doctor recommended putting my babies at a 30 degree angle due to acid reflux . I purchased this but my babies roll off completely . I tried putting all kinds of padding on it , but my kids still roll off . Its just not comfortable , I am sending it back .	-1
This does its job of lifting my daughter 's head during short naps ... during longer sleep periods she just rolls to the bottom and ends up laying flat . The product info does not tell you that this is foldable and has a zipper in the middle ... which means that there is a really hard , uncomfortable bump in the middle of the bottom where the zipper ends . Baby has to be placed to one side and not in the middle of the crib to avoid lying on the bump . Also , the width is narrower than my crib mattress , so there are unsafe gaps at the sides . Not good since baby has to be placed closer to the side . And since there is nothing to secure the wedge to the mattress , a tight crib sheet makes this scoot away from the head of the crib , leaving an unsafe gap there , too . Overall , I 'm pretty disappointed , but at least it was cheap ( and a gift ) . I 'll keep using it until I find something better . Notice that another person posted a picture showing the two different versions of this wedge ... I would suggest finding a store to buy at rather than ordering from Amazon , since you do n't know which one they will actually send you . The foldable one is no good !	-1
The wedge has a pretty big bump where it meets the mattress and our son just slid down the side of it . We only tried using it one night and then took it out . I would not recommend it .	-1
When I received this wedge , I was surprised by hom flimsy it was and how small . Would not recommend using it in crib , since baby can easily roll off either side ( It does not fill the with of the crib by far ) . It comes in two pieces , we ended up putting one in the stoller bassinet and one under the mat of our child 's activity gym , and have to keep watching him while he is on it since he can roll off so easily . What did work for us was to elevate the crib mattress by just placing a few towels underneath , much better solution than this wedge .	-1
I am not exaggerating - this stupid wedge almost killed my 2 month old ! We wrap a blanket around the edges of the crib , as the hospital taught us to do , so that it does not move . We did that on the first night using the wedge . To my absolute horror , my baby slid down the wedge and his entire head was trapped underneath the blanket . He was swaddled so could do nothing about it . HE COULD HAVE SUFFOCATED ! ! ! This seemingly innocuous product should be removed from the market . I wanted to help my baby sleep , not kill him . Days later and I am still sick to my stomach over it .	-1
Purchased this item since my daughter has acid reflux and can not sleep laying flat . I was unsure how she would do with it so we just tried it at nap time . Everytime we put her down it would n't take her long to slide down and almost into the bumper ( she is only a month old ) . Even if we took the bumper out I am not going to let her slide down and hit her head on the railings . This product is a waste of money !	-1
I put it under bed for my infant son and he just went right off it . pointless item . I just wanted something to have where his head is a little more up . going to have to find something else ... ..	-1
not much of an incline was hoping for more and the material could be a bit better would 've been nice to have the option of a cover	-1
Not sure if it is clear in the description , but this wedge has two pieces of foam and a zipper up the back . The zipper can actually be felt at the bottom front of the wedge . I ca n't really lay my son in the middle of this wedge , because the zipper from the back causes a hard bump at the bottom , front , middle of this wedge . Also , there is not much of an incline with this wedge . Overall , just not a great product and I wish I would not have purchased this .	-1
Save your money and roll up a towel or use an old phone book ( remember those ? ) and place it under the crib mattress to elevate the head . Once your baby is old enough to scoot around , he or she will slide down off this wedge or worse , off the side .	-1
I got this as my baby had reflux . She would slide down even if she moves a little in her sleep . I guess you could just use a hard pillow you have at home instead of wasting money on this .	-1
It really upsets me that this product is sold for babies when it is a piece of flame retardant treated foam covered in vinyl . I will keep looking for a different product to use for my baby 's crib , and I hope enough people will refuse to buy unsafe products so that manufacturers start providing us with better options .	-1
Our 3 month old daughter has horrible GERD since birth . She 's on meds , special formula , cereal added , we keep her upright for feedings and for an hour afterwards , etc . We were able to raise the head of the bassinet which she quickly outgrew , but not the new crib . Our pediatrician whose son also had severe GERD basically said good luck because she 's going to probably have to sleep in her swing until she 's a year old . No way do I want to do that ! It 's fine for a nap , but she never sleeps as deeply in her swing and she really needs to be trained on good sleep habits like all other kids or she 'll have problems all her life ( and I 'm speaking from experience , I had her same issues as a kid and have had lifelong insomnia -- now I know why ) . This under the mattress is working well for us for right now . During the transition from the bassinet , we had to put this in the middle of the crib for a few nights with a towel around her to keep her from sliding down and from freaking out . The first night we did n't do this and it was a disaster even though we 'd introduced her to the crib earlier with no problems . She moved in her sleep and when she could n't figure out where the heck she was with all this space and even with my picking her up immediately ( we co-sleep in the same room with her ) she screamed and fretted for a good hour ( staring at me as if she wanted to make sure it WAS Momma and nothing else had changed ! so sad but adorable at the same time ! ) .When I went to remake the crib once she was used to it ( we just kept spreading the towel around her until she was used to the extra room , it took 3 nights ) and I moved the wedge up , there was a VERY unsafe gap . While someone ( MIL ... .sigh ) suggested that if I *had* to 'mess with it ' to just roll up towels , but this is so not a good idea . Very dangerous ! Instead I put this under the mattress and it solved the problem even if the angle does n't seem to be quite as high . As far as wedges go , this is a decent price although the price fits the cheap quality ( two pieces and it off gases terribly ) . We 're going to replace this as soon as we find something that works better ( and is safer and made with better materials ) .So yes , it works , but I ca n't recommend it .	-1
Everything everyone else said PLUS : Previously frozen packs can not be put into the compartemnts as they did n't freeze in the proper shape.And yes , rotating is a pain .	-1
Have to agree with the other reviews - wish I 'd looked before I bought this . I think this is a pretty new product and when I saw it at BRU it seemed like a good idea . BUT , it DOES NOT hold what it says it does . I 've found the same thing other reviewers did - that you can only get about 12 bags in there.I 'm very disapointed because I 've generally liked the First Years products . The drying rack and the bottle warmer are great . This is the first that will be going back !	-1
I got this as a gift and I wish I had a gift receipt to return it ... I takes up too much space in the freezer and only holds 12 bags . Before I got this organizer , I used a tall rectangular snapware container with a lid ; it held more bags and took less space in my freezer . I 'm definitely going back to my good old container , I hope to find another use for this .	-1
I regret buying this , it seemed so convenient to have all the listed items in one package , but it is just poorly manufactured items , and there are much better items out there . Just buy them separately because you will end up doing that anyways if you buy this set .	-1
I thought I needed a kit like this when I was registering for my 1st baby . I recieved this as a shower gift and it turns out , I never even used most of it . The nail clippers are great ( buy them seperatly ! ) , but the nasal aspirator does n't work at all and I never used the medicine dispensers since all of my daughters ' medicine had dispensers . Bottom line , compete waste of money- but buy the nail clippers !	-1
Cheap Cheap Cheap Only thing good is the finger nail clippers . We got a better pair free from hospital . Everything just screams cheap !	-1
This kit contains a nasal aspirator , digital thermometer with case , soft-tip medicine dispenser , comfort tip medicine spoon with cap , magnifying nail clipper and a travel/storage bag.Pros : Comes as a set in a bag ( you do n't loose items as easily.Cons : -I 'd rather have the smaller nail clippers without magnifying glass-The nasal aspirator from the hospital is better-I think it is dangerous to use the medicine dispensers included versus the droppers that come with medicationsSummary : It is convenient to have a bag with everything you `` need , '' but this might be more than you need , or different than you need .	-1
Our daughter is now 13 months old and the only item we use in this kit is the nail clippers . The thermometer is unreliable and the rest of the plastic pieces are so poorly made they 're useless . I wish that I had just bought nail clippers separately .	-1
These were too small , and did not fit my Bosch stove gas handles . = ( Sad I could n't use these , but the concept is great .	-1
plastic melts in heat . These are plastic , if you leave the oven door open for any amount of time the metal pin hinge in the cover conducts the heat from the oven and melts the hinge ...	-1
I was excited to get these to protect my 15 month old from turning on the stove , but when they arrived , I discovered that you must remove the stove knobs in order to install the covers . I wish I had known ! The stove in our apartment does n't have removable knobs.AND as soon as my daughter saw the covers , she wanted to play with them . I can only imagine how much more a toddler would WANT to play with the stove knobs with these covers on ! In my opinion , it was a poor choice on my part and a waste of money . : ( Having a hard time finding covers to fit over knobs without having to remove them . If anyone has an idea , please let me know ! Thank you .	-1
These are quite oversized , so if your knobs are close together they do n't work at all since you ca n't even put them all one at once .	-1
Save your eight dollars and just take off the knobs for a while . I store them in a locked cabinet and then when I cook I just put them back on then remove them when Im done . Then when your child is old enough just put them back on . I have found this to be the easiest method of protection concerning stoves.PS I also had the same problems as below thats how I came to this idea	-1
I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface . THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around . Also a few of my knobs pull off easily . My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come , both knob and cover . Then it 's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover . They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to . I 'm just not sure if it 's worth it . It probably depends on your stove .	-1
These were childproof for a while until my son turned two . Now he can easily get them to open . Just recently , he opened one and then turned on the knob to our gas stove filling the kitchen with the smell of gas . Luckily , it was n't on for long before I noticed and was able to open up all the windows to air out the smell of gas . So now I need to look for a different child proofing alternative . : (	-1
They suck , my DS broke ALL of them off . I dont think i even had these for 2 months . Quality is not there- how can this work if the kids break them all off ?	-1
they lasted about an hour on my stove , untill my 2 yr old pulled them right off . now shes running around the house with her new favorite rattles . after getting them off the stove it only took her seconds to figure out how to open them . would not recommend product .	-1
We have a Smaller , compact Viking and these did not work on our stove -- the knobs popped right off when we put these on ... .knobs would n't stay on and we had to send back .	-1
We bought these in our first round of babyproofing , maybe too early , and by the time he was tall enough to reach the knobs , they had melted and/or the caps did n't work or came off completely . Our oven door is directly under the knobs , so maybe they 'd work better on a different type of stove . I just think they should be more heat resistant ... and maybe a little easier to open ( sometimes , after they started to wear , I 'd need two hands , so I 'd hafta set down what I had in the other hand ... a little annoying ) . Anyway , we 're just teaching him `` dangerous '' and `` hot '' and that really seems to be working better than gadgets , right now .	-1
We read all the reviews and while mixed , we decided to try them out . The bottom line is that they do n't really do the job . There are two problems with them : ( 1 ) it is pretty easy for our 20 month old child to remove them by either simply pulling on them and removing the knob from the stove panel or by unlatching them ( he primarily just pulls on them and the knob with cover comes off ; one of the reasons that the knobs come off easily is that the plastic covers take up space and therefore the knobs ca n't be pushed in all the way , therefore their `` grip '' on the stove is compromised ) , and ( 2 ) every time you need to use the stove you have to unlatch the covers which becomes burdensome.Anyway , we threw them in a box for storage after a few weeks of trying to deal with them . Unfortunately , i do n't know what alternatives we have to address this hazard .	-1
I used this for about 3 months and at first it worked great and I was so happy to keep my toddler out of the fridge . After some time the stickiness wore off and my toddler pulled open the door . Its very hard to get the glue off the fridge now .	-1
I did not realize there was a deluxe version of this product until I ordered this online . I already have , what I now know is the deluxe version , which I purchased at my local baby store . I loved it so much that I wanted another one for my husband 's car . This potty is extremely flimsy . It 's too low to the ground & can not hold my daughter 's weight . My daughter is 37inches & 32 lbs . Unless you have a super petite child I would not buy this . When my daughter sat on it the legs buckled ( & yes I made sure they were clicked in ) .	-1
We had a Potette Plus for about a year and it is a fantastic product that held up well and was perfect for both toilet seat use and stand-alone potty use outdoors . Then we accidentally lost it and replaced with this version , not realizing that it can only be used as a stand-alone , and NOT also on toilets such as in restaurants , playground bathrooms , etc . Do yourself a favor and buy the Plus to get maximum use out of this terrific , indispensable product .	-1
I should have paid closer attention to what I was ordering . This is not the Potette Plus 2-n-1 . This one is not nearly as sturdy , and is obviously not versatile . It is only a free standing potty . You can not open the handles all the way to use as a potty seat on a regular toilet . Spend the extra $ 5 and get the Plus 2-n-1 !	-1
I took this on a short trip , it proved useless . It 's unstable , has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby 's bottom -- I ca n't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this ... especially a potty-training child ? My daughter was fairly young when we tried it ( we did some early PT , and she was about 10 months old ) . She 's now 2 , fully pt , but will still not go near it . If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old , how would it do under the weight of an older child ? Beyond me.I still give it 2 stars , because it 's an otherwise neat idea . Impractical execution , though .	-1
we have owned both this and the potty plus . There are some things I really enjoyed about this potty , but out of the two I strongly prefer the potty plus.Pros : *This potty is very small and easy to pack . LOVE THE SIZE . though my three year old is getting to big for it . *can buy small 5gal hefty bags to use in these . *can easily be set up . easy enough that my 2 and 3 year old can set it up by themselves.Cons : *though it is easy to set up , it is not always easy to lock the legs in properly . *I find it a bit flimsy and have worried that it will collapse while my child is on it . This has only actually happened once . She was unharmed but i wonder about pinched fingers . *can only be used on the floor.I give the 2 star rating because the flimsiness causes safety concerns . Public bathroom breaks with 2 toddlers need to be easy , fast , safe and manageable . I think this product does n't provide the security for me to watch BOTH children . I have to focus to much on the one on the potty . The potty plus DOES give me that security , but this one does not . I also find that that though I love the SIZE and easy of packing , this does n't make up for my not being able to use it on a toilet seat . basically . its a decent potty in a pinch , but not a great staple travel potty .	-1
I bought this for my 21 month old who is just starting to potty train . I thought this could be used either free standing with the bag attached or on top of a regular potty as a potty seat . I have seen another potty that looked just like this one where the feet flip out so you can use it over a regular potty , but you ca n't do that with this one . This one can only be used sitting on the floor with the bag attached . It is so short and flimsy and the seat is so thin that it looks terribly uncomfortable . My daughter does n't seem to like it very much , but she will use it if she has no other choice . I also do n't like the idea that you have to use it with a bag and absorbent pad attached . That seems so environmentally unfriendly and , if you buy the bags , you do n't save much over using diapers . I 'm glad this was n't too expensive because I 'll probably be buying a different one for travel purposes . The only positive thing I 've found about this one is that it is very small , light , and portable . It will fit in my diaper bag or even a large purse so it is easy to carry around .	-1
This would be a great idea for potty training a newborn . It is way too small . I started potty training my daughter early and even when she was a year old it was too small for her . It sits way too low to the ground , and the seat itself is not even a seat . It 's just a plastic ring which must be horribly uncomfortable . My daughter refused to use it , so I 'm stuck with it and the extra 4 packs of liners for it .	-1
After reading all the reviews I decided to go ahead with this purchase anyway . Other reviewers warned that this would take your door right off the hinges if it was pushed too hard , but I figures , how hard can my 14th month old really push anyway ? He loved to close doors and I thought these would be perfect to keep him from getting stuck in a room or losing a finger in the door . It certainly stopped my toddler from closing the door , which was great . However after only 3 uses my door started separating from the wall at the top hinge and now I do n't need the door stopper at all , the door wo n't even close now . Hopefully we can repair/replace the hinge without too much trouble , but dont bother wiht this product . Try the Safety 1st no drill door stopper , works awesome , and I 've had one in place for 6 months and absolutley no problems with that door whatsoever .	-1
We purchased this at Walmart , for a little more than this one cost . Right out of the box , the music did not work . The mobile part worked for a few seconds before it quit . We are returning and will not get another . This is cheaply made and I would not risk buying it since most likely you will just return it .	-1
The mobile is too heavy and it simply does not attach properly to the crib ( it slides forward and since the construction is so cheap I have no confidence that it wo n't dettach and fall in the crib ) . I was very happy to find such a cheap mobile to replace our old/broken one since I was only hoping to get 4-6 weeks of use before converting to a music box since my ( preemie ) baby is already 5mo old but still unable to get up on hands and knees .	-1
These covers were the only ones that I could find that would fit my changing pad ( LA Baby 4-sided changing pad ) . They are made with poor materials , are too thin , stain , and both of mine snagged on my wedding ring every time I would pick up the baby , so there would end up being long strands of terry cloth hanging off of them everywhere . I cut one up and used it as a template to make my own changing pad covers out of old towels , that was the only good thing it did for me .	-1
These changing pads are made from a towel-like material of very poor quality which is shedding continuously bits and pieces even after washing . The way they are made is also very poor and pieces of thread are coming off . Do not waste your energy by even considering buying them !	-1
The suction cups wo n't stick to the formica around our tub . I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile , but I see that others with tile tub surrounds ca n't get it to stick either . Now that I think about it , suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too , so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder . This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money , I 'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead . I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same .	-1
Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath , but one side does n't seem to want to stick to the walls .	-1
We got this before we remodeled our bathroom and it would n't stick to the tile . We figured it was just because the tile was old . So we put it away until after the remodel . Well nearly 100 % of tub units we saw had U shaped corners as opposed to the V shape you need for this to work . SO we got a new bathroom and the thing still does n't work . But based on the other reviews I see we are n't the only ones with this problem.We ended up with a $ 5 buck toy net that sticks to the wall perfectly !	-1
When I misplaced my Sippy Stuff brushes during my recent move I decided to get these due to all of the positive reviews . I have to say , I am terribly disappointed . These brushes are so much more flimsy than expected and they do n't go all the way through the straws like my other one did . The bristles also come apart after a few uses . Take my advice , skip this one . If you are looking to buy a quality bottle and straw brush get theSippy Stuff Straw Cleaning Brush ( 2-Pack ) and thePhilips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brush . I guarantee , you wo n't need to buy another bottle brush ( no matter what type of bottle you get ) for years . I 've had the Avent since my first child ( 2008 ) and the Sippy Stuff since 2009 and both held up really well over the years . I 've decided to count this purchase as a loss and buy the SS brush that I 'm used to . I 've seen countless brushes come and go in my house in the past but these two really stand the test of time . I give the Dr brown brush 2 stars and not 1 because it works if you are looking for something more disposable .	-1
I bought these because after having my Dr. Browns bottle for a short period of time ( a month or so ) the little brush that came with the bottles started to rust . I was putting it on the window ledge above my sink , which the sun hits and apparently wasnt drying it out quick enough . With these I just put a finishing nail in the ledge so it now hangs with no side touching anything . I would have bought pipe cleaners but I didnt want to take a chance of putting something that shouldnt be near my babies mouth on a piece that feeds him . However , why is Dr. Brown using such cheap metal to make something that is cleaning something supposed to be sterile ? would it have been that much more money to just use some stainless steel for the middle part and avoid babies ingesting rust ? I feel like I dont have an option but to buy these to clean my bottles so I did ... not to mention how much those bottles leak ! I recently just purchased Tommie closer to nature bottles that also have the same colic middle rigging , maybe there product , including the cleaning wand , wont be so cheap . one other thing , the metal at the tip of the wand gets stuck in the little holes , like it wasnt bent down far enough , which is silly because this product is meant to fit in this bottles pieces..come on dr brown ! ! ! !	-1
You 'd do just as well with pipe cleaners ( you can get them in the craft department of lots of stores ) . They 're a lot cheaper too .	-1
I have used these bottles for my three kids and love them ! The problem : these are not the same bottle as pictured ! Playtex is redesigning these and sending out the new design instead if the one pictured . The ones in the picture are awe-some ! The ones they sent bend halfway to help feeding while sitting up , which is n't a concern I have . The lid rings have a new locking mechanism and are next to impossible to get off , especially with one hand or when hands are wet . The lids that cover the nipples do n't stay on worth crap , they do n't snap on tight and slip right off . I will be contacting Playtex to see if they will replace them , since I have opened and used them so I ca n't return them .	-1
I so wanted these bottles to work . I was not expecting to have a new one in the house again after 20 years but our new bundle of joy arrived and I wanted to be able to feed without having so many parts to sterilize . In our search for the perfect bottle we triedSimilac SimplySmart Starter Set , Gerber First Essential 3 Pack Clear View BPA Free Plastic Nurser With Latex Nipple , 5 Ounce , Colors May Varyand these Platex Drop-Ins . Of the three bottles tried , the Playtex Drop-ins are the very worst.The bottles were easy to assemble and fill with formula but that is as good as it gets . Our baby had a difficult time getting the milk to come out . Feeding took two times longer than feeding with the Gerber and Similac bottles and he still had n't completed the meal when the leaks began . After burping baby for the second time I placed the bottle back in his mouth and formula poured out of the bottle soaking me and baby . I was n't sure what happened until I took the bottle apart to dispose of the liner . One side of the drop-in liner had unseated from the bottle rim causing the milk to pour out . What a mess ! As for being top rack dishwasher safe , the bottles melted and began to shrink around the bottom after being exposed to steam one time . The Platex Nursers and liners I remember from 20 years ago were much better , made of higher quality materials and easier to use than these .	-1
I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter . I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us , and after 2 weeks , 8 of the slow-flow nipples did n't work . They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut . I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 ( ? ) . Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples , which will probably just end up clogging again . The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles , but I ca n't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks .	-1
i was expecting a medium or fast nipple since it is an 8oz bottle . obviously its not for infants who uses 4oz only . i called playtex customer service to replace the nipples but they declined . wont buy playtex anymore and would not recommend this !	-1
Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw . I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush . I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth . This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink ! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size . Strangest thing I have ever seen . Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick .	-1
On the 2nd day of use while trying to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag the bag edge pulled free of the bottle spilling 3.5oz of precious pimped breast milk all over me , the baby , the pillow she was on , the bed , bed skirt , the nightstand and the floor ! This is an incredibly flawed system . If you try to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag your chance of either pulling the bag free or putting a whole in it is large . Plus the hole at the bottom to teach said bag is way to small for the average adult hand and has a sharp bottom edge to boot . Finally as the baby finishes the bottle the bag collapses into the nipple making it nearly impossible for her to truly finish whatever milk is at the bottom . And ! If she breaks suction air gets in anyway ! Steer clear of the for your own sanity .	-1
pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to `` burp '' them to get all the air out ... would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle.- measurements are WAY off ( 8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz ) - extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces . i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough.- my kids had more gas with these.- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK	-1
I had no idea what I was getting when I purchased this item . Yes , they are `` cute '' , but they are made out of a very cheap , rigid plastic . This is not like the traditional Playtex nurser and will , literally , crack under pressure . What 's more , this bottle was completely melted when I used it in my steamer bottle warmer . I do also have the traditional plastic nursers and have used them happily ( with and without the bottle warmer ) , with great success.Do not get suckered in by the flashy packaging . Spend the extra couple of dollars and buy the tried-and-true original design.Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Original Nurser 8-10 OZ : TurquoiseUpdate -- My comment is not about the liners , or excess air , etc . I have done just fine with the drop-ins and I love that I can still buy rubber nipples for the nurser . I 'm speaking specifically to the quality of the actual plastic bottle .	-1
I really do not care for these bottles . When pushing the air out of the bag , you must do it straight for the liner can come off the bottle , spilling milk everywhere . In my case , it was prune juice and the baby 's medicine . I have been much happier with Dr. Browns .	-1
Bottles were so cute that I really wanted to love them , especially being BPA free . Unfortunately inconvenient when they ca n't take a good boiling or steam cleaning ... Measurements on side are n't accurate , but I was n't too put off by it , since these were meant for supplementing breast feeding & I 'm not too structured.This makes baby work way too hard-I actually considered widening the whole . I even tried sucking on it myself to get a better idea of the issue-Wow ! The strain actually hurt my mouth . It was tough just to get a bit of liquid ( and it only worked for us on an incline-I did not want to encounter broken bag trying to push drink through.Sadly , too much air injested=fussy baby and frustrated mom .	-1
This newer , cutesy version of the Playtex Nurser has a major design flaw - the ounce markings on the side of the rigid plastic shell holder are not horizontal LINES , which you expect for an accurate measure . Rather , the ounce gradations are marked by adorable but basically useless rounded leaves , bubbles , raindrops , etc . Where does the ounce mark truly begin ? At the top of the icon ? Bottom ? Smack dab in the middle ? ? ( Try eyeballing THAT at 3 AM ! ) Because baby is on a strictly liquid diet for at least the first 4 - 6 months , being able to obtain correct & exact measurements at feeding time is VERY important.I 'm sticking with the less attractive but much more practical ORIGINAL Playtex Nurser . They are hard to find but worth it ! They are also made of a much sturdier plastic than these flimsy bottles . My baby seems to be doing just fine with them and they 're working well for us , though I 'll probably switch to a non-liner bottle system once he passes the 3-month mark .	-1
I was disappointed to find that they did not send me the decorated nurser . I got plain nursers in the old fashioned yellow color and just plain clear bottles . Since I have been waiting for them to arrive and therefore have not purchased any from the store I just plan to use them because I have no time to send them back and wait for another set . The box looks like old stock perhaps obsolete . First disappointing purchase from Amazon .	-1
Love the bottles , love the idea of the liners , but these do n't collapse well , which means air gets into your baby . Buy the Target brand instead . They 're cheaper and they collapse well .	-1
I really liked the concept of these bottles and the idea of having the liners , but they simply did not work for us . The nipples gave my son bad callouses and blisters on his upper lip , and the liners did not do anything to reduce bubbles as he drank from the bottle , which irritated his acid reflux and caused bad gas . We switched to Tommee Tippee after trying lots of other brands , and we love them !	-1
I did my research and decided to buy this product but it did not work out for me and my little one . Half the time these bottles leak from the top or the bottom even after closing them well . Cleanup involves a lot of parts to wash. And my little refuses to drink from these bottles now that we discovered the Nuk Orthodontic nipples . We have started to use those with a standard size bottle . Its airflow system works good as well . And it was an inexpensive option compared to Playtex . I just wish I had found it sooner .	-1
For me , using formula to feed my daughter , this just was n't the right choice . The bottles are said to be ergonomically designed to make it easier for baby to hold , but my little one has an easier time getting her hands around and even supporting the much heavier standard glass bottles ! The flow is also really slow , even on the faster nipples , and although the bottles do n't seem to leak , they do n't seem to have any real advantage over standard glass bottles , and are much harder to clean .	-1
I bought 4 of these bottles for my son I tried a couple of different bottles for my son . I know not all kid 's are the smae so your child might like them but I had to get rid of them . My son took 45 min or more to drink 6 ounces out them when he only took about 20 min to drink out of the Avent stage one nipple even . I also tried using these at a day care I worked at and other babies had the same problem the nipple on them is to firm so it takes longer for the baby to suck milk out and by the time they are done their jaw is tired . If you like the nipple shape and design the playtex nurser works like a dream with the Multi Flow nipples . Avent bottles are awsome too .	-1
No BPA is good , but the newborn nippes on these still seem to be a little to much in flow than my little 11 pounder can handle without choking a little after about 3 tugs.I like the technology that lessens the air intake and reduces the suction on the bottle -- these are nice bottles , perhaps the little guy needs to be another month older to be able to handle the flow of these newborn bottles .	-1
First , I applaud the company for their creativity and ingenuity , as much as I applaud Dr. Brown 's bottle design . For really-colic-y babies , we had always been told to look for Dr. Brown 's or these Playtex VentAires . But we were also told to not buy a mass quantity of any one brand as all babies are different.When I had the chance to try this newborn starter set I was pretty excited . The angled design and interesting `` venting bottom cap '' seemed like a good idea for us . We are first-time parents and our newborn is just over 1 month old.We quickly learned that `` angled design '' is not really needed ; you just hold your newborn at a different position with a regular/straight bottle and or prop her up different and or use a Boppy pillow . In fact , the angled design actually hinders the ease of use , as it somewhat forces you to only hold the bottle one-way . We actually like straight bottles.So why the one-star ? Well , because this product leaks . And yes , I read the instructions as well as other reviews here and all of the pieces are assembled as they should be . We noticed milk leaking on the table we set the bottle onto and milk outside of the bottle and on our hands.After that first experience , I personally tested it myself with just water and even sucked on the nipple as a test holding at various angles and also slightly blowing bubbles into it ( as our newborn allows to happen ) and yes , this product leaks from the bottom cap area . I tried with a second bottle and it was the same result . By leaks , I do n't mean a geyser , but tiny amounts of liquid leakage.We love the Philips Avent bottles which further have a slightly different nipple design for reducing colic symptoms . They are straight bottles and have never produced any leakage . They are also wider and easier to clean . We would like the Dr. Brown 's but it has like 5 different pieces and extremely hard to clean ; thankfully we found the Avent ones and our baby likes them . Your results may vary !	-1
My three month old daughter is breastfed and we thought we 'd give these bottles a go . I was hopeful that she might like the VentAire bottles , but they were a fail.We tried both the slow and fast flow nipples and she was n't able to get anything out of the bottle with either flow rate . It was disappointing to say the least.Even though the bottles did n't work for us , I 'm sure they probably work well for someone 's baby , so I will try to give you a run down on the bottles contained in this set . The newborn starter set comes with five bottles . Three six ounce bottles and two nine ounce bottles The six ounce bottles have a slow flow nipple and the nine ounce bottles come with the fast flow nipple . The set also contains two additional fast flow nipples and two replacement vent valves for the bottom of the bottle . Because the smallest bottles can hold six ounces , you could probably get just this set alone and be set with all the bottles you would need for your baby if these bottles work out for you.Other reviewers have stated that they had leaking issues with these bottles . In the few times that we attempted to use these bottles we did n't have any leaking issues , but I 'm sure they could happen given that the bottom screws on and has holes in it that are covered with the silicone valve vent.The bottles feel pretty comfortable in your hand . I have used bottles in the past that are not comfortable to hold , so I think it 's worth mentioning that it fits nicely in your hand.When it comes to cleaning these bottles you can be sure you have every nook and cranny clean since it fully disassembles , but that also means that you have lots of pieces to keep tabs on . The bottle has six parts total.Overall , while the bottles look nice , I think the Ventaire concept is really a gimmack and a poorly executed one at that . What good is a bottle if it 's nearly impossible to get anything to come out of it ? Personally , I 'd pass on these bottles and try either the Avent bottles or the Playtex Drop Ins .	-1
my baby girl had the worst colic and gas while using these bottles . i was so upset because i invested in about 20 of them . i 'll admit i was atracted the pretty colors and neat design first of all , which is why i registered for these bottles . my baby could barely suck any formula out of these and would become tired and frusterated and would take an hour to eat a 4 oz bottle . reluctantly i tried the Dr Browns bottles and thank goodness i did . they are fabulous , she finishes her bottle in no time and is much happier and no gas . too bad Dr. Brown 's bottles are not `` pretty '' but who really cares when you have a happy baby who eats and is not up all nite with colic ? ? I found the price of both brands of bottles to be about the same and both have extra parts to wash , but Dr. Browns are worth it.For those of you that do like the Vent Aires i have one caution i would like to mention : do not skip the removal of bottom ring and disk when washing to save time ... grime builds up on the disk and ridges in bottom ring if you dont wash all parts separately ( i found out that husband and other care takers didnt know that all parts had to be removed when washing and ended up with some gunk in a few of my bottles ) Also make sure that the disc is perfectly fitted into the bottom ring before screwing onto bottle and adding milk b/c it will leak ( found that out the hard way )	-1
I ordered these because of the Playtex brand . I originally used the Dropin bottles and love them . These bottles are the absolute worse , they leak even when the little stoppers are dry . It is so frustrating , I tried to make sure they are completely dry before I make a bottle and then she will start drinking and within a couple of minutes it will start leaking . I told my daughter I will buy the Dollar Store dollars because they are better than these . So do n't waste your hard earn money on this crappy bottle , if you want the Playtex bottle stick with the original dropins .	-1
I was going to give it more stars at first but after continuous use of the product , I noticed a few issues with these bottles . I 'm a brand new mom and had to pump milk in the beginning as she was n't latching on or able to get enough from me . I used these bottles to give her the breast milk.What I did like about these is that all the milk is easily accessible , whereas the Tommee Tippee ones I got were really hard to get the last drop out . Also , I did like the design of the bottle . It was easy to hold and easy to use . It seems to help a little bit with keeping gas out but nothing is foolproof so be sure to burp even after using these . This is where the good stop and the bad starts.It was a gradual thing at first but we noticed as we started using the bottles more that there would be leaks . I made sure everything was tighten both up top and the bottom , and yet they would still leak . We had quite a mess to clean up as the milk went everywhere but to her mouth . Then we had another problem with one of the nipples where nothing was coming out . She was sucking on it for 5 minutes and it was just stuck . After we changed the nipple , it was fine but just strange that something that is brand new would just suddenly just not allow any milk through . Now , as I have said before , I am a new mom , so if there 's some sort of trick to these nipples , please do let me know.We have stopped using these mostly because of the leaks . You never know when it will happen and it gets messy .	-1
I used these bottles with my son back in 2011 . We first used the Gerber Nuk bottles , but they did not work for us . So , when I became pregnant with my second it was a no brainer of which bottles to use ! They do have a few more parts than & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; bottles , but I did not mind ! When the new baby got here , she first would not take the nipple , it seemed to long for her mouth ! So , I slowly introduced them to her . She finally got to where she would take it with no problems . I was hand washing them every night , but eventually went to putting them in the dishwasher . I noticed when hand washing and putting them in the dishwasher , that if the slightest bit of water was in the bottom ring , between the ring and the blue & # 34 ; stopper & # 34 ; , it would leak ! I never had this problem with the old design ! The bottles used to NEVER leak , I was highly disappointed ! Pros : * They really do help with gas on the tummy , never had a colic baby , so I am not too sure about that . * The wide bottle is very comfortable in my hand ! * Very simple to clean and make sure all the soap is out ! ( I highly recommend the Playtex bottle brush ! Other brands seemed to scratch the inside of the bottle ! ) Cons : * The new design leaks ! * The caps are hard to snap on , to me at least.I have stayed loyal to Playtex and started using the Playtex nursers !	-1
I have washed these bottles by hand and only 2 times by dishwasher ( since they say they are dishwasher safe ) . My baby is 1 month old now and these bottles leak out the bottoms and the tops . I ca n't seem to get them tight enough . My son also has the worst gas problems ever . He is sooo miserable I just want to cry for him . I am definetly going to be getting new bottles just do n't know what kind yet .	-1
Piece of junk . Very noisy . Leg lifts off the ground when rocking . All six speeds are exactly the same speed . Poor quality . It 's going back .	-1
The swing is cute with its design etc , ... Takes up alot of floor room . This swing goes through D batteries every 2 weeks , gets expensive . I suggest getting a swing that will plug directly into a outlet . I found that the mobile on the swing to be a real pain , when you are getting the baby in and out . Bop the babies head on the mobile . Sold ours on craigslist and purchased a plug in swing .	-1
My son is 18 1/2 pounds and it 's too small for him . The formation of the seat is very squished and I do n't know why . There 's no room to move or stretch or anything ! Once the baby is in there he/she is stuck until someone takes him out . Kind of like a taco ! The mobile toys are too low as my baby is always trying to reach up to them where as w/ another swing I have he just looks and enjoys . It 's very difficult to adjust the seat positioning and my mom ( who has this swing ) has to turn the entire swing upside down to do it . Luckily we got this for $ 30 at a thrift store in brand new condition so even though it wo n't last much longer for my boy it wo n't be a total loss like it would if we had paid full price .	-1
On the first one I received only one of the two clips made a clicking sound when inserted into the buckle and you had to push *really* hard to get the clips in . So I called Britax and they sent me a replacement buckle and on the replacement buckle , neither one of the clips made a clicking noise when inserted into the buckle and again I had to push really hard to get them the buckle and I am not convinced they are really locked in - guess you would n't really know until an accident happened . Well , I am not taking the chance , so back it goes . When I called Britax about the second buckle - they told me it was normal for there not to be a clicking noise when the clips go into the buckle . Yeah right , I 'm not waiting for an accident to find out whether the clip is really locked into the buckle or not !	-1
I feed my baby pumped milk 100 % and I wanted to have a spare manual pump for my diaper bag . Though easy to operate 1 handed , for me is does n't encourage a good let down . I would have to pump 5x longer than my electrical to get the same about . My opinion is to get a different manual pump .	-1
I bought this one day in a pinch when I was at work and had forgotten a crucial piece of my electric pump . I do like the flanges on this one but otherwise I am terribly sad that my Ameda manual pump broke , since it was so much sturdier . This Medela pump comes apart a lot due to the rubber bit between the handle and the flange is always slipping and is so hard to get back together . Also the handle is massive and a it cumbersome to use . I guess the idea was that you could pump with one hand but this is always a two handed affair for me . it does an OK job if I am very full but the performance is too spotty . I am at 11 months and while I am going to stop pumping at work , I still anticipate having to pump occasionally since I am going to leave my babe to wean when he wants to . Will have look around for a better manual pump that does n't slip and slide all over the place !	-1
This pump works~ but you have to work very hard at it . Every new mom deserves a healthy , happy beginning . If you are going to invest any amount of money , I highly recommend purchasing an electric one or renting from a hospital or lactation center . You will save yourself a lot of time and frustration . Your energy belongs elsewhere , not here !	-1
I bought this pump because , as a stay-at-home mom , I expected to pump very little ( just to relieve engorgement , etc ) . Unfortunately , my daughter had difficulty transferring the milk from my breast , and in order for her to get enough milk , I had to pump and bottle-feed her eight times a day . Since I already owned this pump ( and did n't want to spend a ton on an electric pump ) , I tried to make this one work . It lasted less than three days before the gasket that helps create the suction gave out . I 'm sure Medela would have replaced it ( later experience with the company left me extremely impressed with their customer service ) , however I had come to the conclusion that manual pumping eight times a day was not going to work for me . The muscles in my hand and forearm were exhausted from the work , and I found the suction created by this device ( before the gasket gave out ) hurt my nipples too much . I was able to return the pump and bought a Medela Swing to replace it . The Swing worked much better for me . If you have to pump often , it is much more convenient to have the pump do the work itself , it is quicker than manually pumping ( at least in my experience ) and the adjustable suction on the Swing made it much more comfortable to use . Overall , if you expect to need to pump more than once or twice a day , you may want to consider the investment in an electric pump .	-1
I do n't like it . I bought it to use when I could n't use my electric breast pump . during its first use it was great but then later on just after one clean it lost its suction . Milk went up in the upper part after few use . to me it became worse than the manual expression of breast milk with the hand .	-1
I bought this pump because I was planning on exclusively breastfeeding and thinking I wouldnt need an electric pump since I would only be doing the occasional pumping . Well there is a reason the product comes with a 30 day warranty ... because on the 31st day it isnt going to work anymore . At first it worked amazing , but after using it only a handful of times , it started to lose suction . I tried contacting Medela about it but they sent me an email reminding me of the 30 day warranty . So I finally caved and bought an electric pump ... a Lansinoh .	-1
I bought this for occasional use when traveling and the handle is not very durable . It pumps in the beginning of the session and then becomes weird and loses its suction . Invest in an electric pump if you can . It looks like a waste of money and only usable parts are the two bottles .	-1
Medela products are known to be great , and they generally are , but ... I found a better product , and it 's by Lansinoh . Read on : i was given one of these Harmony pumps after my daughter 's birth , and it worked great . i have n't ever needed to pump that often as i stay home with my daughter , so it only got used 3 or 4 times before it lost suction.well lo and behold , it 's not an uncommon problem with this pump , and a quick google search showed me that i 'd lost my `` o-ring '' .ladies , this is a VERY TINY rubber ring that very easily disappears from this pump when you disassemble it to clean . a set of 10 of these little rubber rings in the hardware store 's plumbing department is usually around $ 2.75 ( i know , because i went and looked ) - EXCEPT THAT MEDELA USES A PROPRIETARY SIZE THAT ONLY THEY CAN REPLACE . As well , good luck finding replacement parts anywhere except online . It seems that even many of the places that sell Medela pumps do n't carry the parts.worse ? you 'll need to spend TWELVE DOLLARS and replace the entire handle setup , just to replace this TINY little rubber ring ( not including shipping ) . Now , I *have* heard from a few women who 've been able to convince Medela just to send them replacement o-rings , however , it cost them over six dollars . I was n't so fortunate anyway - after i sat on hold waiting for a customer service representative for almost seven minutes , she insisted i replace the entire setup as well . I quickly hung up , went to Wal-mart ( yeah i know , but i needed a working pump asap ) and got myself the Lansinoh manual.Anyway ... that 's another review ( it 's a great little pump ! ) , so I 'll end with this . If you insist on buying the Medela Harmony , and you 're buying the right pump for your needs , you 'll probably be satisfied ( I also found that I had a more productive time with the harder flange instead of the `` massaging '' one that comes with this pump - and those you CAN get in most places Medela pumps are sold ) . AND KEEP AN EYE ON THAT O-RING . Be VERY careful when you disassemble this pump to clean it .	-1
I bought it . I used it for several times but i didnt like it.the edge of shield is firm . it doesnt fit the breast . and milk leaks out , so you have to hold it with hand with a tissue . after a month shield began to loose its shape.then it sucks really hard . my poor nipples were purple even after few minutes of pumping.Then i bought electrical one . MiPump by First years . It costs twice the price of this pump , but it sucks really gentle but strong enough ( you can adjust the strength of pumping ) with a sort of vibration . and it feels about the same way as a baby sucking . it is electrical and works both from batteries and electricity . and pumps 2 breasts at one time.shields are very soft . and i just enjoy pumping now.Medela is a cool brand , i liked the cream for nipples by Medela and some other products but i am ready to throw this pump away in a dumpster .	-1
Given the fact that this pump was made by Medela and the most expensive of all the hand pumps , I figured it would be an outstanding product . That was totally not the case . It was awkward to use , took forever to pump my milk out and the suction part was very uncomfortable . I gave this pump a full week of using it before I sent it back . I then bought the Evenflo manual pump ( for $ 20 ) and it worked soooooooooo much better . Do n't waste your money on this item .	-1
The other reviewer who prefers Lansinoh over Medela had the same experience as I did -- the Medela just has poor suction , even when put together properly , and even when 100 % dry . The breast shield warps after a few uses and is made of a really strange material that does n't provide suction . Even when I use two hands , one to pump , one to hold the breast shield on , I still get poor suction . Maybe it 's just the way I 'm built , but I 'm registering for a Lansinoh manual for my second pregnancy .	-1
I have a advanced on the go medela pump which I love , I bought this thinking it might be worthwhile to buy a manual pump that is more portable and less bulky , not needing electric power , adapters , tubings etc ... in case I needed to be on the go . I was planning a quick trip to NYC and was hoping to be able to use it quickly , I barely pump out 1 oz when I am usually able to pump 3-4 oz . the handle is awkward .	-1
this pump is very flimsy . i managed to get only 1-2 good pumping sessions out of it before it broke .	-1
I have the medela double electric pump and it works wonderfully . From first use it gets about 10 oz out within 6 minutes . I tend to have an over supply so my 2 month old kept getting full before getting to the hind milk or only does one boob and the other is left full resulting in painful plugged ducts . So I researched manual pumps since my double electric wont do just one boob . Since it works so well , I decided to go with the same brand for manual pump . I was really excited , thought it would solve all my problems . Went to use it for the first time with a VERY VERY full breast and it took 10 minutes of vigorous hand pumping to get 1 measly ounce . I leak more than that in a shorter time . I thought maybe the first time was a fluke , made sure everything was connected properly , had an already leaking breast , tried got 1 drop . Somehow , it stopped my milk . So confused by the good reviews , is it just me ?	-1
It does the job if you have a lot of time and patience . It does pump but you have to stop many times to adjust the pieces , otherwise it stops . I guess this is what you get for that money .	-1
it broke right after I had used it once . i carry this around as my back up and it 's already smashed . it did work well that one time .	-1
I do n't get much milk even with the best of best electric pumps , and this thing got nothing out of me , and I hurt my hand in the process of trying to get anything out . Not worth buying if you do n't have an abundance of milk .	-1
At first it was a really great product . Then I had to start replacing pieces frequently , and having to break-down the whole thing every few days to wash it was irritating . If I left anything together mold appeared . Eventually after only a few months I could no longer get any suction no matter which piece I adjusted or replaced .	-1
I 'm really disappointed with this product . I wanted a hand pump because I find the electric ones to be too much of a hassle with plugging in and it takes forever to empty the breast . Had I reviewed this when I first got it , I would have given it 5 stars . It worked great , I could get just as much milk as the electric pump in a quarter of the time . I bought 2 just so I could always have one on hand if one was dirty . I figured Medela was a good product and would stand up to pumping . Well 3 months later , it 's junk . It 's worn out , like what other people said , I can hear the air hissing into it . I 've changed those little flimsy plastic pieces and it worked again for a little bit and then stopped again . I did n't know that this was n't supposed to be for daily use , seems silly to sell a pump you ca n't use daily , so I thought maybe I over used it . Well based on other reviews , it was n't me . I went and bought a different brand , Nuk , we 'll see how that goes . Do n't buy this , period	-1
I used this pump with my son who was breast feed for 7 months . It does not hold suction very well and when it did I found it ok strong . I got tears along my nipple that I did n't even get from my baby latching on . I took it on some over night trips when I did n't have my baby and it did not re-leave me at all I would pump 8 oz and still be in pain in certain spots .	-1
This pump is NOT BPA-free . Note the fine print : only `` parts that come into contact with breastmilk '' are BPA-free , which means the handle , the part YOU touch the most , has BPA , as I discovered from the little # 7 plastic sign on the back.This brings me to another point : I only uncovered the # 7 sign when I was poking around wondering why my pump had lost suction after only a few months of occasional use ( several other reviews here noted the same thing ) . I found a little tear in the clear plastic underside of the handle . Very disappointed in the quality .	-1
I 'm weird I think ... ... First , I hate hate hate pumping . It 's more work ... and boring . But , sometimes you got ta pump . I have a nice electric medela and then bought this one for vacation in Europe . It 's just not my thing , sitting there pumping away with this . It feels weird and is even more boring than the electric one ... ..and I did n't get much milk.but that 's just my opinion . Even though the electric was around $ 200 ... .it 's definitely worth it to me .	-1
I ended up returning this product because it stopped working after the 2nd use . The first couple it seemed to work great but did n't suck as well as an electric . The customer service at Medela is excellent .	-1
This was such as waste of money . I should have just invested in an electric pump . First of all the suction is horrible and I have to continually fix it as I am pumping . Also the piece will fall off if you pump too fast . Secondly , it takes forever to pump so it is not convenient . You need to have an oversupply for this to be an effective pump.My main complaint is the suction . It is weak and makes pumping ineffective . I get more milk by hand expressing .	-1
save your money and just forget about buying a manual . Unless you 're a weight lifter you 'll never be able to pump for long enough to get any milk out . Invest in batteries for your electric in case of power outages if you want for that reason	-1
Buyer beware ! This is a terrible pump.I bought ( and used ) it to occasionally relieve engorgement . It broke after about 10 uses . Hand expressing or electric pumps are much more effective . I have the Medela Freestyle pump which is nearly as portable as the hand pump and much , much better.Problems:1 . Unusual flange shape is uncomfortable for nipples and pinches them2 . The handle only allows you to pump with high suction unless you have a very precise squeeze3 . Takes forever to pump any milk4 . Spills easily if tilted at all , wasting ounces of milk ( when unscrewing the bottle , for example ) 5 . Breaks and loses suction after a few weeks of use	-1
Through a series of unfortunate events , I 've come to own six different manual breast pumps and two electric ones . My manuals include the Lansinoh , the Medela Harmony and two generations of Avent pumps . This is how they compare ( from worst to best ) : ( 1 ) Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump . I own the Freestyle , so I thought that I would like the Medela brand manual . Not so . The valve system on this pump is a thin flip attached to hard plastic . It simply does not generate as much suction as the sturdier Lansinoh and Avent valves , and therefore it does not trigger let down as well or get as much milk . If this is the only pump you have , you might not realize it , because you will still get some milk , but when I compared it to my Avent , it was taking about five minutes longer and getting an ounce less per breast . I liked that you could switch out the breast cup to accommodate different nipple sizes , and assembly was slightly easier , but it does not have the `` massage cushion '' which makes it a little less comfortable . Of course , the lack of cushion also means that milk ca n't get stuck in teh cushion and leak like the other three pumps , so it 's good and bad . But the bottom line is that I have supply problems , so I just could n't settle for a pump that generated less milk . It 's in the garbage now . ( 2 ) Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump ( aka the Older Model Avent ) . These pumps are comfortable to use and generate a lot of milk , but the valve system is a small dime sized piece of plastic that pops out while pumping and easily gets lost . Fortunately , you can now buy replacement valves that are inch long pieces of sturdy , flexible plastic . Those are a must for Avent users.Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Pump Valves . Also , even though I like this pump , it is annoying that it collects milk in the cushion and spills easily . It shares this problem with the newer Comfort Avent , and the Lansinoh , but not the Medela , which does not have cushion . ( 3 ) Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump , 1-Count . This pump is cheaper than the Avent , and uses the same type of valve , so unlike the Medela , it is almost as effective as the Avent at getting milk . It also takes standard size bottles , including Medela , Even-flo , etc , which is an advantage if you do n't already use Avent bottles . Still , I prefer the Avent for two reasons : first , the massage cushion on the Avent has `` petal '' air pockets that I like , and second , the Lansinoh takes much more effort to pump . My hand gets tired within five or ten minutes of using this pump , which is not a problem I 've had with either the Medela or Avent pumps . I think it is because the diaphragm on the Lansinoh is much thicker . So , well , I can see certain advantages to this Lansinoh ( cost , bottles ) , it 's not my favorite . ( 4 ) Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump ( aka the Newer Model Avent ) . These pumps are the best . The most comfortable to use , the short neck can be placed right next to the breast . They also get the most milk without making my hand tired . The only disadvantages are that they are somewhat harder to assemble than the Medela and ca n't accommodate different nipple sizes , cost more than the Lansinoh and require special Avent shaped bottles ( usually included ) . Still , the assembly difference is small , and I can learn to control milk spill . Comfort and milk matter most to me , so I enjoy this pump the most . If , heaven forbid , I need a seventh breast pump , I will buy another one of these .	-1
I bought this because of all the great reviews and I was being cheap . This does not work at all . Do not waste your money - get the electric kind !	-1
I have trouble getting milk out this way . My electric madela is way better . I just ca n't get my milk to let down . Also tricky to clean . Deff not for regular pumping but ok for occasional relief .	-1
I own a Medela pump in style electric double pump . I purchased that and used it with my first child over 4 years ago , and I believe the suction started to go on that model which is why I wanted to try the hand pump . I thought it would be a stronger suction for some reason , but it was less than my lagging electric . Unfortunately I ca n't return it after using it - waste of money for me .	-1
This is my third Medela Harmony ... They are AMAZING while they work , but all three suddenly lost suction . I could n't figure out why but thanks to the reviews here , I discovered the problem - the pesky o ring . I ordered a new pump at the end of May and that tiny white piece was gone the first week of June . When I called Medela , the customer support woman told me it 's for & # 34 ; occasional use only & # 34 ; and that once a day for 15 minutes is considered to be too much . They also have no plans to sell the o rings separately or provide extras with the pump . & # 34 ; The piece is too small to track , count , etc. & # 34 ; After 15 minutes she agreed to send me a new valve piece since I was still under the 30 day warranty . I plan on going to Ace and getting a bunch of o rings to have in case this happens again . *I tried the dental floss trick - it worked ! Just make sure you 're using a waxy floss and wrap it tightly around in the indentation where the o ring would go . Such a great short-term fix . Thanks for the suggestion !	-1
This was very cute and I loved it . However , after about 2 weeks the upper edges came off when my toddler reached up on them and pulled . It left splintery edges where the screws had been . It was still functional so we sanded them down and kept using it . A few months later the drawers no longer opened and closed properly and it became wobbly and tightening the bolts didnt help . Overall , I think it is adorable , but I wish for the price that it had been better quality . If it was half the price I would have given it a better review - but the long term quality should have been better for such an expensive piece .	-1
First of all , our kit came WITHOUT instructions . I called customer service and they emailed it to me immediately . Second of all , our kit came WITHOUT dowels & screws.Third of all , one piece was damaged- and looked like it was sort of water damaged due to some slight bubbling of the white finish . It had to have been damaged prior to being packed into the box because it was in the center of the box and no other pieces had similar damage.Fourth of all , the base board was not even the correct base board for the unit ! Fifth of all , the decorative trim around the drawers- was not tacked down on one corner so about 6 inches of the trim was flopping around.VERY stressful for a 36.5 week prego person ! I 'm afraid the baby is going to come while I 've still got this mess of a changing table laying all over the nursery floor ! I should have read all the reviews for this company before purchasing . I 'm hoping customer service will expedite the missing/damaged/incorrect pieces . I 'll update this review later after I 've dealt with them ! ******REVISION*******When I called the company- they said the instructions that I had been sent were the wrong Revised instructions . Apparently they continually `` update '' the product *in other words cut corners for a cheaper construction- the instructions I have are for 2009 and the product was made with more locking dowels , dowels , better screws , and a better baseboard . 2011 's version includes a baseboard that instead of wood support pieces- now they send you little plastic pieces to secure to the unit.Overall , dealing with customer service was easy- shipping will take 10+ days , for the damaged pieces and pieces that are still missing even with the new instructions . I do not understand how i was sent the incorrect instructions to begin with- because the woman asked me for the same numbers I gave them yesterday ! Very very frustrating . The unit is cute and matches our BabyItalia crib- BUT I KNOW i 'm going to have to replace the unit eventually- the plastic drawer slides and only 1 dowel pin holding certain pieces in place , cardboard backing , and screws that only go in 3mm to secure wood panels ... do not waste your money ! ! ! ! invest in a quality piece of furniture !	-1
I had used these for 2 weeks when the drawers started falling out . I screw them in again but Now , after 4 months of use they can not be screw in again because the fixed wall hole is already too big . The worst thing ever . It seems like it was made of cardboard . DONT BUY THESE ! ! !	-1
When my husband unpacked the box , we were really disappointed . It is made of cheap particle board ( there are different qualities of particle board ) . The corners were chipped off . I do n't see how it can be shipped without being damaged . Too bad , it was the perfect size for our room . We returned it .	-1
It is cute , but all show . Aside from the horrible directions and terrible time my husband had putting this together ( we are on our third baby , and have never had a piece of furniture or baby item be this awful to put together ) , it just is n't safe . I could write off how long it took , how terrible the directions were , and how crazy the steps to piece it together if only it were safe enough to hold a child . If an adult leans on it , it will tip , and I 'm pretty sure if my 2 or 4 year old push or try to climb on it , pieces will break . My husband put all the bolts/screws in tightly ( and doing it tightly/securely makes the very cheap particle board crack btw ) , and it still is n't stable . This piece is all show , meant to impress you with looks and a low price . Even if you ca n't afford anything nicer than this ( and discount stores do have items at a similar price that hold together better , even if they are n't as pretty - I guess you 'll have to decide what 's most important to you ) , I suggest looking for someone selling a piece second-hand that is well-made . I didnt want to spend much , and fell for the cute looking picture , too . I 'd return it , but it may affect my marriage to ask my husband to take it apart after all the work . I will use it as a dresser , but as far as putting a child on it ( and I 'd of course never LEAVE a child on it ! ) , I just dont know ! Will put it next to a wall , and line up our more sturdy ( and this is sad ) diaper genie to hold it up on the other side . I know you think this is a deal , but I highly discourage any future buyers from making the mistake we did buying it .	-1
I bought this for my almost 2 year old after reading the rave reviews . It 's pretty disappointing . It does n't do anything but float . The blue spray nozzle does n't really work . You 're supposed to squeeze it and it acts like a squeeze toy and is SUPPOSED to make the water run . Instead you get a airy spray of water . The only thing my daughter really seems to like about it is the orange cup that has holes on the bottom . She likes to scoop up water in it and watch it trickle out from the bottom . It 's an okay toy I guess , but do n't expect anything spectacular .	-1
I ordered this for our 2nd vehicle and it served its purpose well , except for the fact that the leg holes are are too small . I ordered it because of the low price , but paying a little more for bigger leg holes may be best . It was always a struggle/hassle to get my son 's feet/shoes through them or out of them . After only 2 weeks of having it , we were ready to buy a replacement like the Bright Starts Comfort & Harmony Cozy Cart Cover , Calypso Blue cover we already had . It usually took 2 of us to get his feet in/out . He 's 22 months , so maybe this works better for younger kiddos . Needless to say , we lost it while on vacation ( it must have fallen out of the trunk while pulling out the stroller ) , so I 'm ordering a different brand today .	-1
I purchased the `` small '' ( 7-14 lb . ) size for my 10 lb . baby and it was far too small . The fabric was nice , color a bit garish , but we really did n't get to experience this product because it was n't large enough for our baby.We have used the Halo swaddle sacks , and we like them . Moreover , they 're truer to the stated size.Halo : Halo Innovations Newborn 100 % Cotton Sleepsack Swaddle , Sage Pin Dot	-1
My daughter is a strong little girl and though she needed to be swaddled in order to actually sleep ... she fought it most of the time . I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use . Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result . Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets , however my little girl was pretty intent . I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled .	-1
If this is the only swaddle blanket you have ever used i can see saying its tje greatest thing ever , however its not my first one . This product is much more difficult to put on and certainly not as diaper changing friendly as they make it sound . You have to undo the inside velcro then attempt to put it back again after . Also , my very sneaky 7 week old easily wiggles his arms free so that his hands are poking out the top then wakes up . My kids are very long and they , at 7 weeks and only about 8.5 lbs , are already almost too tall for this product.The reason I bought these was because the halo fleece sleepers got too warm with wood heat but I must say even too warm the halo sleepers are a million times better ! I got size small which my boys are swimming in amnd I can still wrap them more tightly and change them easier.These are definately not my favorite by far , I think I swaddle with a blanket better .	-1
I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it . Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead . The velcro is annoying , and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily . She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket , even at 6 months ( I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping ) . Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket . I swear I do n't work for them -- it 's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous !	-1
We got this as a gift and have used it 0 times . It 's expensive and poorly designed . A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper , easier to fold , and nicer looking .	-1
I purchased these at Baby 's R Us because of the good reviews , but I have not had any luck with them . They did n't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference , and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly . I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours . They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk , but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work . My nipples were too flat , so I just ended up with wet , smelly breasts.They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public.I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up . This shell does not have a foam insert , and is hard plastic .	-1
This will do the job but it 's really big and baggy looking . We gave it away to a friend who wanted it and I 'm going to make something for my daugter 's room .	-1
I was excited when I ordered but as soon as we got them and put them up everything kept falling out the front kids and I were bummed . I grabbed 3 one for each of my kids and they have about 6 teddy bears a peace would not recommend	-1
It was too big and saggy . Plus , Its really ugly hanging from the corner of a room . I 'll have to figure out something else .	-1
Not to be one of those people who complain about too much of a good thing , but here it goes ... It 's just too big ! You need a great deal of wall space to be able to accommodate this net . It spans at least 5 feet and requires bigger holes in your wall then I was planning on . I never put the thing up , just took it out of the box and realized it wo n't work . I 'd you have major wall space available , do n't mind anchor screws in your wall , and need to house A LOT of toys , this might be for you .	-1
serves its purpose but in order to get the max space out of it , it has to stick out quite far into the room , and if not , it sags and everything falls out	-1
I really do n't have much to say about this product that is positive . The picture looks great but the end result is far from ideal . First , they do n't provide any sort of directions about the optimum height for each point of the hammock to attach to the wall , or give you any indication of how low the hammock will hang after it is attached . Second , the hardware provided is absolute junk . If you decide to purchase/install this , I highly recommend going to a hardware store and getting the kind of drywall anchors that you screw in ( as opposed to hammering in ) . This way they can easily be removed if you need to change the position of an anchor .	-1
If you have kids under 4 , they will get in this hammock and use it/break it.Get a real hammock and use it for toy storage.It is too stretchy and is a bit awkward to install ( hard to determine how far apart to put the hooks ) . I recommend putting toys in it while you are determining where to put the hooks .	-1
Yes , its stretchy.. but TOO stretchy . i couldnt even get it to look right hanging up in my daughters room.. she has a lot of stuffed animals and after putting only about 4 in there it was just awkward looking and hangs down too much	-1
This should be pretty straight forward but the suction cups wont stick to the tub walls . I 've tried everything , the cups just suck . It does come with screws to put on a wall but if you want this for the tub its no good .	-1
I would not recommend these for use in a bathroom . Kids can easily pull them down and/or fart in their direction and they will fall .	-1
I 'm an organization freak , so naturally I tried this out for bath toys to be able to drip dry . I 'd give this 0 stars if I could . The suction cups do not stick to anything in a bathroom that 's tile . Unless you want to hang it in the tub itself ( which is then totally in the way ) the do n't stick . I tried everywhere and in all my bathrooms and other surfaces and it just doens't work . But hey if you want to drill holes somewhere and hang with screws then it should do the trick . I 'd send it back , but it would cost more to ship it than I paid for it in the first place .	-1
We have a tile shower . I can not get these suction cups to stick . Two seem okay but the other keeps falling off . I finally just gave up . Good size net , though .	-1
I have the Prince Lionheart Jumbo toy hammock in my son 's room and love it ! My daughter needed one for her animals too . Based on this product picture I thought this one would be big too . Imagine my surprise when I saw how tiny it is . I 'll be ordering the jumbo version . Amazon was at least nice enough to let me keep this one and are going to issue me a refund anyway . But they really need to change the picture b/c it 's a total misrepresentation of the actual size . Had no idea this was actually meant for bath toys . ( Kinda wondered why it came with suction cups when the other one had n't . )	-1
We have about 10 or so lightweight bath toys we store in this net . The suction cups do n't stick very long , and send all toys spilling all over the tub . Gets old picking them up so often . Very disappointed .	-1
Was n't thrilled with this product . It 's made fine - just a poor concept . Looks silly if you do n't have the right type of corner to hang it in .	-1
These feeders get so gross and it 's too hard to clean them out . I feel like they wer n't sanitary and I just do n't have the time to mess around with that . I bought the Kidsme Food Feeder from Amazon and it 's a million times better . No mesh ! It 's silicone ( like a bottle nipple ) so it 's easy to clean . My 6 month-old daughter and I are both happy campers . [ Award winning ] Kidsme Food Feeder for 4 Months and Above ( Small , Blue/Yellow )	-1
kept falling off my seat ( orbit ) . also my 4mo old did n't deem interested in it at all . He loves his whozit spiral !	-1
Horrible design ! I should 've listened to the other reviews . It will stay on my daughters Graco stroller as long as she does n't touch it ! The music hippo is cute and the toys catch her attention but bad design overall .	-1
i suppose this seat is better than layering tons of toilet paper on a toilet bowl . this folding seat may be appealing to little ones because it comes decorated with familiar characters ( e.g. , sesame street , dora , etc ) . but there is nothing to hold it in place on a toilet seat . my twins ca n't relax enough to 'go ' while sitting on it because the hinges are flimsy so the seat feels like it 's about to give way under them . they 're small ( 27lb ) 2yos , so i ca n't imagine what would happen if they weighed more . save your money and get a more stable travel potty seat !	-1
These folding seats are horrible ! At first I thought it was the greatest thing until I found the actual greatest thing ! While this does fold nice and small , the open front is a joke . My daughter sprayed out constantly on her clothing ! Public toilets are open front too , so there was NOTHING to stop the pee . It was just a hassle having to change her clothes all the time . The only thing I could do to stop her from peeing out was to hold her legs straight out and lean her forward . Really ? As if potty training was n't difficult enough ! There were also several times that it pinched her little hiney when she sat down because of the hinges in the middle of the seat ! This made her afraid of it which we all know is a VERY BAD THING.I found a different potty which I actually bought to keep in the car . Now I use that one instead of this folding seat for my second child . The Kalencom Potette plus potty is WAY BETTER . It has no hinges on the seat so it never pinches , and it has a built in guard to keep them from peeing on their clothes . While it is slightly larger , I would much rather carry that one around since it is so much easier to use and comfy for my child . It comes with a bag that you can keep flushible wipes and training pants in as well . Get that one !	-1
Maybe this works for really light toddlers . Our lil guy is 30 pounds and this seat bends so much you worry it will crack . It does just flex , but because of its instability you do n't feel comfortable using it . Also with the flexing , since there is n't anything holding it in place on the toilet , it snaps off quite easily and falls in or off the toilet .	-1
I bought a pretty princess seat cover just like this one and then saw this Sesame Street one in Burlington Coat Factory & confirmed ( from taking it out of the box_ ) that it is the same thing , just different decoration . At any rate , I out it on the toilet and the overhang lip in the front does not hang over enough . If it did , I think it would help keep it in place better . However , the cushions on the underneath ( wish they would show you that on the product images ) are just that , a cushion . It has nothing to do with actually helping hold the potty seat in place , as it slides around all too easily . It snapped open well and I felt it was good , but once I sat my 16month old 21lb girl on it , I better understand the reviews others are giving . Although it 's snapped together pretty solidly , when I put my daughter on it , she seat really sunk in toward the toilet water a bit , enough to worry me too much to keep it . I can see where people might say it pinches because although it 's not supposed to bend anymore in that direction , it does , and could possibly pinch . My main issues with the seat though are that it:1 - had nothing to click it/stick it on the seat to keep it in place2 - sinks down under the weight of my 21 lb girl3 - I can see my own hands getting unsanitary from touching the seat to open and close it after being on the toiletI think it 's a great idea , but not a well developed/made product to do the job it 's supposed to do .	-1
I dont know how the people who like this thing got it to work but my son hates it and wo n't go near sitting on it . Its too unstable for him , slides on the seat and doesnt fit even our own home toilet . There are no grips of any kind on the bottom so its straight , smooth plastic on porcelain which presents a severe danger to any child trying to use it . The flexibility is great for travel but it gives under my son 's weight before he even hit thirty pounds and that freaked him out so bad he started yelling , 'no , no , no ! ' It was ridiculous . I ended up having to get an extra of his padded 'ducky ' seat from WalMart to stuff in his backpack to drag around with us . Less convenient but a million times safer and he 'll actually use it . Would never buy this again !	-1
I had a lot of hopes for this product . Some of the reviews were mixed and now I understand why.ConsIt constantly slips off the toilet seat when she moves . If I turn my back for a second and she tries to get off she is likely to almost fall in the toilet.This product takes too much detailed precision to use it correctly . We have other seats that work much better but they are not travel seats.I would be uncomfortable using this in a public restroom.I would not recommed purchasing this.ProsIt has characters on it and she likes that .	-1
I saw the bad reviews on this and ordered one anyway , because I figured it really could n't be that bad . It is AWFUL . I got it because we were flying to go on vacation and I figured this would be smaller to pack and use on the plane and would be small in the house we were renting . We have a Potette Plus that we use on a regular basis ( just running errands ) but I did n't want to have to worry about where is was and/or leaving it at home while out and about . This was SO shakey , pintched my little one , completely feel in on itself , all in all awful ! My little girl would n't go potty on it . She just held it for HOURS . DO not buy this .	-1
We bought this for the diaper bag when my first was ready to potty train . My second is using the potty now , and I pulled it out to give it one more shot . It does n't fit well on any toilet seat , public or residential , it slides around horribly , and it bows under my kids ' weight causing the joints to catch skin . Both of my kids ended up sideways and screaming on the toilet with pinched thighs , and I had to support their weight to keep them from falling in . I wanted so badly for this to work , but it does n't . : (	-1
I have to agree with others , it is n't very strong . My daughter was excited about the print on the seat , but as soon as we used it out in a public bathroom , she was n't very happy . It is n't sturdy enough and she wanted off before her business was done . I have decided to put this one away and maybe for the next one we can use it . I recommend the more sturdier ones , but they do n't fold up as Convenient as this one . **** I finally found a folding cushy potty seat on another website for $ 15.00 , and I like it much better . ** **Look at 2nd picture ( not purple one ) this is the potty seat I am writing this review about , not sure how this purple one comes up ?	-1
We inherited this seat from a friend as we started to potty train our son . Not only does it bend when my 26 lb son sits on it but if he shifts his weight or leans to one side the seat jumps and moves . This seat really made him feel uneasy . We bought the Primo seat after we read the reviews and have used it constantly for the last month . I would give it 5 stars . Not only is it sturdy but it stays in place . The seams are not flat like this seat with big bird so be careful if you like to slide your child 's bottom all over it but I feel there is no real threat using the primo . I also believe that 's what makes the primo so much sturdier . Good Luck ! BTW we have used the primo everywhere : Planes , Porter potty , mall ... and so on it works great EVERYWHERE .	-1
We used this ring in public restrooms when we were out and about . Often it would n't fit the toilet very well and would slide around when my boys would sit on it , even if I carefully lifted them onto the ring myself . A couple of times it almost dumped them in the toilet and scared them to death . I do n't recommend it .	-1
I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born . However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack ) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher , they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic . No other bottle kept that smell , it permeated my home for days ! ! ! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong , they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back . I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30 . It was offensive and disgraceful . Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info . Disgraceful company . Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick . The smell in the air was awful enough ! !	-1
The material came loose from the elastic when I washed it before using for the first time . I was disappointed in the quality . It is a baby item and needs to be soft and durable .	-1
It just stains so easily it 's not worth having it . I took the cover off and it 's better that way . My friend has some black water proof changing pads , I 'm beginning to see that 's the way to go , would be nice to have them to put over the changing pad .	-1
This is not sage . It is mint green . Very pastel and kinda girly . I have a boy and it does n't match with anything in his room because it is not sage . Other than that , it 's fine .	-1
As others have mentioned , the color of this product is more of a lime green , not even close to sage as pictured . I 'm only keeping it because it was cheap , it 's soft , and I ca n't be bothered to send it back .	-1
We did n't end up needing these , so I highly recommend you wait and see if you will even need the height . We have a relatively high bed , which is why we thought we would need them , but the unit is higher than you think it will be on its own .	-1
I ca n't help but agree with other reviewers who call this item out for what it is ... pure price gouging by Arm 's Reach . Leg extenders should absolutely 100 % be included with this product , not sold separately ( especially for a price of $ 20+ ) . I 'll also be buying a more reasonable , sturdy alternative.Also misleading is the fact that co-sleeper instructions ( I have the `` mini '' model ) state that the unit as packaged is adjustable for beds up to 24 '' in height . This really only means that the top of the co-sleeper frame is 24 '' high , NOT the mattress platform . Be aware of this when purchasing . If your bed is higher than 23-24 '' and you want your baby sleeping at the same level as you ... you 'll need to buy extensions , whether you choose to purchase from Arm 's Reach or not .	-1
Con : There is absolutely no reason for these NOT to be included in you co sleeper sets . None . What do they cost you to make , really ? And our bed is absolutely average height . Who leaves their bed sitting on the floor ? This is false advertising and price gouging . You should be ashamed of yourselves.I 'm glad we 're borrowing our co sleeper . The cost/absence of these would have been enough to make me not do business with you.Pro : They work & # 8230 ; as long as the bassinet remains attached to the bed . I guess they could n't afford to make them lock together .	-1
We bought these to make the Co-Sleeper taller if we decided to use it next to our bed . We were n't sure if we wanted to keep it in our daughter 's nursery or in our room . In the end , they were kind of a waste because we ended up just keeping her in the nursery . However , I wanted to review them because I also was n't happy with the stability of the Co-Sleeper when we made it taller with these . It seemed a bit shaky , and my husband and I were uncomfortable with it . Overall , wish we had saved the money .	-1
This was a waste of money . I got it so that my daughters head would not fall forward while she was sleeping in her car seat but the part that goes behind her head is so bulky that it actually pushes her head forward . It also limits their head movement when they are awake , so I had to take it off anyway . It did not hug her head like it is shown in the picture . I think you would be better off with one of those small boppy like pillows they make for this same purpose and just put it under their chin when they fall asleep .	-1
These did n't work well and my little girls head still fell forward . These are hard to put around the head/neck when the child is asleep and when they are awake they do n't want the head support around their head- it was aggravating to her . Maybe this would work better for a smaller infant , but not a child over 6 months in my opinion .	-1
Do n't buy this product ... totally sucks . It does n't fit like it shows in the photo . It just does n't fit right . I regret buying this.. and hassle to return when it only cost about $ 10 ( with baby.. going to post office and staying in the line.. was n't something I was willing to do ) .	-1
We bought this product when my 6-month-old son moved up to a convertible car seat from his infant car seat . Because the car seat is more upright , his head was dropping forward when he fell asleep in the car . We installed the product as shown , but the first time he fell asleep , his head was pushed so far forward he snored loudly and then started wheezing . I pulled over , woke him up , and removed the pillows . We threw them away after one use . We got cushioned strap covers intead , and they seem to work better because nothing goes behind his head .	-1
It 's too big and does n't fit into our Graco infant snugride since the top of the carseat is curved . Could be a good product and will save it for when we transition to the convertible carseat ( if we still need it by then ) .	-1
Lids are very hard to close . By the time you finally tight the lid to the ice cubes all the liquid inside is spread over the kitchen counter .	-1
I was excited about these because I wanted to have lids covering my home-made baby food . I have never once put this product in the dish-washer , just as it states , and these trays and lids have never sealed since the first time they were in my freezer . The plastic is thick and frozen food slides out easily , but it also does from my dollar store ice cube trays . the whole point of this product in my mind , is to have the lids , and since they do n't fit , I find this product over-priced and use-less .	-1
Just received the trays . There are two trays and one lid . Very disappointed . I ca n't return it because I broke the box before noticing the missing lid .	-1
They would be useful if the size of the cubes would be twice bigger and deeper . 2 starts for the idea only .	-1
It 's a regular tray with a lid . Not anything fancy at all . I think there are better designs out there for baby food and breast milk .	-1
This milk tray looks and feel sturdy . However , it is not airtight . You also have to carefully slide it flat into the freezer so the cubes do n't spill out or into the next cube . Moisture beads collect under the cover , and a slight freezer smell seeps in . When popping out the cubes , it looks like moisture collects under each cube as well . I did n't continue to use this as I worried about the freshness of storing milk this way . Also , each cube is 0.5 ounces , and this shape takes up a lot more freezer space than using bags which can be frozen as flat bricks .	-1
Lids do n't fit , and cube size is not useful . It 's just under an ounce , and hard to get it just right for half an ounce .	-1
I wanted to like these , but , alas , it was not meant to be . I was using these to store breast milk but eventually gave up because of the inconvenience . Anytime I needed to pop out some cubes of froze milk , I had to get my husband to twist the plastic so they would pop out ! The plastic was so inflexible that I could not do it by myself and I am not a wimpy girl ! It got so annoying that I finally abandoned the trays . I may revisit using them when my LO is eating solids , but for now they are being stored out of the way . I ca n't recommend these .	-1
Do not like this product ... lids DO NOT STAY ON from the moment i un-packed them . They have not been in dishwasher . Also very hard to get frozen cubes out . I will no longer use this item ! !	-1
The lids do n't stay on . Which defeats the purpose . I do n't want air to get in there so the food stays fresh . I returned them .	-1
So the food gets all frosty . I use three rubber bands to keep it on better and it works well enough .	-1
I really like using the little square glad plastic tubs rather than this item just didnt like how it was too much work trying to get the frozen cube out if I did n't want to defrost the whole thing .	-1
My bad for not reading reviews before buying . If I had known I would have to run it under water to get the cubes out , I would have purchased a different product . I wanted something I could use after we were done with baby food , but this will make getting ice cubes out a PITA . The cubes are small , I use two for my 5 month old . It is a solid product though . No issues with the covers like other people . Sigh . I say my bad , but really , why make it so hard to get stuff out ?	-1
I bought this mirror because of all the great reviews . But I am not thrilled with it . I have to see if I can find anything that works better for me . Maybe all the car seat mirrors are problematic . Who knows.The view in this is very clear , though small.The bigger downside though is that I have it attached for the middle seat in my mid-sized sedan and , as a couple other reviewers point out , it completely blocks the visibility of the car behind you . It actually spans the distance from the top of the seat to the roof of the car , splitting the rear window visibility in half . I thought I might be able to live with this , but I can not . I ca n't see the car directly behind me on the highway at all . I ca n't see if they are real close or far away or not there at all . I like to be able to see behind me because it helps me gauge my reaction in an emergency situation.So , I 'm going to look on ...	-1
This mirror does not work with my Britax Roundabout 55 rear facing car seat because of the way that it needs to be tethered to the anchor , so I 've put it in the seat next to it , and I can still kind of see my child . It is HUGE ! There is no way that I would put this on the headrest . It would completely block my vision . It 's cute , though , and the mirror image is really clear . I wish I had n't bought it . I did post a picture of the different ways you can anchor the mirror .	-1
I was so excited when I ordered this product because it seems to be the safest infant mirror I could find and also had many ways to install it . I placed it in my back seat as directed . The seats in the back are at a slight recline so I could n't even see my baby from the rearview mirror . Luckily I have a fold out armrest in the back right in front of my baby . I tucked the bottom of it in there and loosened the fastening so it sort of hangs out at a different angle . It 's jimmy-rigged but is n't sturdy enough for my liking . Great idea just does n't work . **UPDATE** I was putting my car seat when it accidentally hooked on the mirror . In an instant it was broken and it broke with a very sharp piece sticking out . Very weak material and very dangerous ! ! !	-1
The mirror is not much larger than other mirrors or more clear . I ended up returning it for a regular rectangular mirror . There was nothing special about this mirror !	-1
Sure , this is cute , but it 's huge and the mirror sucks . I can only see baby if the light is perfect and the adorable-ness of the panda is pointless for baby , but attracts dust . Regretting this purchase . Wish I had just gotten a good infant car mirror without the plush bells and whistles .	-1
I really wanted to like these but I was faced with a couple of problems . ( 1 ) My daughter 's hand as too big for the 1-yr-old tin . ( 2 ) I tried to get her handprint anyway and discovered that the plaster dried FAR too fast to even get a very faint imprint . The instructions say that I could have scraped out the plaster and sent the empty tin back to the company for a free replacement of the plaster ( after paying for shipping ) . I chose to dispose of the whole set after trying for at least 10 minutes to get the plaster out of the tin -- yah right ! As an alternative , I found a clay imprint set that allows for molding and remolding if it does n't turn out well . Clay is the way to go -- not plaster !	-1
We got this as a gift for our baby and I am SO happy we did not pay for it ! This product is awful . The design on the tin leaves much to be desired ( as a professional artist I 'd like to know who did the awful typeset ! ) but that 's the least of this product 's problems . The real problem is the plaster , and after reading reviews on here beforehand , I completely agree with the bad ones . We followed the instructions **very carefully** and the mixture was a complete failure ! We mixed it continuously for about 15 minutes and it did not turn into a `` toothpaste consistency '' until we let it sit for 10 minutes . The water kept floating to the top so we had to mix it occasionally while it sat . When it was `` ready '' and a `` toothpaste consistency '' we took baby 's hand to it and she was actually pretty cooperative . We pressed the hand and each finger into the plaster and got NOTHING ! The plaster was in no way too hard , it was the right consistency for an imprint but we could not get one of her little hand . We gave up after 6 tries ( baby was frustrated by then ) and I tossed the plaster in the trash . I saved the tin so I might try buying some clay that can be baked and will harden . Do n't waste your money on this garbage ! And the insert from the manufacturer saying they 'll ship you another little packet of plaster for $ 5.00 ... what a joke ! Not worth that . Save your money , this product is so frustrating and disappointing it will have you near tears !	-1
Great . So my wife and I purchased this ultra-convenient frame/stroller for convenience . It worked great for about 8 weeks , then one of the front wheels bent to where we could n't use it anymore . AND , the front wheels would at times jam the stroller from opening up in the first place . In concept , a frame/stroller like this is awesome , but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier . All in all , a major dissapointment .	-1
I found I did n't care for this product once I got my hands on it . I was expecting something relatively soft and pliable . This is quite a hard piece of plastic . Clearly it 'd be better to hit you head against this than a metal spout , but just as clearly there are better products on the market .	-1
Very cute but does not come close to fitting . Read the description carefully as it will not go over a spout with shower pull .	-1
I bought the hippo . Cute ... but it does n't stay on the tub spout . My son immediately pulled it off and wants to play with it . So now its just a tub toy .	-1
Difficult if not impossible to fit on spout , has no hole for shower pull . The paint was also already wearing off ontop the hippos head , like it might have already been used ?	-1
It 's a great idea but poor design and construction . It 's a very stiff rubber so when I went to slip it over the spout the inner rings broke off . The inner rubber rings help keep the hippo snug on the spout . Once the rings broke off , the hippo just dangled on the spout . The water flows out of his mouth still but back sprays out of the neck because its too loose . I would n't recommend it but it 'll do until I find a suitable replacement .	-1
Dont buy or waste your money really bad . It gets a star because > The hippo is cute but it 's piece of garbage . Sending back hope I can .	-1
This is cute ... Not sure if it was my specific unit but it stopped working and after replacing the batteries it still did n't work : ( it does look good but does n't work : (	-1
We got this backpack as a gift because we love to hike . Unfortunatley neither my husband or I could ever get it adjusted correctly for comfort . My son never seemed very comfortable in it either . We are 5 ' 7 '' and 5 ' 10 '' with average builds , so I assumed it would fit us . In addion to that , the frame makes it bulky and hard to bring places . It takes up almost as much room as a stroller in my car . This would be fine if it were comfortable , but it 's just not . I was bummed because I would love to have a comfortable hiking pack , but this has been sitting in our garage taking up space . We took it hiking a few times and it kills our shoulders , the frame comes up really high around DS so he can barely see out and seems smooshed . I just purchased the Ergo and it is a million times more comfortable for a toddler . DS seems to love it , and I can wear it for much longer than this frame carrier . Plus it is cloth so it folds up small and can be brought along anywhere , even in the bottom of the stroller in case he wants to be held . I would pass on this product in favor of a better one or an Ergo for the same price .	-1
I suppose you get what you pay for . I am 5'2 & # 34 ; and the lumbar portion dug into my back in the worst way . My husband is 6'5 & # 34 ; and the lumbar portion was in the middle of his belly . Very uncomfortable for both of us . Also , the strap which is supposed to offload some of the weight basically just pulls on your belly . My son did look happy riding it in , but I will be returning and upgrading to a Kelty 3.0 . Oh well .	-1
I tried this product instead of the more expensive options out there . I realized that comfort is worth the extra money . I tried it on for only a few minutes with my 28 pound son and my shoulders felt like they were going to fall off . Not enough shoulder support . I was so glad this happened in the first few moments and not after a hike . I immediately made plans to return this item ( which is wonderfully easy with Amazon ) . Everything seemed to fit fine other than that , I am 5'5 '' tall , medium built woman in relatively good shape . Thank goodness for EBAY , I was able to get a used , better supporting pack for cheap . Maybe a lighter child would fare better in this pack .	-1
We requested this on our registry since we 're avid hikers and wanted a backpack carrier that was affordable and well-reviewed . I 'm not sure how others are using this carrier and finding it comfortable . Perhaps we 're hiking greater distances ? Perhaps our baby is heavier ? As someone accustomed to carrying the kiddo in an Ergo and Becco and accustomed to backpacking ( carrying up to a 50-lb pack for an extended time in the backcountry ) , I know the importance of a decent waist strap . I know how much lighter and more comfortable a load can seem if it 's well-distributed . This carrier does not have a sufficient waist strap . Carrying our daughter in this carrier was immediately uncomfortable and , over just a few miles , painful for both me and my husband . We 'll have to return it and cough up the extra $ for a carrier with a better waist strap .	-1
I ordered this item after reading through the reviews . While some were negative , most were positive so I decided to give it a shot . I should have trusted the negative reviews . I am 5'2 and my husband is 6'3 , both fairly fit people . We both found that this carrier was extremely uncomfortable . The bottom of this pack dug into my tailbone when I wore it and my husband just could n't find a way to adjust the straps so that it was comfortable for him . I am returning it after attempting to use it once on a hike . The chest strap is not adjustable ( up or down ) and actually does n't tighten enough for my thinner frame . We were so excited to upgrade from a soft pack to a framed pack but this just turned into a disappointment .	-1
this item has a short battery life . sometimes it will die during the night even if have charged it fully during the day.this system is prone to a lot of interferences .	-1
Although the monitor is a bit bulky ( if you have plans of clipping it to your clothes where you are out and about in your own house ) , it worked well the first six months . Then , all of a sudden , no more picture , just static . I have never been able to figure out what the heck happened and why . I certainly would not purchase any of their electonic products again .	-1
Yeah , its a great concept , but come on , for over a hundred bucks the product should last longer than a year ! ! ! I bought one unit in 2009 ( at a babies r us ) and was in love with it for the first 8 months . Thought it was the best investment we made for baby ! Then it started going downhill ... ..the plug to charge the monitor would n't stay in to charge and the static interference got worse . Also the volume doent work anymore , you have to turn it all the way up but then you get a buzzing sound . We have a second baby due next month so decided to buy another unit ( the one I bought on amazon ) the screen is so bright you cant even see the baby in the crib . I have mailed it back to the manufacturer . I am really dissapointed this product isnt made better for how much it costs .	-1
when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased . the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in , so it was a pain cause I could n't go outside and relax , had to stay near the unit where the plug was . as I live in another country I could n't call for the warranty . would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I had this highchair with my first son - and when I pulled it out to put our new baby in it - I remembered all of my frustrations and ended up throwing it away.I bought the chair originally because of the comfort for the baby - the plush , big seat , the reclining options and the height adjustment options.I also loved that it had wheels on the bottom so that I could move it around the kitchen and out to the deck for summer meals.Everything was great at first - until we really started using it . Here were my main issues:1 - I hope they 've fixed this in newer models , but the baby could get the tray off by sticking his foot in the handle and kicking it off.2 - The cotton cover pills the first time you wash it , and the batting ( stuffing ) inside , bunches up into one of the corners.3 - The legs stick out further than the chair , so every time the baby drops little bits of food off the side ( or lots of food when they 're older and think it 's funny or want to feed the family pet ! ) it gets stuck on the legs and in between the legs and the seat . I was constantly scrubbing food out of the little cracks and off of the various molds on the plastic legs.4 - When you wash the tray , water seeps into it and does n't all come out no matter how much shaking and draining you attempt . So , when you stick it back on to the chair , it slowly leaks onto the floor . After a while it starts to smell like mildew.5 - It takes up a lot of space - and even with the nice print on the cover - all of the plastic and metal makes it stick out like a sore thumb.We purchased the Eddie Bauer wood highchair for our new baby . I 'm so much happier with it . It looks nicer , it does n't get anywhere near as dirty - but when it does , it is easy to clean . The baby seems just as comfy in it as the Trend seat . I do n't mind having to pick it up and move it instead of rolling it - that little task is worth all of the time that I spent trying the Trend chair clean .	-1
These do n't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash . I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better . You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper ( about $ 2 ) . I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells . I 'm no longer using these because I 've switched to cloth diapers.Another bad thing is they are n't biodegradable , maybe they should change that .	-1
These bags are too stinky ! ! I threw them out . I read the other reviews complaining about smell and I thought it could n't be THAT bad , so I ordered them anyway . Its nasty . Made my whole diaper bag smell . I put them in their own plastci bag in the diaper bag and it still made the entire thing stink . I have snacks in the diaper bag , even in a differnet pocket completely , and the bags made the snacks stink I had to throw those out too .	-1
I bought these diaper sacks in preparation for my baby and I returned these IMMEDIATELY and here 's why : I could smell the artificial powder smell before I even opened the package . Once I did , I was overwhelmed by the nauseating smell and realized this would stink up the nursery and diaper bag in a second . If you are sensitive to smells , this is not the product for you . A better alternative would be ordering unscented dog poop bags .	-1
you need a bag that fits the diaper as well as the tissues and this is not big enough . dont waste money on it	-1
I 've ordered these twice . The first time , they were alright and a decent price for the amount of bags you receive . The second order - the smell coming off the bags was horrific ! It smelled like bug spray or something toxic - they would stink up the whole room ! I returned them hoping for a better batch . NO LUCK ! They smell just as bad and my husband had to put them out in the garage . We 'll be using them as poop bags for the dog instead of diaper disposal bags . They smell way too strong to put anywhere near the family !	-1
Overall the bags work fine . But the scent is too strong and the ingredients for the fragrance are unlisted on the package ( the fragrance could have potentially harmful phthalates , d-limonene , etc. ) . Before I opened the box , I could smell the fragrance from the bags.Almost everything I buy for the baby and the household is fragrance-free . So if you typically buy fragranced soaps , air fresheners , etc . for your home , then these bags should n't bother you much . The other popular green-friendly , decomposable bags on Amazon have about half the scent but that 's still too strong for me.I wound up using regular ziplock bags ( which do n't hold in odor well ) and a small trash can with a charcoal filter in the lid to keep in odors . Every Tuesday and Friday I empty the small trash to go out with the garbage . There 's no poopy diaper smell in the room and no fragrance , so I 'm happy .	-1
These are the worst bags . I gagged every time time I went near them . I threw them out and spent a little more	-1
The smell will only work in a bathroom but definitely NOT in a babies room . Unless you want your baby to have respiratory issues- steer clear of these !	-1
These bags are very , very thin . They ca n't block the diaper smell , so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I ca n't stand to leave the box open . The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition , the way the bags are placed in the box they do n't pop up as you pull one out , so I 'm always struggling to get another bag out as I 'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well , the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties . They are easy to use .	-1
I love this product and have been using the diaper sacks for over a year . Something is wrong with the price . It 's gone up almost $ 10.00 . I ordered them anyway because I need them , but the price just does n't seem right .	-1
I got a fleece version as a shower gift , and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter , now 5 weeks , sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already . However , after washing it twice ( and following the washing instructions ) , it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones . My daughter is on the large side ( she was 9 lbs at birth ) , and 1 1/2 inches does n't seem like that much of a difference , but she ca n't wear the flannel one anymore . The velcro just barely does n't reach.Love the fleece ones , very disappointed in this one .	-1
The motor on this toy is SO loud ! I do n't know how any baby could fall asleep to this , mine never did . I looked everywhere for the older version and found it . What a difference . That one is so much better and no loud motor . It is so much more soothing . Still does n't put my baby to sleep but he likes looking at it .	-1
I purchased this item yesterday , and it will go back to the store tomorrow . I got it together , turned it on , and the motor on the thing was louder than the music . It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute . There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep .	-1
My wife keeps buying Fisher-Price products for our infant . I do n't know why . Most of the P.O.S . products we have bought from them have either malfunctioned prematurely , or have fallen short in expectations due to shoddy construction and/or poor design . This product is no exception . The concept is good , but execution is terrible . You will go crazy trying to find the tiny , recessed screws on the battery pack , in order to attach the unit to a crib . In addition , they easily strip , even with the proper sized screwdriver ! This makes it impossible to either install the unit , or to remove it ! ! ! Whoever designed the crib attachment battery pack part of this product should be fired Donald Trump style ! ! ! Back to the drawing board Fisher-Price .	-1
Do n't waste your time with this version . The older one can be found in most children 's consignment stores and is much better . I also have the Flutterbye version , which is even better .	-1
We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish . My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish would n't move anymore . The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model . The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on . If you have a Next Generation or any other large , sleigh type crib.forget it . There is no way to attach it . I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line . They need to make the straps way longer ( test this on different types of cribs ) .Next problem ... .it needs more water in front of the toys . It is obvious they are not in the water ( not a problem on the older model ) , it would make better bubbles too . I like the fish and the music .	-1
My toddler cries every time we use this shampoo . Also her dandruff does not go away as I thought it would with this natural shampoo .	-1
Ordered this cover for my beloved Snoogle ( on my 3rd pregnancy and I do n't know what I would do with out it ! ) . HOWEVER , this cover is covered in lint and cat fur ( my 2 cats do not shed that much ) . The original cover was the same way but did n't seem as bad , this one however is horrible ! I 'm so bummed because I love using my Snoogle but I have got to figure something else out because it just seems gross even after washing it . : (	-1
We bought this thinking wood was 'healthier ' or 'safer ' for baby . It comes with a plastic tray cover which we figured we did n't have to use , but unfortunately the paint is chipping and peeling and gets all over babies hands . So we started using the plastic cover , but the thing is so hard to get on and off it has almost ripped our nails off . Baby has been using this about 2 months now ( she 's 8 months ) and already it is loose and the screws are coming out . The fabric is very nice but not very practical , there is no way to clean it without putting it in the wash . I can get over that in order to avoid plastic , but the other issues with the chair have made this a bad purchase for our family and we will be looking for something else .	-1
I hate writing a negative review for this chair because I think it is beautiful . We live in an apartment and I really did not want a huge plastic monstrosity taking up too much space . The pros of this chair are that it is very nice looking and has a small footprint . The negatives have been mentioned in a few of the other reviews - ( 1 ) the tray is small so it only fits a very small plate and a very small cup ; ( 2 ) the wooden frame for the tray is set up in such a way that it is very difficult to slide your child into the seat ; ( 3 ) the tray is not easy to remove to clean ; ( 4 ) the bolt on the bottom of the chair keeps coming off ( my husband says it 's not a hazard but I find it disconcerting ; ( 5 ) the straps are of poor quality ( no over the shoulder straps so my son almost crawled out and tipped over the chair once ! ) and difficult to adjust once the child is in the seat ; ( 6 ) it does not seem particularly sturdy ; and ( 7 ) my son has never seemed to like it ( he 's been using it for over 10 months now ) . I am tempted just to get a booster seat and be done with this chair , even though it is supposed to grow with the child .	-1
I ca n't believe I bought this in 2 colors ! The fabric gets extremely itchy after being washed and tumble dried ! ! Pills like crazy .	-1
I plan on washing the heck out of these before I use them , just to make them softer , I received two gingham check prints and they are cute to look at .	-1
I purchased three organic cotton mattress covers from three different company and I feel that many companies are jumping on the organic bandwagon and pushing out inferior products with a bit of false advertising . This product states 100 % organic cotton surface , but the pad , on the label , says 20 % organic cotton blend . Again , that is very misleading ( and the pad is thick and bulky anyway ) . I am definitely returning it.About the other two if you are searching for the right one . I bought the Colgate organic mattress pad as I have the Colgate Eco organic mattress and spent a lot of money on it ( $ 250 ) . I have been pleased with the mattress and was looking forward to buying this cover to match . I received it the other day and noticed that the underside of the cover smelled a bit like plastic . Obviously this was due to the waterproof backing . I could maybe live with that , but ... .and this is a big one.I would like to know how this is sold as organic ? ? The care instruction label states 100 % polyester . That 's right 100 % .I understand that it ca n't be 100 % organic cotton AND waterproof , but there is nothing remotely labeled `` organic '' cotton , or ever COTTON except the paper product insert and the top of the pad says certified organic cotton . It feels soft like cotton , but is it ? I am very disappointed . I would hope that the company would get back to me regarding this because it is VERY misleading to sell something as organic cotton , while it states that is 100 % polyester ... .unless the label is incorrect . Please see my review for the update.The third product , the Naturpedic waterproof mattress pad felt like a piece of soft piece of canvas . HOWEVER , the label states 100 % organic cotton .	-1
This mattress pad is backed with plastic ! It smells like plastic and the `` Organic Cotton '' title is completely misleading . False advertising !	-1
I love the shape and height of this pillow , but it 's just too soft for nursing . The lack of support causes the baby to `` slip '' forward . It 's a very light-weight pillow and tends to shift a lot on your lap . Also , the cheap filling tends to bunch up and become misshapen after only a few washes .	-1
I wanted a nursing pillow to prop up my reflux baby , and this one did not do the job . The stuffing is so soft baby sinks into it . Its much smaller than it appears and has no belts or anything to go around you , its literally a pillow . The breast friend with a pillow stuffed under it does a much better job .	-1
Do n't buy this pillow if you will be using it to nurse . The cover does n't come off to wash either piece ! I do n't care for it 's shape , but it might be perfect for another mother/baby pair . The fact that you ca n't wash the cover is ridiculous . What child does n't dribble milk out of their mouth ? What mother does n't drip a little ? You are going to get milk on this and not be able to remove the cover to wash it . You will have to wash the whole pillow . Not cool .	-1
This product is so close to being awesome . I 'm tall , 6'1 and thought this was going to be a godsend for nuring . I tried using it several times but its slippery and not comfortable . It does n't BOOST enough and the baby it awkward laying on it .	-1
Five years of breastfeeding and three babies into this ( including a 22 lb five month old ) and a friend absolutely insisted I try her pillow because it would be a lifesaver.Not impressed.Personally , it felt incredibly strange to have this HUGE thing around me . I worried it would make me too comfortable and prone to falling asleep and the baby would be at risk of suffocation . It seems counterintuitive to purposely place a baby on a soft surface in a sleepy situation when literature dictates time and time again that something like this is precisely what should be kept away from baby . Go ahead , send me nasty comments about how you will never fall asleep nursing your baby , but it happens . And all it takes is one time under the wrong circumstances . It just seems dangerous.Even if it did n't seem dangerous , it 's hot , and it feels cheaply constructed.Honestly , you will get used to the weight of your baby . They start out tiny and you grow together . Plus , unless it 's your first , you are probably going to be spending a LOT of time nursing while doing other things . Do you really want this flying saucer around your waist while trying to check on other kids , do chores , etc ? I do n't .	-1
Our baby has not arrived yet so I can not comment on usage . However , I did want to warn others that the material is very scruffy and stuffing does start coming out as another reviewer mention . We have n't even used it and stuffing is already stuck in the Velcro.Item does fit around my waist just fine and I am 7months pregnant so it will fit larger women.Update****Hardly used this item once LO arrived . It was so big I could not get my baby on it comfortably . Wished I had saved the money .	-1
I ordered this product to use on my ( very standard , typically sized ) double hung window , in order to prevent my toddler from opening the window too far . The suction cups work fine , but the & # 34 ; steps & # 34 ; are n't nearly deep enough and do n't stop the window at all . They would need to be at least another inch larger in order to work.Of course , because I 'd already tried them on my ( newly Windexed ) window , the seller would n't let me return them . A disappointing waste of money .	-1
I bought these after friends recommended them . They do catch the dribbles from feeding but it just soaks through to the bottom and wets the shirt . We use cloth diapers or Gerber burp cloths under his chin and have n't had a soaked collar since .	-1
This is shit ! ! I return it . It does n't fit my spout at all . Way way too small . I found no way to put it into my spout . Return it and I need to pay for the shipping . Regret x 10000000 .	-1
I have a 10 month old baby who always wants to stand up in the tub but he 's not totally stable on his feet yet , especially in the bath ! I bought this to protect his head in case he fell against the faucet . The product is just about as hard as the faucet itself ! If you want one just for the novelty of it for your kiddos , it 's perfect . I 'd recommend it ! But if you 're ordering it for the same reasons as I did , keep looking . This is not it ! I should mention again that it is adorable & seemingly well made . Just did n't work for our needs .	-1
I had one of these several years ago for my eldest daughter which she loved so I decided to get another one for my second daughter . However , the experience is n't as nice this time around . With the new shower spout designs , this product was hard to fit larger spouts . The fit was VERY tight going on and coming off -- I felt that I was scratching the finish on the spout . If you have a large spout , i 'd suggest you look for something different .	-1
This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out , and NO shower pull-up handle ( look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations . ) On top of that , this cover is too short for any of our spigots ! One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover , the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front.This cover wo n't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle . If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed , then perhaps you can make this work.AND it 's too short ! When the cover is on a spigot , the back of the cover wo n't meet the tile wall , which means it ca n't be caulked into place , which means it is easily bumped out of position , spewing water everywhere , or perhaps worse , falling off the spigot entirely . No good ! This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots .	-1
Carry around a flat screw driver and you 'll be fine . I do n't understand how this has so many stars , the outlets are completely useless with these installed . These things will send mommy diving for the pills .	-1
I purchased these when my baby learned to crawl as an infant . They were just fine and were pretty easy for us to pull off when we needed an outlet for vacuuming , etc . However , now that my infant is now a toddler she can easily pull these off the wall . I was shocked when she nonchalantly walked over to the wall , pulled one off , and tried to plug in her night light . We had to go to our local hardware store and buy a different brand ! So overall these are fine for infants and young toddlers , but too easy for them to take off once they master the grasp ( age 2 and older ) .	-1
I find these get stuck and I ca n't ever use the outlet . I am prying them out with a screw driver and switching to the outlet covers that close .	-1
These things are complete junk and fall apart whenever you ( or your child ) touches them ... which in turn causes a potential choking hazard for the young child . Save your money .	-1
A friend of a friend installed these on all her windows thinking she made her blinds safe . Two month later , her 2 year old son was able to get the cord out of the cord windup device . He ended up hanging himself on the cords and died . He was supposed to be taking a nap . It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS ! ! ! But if you must keep your corded blinds , get the Fashion Wand ( approved by PFWBS ) . Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety ( PFWBS ) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords . Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds . And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether . If she could go back 1 year ago , she would take down every corded blind in her home so she 'd still have her son with her .	-1
The twisting feature does n't work according to package directions- the caps just lock in place and only turn about a quarter of a turn in either direction . You have to wind the cords BEFORE placing the cap back on , it 's a little tricky to keep all of the cord wound around the tiny little axle in the middle without the cap . Very cheap , but hey , I guess it did n't cost that much . Still better than nothing and they seem to stay in place ok .	-1
I 'd go with the tie points you put on the wall . I think these things suck and do n't work all that well .	-1
These are just one of many cheap child safety products out there than may serve the intended purpose , but may be more trouble than they are worth to make work . It 's not rocket science , but it 's a total pain in the ass to get the cords lined up in the right direction , with an adequate length of cord , and to get it all wound up and snapped together . You think you finally got it , and then you pull the cord to adjust the blinds and the caps pop apart and now you 've got a tangle of strings to untangle . Maybe 'm just missing the magic touch , but..I 'm plenty happy rolling the cords into a ball and securing them with a hair clip . it 's less work and plenty effective .	-1
I like the safety of these outlet covers , but the casing is too thick so plugs will not work unless it is perfectly flush with your walls . We live in a 20 year old home and these outlet covers work on 1/3 rd of our outlets .	-1
My house is all upgraded and these did n't fit any of my outlets . This requires the old outlets that have the screw in the middle . The modern upgraded outlets have screws on the top and bottom only . Back to Amazon these go !	-1
I was thinking that this would be really handy for outlets that I use more frequently and I am sure if could be if I had not had trouble installing it . I removed my old switch plate and replaced it with this one . However when I was installing it ( using the screw that it came with ) the screw broke off and the tip is now stuck in my outlet box . I now have to turn off my electricity and remove the outlet box to try and fish the screw out from the other end . In the meantime I have an exposed outlet which kind of defeats the purpose of getting a safety cover . Hopefully once I managed to get this item installed it will be smooth sailing .	-1
Did n't fit our outlets , could n't plug anything into the actual outlet . a waste of money . Too good to be true .	-1
This price is a LOT for something that youll have to buy many of ! ! ! ! this comes with just one , and if you multiply the price by the amount outlets you have , youll be spending a lot of money . I do however recommed these ,	-1
I decided to try these out since the positive reviews out-weighed the negative and I really need an outlet in each room where I do n't have to deal with the plastic plugs for things like the vacuum and iron . I faced several issues and will be returning these.1 ) The width and height are smaller than the standard outlet cover . While they covered the hole in the wall , they did not cover marks from the prior cover and missing paint so the wall around each outlet cover I replaced would require touch up . I took a chance since other reviewers had already mentioned this and unfortunately I had the same issue.2 ) they did n't lay flat against the wall so they could be twisted left and right and it looked bad . while little fingers could n't get into the space between the plate and the wall , little hands could try to shove stuff down there . Or if they did twist the cover they could turn it enough to create an opening.3 ) when trying out a few plugs in the outlet when I 'd remove the plug the cover did n't always slide back into place leaving the plug holes exposed . I tried 5 times and 2x the cover did n't fully retract .	-1
We ordered this because of all the good reviews only to realize that all of our electrical outlets have screws at the top and the bottom of the outlet plate and not at the center . This product only has a screw to fasten it to the outlet in the center with none for the top or the bottom ( which is exactly opposite of what we need ) . You should check your situation before you order this outlet plate ; it is unusable for us .	-1
As our kids became more mobile we wanted to have something to safeguard outlets which we needed to keep something plugged into . We thought this would work great as a way to keep kids fingers and toys away if they happened to pull the plug out of the socket.In theory this & # 34 ; works & # 34 ; for this requirement , but in practice it mostly makes the outlet unusable . What happens is the extra space created between the actual outlet and the plug ( by having the additional plastic of this cover in between ) makes most of the plugs loose and lose connection periodically.In our new house , I simply bought a bunch of new tamper resistant outlets as replacements which has worked much better and was far cheaper ( ~ $ 2 / outlet ) .	-1
inconvenient and thus useless -- i used it once ( it was irritating to put on ) -- i removed after the sun was no longer shining through the window ( so that my kid can see better ) and it was difficult to store and then got dirty and i never used it again.useless !	-1
Bought these to prevent sun spots on my face in the summer months due to my long commute . These offer good coverage ( without affecting visibility ) compared to the typical screens and a good alternative to permanent tinting , which is n't allowed for the front windows in my area for some reason . I use a squeegee to apply with minimal bubbles . The hard part is the plastic material is stretchy so it 's hard to get straight . Also , I did n't realize these were primarily made for rear-door windows . The square shape make it difficult to fit the slanted front windows ( without trimming ) . Plus , the package tell you not to scroll down the window once it 's on , though it is thin enough to do so if you 're careful . Very disappointed by that.All in all , these are n't a bad deal , at this price . They offer great protection and are easy enough to move around in case you get stopped by cops . No idea yet how well the material will stand up over time , with the summer heat. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2 months later : I left this on my window for a few months . When I finally took it off , there is a sticky residue that 's hard to clean off . Even after a lot of scrubbing ( with window cleaner ) there 's some residue left and it 's causing a problem when I scroll the window down . Definitely NOT worth the trouble .	-1
I had the Jeep window shades in my Tundra , but when we bought the Camry , the shades were too big . So I bought these , hoping that installation would go better and they would be the right size . Not only were they not the right size , but they were flimsy and not tinted near enough to make a difference . I probably could have ripped one of them if I had n't thrown them away first . We ended up reusing the Jeep shades and cutting them to size with a razor blade . They work soooo much better .	-1
Not very happy . Did n't stick well , stay on well , or block the whole window . Spend a few more bucks on a better item .	-1
We bought this instead of the pull back shades , thinking it 'd work well and be easy to install . Was very hard to get flat and straight on the window and pealed up when you lowered the window ( this was n't a huge surprise and was discovered by accident ) . Would n't buy again and would just get the pull down shade in the future .	-1
You are better off getting the ones with suction cups . These also are dark and hard to see through . They are plastic so they get really hot here in AZ .	-1
I purchased these to install on the rear window of my sedan . They are fairly easy to install , and not too difficult to get smooth/remove bubbles if you take your time . My only issue is that the tint is way too dark . I can barely see out of my back window , even on the brightest of days .	-1
I spent half an hour attempting to put them up and after cleaning the window and pressing one side then the other ( maybe this side would work if not the other ) well in the end they ended up in the garbage . JUNK ! They will not stay on my window .	-1
The edges were frayed as I started to roll it out . It also does not fit well for my Kia Sorento windows .	-1
It 's very difficult to put this product on without any bubbles . I simply do n't have the patience to adjust and readjust . That being said , it did serve it 's purpose , and that 's reducing the amount of sun that gets to my son , but my biggest problem with it is that it is very dark . I read the reviews of others , and thought I would be able to handle the darkness . It was only installed on the back driver side window . But after driving with it for a few days , i found myself checking and re-checking my blind spot . Maybe it just takes getting used to ... but I 've since removed it . Also , it is tacky looking , but I can get over that as long as it works .	-1
I am really glad it failed while I was present and not on top of one of my children ! This product lost its & # 34 ; stickness & # 34 ; a week after installation .	-1
Does n't work . Save your money and the paint on your appliances . Do not buy this piece of junk . Very disappointed .	-1
This mat is n't really big enough for the car seat we have . I 'd rather have one that is wider and has a longer seat . We have a Britax Advocate and part of the seat always seems to be on the car seat rather than the protection mat because of the size .	-1
Needs some padding around neck . The straps edges rub the neck and do bad things . The demo kid is wearing a turtle neck , which would help .	-1
Our child would not let us put it on him . So in the end , the product did not serve its intended purpose	-1
pointless . do n't buy . its just velrco . My kid screamed when I put it on and then just tore it off with one hand .	-1
Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem , cause I mean when you buy it , you already know that ! LOLMy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not . Every time I would put it on her , she would scream and beg me not to put it on . It was really heartbreaking . On the plus side , this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOLWe used it a couple of time and put it aside . She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth .	-1
I received this today.While the idea is great , it is made of very flimsy plastic and requires plastic nuts and bolts to assemble which are included but 2 of them snapped in half while assembling it . These bolts can not cost anything so I would have thought more than the required 6 would have been included . I would never recommend this item . I called the company that makes it but they were not available . They close at 4:30 p.m. EST . Do n't buy it !	-1
Unstable and flimsy , this piece of plastic nonsense is such a disappointment . it 's not sturdy enough to support a toddler . I should have known that at this cheap price that I was going to get junk . You 're better off putting a stool on the ground and a seat on the toilet .	-1
I ordered this to have for 2yr old granddaughter , while it is easy to put together . The step is at a angle , and the seat did fit or cove the toilet . I sent this back the exact same day , because its a piece of junk .	-1
This was a cheaper option compared to other types of safety straps , and I 'd say it 's just OK . The straps are very stiff and kinda rough , especially the parts that rub against his neck . It actually left red marks on my son 's neck . : ( I put some strap covers on so that helped greatly . But the thing is such a pain to put on and take off , cause you have to slip one arm through , then the child 's head , and then the other arm . It 's a little awkward.It did help me keep my son from running away from me , and when he tripped and fell , it kept him from hitting the ground cause I yanked him right up ! I have since decided to spend a little more money and get a more comfortable safety strap : Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy - Monkey I love this monkey so much ! ! ! Soft , slips on and off like a book-bag , cute , and my son loves the monkey ! I would recommend spending a little extra for comfort !	-1
this product had a Velcro strap . if your child falls it could be dangerous . get a better product with a buckle	-1
I bought this based on the - mostly good reviews- however , I am giving a warning.. read the bad reviews and take them to heart.. everything stated ... Stiff material that hurts then , sticks in their throat , velrco easily undone.. its all true ! beware ! this will be like throwing your 12.00 OUT OF THE WINDOW .	-1
We ordered this item to keep track of our toddler how now refused to be carried or put in the stroller . We took it out of the package and adjusted it to fit our toddler . We held the wrist strap and it immediately broke -- even before he or the parent started moving . It appears that the handle portion of the item ( that the parent holds ) had been improperly sewn . As a result , that loop was not secured . We contacted Amazon and the offered us a refund , which we gladly took . We will not be purchasing this item again .	-1
I just got mine today ( ordered elsewhere ) and there is no swivel on the clip despite this listing 's claim . But at least the plastic parts are opaque black , rather than the more brittle transparent stuff in the pic . Other than the lack of a swivel clip , the harness seems ok . The straps are woven to the needed width , instead of cut from larger webbing and edge-melted to keep from fraying ; the material is n't exactly satiny soft , but it 's not too bad , and at least it does n't have scratchy melted edges . But dang it , that swivel clip would save frustration , and the listing SAYS it 's there .	-1
While this seat is a little small for the toilet seat , it fits enough that it would still be acceptable if my son did n't just pee right over the front `` guard . '' We have a different seat in the kids ' bathroom that I wish I could find again , because it works very well , but this one is pretty useless .	-1
I just got this for our daughter because she is getting too big for her stand alone potty and she was saying it hurts her bottom . I got this and it does not fit our toilet seat , we have the longer seats and this potty seat just slides all over the place and it scares her to get on it and she also says it hurts her bottom . We are going to try to return it ! I do not recommend this potty seat !	-1
Really liked the good price . Sad that this does n't fit either toilet . Also , the plastic smells and the splash guard is too short for my boy .	-1
If your child likes open and close the door this product is not going to last for very long . It cracks so be careful and watch it so your child does not hurt themselves .	-1
I was disappointed in the quality of this product . The straps themselves are nothing special and the included screws are very poor quality . In one case the screw head was stamped off center , making it unusable . As indicated by other reviewers , it is pretty much impossible to use these screws without stripping them , even if you use a hand screwdriver and a pre-drilled hole . I ended up having to use some leftover drywall screws , which fit through the opening in the brackets almost perfectly.Since you will have to replace the screws , you are better off just purchasing the brackets and your own zip ties .	-1
My husband says the screws that came with this product are the worst he 's ever dealt with . They do n't go in straight and they strip . He had to go to the hardware store for replacement screws in order to install the brackets . Other than that , the brackets and zip ties seem fine .	-1
I purchased this pail for cloth diaper storage , but I found out after two days of usage that it is not good for it because this pail can hold only 4-5 wet cloth diapers , which not even one day 's worth of diaper supply . I think it would hardly hold one day worth of disposable diaper supply for disposable diaper user , which is only good if you want to dispose diapers everyday . Overall , I think this diaper pail is too small and only good as a secondary pail to use somewhere else in the house other than nursery .	-1
This diaper pail is too small for parents who cloth diaper . Also , putting it over a reusable liner is hard because it is very difficult to get the lid to snap shut . I feel like I 'm constantly finagling with it to get it to close . Also , the place where you snap in the air fresheners are difficult to use . We eventually just gave up . All of that was fine , but now , after just 8 months of use , the lid broke . The two little nubs that lock it in place just gave out . One snapped off completely , and the other is about to give . All in all , it 's just not worth the money . We were n't particularly rough on the pail , and it should last at least the diapering life of one child .	-1
This is ok if your child 's diapers do n't stink ( yeah right ! ) .We had high hopes for this after our Arm & Hammer/Munchkin diaper pail broke . It has a compartment in the lid for a deodorizer but it does absolutely nothing . We ended up putting the bin outside on the balcony and taking soiled diapers out there . When it was in our son 's bedroom the stench was horrendous .	-1
We bought this to use as a trash can in our babies ' room when they were a year old and starting to get into everything . I figured if it is marketed as a diaper pail it must be able to handle simply trash ! I was wrong . The pail is so light and flimsy that it flips over as soon as you hit the pedal with your foot . Nor does it close tightly . My kids were into it immediately , and we put this trash can in the trash a few days later .	-1
I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors . I am going to purchase the odor disks I just saw on amazon . Hopefully this will help . My son 's room is very small and once I open the diaper pail his whole room begins to smell and its not like the pail is filled with dirty diapers when this occurs . I would only have 2-3 diapers in there when it begins to smell . I wish I had gone with a more expensive diaper pail because I ca n't take the odor . I hope this helps .	-1
I 'm returning this item , because it is not at all what I expected and not really a diaper pail . It is actually just a step trash can with a place for a deodorizer . The step for the lid is pretty flimsy and the whole thing moves unless it 's against a wall . The lid does not even open all the way and the whole thing is pretty low quality . I wanted a small diaper pail that was relatively `` childproof '' for my curious toddler . This is not it . It took her all of 5 seconds to figure out how to operate the step lid and reach her hand inside . That combined with the low quality makes this item useless in my household .	-1
THIS PAIL IS A WASTE OF MONEY . THE STEP LEVER DOES NOT WORK . I WOULD HAVE RETURNED BUT I OPENED BEFORE MY BABY WAS BORN AND NEVER THOUGHT TO CHECK IF THE STEP LEVER WORKED . IT IS SMALL AND NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE . DO NOT BUY .	-1
I use pocket diapers ( FuzziBunz brand ) . I needed a diaper pail with a foot lever and a place to put deodorizing disks . I bought this one because of the brand . Six months later , I still hate it as much as I did the first week.It 's too small . With two days ' worth of diapers in it , the lid wo n't close.Which is ironic , really , as the foot lever mechanism is so ineffective , the lid barely opens when I want it to . This means every time I have a dirty diaper , I step on that lever , the lid opens about 2-3 inches , and I then try to maneuver the dirty diaper into the pail without hitting any of the dirty diaper surfaces against the outside of the pail . Which is nearly impossible to do . So a long time ago , I just started lifting the lid up with my fingers , which creates a couple of other issues : that I then either have only one hand to remove the pocket insert from the diaper , or I have to first do that and then lift up the lid with a hand that 's just touched the dirty diaper - which defeats the purpose of manually lifting the lid , to avoid getting the outside of the pail dirty.A diaper pail is really a pretty simple concept : it needs to be big enough to hold 2 or 3 days ' worth of diapers ; it needs to open up without the use of hands ; and it needs to accommodate some form of deodorizing system . This can does hold scented disks ( sold separately ) in the lid , so it gets two stars for that . Otherwise -- this is the worse flippin ' diaper pail on the market , and I can not for the life of me figure out why a brand as reputable as Safety First would even bother producing it .	-1
..and neither of them work as they are supposed to . For being `` step '' diaper pails , they are not simple as listed , nor do they lift , which make it very difficult to even use when you have a baby in your hands . I have to bend down and throw the diaper in from the side to get it in ...	-1
I ca n't fit much in this bag without the magnetic closures popping open . The stitching on the liner on the inside that seperates compartments came undone after less than a year and is flimsy . I 've got two in diapers now and there is no way I can continue with this one any more . Three diapers , a half empty bag of Kirkland wipes , one change of clothes , and an insulator pack for breast milk , prooved to be too much for the main compartment . Pockets for the bottle and a water bottle on the sides are the only perks I can put on here , but most diaper bags have that , sooooo ... I think I 've said enough .	-1
While my daughter liked this , the lights broke the first day , and by the third day the motor was make grinding noises even with new batteries . It is very poor quality and I would never buy something from The First Years again .	-1
The breast shields in this kit will not fit on anyone well endowed . In addition - the connectors are connected to the breast shields thus making it impossible to utilize them with other size breast shields . If the breast shields do not work for you essentially you are paying for milk holders , 2 membranes , and one sanitizer package . Very bad value .	-1
WARNING TO ALL WHO ORDER , THE FLANGY DOES NOT COME OF THE CONNECTOR . NO ONE BOTHERED TO PLACE THIS IN THE DISCRIPTION . it is the regular size , so if you planned on using it with a larger flang forget it . I am now stuck with this product so I had no use for . I ordered 4 thinking how great the price was . I think amazon should refun everyone who was misled.Amazon you are typically great and I know I got this from a `` second party seller '' but it was on your site , you need to correct this , I am out of 100 dollars which is a lot of money .	-1
I was looking for the bottles and the connectors to go with my Medela breast pump . However , the description did not make it clear that the pump connectors and shields are one piece . I thought it had the connectors that allowed you to change out the shield size . I wound up returning this item .	-1
It is really helpful to have extra bottles and pumping parts , but I didnt realize that the pump flanges are not the same two piece ones that come with a pump in style . Although they are supposed to be the same size ( 24mm ) I feel that the fit is very different , and I found them quite uncomfortable to pump with . I do have them stashed in my drawer at work in case I needed a fresh set in a pinch , but if I had realized these were one piece and not two piece units I would not have bought them .	-1
I have tried several cloth diaper covers , including this one . After liking the Bummis Super Brite , I thought the Whisper wrap would be as good . Sadly , I was mistaken ! There are no gussets and poop definitely leaks more through the legs . ALso , there is no real moisture barrier material lining the cover . I could hardly call this cover water proof . It is soaking wet with pee in the mornings and we use both a prefold with microfiber inserts at night.Buy Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps instead or if you like the big velcro of Bummis ( my reason for buying ) , stick with the Super Brite model .	-1
These covers come in adorable prints , but when it comes to functionality , I 'm not impressed . As soon as these covers get wet , they stay wet , especially the white fabric around the edges and the flap of fabric that folds down on the inside top . As a result I have to change covers just about every time I change my babies diaper . Otherwise he gets a rash around his legs and tummy where the wet cover touches his skin . If I only used these covers I 'd need about 6 a day ! Luckly I switched to a different kind of cover ( Rumparooz ) that stay dry and can be used over and over many times before they need to be washed . Now I only need 2 or 3 covers for a whole week ! Thirsties covers are pretty good too . Do n't waste your money on these .	-1
When I first started researching diaper covers this one came highly recommended . Why ? ! It does n't have leg gussets , so there is n't that extra protection from blow outs . The fabric is stiff and seems really uncomfortable . This is my least favorite diaper cover . I think the proponants for this cover like the durability of it . Yes , you can probably wash it a thousand times and it will work fine , but there are so many better covers out there that will do the same . If you are looking for an all around comfortable yet durable cover check out Thirstys Duo Wrap . The fabric is water proof but very pliable . You may have to treat it a little kinder than this stiff plasticly thing , but you baby will be able to move around and not feel like he/she 's wearing a plastic shower curtain . Another great cover is Kissaluv 's Marvel . It is in between the Whisper Wrap and Thirstys Duo Wrap in terms of stiffness , but the fabric is sooooo water ( and poo ) resistant and becasue it 's a solid color it does n't stain ( except the white obviously ) . Happy hunting ! Please do n't waste your time with this cover !	-1
Being new to cloth diapering , I purchased all my items based on reviews I read . I do n't know why a lot of people recommend this cover . The fit is horrible and the fabric seems like it would be so uncomfortable for the baby . It 's really stiff and stains easily . Because the materials is so stiff , it is not easy putting it on a crying baby . There are no leg gussets and does n't contain the mess from blowouts . The fit rides really low and wide . Not at all for a long and lean baby . The piping on the edges starts to pill after a couple washes and becomes `` scratchy . '' The only reason why this cover seems good is because it will last through many kids , but what does that matter if it 's not comfortable for the baby to wear and it looks dirty from all the stains in it ? Thirsties and Imse Vimse wraps are far better in every category compared to these .	-1
It might work for others , but my son 's skin is very sensitive and in the winter he gets very bad eczema . I think this made it worse . It might work well for others if their skin is n't as sensitive but it did not work for us .	-1
The main ingredient in this is petroleum jelly which you can get for 99 cents at WalMart.Use Hydrocortisone 1 % and it works wonderfully well for eczema . It 's the only thing that helps me .	-1
The cream is too oily , not easy to absorb . Thought it is fragrance free , it has a strong oily smell . And it does n't work for my baby 's eczema . I am thinking throw it away , but it is too expensive ... .	-1
I used this cream on myself when I had an eczema outbreak on my hands . Please do NOT use this on children/infants that can not verbalize . It BURNED horribly . I have tried numerous types of hand creams with the same results . MY RECOMMENDATION would be to use the Aveeno cream product for children . It WORKS and was pain free .	-1
Not a fan of these . They 're very rough and give my baby redness , so we 're stuck with 175 liners we do n't know what to do with . Would have preferred if like other companies they sold them as 100 , so I could have decided and saved money . They do the job they 're supposed to do but at the cost of hurting my little one 's bum , so no go .	-1
These diaper liners were rough and after using for a whole days worth of diapering , my little one 's skin started peeling . We looked at all the usual suspects : diet , cloth diaper too tight , amonia burn , etc . but it was none of those and the skin peeling stopped two days after I discontinued use . Sadly , we ca n't use the rest and found them to be a waste of money .	-1
I was expecting a lot more from these . When they came I laughed . They are so think ( like a fabric sheet if not thinner ) so how that is going to hold any urine is beyond me , I did n't even use any of them I just threw them away .	-1
I have used any number of diaper inserts in my life ( I use mostly Bum Genius and Fuzzin Bunz diapers ) . I use them not only to collect the poo , but also so that I can use serious diaper creams like Desitin on my daughter 's diaper-rash-prone bumbum . I bought these instead of my regular brand because they were ( slightly ) cheaper . What a disappointment ! Yes , they will probably be just as effective at keeping poo and medicine off of the diapers , but they are so rough and rigid that I truly worried that putting them against my daughter 's skin might rub her diaper-rash raw again . Yuck ! I tried them a couple of times , and she actually did n't seem to mind ( I will admit ) , but I just did n't feel good about using them . There are much softer , nicer brands out there for nearly the same price . Do n't settle for these .	-1
The pros : It will keep the poop off your baby 's butt and diaper.The cons:1 ) There is no way I would put that next to my child 's skin . Go to your laundry supplies and pull out a fabric softer sheet . That 's what if feels like . Can you imagine wearing that all day ? 2 ) It does NOT keep the wetness away from the skin . Not even a little bit.I think I 'm going to soak my purchase in liquid fabric softner and use them in the dryer.I do n't know if all liners are like this as this is the first one I tried . I 've decided to use the fleece liners instead as they will keep the wetness away from the skin .	-1
When we started cloth diapering , getting flushable liners was a must for us . We first used Grovia liners . I tried switching to these as they were a little cheaper . Sometimes you get what you pay for . These bunched up and did not do a good job of catching all of the waste . They are much thinner and flimsier than the Grovia liners . We did n't even use them all up before we ended up buying some more Grovia liners . We are pretty much done with diapering , so I have not done anymore research to find an alternative . I would definitely not recommend these , though .	-1
I got these liners because they were less expensive than others and had great reviews . Seriously , the people reviewing these have n't tried other brands . I love , love , love the Bummis and Bumkins liners . Compared to those two brands , the imse vimse feel like sandpaper . I put a few on the changing table so my husband would used them . When I asked him why he had n't been using them , he said , `` Oh , I thought those were dryer sheets . '' Thats what they feel like , stiff , ichy dryer sheets . The Bummis and Bumkins brand are soooooo soft . All three serve their purpose , but I would n't want the Imse 's on my butt ! Bummis are my fave because they are on a roll , if you do n't care about it being in a roll , the Bumkins are perfect . They all seem too big , so I just tear them in half and get twice as many !	-1
