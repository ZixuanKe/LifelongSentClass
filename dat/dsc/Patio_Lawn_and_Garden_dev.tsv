The full size chimney was too big when lighting the 10 coals needed when using the Minion method . This works perfectly .	1
I use a Big Green Egg for smoking and was looking for a quick way to ignite a small amount of charcoal to add to the remaining charcoal in the pit . I owned a generically-branded chimney starter for over 20 years that finally rusted out . I wanted to replace it with a smaller one , and this Weber was the perfect size . Surprisingly , this size was not available in Home Depot or Lowes.Simply fill it 3/4 full with your choice of charcoal ( lump or briquette ) , stuff some old advertising circulars in the bottom , and you 'll have lit coals in just a few minutes , ready to pour on top of the existing ones . I put the chimney on top of the grate , but you can also put it directly on top of the coals and then ignite the paper . Just make sure that there is a way for air to circulate underneath the chimney in order to create the necessary flow of air ( draft ) to ignite the coals.If you buy a chimney starter , regardless of size , here 's a tip on how to make sure you get hot coals in the shortest time . Roll the paper into a donut shape and then put it in the bottom . That will insure that there is sufficient air and draft at the very beginning of the process to light the coals.Let 's eat !	1
There is no better way to start charcoal briquettes or lump charcoal than this . Forget the crumpled up newspaper . Try the Weber starter cubes.Weber 7417 FireStarters Lighter Cubes , 24 CountOne is all that is necessary , and you will have charcoal ready to go in 15-20 minutes ! Set this over the cube on the fire grate , and light the cube . You 're done .	1
a must if you are a charcoal grill owner . No chemicals to deal with 2.5 sheets of newspaper and lighter and you have lit charcoal .	1
I was hesitant to order another chimney starter after having purchased the weber standard size starter . The standard starter is big and holds about 100 briquettes . This is great if using a full size grill . I however , travel with my 18 '' Weber and this compact starter is perfect and takes up much less room . I also use it when I only need 10 or so briquettes for slow smoking.I have n't noticed the handle getting hot because I use gloves when handling these starters and I think everyone should to avoid burns.Recommended.I added a photo so people can compare the size difference .	1
I stuffed this pint-sized chimney starter to the brim and hoped as I poured lit charcoals into my Weber 18 inch grill . Well , that one load kept good heat for 2 hours and some , cooking 2 pork roasts , 3 pounders each , 6 chicken leg quarters , 4 top sirloin 2 inch square steaks , two lamb chops , and finished with 4 leg quarters to use up the extra heat . I was surprised and very content . That domed insert that positions the charcoal really works . Those other chimneys with the flat insert take a good 40 % longer with unburnt charcoals . It 's a whole lot cheaper than its European clone as well .	1
I had never seen this before I started watching cooking shows and it worked just as easy as they show - crumple up newspaper , then add your brickettes and light the newspaper from the bottom . When the coals turn gray ( in just a short time ) spread them on your grill bottom and start cooking . No need to use that awful , chemical charcoal lighter liquid or charcoal that has been soaked in lighter fluid ... ..just use plain old charcoal and it works fine ! VERY pleased ! : )	1
This is actually the second such gadget I have purchased . One is all right for a small quantity of charcoal , but I sometimes need more charcoal . The starter is rugged and very well designed . The directions suggest wearing insulated mitts or gloves when using the starter ( and that 's always the safest way to use it ) , but the handle does n't get hot , and the smaller size of the unit makes it easy to handle . A full batch of charcoal takes about 15 minutes to get white-hot .	1
In the war between man and deer , the more defenses we have the better . Deer-B-Gon is an effective repellent . However , if you need to treat lots of plants , a hand-trigger sprayer gets old very quickly . This broadcast sprayer makes it very easy to coat your deer-vulnerable plants . Especially since Deer-B-Gon needs to sprayed on after a rain.The bottle screws on to your house easily . Then , there is a switch to turn the spray on . It has a plastic tab that prevents accidental release . When done , you turn off and unscrew from the house . Nothing could be simpler.It is important to note that no one control will deliver season-long deer proofing . You need to rotate the sprays and treatments so that the deer do not get used to any one odor .	1
I have a lot of deer living in the woods just behind my neighborhood . As such , my yard tends to serve as a salad bar for the deer . I 've found that by regular use of deer sprays , and switching brands every year or two , I tend to keep them at bay for the most part.I am a big proponent of using my own mixture as well . For me it works just as well as the manufactured sprays and costs far less . The home made stuff does not adhere as well after a rain though , so it does require more frequent applications.This is my first time using Deer B-Gon . Like most repellents of this sort , the product relies on rotten egg to deter deer . Some other brands will also add capsaicin ( hot pepper ) or garlic . Deer B-Gon does not include these ingredients , instead adding cinnamon oil and clove oil to its putrescent egg solids.So far , my experience with the product has been very good . I usually buy concentrate instead of ready-made as all deer repellents tend to be expensive . I tend to like Ortho products for performance and value though , so I tried this ready-to-use mixture . Plus , it was one less thing to mix when I do my yard work ! As mentioned at the start of this review , I do switch brands from season to season . Here 's why : if everyone in your neighborhood goes to the same large store or even local hardware store , they tend to buy the same spray . This means every shrub in every yard is treated with the same product . The deer eventually are going to eat something , and when they run out of untreated food , or are simply hungry enough , they are going to eat treated vegetation . So if they wander into 5 yards and 4 smell identical , they may tend to avoid the 5th yard a little longer . I know this is not a scientific approach , but it is simple and has held true for me for the most part . Of course during a harsh , cold season , deer will eat even things they rarely touch , sprayed or not.So I rotate between Deer B-Gon , Deer Off and my homemade recipe . I 've included that `` recipe '' below if anyone has interest.As far as the Deer B-Gon , it has a heavy cinnamon smell , which is somewhat pleasing from a few feet away , but when you get close to what you 've sprayed , the stuff stinks ( which is what you want after all , something the deer dislike ) . If you dab some on your fingertip you 'll see what I mean . It smells OK from a couple of feet away , but lift your finger to your nose - oh boy.This product is meant to be applied by attaching a garden hose to the bottle . I poured about the bottle into an empty garden sprayer to put is aside , and then attached the hose to the Ortho bottle . Although you can control the flow for the most part , I was n't really sure how much of a mixture of the spray and water I would get , so that 's why I put some aside . I tried some of my yard like this , and for the other half of my yard , I added water to the Deer B-Gon I had put aside , about 3 parts water for 1 part Deer B-Gon . Even watered down , this seemed to apply a little heavier application than by hose , so I was probably wasting some of the product when I did n't use the hose . I always spray some of my lawn as well as shrubs , usually applying some deer repellent on my grass in the narrower parts of my yard , on each side of my house.The deer seem to avoid the whole yard , so using the product as intended ( attaching a hose ) appears to be fine . I 'll observe them late at night on occasion , and I can see them standing by the lawn , debating whether to come into the yard . So they do come , but seem to leave the shrubs alone . Of course , one or two alwasy come up for a nibble , but seem to be put off by the taste.To me , a hose application is a little more cumbersome . A ) you need to use a hose and pull it around with you , and B ) I do n't like the idea of deer spraycoming in contact with the water hose , or the splatter from the hose method . I like a more controlled spray/mist , so I can stand upwind of the breeze and apply more easily . Personal preference though . Others may prefer to use the hose stream , as opposed to battling the wind more with a mist spray.All in all , this is a good product , seems to work as advertised , and it is one of my 2 or 3 products in `` my deer spray rotation . `` If you do want to try a homemade spray : The homemade spray is simply a gallon of water poured into a plastic milk jug , to which I add one raw egg , some hot sauce or powder , some garlic powder , a teaspoon or two of cinnamon , and a couple of squirts of liquid dish detergent . I close the gallon container and put it out in the heat/sun to rot . It smells bad , but so do most of these products . For a fraction of what commercial sprays cost , I have an effective homemade ( inexpensive ) spray . Every time I use some of the jug I read water and another egg . Every few uses I add some more of the other ingredients . The main ingredients are similar to a commercial product . I add cinnamon as it cloaks some of the bad odor with a sweet smell as you walk past the plants , without making them taste/smell better to deer . The dish detergent helps the spray adhere to plants but wo n't hurt the plant . Keep in mind your dog may lick some of it up because of the egg.The main difference between homemade spray ( aside from cost ) is you have to respray it more frequently ( after any heavy rain and most showers ) . You can also save money on a sprayer by using a rinsed out Windex bottle . These do n't seem to clog as much as store-bought hand sprayers , and are basically free.The home spray does require some prep , and of course , more frequent applications , which can be time consuming , so you may want to simply opt for a ready-mixed product such as Ortho Deer B-Gon .	1
The package says this should be applied once a month . It worked well for a week , and then I had to re-apply it . So why do I give it 4 stars ? It smells nice ! My dogs actually like the way it smells and even licked where I spilled it on my arm ! I have tried lots of products to get rid of the robo-bunnies in my development that chomp on my plants immediately after I put them in or as soon as they pop their heads out of the dirt . This one smells better than anything else I have tried and it works , it just has to be re-applied liberally and often ! ! !	1
I have used a few different kinds of deer and rabbit repellants in the past but this one worked very well . I have a pack of deer that come through my neighborhood and eat up what ever they want a night . Whatever I sprayed this stuff on the deer sniffed and went away . I wo n't say it lasts forever though . When it rains a lot some of the spray seems to dissipate . But it can be used to deter the deer for awhile letting your trees , flowers and shrubs get established . Now rabbits are another story . They seem to find whatever area you miss and eat away . But if I work at it I can deter the rabbits for awhile . As with everything else you do have to reapply this spray every so often to keep those animals away . I did find it to work well for me without the usual odors of rotten eggs and other stuff . Even though it has some egg stuff in it I did not have to smell it . I recommend this product to anyone for warding off deer , rabbits , and sometimes racoons .	1
Well , I have n't had a really long time period to verify the results but right now it is limited.It is working better than coyote urine , dog hairs , cayenne pepper dusting and Irish soap.The deer had come in within a week of getting this and had n't had time to spray the roses.So , I 'll give it another 1-2 weeks for the buds to come back and will give an update after July 4th weekend . See you then	1
I 've had good success with a variety of deer repellents , including Ortho Deer B Gon . Most have similar ingredient lists , with putrescent egg solids typically being the main active ingredient . I prefer concentrated forms , but every so often convenience wins out.Our back garden is small but plentiful . Every year , like clock work , deer seem to sense peak blooming times . Nothing is more disappointing than seeing bare plant stems minus beautiful flowers . Ortho Deer B Gon works wonderfully in small areas . Because this mixes with a hose , nozzle plug-ups are rare . That happens frequently with many other ready to use sprays and concentrates , even after careful nozzle cleaning . I have n't had any clogging issues using Deer B Gon and a hose , although I think it 's a messier application method . I usually end up smelling bad regardless of repellent brand or method used , but it 's just a little worse with this one.Application directions say to re-spray every 30 days or after signs of nibbling . Who wants to test that out ? I lightly re-spray select plants about every two weeks or after heavy rains , and as a result , have never had plant damage . The key is diligent spraying all season long.Ortho Deer B Gon with hose attachment is a convenient way to control small areas . If you do n't like working with concentrates , I recommend ready-mixes like this one orOrtho Deer-B-Gon Deer and Rabbit RTU Repellent , 1-Gallon . I ca n't say I like Ortho deer repellent products more than other brands , but this one does work if applied conscientiously .	1
All deer repellents depend on egg protein as the main ingredient , this Ortho is no exception , but others have a strong stink , exacerbated by garlic . Aiming to avoid the unpleasant smell , this repellent foregoes garlic and use copious amount of cinnamon oil and clove oil instead . They cover up the egg effectively and help make the greens unpalatable to the deer.Also , most repellents contain just under 2 % of active ingredients while this one has almost 12 % , so that the user can plug it into a hose and water away.So far it seems to work and appears to be a great value .	1
The last rabbit repellent I used sort of bubbled over and made a bit of a mess when stored . This one was contained in its neat , tidy package.The thing I liked about it is that the ingredients seemed to all be foods , or things that are sometimes used as food additives , so it seems relatively safe ( which they brag about on the label ) . The ingredients as listed are : Putrescent Whole Egg SolidsCinnamon OilClove OilWaterPotassium SorbateSodium ChlorideVinegarSodium SulfateXanthan GumWe 're trying to use it to keep rabbits from digging a whole under our house , and it seems to be working well so far !	1
A family of deer usually visit my backyard and last year they ventured to the side of the house and ate nearly all the leaves off my cucumber and tomato plants . I planted my garden this year and have been spraying this product around the area they frequent in the back and so far so good . I do n't see any evidence that they have been eating my plants , and I have n't seen any in the yard . I 'm hoping that this continues.The product should not be sprayed on vegetable plants .	1
I hoped this product would keep the deer away from my hosta beds . The deer seem to love to feast on those leaves . This does seem to last longer than some other brands I have tried , since even if no rain is predicted we seem to have thundershowers lashing down upon us - so it seems to be futile to use products that say do not apply if rain is predicted , besides the fact that dew tends to wash products off too . This does wash off in heavy rains , but otherwise seems to last through sprinkles and dews.So far the deer have stayed back in the woods this spring .	1
Summary - nicer than the other putrescent egg based repellents , and perhaps more rain resistant ... .This is still putrescent egg based - 7.6 % . What is different is that instead f black pepper or hot pepper extract , they are using 2.2 % cinnamon oil and 1.4 % clove oill This does leave your yard smelling like your mother-in-law 's powder room . Not unpleasant , I wonder if it will help with mosquitoes ? We 've been getting torrential rains every few days , so although this is advertised as being rain resistant , it 's hard to tell if it is working . I have some snow peas planted where neighborhood rabbits can get to them . Although it seems that they are less prone to getting eaten , I 'm thinking the only real long term solution is to put up fencing - the repellent seems to work for perhaps a few days , but then BAM , one rabbit decides he ( or she ) is hungry , and I 'm back down to stumps ( same for the Kale )	1
I saw several snakes in my yard last year , which is why I decided to spread these granules around the yard . It 's important for me that no children or animals come in contact with the snakes , although there are only two snakes that are poisonous in this area.So far , I have n't seen any snakes or any shed snakeskins . I suppose this must mean that it is working !	1
It is snake time here in Arizona right now . In the past I have been using Snake-Away which is made up of something similar to moth balls ground up . It stinks . You put it at the entrances to your back yard and it is OK except if one of the entrances is near and window that you feel like you are smothering . Plus Snake-Away goes away at the first rain so you really use a lot over time because snakes keep a coming during the monsoon also . This Snake Be Gone is supposed to last during the rains so this would mean using less . This season should indicate how good it is . I 'm giving it 4 stars now because I like the idea that it will last through rain .	1
This seems like it 's working so far . My dog managed to track down one of the snakes in our yard and have a little confrontation with it ( I intervened before either of them was hurt ) so I 've been using this to try to discourage them from hanging out in the yard where she might corner them.I do n't have any absolute way of being certain , but we have n't actually seen anything in the areas that were treated in a couple of weeks , so things seem good.Application was simple , and they were truthful about the fact that it does n't smell awful or anything like that . I will probably continue to get more , and in the future I 'll apply some in the spots where I know songbirds are nesting . I like watching the little bird families grow up , and it 's sad when the snakes get to them and they disappear overnight .	1
We have a large pond in the back yard , so ... we have snakes . Some are just harmless , even though some of them are HUGE , and others are dangerous , like copperheads . The trouble with reviewing a product like Snake-B-Gone is this . You KNOW if it does n't work , but if it does work , how do you prove the & # 34 ; absence of snakes due to the fact you put out some snake repellent granules. & # 34 ; I like the fact that I do n't have to worry about snakes scaring me as I walk out my back door . The neighbors came running that time , because the snake was HUGE ! I do n't have to worry about my dog nosing around in bushes because a snake is in there . The product appears to be safe enough for animals , although I 'm going to keep it out of his reach anyway . I 'm pleased with it . We have a large yard , so I 'm only attempting to keep the snakes out of the immediate back door and front door areas . There is not enough of this stuff to cover the area out by the pond . The snakes can keep their distance there and stay out of my area . We 'll be fine .	1
Here in the desert , you expect to see the animals that have lived here long before houses were built . Having ponds and fountains , all types of desert animals visit I do not mind the visits , but nesting ... well , not happy about that . The odor of this snake be gone reminds me of a citrus , nice fragrance.I spread snake be gone around the bushes and ivy and so far have not stepped out to meet Mr. snake.The product give you a sense of mind . Knowing that they will move on their way . Nesting some where else .	1
I 've used similar products by other companies and found Ortho 's version just as easy to use . The container makes this simple to pour out and it 's a good amount . It 's not too much to make it bulky , but at the same time it will make it around your average-sized house a few times . You 'll have to reapply at least every month to be effective , but this should give you enough to go a couple of months with it .	1
This product does not say & # 34 ; frogs & # 34 ; , but does help with them . I know this as I have a sculptured backyard that has a stream around a gazebo . The water attracts frogs and at certain times of the year lots of them with loud croaking . This makes it hard to sleep . The repellent helps cut down on the frogs !	1
These Ortho 489510 Snake-B-Gon Snake Repellent Granules have absolutely helped keep the various snakes out of our club 's meeting house . We belong to small shooting range that is deep in the woods and have a small prefab , glorified shed that we use as a meeting house . Unfortunately , the local snakes have found ways into the building in the past . We applied this around the perimeter and have not seen a single snake in or around the building since.The package has a shaker top that allows for easy spreading of the granules , which makes it easy to use.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
We get the storer dekayi ( brown snake ) because they like to eat earthworms and small insects . But none seen after application so it probably works .	1
I moved to Tucson a year ago , have yet to see a snake , that 's a good thing . I am more worried about my 20 pound cocker spaniel . She does not have the knowledge to be watchful , thus ordering this repellent . I sprinkled it around the fence parameter as suggested and I do hope it helps . It smells like those hot cinnamon candies . It states that it needs repeating every month or so , that could get expensive . There also was not quite enough in the container to get the job done , so I hope the snakes do not enter in the undone area - how smart can they be ? Probably smarter than the dog . She would want to play and whine at a snake , I am pretty sure . I hope the product does what it says and I will buy more to finish and keep it refreshed as suggested . If it works it will be worth it to both of us .	1
You must make sure that the snakes are away from the house then put this down and the snakes will stay away . We have some garter snakes that like to try and get into our foundation . We made sure that they had left and put down the barrier and they did not cross it . We had used this once before and it prevented them from finding a nesting place in our house for the winter . I have closed the holes I could find that I thought they were getting in but this kept them from trying and they found their winter spot out in the yard somewhere .	1
I have to remind myself of the important role snakes play , but I prefer not to see them . Normally they are very accommodating by staying out of sight , but once you find one its easy to imagine one under every bush . For my peace of mind I got this snake repellent and put it in the beds outside the front of my house . So far it is working . I had Copperheads before and I have yet to see one where I put the granules.Since I bought this I was told by my farmer 's coop that sulpher granules do about the same thing and you can get a 50 lb bag for about what this 2 lb bag costs . One neighbor swears by it .	1
I was absolutely floored to realize Snake-B-Gone 's active ingredients are NATURAL ESSENTIAL OILS ! Not only is it effective for snakes , it 's effective to deter a range of critters - think snake FOOD . No food , no snakes . I also used sulphur powder , between these two I have n't seen any snakes at all - which is rare indeed . I am thrilled !	1
My wife and I live in a sub-division near a large lake and woods . We do see snakes in the woods and as the weather warms up they are coming out further . Last year we had a few in our garden area so when I had the chance to try this I took it.The snake b gon was put down a few weeks ago , I have n't seen any snakes in the garden yet . I ca n't say thats because it works or they just have n't come out yet but I 'll update this review if I see any snakes.What I can say is my wife loves the smell of this stuff . I thought she would hate it , but it has a cinnamon smell to it , a bit of pepper , and some other spices and she really likes the smell which I assume the snakes hate.The only downside to this is you are supposed to retreat the area every 30 days . I 'm guessing since you are essentially sprinkling spices on your garden they will wash away . To treat my garden area which is approx 10 ft x 5 ft I used about 1/3 of the container so for me this is really a 3 month supply.It 's certainly worth a try if you have an area where you frequently see snakes and you 'd rather not see the snakes .	1
After having two large black snakes come into the house , I decided when I saw this product to try it . So far , so good - I have n't even seen one in the yard . Now , I do have to admit , that we covered the covered porch decking with plywood ( where one of the snakes came up and entered the living room though the open front door ) and he did fill the holes in the attached greenhouse with foam - so that may be the real reason , I have n't seen any . But honestly , in the parts of the yard where we spread the crystals - have n't seen a snake cross the path yet ( and I usually see two to three a week ) , so I have confidence in this product - that it does what it says it will do .	1
We live in a neighborhood but there are still snakes around . They like to try to get in our storm door frame - which is not good ; when we open the door - they can enter the house . You ca n't see b/c the door is shut BUT a snake made it in - then that would be bad news ... I do n't choose to live with snakes . I am so glad that this repellent is available . I am also going to spread it around my blueberry bushes in my little garden area . Jesus ' Blessings and Peace	1
Ortho 's Snake-B-Gon Snake Repellent Granules are easy to apply and so far they have been performing . It 's only been a month , but we frequently see some snakes during this time of year . However , after applying the granules we have been snake free . The bottle comes with a top that can be used & # 34 ; wide open & # 34 ; or as a shaker . I used the shaker end and the granules came out easy , offering a very good spread of the product . The granules do not stink really , but they do have a scent . It 's not unpleasant though . So far , so good though , just waiting to see how long they last .	1
I used this because I saw a garden snake in my yard . I hate any kind of snakes . This is safe for your pets and and your plants . That 's the best part that you do not have to worry about your animals getting sick . Since using it . I have not seen anymore garden snakes at all .	1
On warm days , I find some snakes in the front yard of my house . I spread this in the grassy area around the walk way to the drive way , and I have n't really seen them again , at least now near the walkway . So it seems to do what it claims .	1
I really like this product . The ingredients are natural so I am not worried about seepage into my well water and into the creek alongside our property . It 's nice to use a product that you do n't have to glove up to use and that is made of ingredients that are easily recognized and not chemicals that you ca n't even pronounce . This stuff has worked so far in keeping snakes from our wood pile , and an added bonus is that it smells great .	1
We have a large pile of firewood in our back yard , and I 'm always a little nervous about what I might find living back there ( especially since I have young children that like to play in that area ) . Here in the southwest , we have our share of nasty snakes , including rattlers . I , personally , would rather take a little bit of preventative measures to avoid having snakes in our living spaces . People in my neighborhood have found rattlesnakes in their back yard . I like that these granules help prevent them from entering our space and keeps them from making themselves at home .	1
We live by a river and have had a huge snake lurking around our house for the last few years . My daughter is terrified of it and just knows it is an anaconda off of one of the ships . I try to convince her that it is a water snake and probably non venomous ; but I have to admit that it seems to get bigger , eggs in bird 's nests have disappeared , it hangs from our tree and the final straw is that a few weeks ago it was coiled on top of our sliding doors . Last year I tried some snake repellant , but had to take our dog to my mom 's since no one could reassure me it was safe and the screams of my daughter about ` anaconda ' sightings continued.So when I saw this claiming to be safe for pets ( and children ) I thought it would be worth a try.After seeing the snake away from the house I applied this and there have been no screams about the ` anaconda ' is back - since then . Hopefully it works for a long period of time because one container was used up in one application .	1
I 've used this animal repellent for nearly a month and it seems to have work pretty well . The last few years by about this time the squirrels have stripped all the peaches off my peach tree . But this year I sprayed the Animal-B-Gone repellent around the tree twice , and most of the peaches are still there . One thing that I like about this repellent is that it is mostly natural ingredients.While it seems to have deterred the squirrels , I have one bird who is n't deterred by it .	1
I sprayed this around my garden . It has a really nice scent and is pet safe . It did n't deter the squirrels as much as I hoped it would . I have n't seen as many other critters around though . I like that this is ready to use and does n't need to be diluted or hooked up to a hose . I use this around my straw bale garden and it has n't done any damage to anything .	1
For some reason the rabbit population seems to wax and wane a lot . Last year there were a lot and they like to eat many types of flowering plants . Having applied this product , I have not seen rabbits .	1
We live in a wooded area and it is a never ending battle to keep away the & # 34 ; critters & # 34 ; , i.e. , raccoons , deer , coyotes , even bears . Its not just the plant eating but our garbage must be put out the night before and we would find them tipped over and rooted through.We have been using Animal Stopper , which works really well , the garbage has only been tipped over once since I started using it . Ortho has basically the same makeup ( the percentages are a little different and if there is a difference Animal Stopper uses mint oil and Ortho uses peppermint oil ) and appears to smell about the same . The prices are comparable.This is a good product and after checking local stores seems easier to purchase . Animal Stopper seems a more specialized product , but it does say it repels deer and bears which are my main concern .	1
We have sprayed these two big wooden poles that are at the start of 2 rows of radishes . We 'd had some problems with rabbits eating the greens but after we sprayed those poles , we 've not had any more greens nibbled down to the ground and we 've not spotted anymore droppings or tracks in that area . The deer have not bothered these 2 rows either , though this product is n't advertised for that . The two rows are very close to where the deer come out of the woods - though it might just be that they are not caring for radishes as they are making a beeline to eat fallen apples and pears off the ground.The product is easy to spray but it does n't smell all that great . The sprayer works great and it 's easy to use . It 's works by smell . It 's made out of what I 'd call rotten eggs and essential oils , though it does not smell like rotten eggs at all , just the herbal oils . It smells strongly herbal , not really bad , but it is not a mix of scented oils I 'd want in my house . It is mint , cinnamon , and rosemary , which will cover up about any bad smell.The squirrels we have never come over towards the radishes anyway so I ca n't say if it deters them or not . Our squirrels are too busy eating nuts and the chicken 's corn to mess with the garden.So far it 's been 3 weeks since we saw evidence of rabbits . We 've started using it on a landscape timber that we 've laid in front of the broccoli too since last week . So far those been safe from the rabbits as well . It seems to stick to wood some , so this seems like a pretty good way to use it to me.My only real complaint is it seems a bit expensive for what it is . In my experience , these ingredients are not that expensive .	1
Unfortunately I have a large family of adorable bunnies that remain intent on eating a section of my lawn . This will be my third attempt at using a spray to deter them , and only time will tell . I will say that this applied easily , and is the only one with a noticeably strong , tart aroma that I would think might scare off the critters .	1
This spray has a minty scent , for which I am grateful considering the first listed ingredient is & # 34 ; putrescent whole egg solids & # 34 ; . Just that phrase alone ought to scare away the most intrepid & # 34 ; small herbivore & # 34 ; ! I have sprayed the ground around the trellis where my bird feeder hangs in the hopes it will keep the squirrels out of the bird seed . I know the product is not designed as a cat repellant but in desperation , I also applied it to my front door threshold where the neighbor cat keeps spraying as a cruel taunting of my indoor cats . The label does say it is safe for people , pets and plants so I feel safe experimenting with its use for this purpose . NOTE : that statement does NOT mean it can be used to keep Peter Rabbit from nibbling on your leaf lettuce . Directions specifically say it should not be used on or near plants grown for consumption .	1
We 've had lots of problems with squirrels and chipmunks in our yard and garden . Since spraying this around the house and around the garden we have n't seen the little rodents . My strawberry patch may thrive this year without the little beasts beating me to the berries ! I 'm thrilled with this product and love the natural ingredients that wo n't harm my vegetables or well water . So far so good !	1
We 've had rabbits in our landscaping and have n't had any problems with them since we got this product . I had planned to try this on our bird feeder to repel squirrels , but since the weather has warmed up the squirrels are now searching the yard for food so I do n't know if it works on them or not . I will say that I sprayed a little on a paper napkin and laid it on the floor for my cat to smell , and she sniffed it and immediately started scratching the floor around it trying to cover it up the way she does in the litter box lol ! So it will likely work for other small animals too .	1
I planted some nice little ground cover plants beside my front porch . Since they are behind some larger bushes , they do n't show from the street , so it has become like my little secret garden as I go in and out my front door.However the rabbits that hop around our yard discovered the secret and were soon munching away at my new lovely plants . This spray kept them away , but did not harm them and unlike other animal repellents I have used this did not smell to high heaven , which is always a good thing ... to not be greeted by a horrible stink coming and going from your home .	1
I 'm not really willing to use products that smell terrible in my yard , because my yard is there to be a place where I 'd like to spend some time . I do n't want a repellent that 's going to repel me more effectively than it does anything else . This has been good on that count . So far it seems like it 's keeping the critters away as well , so we 'll see if things continue to be quiet on the backyard front .	1
I sprayed this around the perimeter of my garden to keep moles away . It is easy to use . Just hook it up to the hose , unlock it and spray . It has a slight musky odor , but it is not noticeable once the spraying is done . I have n't seen a mole in a while in the area where I sprayed . I like that this is pet safe , as I have avoided using other means to get rid of moles because they could be dangerous .	1
It 's really a year in which the critters are running rampant . I can actually see them skittering into a hole in my foundation . Of course I 'm not too happy with this , but am determined to defeat them this year . I 'm not quite sure what 's happening , but another family member just mentioned she is having similar problems.I certainly have the holes to prove I 've got them , but the problem is n't quite as severe as it has been in the past . I 've made my own homemade concoction , which is somewhat similar to this one . The bottle is actually easier to deal with that my Mason jar recipe , but will they quit putting holes in my lawn ? Perhaps the only way I 'll know that is throughout the summer when I 'm mowing it.The formula looks as good as any and I very much like the convenience factor . I do n't really wish these little varmints to head for my neighbor 's houses , but hopefully they 'll head into an area where they wo n't inconvenience people.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS : Castor Oil : 23.33 % Geraniol : 1 % Peppermint Oil : 0.50 % INERT INGREDIENTS : Water , Xanthan Gu , Sodium Sulfate : 75.17 %	1
AsI am a Vine reviewer , I am required to do a review within 30 days of receiving a product . That does not give enough time to see how the product works , sometimes . So , I can tell you that this product is very easy to use . Just hook it to your waterhose and turn the water on . There is a little lever to turn and it starts spraying . I have had these types of sprayers that spray about 5-7 feet in front of you and it takes forever to do a whole yard . This one sprays about 10-12 feet , so it went a lot faster . It was windy when I sprayed ( the only day I had available ) and that was a problem ( trying to stay down-wind ) but on a still day , it would have been fine . The instructions say that it is n't harmful to humans or pets if used properly , but I could n't find anyplace that said what the definition of `` properly '' was . You can use this product around fruit trees and vegetables , but you must make sure the spray does n't land on the edible part or even the blossom . Still , I stayed out several feet from my little fruit trees . I noticed that it got used up pretty quickly , so if you have much ground to cover , you 'll probably need more than one bottle . I have a big backyard , but I do n't spray all of it ; just where I want to keep the gophers away and it used about 80-90 % of the bottle . Overall , it was easy to use and should be a good way to keep gophers out if it works properly . But it has n't been long enough to see if the gophers were run off or not.5-13-14 A little time has passed and I can say that the gophers have moved out of the area that I sprayed and , so far , have stayed out . I have been pleased with the results , though most products of this type have to be re-sprayed every 2-3 months , and this one probably will , too .	1
I got these too early for Wisconsin , so I was not able to test it right away . I wanted to wait for the snow to melt and the ground to thaw . Now that it 's May , it 's time to use this ... and I will re-apply in the summer and fall too.This bottle easily attaches to a garden hose , and the mixture then is pre-mixed as you turn on your hose 's water . My bottle did n't leak ( had a nice washer ) but I 'd still advise using gloves as this is poison . They call it & # 34 ; no stink & # 34 ; and while it smells a little , its tolerable , and after it tries its fine . This is for OUTSIDE your house , and I applied it around the outside of my house , and in the grass where I see trails from the winter where the little critters has made tunnels under the snow in my lawn.I feed a number of animals in my backyard , including squirrels , raccoons , skunks , and after this was applied they still came around . I ca n't tell if this had an impact on my chipmunks ... ( it was not my intention to kill them ) . But as for the mice and voles , I feel that it 's helping , but ca n't tell if they are really gone yet . I suppose it will take a winter to see if they are really gone , when I hopefully do n't see trails under the snow next spring .	1
We have kids that love playing in our back yard so I would n't put anything down that would be harmful to them . We 've had a mole problem for a few months now but this product seems to have done the trick . It 's my neighbor 's problem now because they are leaving my backyard alone .	1
Every spring our yard is invaded by pests that tunnel in from the yard next door . The single man who lives there does n't really tend to his yard very well , and burrowing moles and voles seem to proliferate there and then move toward our greener pastures . We have dogs and can not use the guillotine traps or poisons that are common for control of burrowing animals , and are just stuck with raised runs all over the place , at least on that side of the yard . Then , the dogs dig up the runs ( and I ask no questions about the fate of the critters that dug them in the first place ) . This year , however , we tried this new Ortho product , following scrupulously the instructions on the bottle , and hoped for the best . It seemed to have worked-at least for a couple of weeks . One stubborn tunneler returned after two weeks , but only one . The network of runs is no more , just one little one from a mole who does n't seem to mind the repellant .	1
The day after I applied per instructions , I saw increased mole activity , but I think it was from them leaving . Now close to a couple weeks since application , I see no evidence of activity . There is an odor and overspray will leave a white residue , so care should be taken , but it is effective and very easy , just attach to hose and spray affected areas.I hope they stay away !	1
It 's always a little hard to determine whether the result of no voles or moles is a result of the deterent or if they have just moved on . This product is easy to use and apply , if your critter problem is as close to the house as a hose will reach . I have tried many new products and although many seem to work on the tunnels that are present at the time none seem to really get rid of the little varmints . They always come back somewhere else .	1
I used to think these mole repellants were hog wash . The Michigan State University research on using castor oil was not very convincing and not replicated . But , based on that , you have a horde of castor oil based products . Well , let me tell you , I 've used a bunch as well as spraying plenty of plain castor oil and observing no effect . I tried Repellex brand ready-to-spray last year because I read some good reviews and it also has other ingredients besides castor oil . To my surprise , it seemed to work ! Well now comes major hitter Ortho -- so I had to try it . Sprays easily using hose end . I sprayed mainly my flower beds and also select parts of the lawn . Now will have to see if they come back . This is using it as a preventative . I previously used the Repellex when I had an infestation and within two days , there was no new mole activity . I have saved half the bottle of Ortho for when I do have an infestation -- and trust me , they are almost always back every year . If I do n't trap them , they will stick around in my flower beds and tear up my lawn . I recommend trapline traps.Will update later with my observations .	1
Tries this in an area of our yard where we have a mole problem and it did make them go away . Just watching now to see how long they stay gone .	1
I use this to stop my cat from scratching on the doors and on the window . I also use this outside to keep the cats out of my garden as well . This actually works very well on walls and windows as well as doors .	1
I sprayed this around the front and backyard where I 've seen the neighborhood stray cats lurking about . Thus far , I have n't seen it , nor my wife has . So , maybe this product does work . It 's worth a try . I found the ingredients interesting . Peppermint and another herb were 2 of three recognizable ingredients.Just spray around areas such as the front yard , driveway , near the walls , where these pests tend to hop onto . I sprayed next to my Gazebo , where the cats always like to lounge . I also sprayed around my flower beds and near the grass.It 's not an overwhelming chemical smell , but you should still mind the instructions . Overall , I think this is a good product . Why did n't I choose & # 34 ; I Love It & # 34 ; ? Well , it 's not something that brings me overwhelming joy to use . Not fun . It 's going to take time , for me to really use and monitor the cats that come around . But , thus far , it works .	1
After taking out lawn and installing drought tolerant ground cover , I made the mistake of using finely shredded decorative bark to fill the spaces in between plants . Well the neighborhood cats love it , and my front yard quickly became their litter box . I used this product in granular form to cover the whole area , and it really helped . I 'm using the spray for spot application around the plants themselves . It seems to work ; the cats do n't like it , and I 'm getting very few return visits . Big improvement .	1
This dog and cat spray seemed to work fine and the nice thing is that it does not have the horrible odor that some others that I have used . We have a sidewalk out in front and a nice garden of hostas which several of the neighboring dogs think is also a fine place to relieve themselves.We sprayed this along both sides of the sidewalk , around our mail box and around the hosta garden and then were very pleased to watch a dog lead his owner away from our property line and refuse to walk on the grass . This is good.The bad is that one dosage used up the whole bottle which can start to add up in cost . The dosage lasted about 10 days , but we also had a sudden influx of heavy thunderstorms .	1
I get about 2 charges for a smart phone out of this . It has blue light indicators for its level of charge . I like that I can plug into into all my standard USB chargers from the wall to my solar panel but you have to bring along a cord for whatever item you want to charge from it . I own a Goal Zero solar panel so I like this as part of my set but I think it should be priced closer to twenty bucks , as similar charges go for .	1
This portable recharger for small electronics can charge from a USB cable from electronic devices , solar panels or any USB port.I tried it out on phones ( iPhone 4 & flip phones ) , iPad mini , a Kindle Fire , mini speaker , GoPro camera and a Sansa MP3 player . It charges all of them as advertised.The & # 8220 ; 8 & # 8221 ; in Switch 8 means 8 watt-hours of capacity . This is enough for 2 charges on a small flip phone , 1 charge on an iPhone and a small portion of a charge on an iPad mini/Kindle . It can be charged from any USB power source ( computer , car adapter , wall adapter , etc ) . It can even be charged by a solar charger , but I don & # 8217 ; t have one of those yet.Pros : Super light weight , compact ( small enough to slip into just about anything , including your pockets ) , very simple.Four light & # 8220 ; gas gage & # 8221 ; is handy and shows power level both while giving power and receiving power . The added bonus is that my highly restrictive work computer does n't set off alarms when I plug in to the USB port because it is not a memory device . The Switch 8 is now basically an adapter allowing me to charge my phone right off the computer ( instead of needing a wall adapter ) . The manual says it holds a charge for 3-4 months and can be recharged hundreds of times.Cons : Only 1 amp max input and output , but good enough considering the light weight . Optional charging tips are not available yet , but good enough because you already have the charging cables for your devices.This is a very cool portable recharger at a decent price ( $ 35 right now ) . I recommend it .	1
I received this device for free to review from the Amazon Vine program . This is a stylish-looking device that can fully recharge your phone . It has a metal body and plastic ends . A 4-light power indicator shows how charged it is . It weighs only 3 ounces , which is light enough to sit directly connected to your PC power outlet , so no need for a separate cable . This makes it more practical than some other models to carry while walking or hiking.You do , however , have to have your own USB cable to connect your phone to it . It takes about 3 hours to recharge your phone . If you have a goal zero solar panel you could charge this device remotely and have a self-contained phone charge system .	1
I have been very pleased with the Switch . In essence it 's a portable battery that can be charged by any standard USB power supply . The source can be from solar . wall charger , vehicle or any other source . The name is misleading in that this does n't have any solar specific features . It includes a USB cable , but you will most likely need an adapter for your portable device . The documentation seemed to be too brief at first , but it 's a very simple device . The USB port on the input end swivels , the output end is fixed . To charge the Switch , just plug into the swivel end . To charge your portable device , plug into the fixed end . The Switch has a small button on the input end that when pushed will light up to four lights , depending on how much power is remaining in the device . I have used it for MP3 players and my smart phone . It charges my phone and still has plenty of charge left . It 's light weight for a battery .2 oz and is only 5 inches long by less than 1 inch in diameter . It is easy to throw in my pocket or pack and gives me the peace of mind that I have plenty of back up power to get me through the end of the day .	1
I am giving this four stars , because mine works well ... For now . But I have had too many friends who have had problems with these exploding to give it a confident five.I recently had to lug our other 75 foot hose and so I appreciate the lightweight nature of this hose . Even more , it really does n't kink , another thing in its favor . The problem ... For the cost of one of these , you could buy a sturdy hose that you know will last . I 'd suggest you buy a normal hose for your yard and save this super light one for places where you actually need a portable lightweight hose .	1
I have not yet had any issues with this hose - it does expand as they say it will and I expected it would get stretched out and never contract back but so far it does seem to contract once it is empty of water . I like the carrying case that came with it as a nice , easy way to store it out of season . I 'm not crazy about the bright color but it does make it easy to see so there is no danger of mowing over it , which I suppose is the reason they went with a bright color .	1
I liked this hose so much , I went out and bought another one . It solves my problem of having a long hose on my deck that does n't take up half of my floor space on the deck . I only have one negative and that revolves around water pressure : the hose has a smaller diameter than some of my other hoses and therefore has a little less pressure . But for the purpose of watering plants in a conspicuous area , it is perfect .	1
Right now , I have only been using this hose for a week and so far I have n't had any issues . It is lightweight and easy to handle . Because of the lightweight aspect it does make the hose seem flimsy and weak , but it is doing its job for now . I have seen a lot of reviews of these breaking so I will keep watching it and update my review if anything happens.The color is very bright , a lime green color . And when I turn off the water , it will continue to spray until the hose shrivels down to a smaller size and then it stops . It is easy to move around my yard . No trouble with kinks in the hose either .	1
This hose is lightweight and easy to move around and transport . The hose extends to its full length when you use it . When you turn the water off and continue to spray the hose shrinks down to a very manageable size and weight . I put it in a small basket and can now take it anywhere very easily.I have been using this hose for several weeks now and it has held up . No leaks.I purchased a similar hose from my local Kroger 's this summer . It was the 50 foot `` Pocket Hose '' brand and it had a leak at the nozzle fitting right from the start .	1
I 've not had this hose long , so I ca n't speak to the long term quality . I 'll try to remember to update this if it breaks quickly like others have experienced.Pros : -Lightweight-Easy to store ( I toss it behind the bushes and no one can see it - no need for a hose reel ) -A decent length-While the diameter is much smaller than an average hose , I have found the flow to be more than adequate for watering plants which is what I 'm using it for.Cons : -It does n't expand at all . What you see is what you get . Do n't expect it to somehow increase in length.-Attachments are plastic and likely wo n't hold up long.Overall , it 's meeting my need . I 've got flowers to water out front and I do n't want a big hose reel in front of my house . This is easy to use and store .	1
Although the diameter of this hose is not as large as a traditional hose ( and so it does n't put as much water through at once ) it still delivers a lot of water quickly and it 's very easy to drag around . I think that really rough terrain , with sharp rocks or a lot of brambles and branches might tear it if you dragged it through with water in it , but a normal yard did n't present any problems . When I turned off the water , it emptied in a surprisingly short amount of time , too . The hose comes with a little attachment for changing how the water sprays . I have n't tried it ( just never have remembered while I 'm using it ) but I think it might turn the water off , too . It 's made of plastic and fairly lightweight , so I 'm not sure how long it will last , but it worked pretty well . I needed a hose for my front yard , which does n't have a lot of plants to be watered , and does n't cover a lot of ground , so I wanted something that was easy to drag around and easy to put up . This filled the need perfectly.Later note : The longer I use this hose , the more I like it . I do n't think it would be as good for my back yard where I have a lot of watering over a big area , since it 's only 75 feet ( I use a 100 ft hose there ) and it 's a smaller hose with less water pressure , but for the front it 's perfect . It 's so fast I can hardly believe it . Since it weighs practically nothing , it 's easy to get out , and then when you 're finished and the water is out of it , it 's easy to put up . I have a hose holder on my porch and I just toss it in there and I 'm done . This winter , I will make sure that it 's completely dry inside and then store it in the little bag it came in , but for now , I can water in 10-15 minutes , which is important to me since I have heat-triggered asthma and ca n't stay outside very long in the hot summer months , then toss it in the holder and get inside . This hose is well worth the price .	1
We have 11 planting areas scattered around our house , some 200 feet away , so we have a lot of hoses and in summer often water every day . I 'll compare this hose to both traditional garden hoses and other shrinkable hoses , i.e. , The Pocket Hose.First off , while it does have plastic connectors all shrinkable ones do , the picture of the product does seem to make this clear . It comes with a pouch for storage and carrying . Compared to the Pocket Hose , the connectors are much , much sturdier , about 50 % thicker . The fabric the hose is made of is also much thicker than a Pocket Hose , seems less flexible but more solid.I tried the hose first directly on a faucet . The end of the hose connected to the faucet quickly became smooth for about 2 feet , like a normal hose . After than the hose stretched out but not as smooth , it still had some of the folds you see in these hoses , near the 75 foot end the hose appeared to not expand very much . It did not leak . I found that to make the hose contract all the way , leave the nozzle open so water is flowing through when you shut the faucet . It did shrink enough to fit back into its pouch.We have hoses on reels connected to our faucets but need to connect other hoses to them to reach all our planning areas , so I tested this way also . Obviously even at 75 feet this hose was easier to carry , than a traditional 50 foot one . With the water pressure being less it did not expand as much . Perhaps 60-65 feet . I have to fill watering cans for the really far planting areas so have to shut the nozzle , but no leaks or bursting.Finally I shut the nozzle and let the hose sit for about 15 minutes to see if it could take the pressure since others have had trouble with bursting.Good so far . I have this hose and the 50 foot model and no trouble with either one . I will update if there are problems with bursting/leaks , etc .	1
Out of the package , the Rumsford Gardener Expanding Hose worked as advertised . It is light and compact and comes in a nice little storage bag . It fit my fixture easily and filled out to its full extension in a matter or seconds . The shutoff valve works well , creating a complete seal until opened . The hose pressure was a bit lighter than my regular garden hose , but was up to the task of watering the garden and hosing off the patio . I would have liked a bit more pressure while washing the car , but otherwise it works without problem ! Even more amazing was watch the thing shrink back to its original compact size when the water was turned off . It works best if you detach it when not in use and keep it in the storage sack - I would n't leave it attached outside in the sun for extended periods . Its also important to leave the valve open when not in use , so that excess water can drain completely . I 've only had this a few weeks , so I ca n't speak to its durability but it is one incredibly practical product ! I 'll update this after I 've had the hose for a few months .	1
One star removed for no instructions . It 's not complicated , but it 's not instinctively simple either . Install the twisting end to the garden faucet ( use Teflon tape on the threads for a good seal ) . Attach the loose part with the little valve switch to the other end . Attach whatever hand spray attachment you want to use . Turn the little valve switch so it is perpendicular to the hose . Turn on water and let the hose fill with water and expand . Open the valve , and the water comes out . I learned this by watching a salesman at the home show where I bought another brand ( X-Hose ) , which the man said was the ORIGINAL , not some cheap knock-off . This Rumford hose looks identical to the X-Hose , which gets light use in the front of our house . The Rumford hose is serving well in our backyard . The advantage of the expanding hose is that it takes almost no space to store and it is lightweight and easy to maneuver . I 'm very satisfied with it , after using it on several occasions . If it suddenly suffers one of the fates mentioned in earlier reviews , I will update my review .	1
We really like that this hose is so lightweight and easy to use around our large yard . It 's extremely flexible and manageable , which makes me think this would be a great product especially for elderly folks who enjoy working in their yard.The valve at the nozzle has been great so far , it easily adjusts to allow little or a lot of water flow , and I find that an easy adjustment makes this hose perfect for watering delicate flowerbeds or large sections of grass or anything in between with just a little turn of the valve . This hose curls up and stores very nicely , and also has an attractive look to it.I will say this hose does n't seem as durable as regular garden hoses ( which are also heavy and cumbersome to use ) and I worry that this hose wo n't withstand too much rough use in the yard due to it 's construction as well as other reviews I 've read . I would say those in need of a casual garden hose that would n't require much heavy duty use might really like this product , especially if you 're looking for something light weight and manageable . Those in need of something really durable might want to look elsewhere.So far I 've been happy with this product , but if anything changes I 'll be sure to update my review accordingly .	1
Previously owned a 25 ' which proved as advertised for smaller projects around the garden . It works as a standard garden hose but its ability to 'minimize ' itself after use is priceless . Purchased two for those extended locations away that are otherwise hard to reach . The lime color reminds one that the hose need to put away after use .	1
I was n't sure I 'd like this hose , but now I think I may want to get a second one for the front yard.Why I like this hose better than any traditional hose ? 1 . It 's lightweight , even when full of water it 's still lighter than my old hose.2 . It does n't tangle up as easily or as much as a traditional hose.3 . compact size for the same length.4 . Has a shut off valve built right in the working end , easy on easy off.5 . Expands when in use , but retracts automatically to original size when not.6 . I like the color.I ca n't think of any disadvantages right now . So I have no choice but to give this hose 5 stars.UPDATE 10/23/13After using it regularly now for awhile and having to put it away for the winter it still was my favorite hose . Other people have told me they do n't like these kinds of hoses because they break or leak easily but that has not been my experience at all . If anything bad happens when I pull this back out in the spring I 'll update . A good hose should last a long time after all.UPDATE 5/9/14Had it in storage for winter , and brought it out in the beginning of April and it 's still working great almost year later !	1
This is going to work very well at our cabin in the mountains . very convenient and ready to use when you want it handy.Will leave it out for the winter weather this year to see how it holds up and report back my experiences .	1
More than I expected and could be slightly better . In spite of several hundred feet of 'regular ' water hoses filling space around the house this has become our go to hose for almost all nearby jobs . We use it for car washing , window washing and general plant maintenance among other quick and dirty things . It acts just like all the ads from the various sellers have depicted . I always make sure that I empty it fully so that I can reduce the chance of internal growths that might clog it when not used for a long time such as winter . I chose to downgrade it by one star because the black plastic connectors do not last as long as brass fittings . While I have yet to experience coupling failure yet it is going to happen sooner than those made from brass . Regardless of my pickiness this is a good and effective hose and as I said earlier it is our go to hose .	1
This item has terrible reviews , but I have it ( received 7/2013 ) and tested it thoroughly . It works great . I can only assume they switched manufacturers or redesigned something.There are plastic ends , so be careful not to cross thread . It comes with a screw in shut off valve , which works , but I do not really use it.The hose itself expands to a full 75 feet ( I measured ) when full and after a bit of water runs through it . Mine does not leak at all . After use , it drains easily and scrunches back to fit in its basketball size bag.One thing I REALLY like about this hose is that it does not kink . I could not even get it to pause water pressure by folding the hose back on itself.I got full water pressure from the end . Same as my 3/8 '' hose.It is light and easy to drag around the garden.I can give this a full unquestionable recommendation.The prior bad reviews should be disregarded .	1
One thing I hate doing is rolling up a vinyl garden hose or a hose that kinks . I took this hose out of the included pouch and hooked it up . Looking at it I was thinking that there is no way this is a 75 foot hose . As soon as i put the nozzle on it and charged it the entire hose expanded ! I was amazed at how this worked and how easy it was to set up . After use and drained the water and it went back to its original size , fitting back into the original pouch it came with ! The only thing that I would include with it is a quick disconnect plug , so you do n't have to unscrew the house each time . I was able to get one at a local retail store for a couple bucks ! I will follow up on this review if any problems or issues occur . As of now this appears to be a great idea ! 11-21-13 ; As i put this away for the season I have to say this is probably the best hose I have ever purchased . I have not had any issues with leakage or splitting . I am careful to make sure the hose is extended before filling it so it will not burst . As long as you extend it before turning the water on yo will be fine . Break down is easy as the house will literally shrink down from it 's 75 foot size to a more manageable 25 feet or less . Wrap it up and store it in the included nylon bag . Will definitely purchase another one of these so I can extend the length .	1
These expanding hoses seem to be all the rage right now . My ideal hose setup would be 100 foot kink-free hoses with self-winding reels placed at enough outdoor faucets that the entire yard and house could be sprayed . Not everyone has this set-up or a budget to create it . That is where a light-weight , expanding hose would come into play.I have used this hose a few times , but not enough to guarantee that it will last and not explode as others have stated . I found the plastic connections to be fine , just not extremely heavy duty . The pressure seemed OK , but I have water pressure issues here , anyway . What I thought was neat was watching it expand . I use this to extend another hose I have , and I used a hand spray nozzle on the end . When I turned the hose on it began expanding which was interesting , but it did n't look like 75 feet.I had to turn my spray nozzle off and let the hose continue expanding . Which it did , and it was actually fun to watch . When you turn the water off it really does contract , which is also interesting . This brings me to my theory about the hose exploding . It is made from a material that expands and contracts according to the internal water pressure . If you have a spray nozzle on the end , and the nozzle is closed the hose would continue to expand to a point that it could break or explode . I will continue to test this hose , but so far with gentle use it seems to be fine .	1
We 've all seen those infomercials of this type of hose and , like me , most probably felt their claims were overblown . I 've tried various of the `` flat '' garden hoses in the past and found them all wanting so I was a bit skeptical about this new type of `` expanding '' hose . However , after trying this one out I 've become a believer and may never buy ( or use ) a bulky rubber or vinyl garden hose again . I 'm also retiring our heavy , clunky garden hose winder as this hose is so simple to just coil up and store in the included bag or hang on the side of the house . I 'd have given it 5 stars if it were a slightly less obnoxious color and if the fittings were brass rather than plastic . Still do n't understand the `` magic '' that makes this relatively light and easy to handle hose expand like it does but it 's fun to watch and it works almost instantly and just as easily contracts when you 're done and ready to put away the hose .	1
We attached this hose to a traditional 50-foot hose and run it down to our barn to make it more convenient for us to fill buckets of water for our 6 miniature sheep . We also have a garden nearby and use the hose to water that , too.In terms of weight , the hose is outstanding . Much lighter then the 75-foot traditional hose we used to have there . And it 's much easier to wind up , too ( though we mostly leave it out ) .There was some initial leakage with the valve at the end of the hose . But that can be removed ( it 's a little piece that can be unscrewed ) . Once I removed it , I connected the sprayer directly and the hose is working fine with no leaks.We do make sure to turn off the water when not in use - in the past I 've had hoses bulge up and leak when I left them on overnight . This is a good light-duty hose that 's easier to handle then traditional hoses .	1
I was very pessimistic about this when I first saw it , thinking it might be a total waste , especially after I attached it to the water line while somewhat tangled up , and it inflated to make the tangling worse . Also , the outer material will get dirty and stay dirty - I could see this right away . But indeed , upon further use , it has made me realize it has some good qualities and usefulness . For one thing , the very simple , included , half-turn shut-off valve does spray water in the way you 'd want for gardening , so calling it a Gardener hose is correct . But the best thing is that when you turn the water pressure off , it shrinks itself , expelling 95 % of the water it holds . The last bit of water easily comes out when you wrap it around your arm like an extension cord . And now it is small , light , and ready to be stored . Now , there is still some moisture , and the outside may have picked up some dirt , so it 's not like you can put this right up on your kitchen counter , but it 's ripe for putting inside a mud room or basement . This makes it great if you 're the type that does n't like to leave anything outside . I also think this would be especially good for my nice old lady neighbor , who spends a lot of time gardening , but who ( looks ) too small to want to mess with a big hose . And especially because she 's only using it for gardening . I believe that this is something you 'd get used to and like more with time . Oh ... but I think a shorter model would be even more convenient if you could get by with a shorter model.This could also be used as a poseable weight , as necessary . For example , there is a fillable tube in my circular mosquito net meant to keep the bottom weighted ; this could be used in such an application.In conclusion , I think it 's a really good idea and has its uses , but it does not appear to be the most well-made product around ( not that I have anything to compare it to ) . Even so , nice to have around and could make a great main hose for the right person with the right application .	1
Wish I had gotten one a long time ago ! I have an extensive patio garden with vegetables that need almost daily watering . I like to keep the area tidy , so coiling the hose back up each time is a must . With traditional hoses it is a hassle every time ! The hose kinks , wet dirt gets all over your clothes , etc ... you know the drill if you use hoses a lot . But this hose is fantastic - flexible , lightweight even when filled with water , easy to stretch out to reach all ends of the large patio , and shrinks to almost nothing when the water faucet is turned off ! And because it will shrink if you empty it after each use , scalding hot water does not come out when you first turn it on in 90degree weather like a traditional hose . I was concerned it may not be durable enough , but I have had no problems dragging it across cement , me and the dog stepping on it , and all day exposure to bright sunlight . This is the only hose I will use for now on ! ! It makes watering enjoyable again ! I know some have had problems with durability . I have had this hose since 7/23/2013 , so I will report on its durability in the future .	1
I have two kinds of these , but here 's why I love this one ! I have a 50ft one from the TV ad and this 75ft one . This one appears to be made with better materials and should last longer . Additionally , this one comes with a cloth bag for storage . Yes ! The 50ft one came only with the thin plastic tub in which it was packaged . It has already started falling apart , but the bag with this one is very nice and has a drawstring for closing it up.You can take out this hose , hook it up , and be watering in about 30 seconds . It takes about 45 seconds to put it up . It 's self draining and extremely handy . I 'm getting more . You should get one too !	1
As soon as I saw this type of hose in the store I wanted to try it , so when it was offered through the Vine program I snatched it up . Even when it 's full of water this hose is lightweight , and can be carried all over the yard with no problem . No more lugging a heavy hose ! My only issue with it is that it has plastic fittings . I would much prefer brass . I have the 75 foot version . When I tested it , it only expanded to 70 feet . One star knocked off for that , and the plastic fittings . Watching it expand and contract like magic is fun . Between the ease of use and the fun of using it , watering my yard will be a joy instead of drudgery.10/21/2013I feel sorry for all the people who have had problems with this hose because it really is wonderful to use . Besides all the reasons I stated in my original review for liking this hose , I 'd like to add that when the water pressure is released it contracts to it original length . When it does , it squeezes out almost all of the water that 's in it . Lifting up the hose drains the rest . I store it in a bucket which can be carried into the garage or house . If I want it to dry out completely , I can hang it over a shower rod . That means I can use it during the winter when I want to wash road salt off of my van , and not have to worry about it freezing.There are some things I do to extend the life of this hose . I always take the pressure off of it , which I do with all of the water hoses I own , I never drag it anywhere when I 'm using it , and I always store it in the garage . I do n't know if those tips will help with the problems people have been having , but I hope so because this really is a marvel .	1
These expandable hoses are pretty nifty . Last year I tried the coil hose , and I found it to be heavy and unwieldy . This year I tried the fabric-covered expanding hoses , and I like them much better.Earlier in the year , I purchased the popular TV brand at a bricks and mortar store after I saw my neighbor 's purchase . The popular TV brand is a 50 ' hose that is bright florescent green . Overall , the TV brand is very light , which is due to its length and due to its materials , which seem cheap & a bit shoddy . I kept that purchase for watering my flowers and shrubs . I figured that the TV brand hose was a one season purchase but it did exactly what I wanted it to do.Later in the year , I tried the 75 ' Rumford hose . It is priced about twice the amount as the popular TV brand , and I can see why . Although the couplings are the same , this Rumford hose is much better quality . The fabric covering is thicker , the hose is fatter , and the length is longer . It is heavier than the other brand , in part due to materials and in part due to length . It 's also a more pleasing color of green . Whereas I figured the TV brand would be a one season purchase , I can see this one lasting me a couple seasons . If it is going to fail any where , it will probably fail around the couplings , which is fixable.Is this purchase is right for you ? Honestly , I think it depends on how much money you want to spend . I think the 75 ' hose is priced quite high right now . However , if you are looking at the other TV brand hose , I 'd say go with the 50 ' Rumford instead because it is only a few dollars more and definitely worth it . If you 're looking for something a bit less expensive , then go with one of the 50 ' flat fabric hoses with an integrated wheel - these run about 10 bucks , are available at the big-box home improvement centers , and will last 1 or 2 seasons .	1
I 've seen a number of reviews of this product that say it falls apart after a few months of regular use . I ca n't say I 've experienced that yet though I 've only had it for a couple of weeks . In fact this is exactly the sort of hose I have been wishing for -- light , unlikely to kink up , and long enough to go where I need to go -- so if it does end up falling apart I 'll be very perturbed . But then , many hoses fall apart in my experience.In addition to the weight and the non-kinking , I like the on/off switch that attaches to the spigot . It allows me to turn the water on more easily on a spigot that 's out-of-the-way and hard to reach . Seriously , if this does fall apart I will grieve . I will also come back here and tell you about it . Promise .	1
After seeing some reviews before me , I was bracing myself for the worst , but I 've had a great time with this hose ( so far used about a month ) . I use it to go around my backyard filling up Earthboxes . It 's so much easier letting the water drain and watching the hose recoil to what looks like less than 20 feet instead of having to recoil and untangle the regular hose . There are no tangle issues with this since it 's so easy to sort out once emptied and shortened . The hose end is n't bulky so it fits easily within the diameter of the Earthbox fill tubes so there is n't any extra water spraying outside the tube and getting lost . I used some teflon tape around the connection to the water spout and have n't had any problems with leaks . Even the spray strength on my hose has met and perhaps gone farther than my expectations . I had a maggot-infested trash bin outside that I wanted a STRONG spray of water to clean out , and this hose did the job for me.The only thing I have worries about is the hose end is made of plastic , not metal . I am fairly gentle with the hose - I do n't just drop the hose end onto the ground when done using it , I place it on the ground so there 's no great impact to the head . I did accidentally smack the end of the hose against concrete which seemed to create a small leak for a moment , but a few times of closing and opening the valve at the end seemed to make it go away . I have not had any issues with leaks since so I assume all will be well as long as I avoid strong impacts in the future . Take care of the hose and it will work for you .	1
When this was offered to us as an Amazon Vine product that I could test for free I jumped that the chance . I had my eye on them before since I have my own garden and need a lightweight hose . The mixed reviews made me stop and thing . But this offer came by a different company and I grabbed at the chance.This came in a nice little black drawstring back with bright green cording to keep your hose in.How many garden hoses do you that do that ? . It also supplies you with a connector piece so if you want and extension you can have double the hose , 150 feet , wow that is impressive I could use that also , but I would have to pay for it , I hope it will be worth it.I could not wait to try it so I took it outside and hooked it up , I attached a brand new nozzle I had and turned the water on . I did not know what to expect . For a moment I thought something was wrong since no water was coming out . But it was the hose , it had to fill up and stretch , it was really weird watching the hose growing like that . Then the water came out the nozzle.I used it for a few minutes on my deck to flush away some debris from all the storms we had and it worked just great ! It is really very light and easy to handle , what a difference from the regular hose.I used it for a few minutes more with nothing happening so I turned it off . Now my home is waterlogged form all the storms we have had lately and are going to have more of so I must put this away for now . But I am going to need it soon after the last drop falls and I will be putting it to a thorough test.Due to time constraints I must leave the review now but I promise to come back and give further comments . But so far I am absolutely thrilled this works fantastic . So I am going to have fun with it and see if it breaks like some of those other hoses do . But from what I can see already this is a very strong and durable garden hose . I am hoping to be able to use this a lot..	1
The Oxo Omelet Turner is not a necessary kitchen implement , but can be a handy one to have in certain situations . The unique shape helps get under the edge of omelets . It can also be used to flip crepes if they are cooked in a frying pan , rather than a flatter , crepe pan . Due to its unique shape , it may also turn out to be one of those kitchen tools that is just the right tool for any number of jobs.It is rather large , however , so those with limited kitchen space might do better to pass on this item unless they are really avid omelet makers .	1
I 've never owned an Oxo product that did n't work well , and this is no exception . I had my doubts - it looks odd , and it looks big for flipping a small omelet , but the flexible outer part together with the stiffer yellow part works perfectly , and in a pretty small ( 8 '' ) skillet . I find it actually works pretty well for other stuff , too - for example , I used it on pancakes , the other day , just because my normal spatula was out of reach , and it works great ! It flexes enough to get under the edges easily , frees up the food from the skillet without tearing up the food , but it 's stiff enough to work while flipping or folding over . Another great Oxo product !	1
I was a little skeptical when I ordered this ; would it REALLY have just the right combination of pliability and rigidity to gently raise the edge of an omelet without tearing it ? And , would it be an improvement over my favorite , tried-and-true-favorite 1989 model spatula ? The answer is a resounding YES.I 've cooked two omelets with it so far and the results were excellent.I like to cook mine by gently lifting the edges all around the omelet , allowing uncooked egg to seep to the bottom of the omelet after it 's slightly set . I continue to do this for a couple of minutes , until the top begins to set . Then I cover the pan , leave it on heat for about 30 seconds , remove completely from heat ( while covered ) and allow the omelet to completely `` set , '' which takes about 3-4 minutes . If I add cheese , I do it just seconds before removing it from the heat source . If I add fillings like mushrooms , peppers , and onions , I scatter the pre-sauteed fillings over the melted cheese , season , then fold the omelet and serve.This little tool makes this job quite a bit easier . I 'm impressed with the size of the `` folder '' part of the tool -- it will work well with any size omelet and makes it easier to get a good , even fold for a lovely presentation.The tip of the tool is just the right size and shape for the lifting/tucking required to allow the uncooked egg to seep under the omelet in the early stages of cooking . And it makes moving from pan to plate a WHOLE lot easier.As I said , I 'm a convinced skeptic . It works great for omelets and can double for baking duties -- happily recommended !	1
From the title , you can guess that around this house we like Alton Brown 's advice that one does not buy kitchen tools that have only one purpose -- except your fire extinguisher.So , would I buy the Omelet Turner ? Well , judging by the label , I might avoid it , thinking it 's a uni-tasker and not worth the money and storage space . After all , it 's not just whether you can buy it . It 's whether or not you have a place to put it ! Let 's look at how this does:1 . Omelets : obviously , the first question is whether or not it does what it claims : make omelets easier than a normal turner . It does . The combination of the stiffness at the back with the slightly floppy front edge makes this quite useful for making that simple fold-over omelet that I 'm wanting to make.2 . Scrambled eggs in general : as the design is made to well-scrape the edge of a skillet , this works to liberate the scrambled eggs that our children are learning to cook and sometimes let begin to stick . Quite handy.3 . The description mentions quesadillas , and I agree : you can lift the edge of a tortilla and fold it over quite nicely.4 . If you ca n't find the mixing spatula to scrape a dough bowl , this subs nicely.5 . Anything that needs to remain intact and be flipped over , this is useful for.It is not quite the picture of delicacy : some crepe-making and really thin omelets will still be a challenge.But we use it fairly constantly around here .	1
Seriously , I just do n't know why a gadget like this has n't been developed previously . I mean , there are all kinds of silicone spatulas and other silicon-coated utensils created to use with the finish of certain pans . There have been some even curved into a 'spoonula ' shape to serve as both a spoon and a spatula - so , why not a long , thin item with a flexible blade like this , to aid in turning omlets and fritattas . It slides easily between the pan side and the food , even separates the cooked underside from the pan itself , all without scraping or gouging the pan . If I could give it six stars , I would .	1
I 've been trying to master omelets and even with the `` right '' pan and an arsenal of spatulas it has n't been going so well . I pretty much had given up but then I saw this turner and decided to give it a try . The thin silicone edge easily slides around and under the edges conforming to the shape of the pan . It 's large size makes it easy to get under the eggs so you can loosen them and shake the pan to flip the eggs . I also use this to loosen fried eggs and crepes . Worked in both my omelet pan and higher sided cast iron pans .	1
I love to make omelets because you really can put anything in them . I will often put leftovers in mine and am frequently surprised how good some things are in an omelet that I would have never thought of putting in an omelet before.The Flip and Fold has a semi transparent part that is very soft that is barely visible in the picture . The orange part is the only rigid part . The Flip and Fold is really for the hardest part of making an omelet , the fold . It is not really made for flipping the omelet unless it is one egg . It can flip a two egg omelet but it is difficult and forget flipping a three egg omelet . It is also not really made for taking the omelet out of the pan either unless it is one egg.It is great for folding because the soft part allows you to conform to the sides of the pan and slide it under the omelet . It becomes a little more difficult if the sides of the pan come off the pan at a 90 degree angle but still does the job better than a traditional spatula . Since I slide the omelet out of the pan and onto the plate I do n't need it to take the omelet out of the pan.Where the Flip and Fold fails is flipping the omelet . Since the soft plastic part is so soft it really is not rigid enough to flip the omelet so essentially you are left to try and flip it with the rigid orange part . I do n't know if the solution would be to make the orange part bigger or the softer part a little more rigid . I suspect it would be better to make the soft part slightly more rigid . Recommended for those that plan to make one egg omelets or two egg omelets at best .	1
Please refer to the two photos I uploaded . This thing is much bigger than my usual spatulas used for eggs and omelettes . This has a hard plastic handle which turns into a firmer but not rigid yellow blade and that is encased in a translucent soft material . It says it 's good for up to 600F , and if you cook at such temperatures , well , good on ya . I keep things a lot more normal , you do n't want to blast eggs with a lot of heat unless you like watery eggs.Yet another brilliant Oxo designed kitchen tool . Imaginative -- I 've never seen anything quite like this . The soft outboard part provides a big surface area for flipping fussy food . I 'm thinking that this would work great with fish . I have a different really big pancake-flipping spatula from OxoOXO Good Grips Silicone Flexible Pancake Turnerwhich has a similar setup , there 's a stiffer internal blade and that 's encased in a softer-kinder-gentler material to ease your cooking over . The first Oxo product I remember was one of their chunky-handled vegetables peelers -- a massive improvement over those old nasty metal peelers . And they 've kept at it , reinventing and refining everyday kitchen tools . Little things like having a decent spatula mean a lot over the long run , I mean , life is too short to use inferior tools . And this spatula is clearly superior to anything else I have in my kitchen arsenal.I do all the cooking for my small family and I enjoy having good tools . I *USE* them , they do n't just sit there . So I 'm pretty excited about this spatula . And I 'm tickled that a company has people on the job thinking of things like this.Bottom line : While it looks a bit oversized , this spatula provides amazing control over just about liquid eggs , leaving you in control of an omelette . Remarkable improvement over a rectangular spatula . The thin translucent part slips under the edges and lifts them without tearing . Outstanding ! This would make a really thoughtful gift for young people starting out on their own , or newlyweds setting up a household . One of those little things you do n't really give a lot of thought to . But that end up being a perfect tool .	1
I was skeptical about this when it arrived , but have used it a couple of times , and I love it . It really works well when flipping an omelet . I wo n't say it 's essential , but it really does make things easier as it conforms to the contours of whatever size pan you 're using . If you make omelette a lot , like we do , this is sooo worth having ! And great whether you 're right or left handed .	1
When I saw this online , the photo was n't very clear and I thought the spatula was just the yellow part . I use a smallish omelet pan and was actually looking for a small , delicate spatula . When I got it , I found this very large clear area and I was skeptical it could slip into and under the eggs . I was really surprised . The edge is very flexible and it slips under the thinnest edges in my small pan . It easily releases the bottom of the omelet , and then the stiffer , yellow part keeps it sturdy enough to fold or roll the egg without losing control . Other uses must be limited to things of texture , as the soft edge is too flexible for things like scraping down the sides of batter in a bowl . However , anything where you need some support after slipping under material should work well .	1
I do n't make omelettes but this is a great and useful spatula . Heat resistant to 600 degrees so I 'm not worried about using it on socca , which is finished off in a very hot oven under the broiler . It 's a bit large for a spatula , so it 's not going to be poking down into my blender or Cuisinart , but for things that go in a skillet liquidy and get stirred around or get partially flipped over , it 's great . ( Not pancakes , unless you 're desperate ! ) Quesadillas , home fries , tofu scramble , all good . Will do for a grilled cheese in a pinch . Very sturdy and strong , with a nice blend of thick and sturdy down one side and then and pliable down the other with a just-right size handle .	1
The head on this spat was way larger than I was anticipating ! It works great for almost everything . The spat is very flexible but sturdy . The high heat resistance is great for every day use . very happy ! I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this ? Yes	1
I love my kitchen gadgets and thisOXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turneris a fantastic tool for helping with breakfast . Great for crepes and omelets , the turner has a flexible edge that gives you great leverage in turning your cooked eggs . Wonderful for the days I make pancakes , this tool is precise and extremly useful . The grip handle is perfect for getting a good hold . I tend to cook my eggs in a smaller pan and having a smaller turner like this is ideal , it helps prevent damaging the presentation of the cooked eggs . Truly a wonderful tool in the kitchen .	1
This omelet spatula actually works as intended ; it slipped easily under the eggs and flipped them in half without the omelet ripping . Unfortunately I 'm not sure it 's good for anything other than this task . It 's not designed to flip pancakes for example . I would highly recommend this omelet flipper and it would be a great gift for the `` hard to buy for '' foodie person .	1
The Oxo Good Grip Flip and Fold Omelet Turner is an outstanding product not just for omelets , but for other foods that need a perfect flip . The grip , balance , and the light silicone material make it ideal for everyone 's kitchen . First , it is easy to handle and the large flexible edges truly conform to pan edges . Other smaller edge products are not able to turn an omelet or other large items and keep them in one piece . Also this tool does n't scratch , glides along smoothly and makes cooking simple . Other utensils sometimes put scratches in pans and do n't pick up food very well.It seems that almost anything cooking in a frying pan can be flipped or stirred with this utensil . Because it is so flexible it can reach edges and maneuver food without pushing it out of the pan . It has become one of my favorite spatula tools and I have many , both small and large . Beyond the pan , the tool also is convenient for getting food out of bowls and due to its size , it makes the process fast since the turner can move so much at one time . There is n't any negative I can find in regard to this item . Cooking with it is great , but the cleanup and the dishwasher safe aspect of the turner is also wonderful . Congratulations to Oxo for such a phenomenal product .	1
Most of us are cautious about one trick ponies or tools that only perform one duty in a kitchen , but the OXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turner delivers on its promises . It 's very flexible and does a good job of getting under the omelet.The outer portions of the turner are very thin , much thinner than any silicone tool I 've seen . That is , of course , what makes it so useful for omelets , but something tells me it will tear or wear easily . I have n't used it long enough to verify that though . The turner easily slides under the omelet and does a good job of supporting it while flip or fold it.Overall , if you make enough omelets I 'd definitely recommend this tool . I 'm not sure it has many other uses , but it certainly helps in preparing omelets . It 'll have a spot in my utensil drawer for some time to come .	1
This was prefect for flipping omelet turner . It was really good for flipping omelet . It did n't burn , was nice for the grips . It was perfect for an omelet .	1
Time after time , I 've tried to create the perfect omelet , but the eggs seems to squeal with mocking laughter back up at me , because I just could n't get it right . The omelet would fall apart , and I 'd be left dejected ... but oh no ... not anymore ... Seriously though , who 'd have thought that a little modification to a skillet turner-thing would work out so well ? It really does help turn an omelet a lot better than the spatulas and other kitchen tools I 've tried.It 's made from silicone which I guess is safter than the plastic types in terms of leaching chemicals at high heat.The design makes it perfect for what it needs to do which is to flip an omelet ( or tortilla or crepe ... but watch out if you combine those three at the same time ) .	1
I 'm not really a big omelet guy , but we went on a quiche kick recently , and this is a good tool for getting things out of a cake-pan . I 've also used this on latkes and fried fish . It 's obviously designed for sliding in from the side rather than your typical shovel-spatula , but it 's got a pretty broad blade and although not exactly balanced for it flips things well enough . I 'm finding it useful .	1
To be honest , I have not tried this with an omelet . Instead , I have used this to turn fried eggs , pancakes , and delicate fish . This is just the ticket for turning delicate items in the fry pan . It is slick enough to slide under the food to be flipped and firm enough to allow me to flip ( or retrieve , for that matter ) what I am frying . I am impressed with this item . For years I have tried to find a spatula that will slide up under food while being supportive enough . This does the trick . If I find that this company makes a spatula like this , I will buy it .	1
In spite of the Julia Child 's words about courage when flipping an omelet , I have never mastered the knack of fearlessly flinging an omelet into the air and catching it in the skillet . In spite of practicing with bread by the hour , I still balk when it is real semi-cooked eggs flying through the air . This , of course has doomed me to years of raggedy-edged omelets or fallen-apart-and-mashed-back-together monstrosities . They always taste okay , but the aesthetics leave just a bit to be desired . That is , until now . The nice folks at OXO Good Grips have solved another one of my small culinary flaws with a device that takes the aerial dynamics out of omelet flipping . This marvelous little Flip and Fold Omelet Turner glides right under the omelet allowing me to flip it in one piece and is cleverly shaped to allow one to lift one half over the other to make the final half-moon of fluffy eggs land perfectly on the plate.For all of you balky flippers out there , here is a perfect tool that lets the perfect omelet be perfect from pan to plate every time ! I am so pleased with this item ! ! OXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turner , Clear	1
This OXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turner was designed for making ... omelets , made of eggs in a frying pan . The flexible and large head shape lifts and separates the eggs from the sloping edges of the pan , and it is supposed to be heat resistant to 600 degrees . No melting yet ! You have to make sure you have used enough butter , oil , or non-stick spray to keep the eggs from sticking . The edge of this turner is n't stiff enough to be used as a spatula . However , it is large enough that I use it like a soft spatula for frying veggies . I have n't gotten brave enough to use it with tomato sauces , since I am afraid it will stain . When I forget , I will add to this review.The handle is a bit longer than I would like , but you learn to adjust . Bottom line ? I am using this kitchen tool more than I expected to . That is always positive ... Not just another pretty implement laying around !	1
I was a bit surprised when I got this OXO Omelet turner because I thought it was going to be a small , yellow , spatula . Well , if you zoom in on the picture , you 'll notice that there is a very faint outline around the yellow on the left side . The actual spatula is pretty big - the part you ca n't see is a nice flexible silicone while the yellow bit is more solid and gives the spatula some backbone . The spatula is large enough that I found myself using it to turn fish steaks as well . The spatula is flexible enough to sneak underneath delicate eggs , but solid enough to bear the weight of larger proteins . A good spatula to add to any kitchen crock .	1
The OXO Good Grips Omelet Turner is excellent ! It is large and I was afraid it would be unwieldy but it proved not to be the case . I like using these soft turners for my skillets pans and this one has become my favorite . And it works great for anything , not just an omelet . Plus the OXO Good Grips are easy on the hands- even for those with arthritis setting in .	1
We have a number of silicone spatulas we use on our LeCreuset pans so that we do n't mar the surface . This spatula is a great addition . It has a fairly large head / turner , with a flexible outer part and a more rigid inner part . This makes sliding under the omelet easy , and flipping equally so . Moreover , it 's really not just a specialty tool - I use this for all manner of things when I 'm cooking , and find it just as handy as the other spatulas next to our stove . I have absolutely no problems with this spatula - it does what it should , seems to me made well , and can be used for other things too . Oh , and it 's dishwasher safe . What more should I expect ? 5 stars from me .	1
Unless you are a professional omelet chef who flips omelets all day , this definitely is n't a tool you NEED for your kitchen . Sure , you can put it to use in other tasks , but it best suited for its design -- flipping omelets.I 'm only an occasional omelet maker , but when I do make them I am confronted with the ultimate game stopper -- the flip . I 've tried to master the fry pan flip , but more often than not I send egg parts all over the room . No fun.This `` Flip and Fold Omelet Turner '' is a clever design . It 's a thin , flexible silicone spatula that can slide right under eggs and , well flip then . It has a tapered edge like a knife that gets underneath even the most persistent omelet . Then a quick flick of the wrist -- and your done ! The omelet flipper is big too ; bigger than I was expecting . It 's a little larger than a common spatula , letting you really get under your omelets when flipping time appears . The spatula stands up to the high temperatures , and you should have no problem using it in a frying pan.I feel a little bit lazy when I use this , but you ca n't argue with results . The omelets I made using this flipper did n't taste any better but they are sure much prettier .	1
I bought this for the Carolina Room , and it works perfectly as a bench under the picture window . It is very comfortable , both for conversations and for lounging .	1
I was a little worried when my chaise arrived because all four legs had worked their way through the box . The delivery guy helped me unpack and inspect it , and thankfully , there was no damage . It comes completely assembled , except for removing the plastic cover from the cushion and placing in on . The back rest is easy to adjust and has 4 height settings or can be left down altogether . I 'm 5'5 '' and it 's the perfect size for me . The cushion is soft and thick and very comfortable . It 's covered with a polyester fabric that resembles cotton twill . The chaise looks great and is very sturdy . I think we 're going to order another one .	1
As the other reviewer said , check the box , which I did n't before I signed for delivery . The legs were poking out in 3 places just a bit , but thank God there was no damage . It 's too bulky for UPS or USPS to deliver so there was a special delivery for us.The base is sturdy and a good quality of wicker . There are a few settings in the back to adjust your back height but you have to get of the chair to change the height . The cushion resembles canvas but not quite , it 's smoother . Because of the weather I set it up in a bedroom and really , it 's lovely enough to go into a sun-room . It 's comfortable enough to be used as another bed for company if they do n't mind a firm mattress . But I ca n't wait until it 's warm enough to enjoy outside . The weight is n't so heavy that I ca n't lift it , but because of the size , it 's harder for one person to maneuver in the house . Outside should be no problem moving it about , though .	1
First of all , check inside the box before you accept delivery . One of the corner legs was bent toward the inside . It almost looks like it fell on the corner -- although it seems hard to imagine how something that big could have dropped on one corner . The box was not damaged though , so it is a mystery . My husband was able to stand on the corner leg long enough for it to straighten out but he gave me a lot of dirty looks.This is a sturdy , good-looking lounge . It is very lightweight and easy to move around . My teenager and I carried it upstairs very easily and then downstairs again when my husband did n't like where I put it . The core of it feels sturdy . The resin-wicker part of it feels plasticized which will make it last much longer as an outdoor piece of furniture . The cushion is fabric covered , not that plastic sticky stuff that you get stuck to while sun bathing.This lounge is the perfect size for me more than anyone else in my house . I am 5'8 '' with 4 '' heels and my feet come near to the bottom of this when it is in the most upright position . In the full flat position , I am the only one who can lie on it comfortably.My 6 ' tall husband could not find any way to sit that was comfortable . Mostly his feet hung off the edge but he also could n't find an angle to be comfortable . My 6'2 '' teenager can sit on it and his feet also hang off the edge of it . When he is stretched out on it flat , half his head hangs off . He says it 's fine but this is the same child who did n't want a twin XL bed in his room.This is a nice deck furniture piece and I 'm definitely going to look at more parts to this , just not another lounge and not until summer when they go on sale .	1
This lounge is perfect for naps . The cushion is deep and soft . The frame is solid and sturdy . I do n't know what weight it 's rated to hold but we put over 400lbs of pressure on it just to see if if would give anywhere and it showed absolutely no signs of stress.I 'm 6 ' tall and had no problem sitting comfortably on it while it was in a reclining position . When I lay down completely it 's a little short . My wife is a little shorter at 5'8 '' and it fit her perfectly.We received the package via a local delivery agency and had absolutely no problems . The chair came in mint condition right out of the box.The lounge has a nice look to it . It 's elegant , sturdy , and weather resistant . It 's a great look for anyone who wants to create an extra `` room '' out on the patio or deck .	1
I have the Strathwood couch , coffee table and side table . This is now my favorite piece . The chaise is extremely comfortable and the plastic wicker holds up very nicely to weather . The back can be elevated to nearly 90 degrees or it can lay flat as an outdoor daybed or even a flat couch for extra seating . The cushion itself is all one piece with a `` hinge '' in the middle . There is a tie in the back to afix it to the elevated portion of the chaise . The inside frame is a powdercoated metal that will not rust . The legs are even finished in wicker.I have taken a bunch of photos and posted them so you can see the detail areas . Everything about this appears very high end.It is light enough to easily move around , but substantial enough it wo n't blow around in a normal breeze.I purchased this cover which fits absolutely perfectly : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ0RNOI highly recommend this chaise .	1
fter the long Winter I was finally able to get this chaise lounge set up on my patio . I am really impressed with the quality and comfort of this unit . I have had patio furniture in the past , but nothing like this . The quality and durability are obvious . After the Summer is over I am going to pu it in my home office as an accent couch . I am looking forward to purchasing accent pieces as well .	1
This product was a nice change to be able to spray it instead of having to squeeze a handle , It does work well . The only thing I would have liked to have been different is the response time . It took about 3 days to really see it changing and more for it to do its total job .	1
This will be another ongoing review , as I 'm sure it will take a few weeks for any real results to appear . Every year I have to dig up weed that grow between the concrete slabs on my driveway , and front walk , as well as the sidewalk in front of my house . This year I 'm going to apply Foaming Edger to these areas , and hope that I wo n't have to go out there every couple of weeks to pull up the weeds and grass that grow between the cracks.I made the first application last night ( it 's the first time in a week that there is no rain in the forecast ) , and used maybe a 1/4 of the can . I will continue to modify this review as the `` growing '' season gets underway . **2nd and final review - This foaming edger worked really well . As stated above I sprayed this in the seams of my concrete driveway , and to date nothing has grown where I 've sprayed . I 've already ordered a second can to apply to my sidewalk and the walkway that runs alongside my house .	1
This foaming weed killer works in tight places where you do n't want errant sprays blowing and possibly killing your wonderful flowers or herbs . I use this in my herb garden for killing pesky weedy vines and chick weed . To be extra careful , I use a 12 x 12 piece of cardboard ( vertically just touching the ground ) and keep the nozzle close to the weed , to make sure nothing goes where I do n't want it . It 's foaming , so you can target it with great accuracy , and you can see where you 've sprayed . Takes a few days to work . I recommend it !	1
We have a bad weed problem in our rock driveway , and all the & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; methods have failed . I figured I 'd try this . It did kill the weeds , though it took a couple days to really work ( applied in the AM on a sunny day ) . The foam is nice to be able to avoid plants you do n't want to spray , but the foam disappears quickly , so you may end up spraying the same area twice . Plan on using this only for touch-up . It runs out quickly .	1
I have a bunch of rocks set around two sides of the patio in my backyard . I use them as stands for my potted plants . Unfortunately , weeds tend to grow up in between these rocks , looking unsightly . Edgers can & # 8217 ; t really get between the rocks , so you either have to move the rocks or pull all the weeds by hand . That is , before I tried Spectracide Aerosol Weed and Grass Foaming Edger.I moved my potted plants away , then sprayed this stuff on all the weeds between the rocks . I meant to check them every day to see the daily progress , but got so busy I forgot . A few days later , I was on the patio and noticed all the weeds were gone & # 8211 ; that & # 8217 ; s when I remembered I sprayed them with the Spectracide solution.I had bought some Ortho weed-killer last year and it was not effective on any of the weeds that I used it on . The Spectracide weed and grass foaming edger was easy to use , effective , and inexpensive . I am ordering a few more cans to take care of some other areas with weeds , like the path to my front door . I would HIGHLY recommend this weed killer .	1
This product is spot on for getting to those small spaces where you need a focused stream of weed killer . It is perfect for along fences and other tight places . I have flower beds right beside all of my fences and this product kills the weeds and leaves the flowers alive . it has a very focused foaming spray that hits where you want and does not spread . On top of that the price at 2.98 is very reasonable . It worked on my entire fence line and still had a little left over .	1
This is awesome ! Normally you have to mix something like this up in a sprayer , but this has all the convenience of a can . This is really easy to use . You just pop the top , point and spray ( read the can for more specific directions ) . I applied the edger one morning before I left the house and could already see progress by the time I returned a few hours later.The can keeps everything neat and clean . It 's very easy to use and store . I highly recommend this for small homes with drive ways etc .	1
This worked very well from the start . Most weeds shriveled and died with 48 hours after I sprayed them ( although the info on the Spectracide can indicates it could take longer ) . And then there were the dandelions . After a very heavy winter , tons of snow , we had so much moisture that the dandelions got a head start . I did n't assume the Foam edger would do much with them but it worked like a charm ( more info about that below as I did tweak my usual method a bit for the dandelions ) .For all other weeds and grasses , I did n't have to adjust a thing . I sprayed them . I watched them die . I saw my garden bed have a very nicely defined line between the plants and my lawn . I do have a fence behind my plants and it is a MAJOR pain to try and tackle the unwanted weeds that sprout along that fence line so the Spectracide edger saved me time - and spared my back.Now for those dandelions ... ..because the ground has been so moist and we 've had so much rain , I picked a day when the ground was still moist - but no rain was predicted - to tackle the dandelions . I simply grabbed and pulled as many as possible and this meant , of course , that their roots generally stayed in the ground . That 's when I sprayed the weed killer into the remaining space.I tested it two ways on the dandelions : spraying them directly without trying to pull them up first - and then pulling up what I could , spraying the Spectracide onto the remaining root . Both methods worked well . Pulling up whatever I could before spraying worked better.The dandelions are now history .	1
Spectracide Aerosol Weed and Grass Foaming Edger , 17-Ounce , finally a product that really works and is easy to use . The foam lets you see where you have sprayed which makes it easier to apply and there is no harsh odor . THe plant dries right up and crumbles apart in a week .	1
I 've tried many different herbicides and have not had much success with them actually killing the weeds and keeping them gone ( esp the hard to kill ones such as dandilions and vines ) I have to say that I am impressed with the Spectracide Foaming Edger ! I applied it on a clear day and within a couple hours the weeds were beginning to wilt . By the next morning they were brown and dead ! Yea ! I applied it on a full dandilion and a half pulled dandilion ( darn roots ! ) and it killed both of them and they are yet to come back.It will kill anything it touches , so be careful of plants you want to keep.Be aware that this stuff is not good for you or pets . The warning on the back states : & # 34 ; Do not allow people or pets to touch the treated plants until the sprays have dried . Do not apply this product in a way that will contact any person or pet , either directly or through drift . Only persons applying this product may be in the area during application . Clothing and protective equipment exposed to this product should be washed in detergent and hot water . Such items should be kept and washed separately from other laundry . Users should wash hands prior to eating , drinking , chewing gum , using tobacco or using the toilet . User should remove clothing immediately if pesticide gets inside . Then wash thoroughly and put on clean clothing . Users should removed clothing and protective equipment immediately after handling this product . As soon as possible wash thoroughly and change into clean clothing. & # 34 ; We do have a dog and she was inside ( along with our kids ) when I applied this product . I did not read all the warnings prior to application and I was in my barefeet and shorts when I applied it . The bottoms of my feet did sting a little bit and my legs felt a little itchy but I washed them and that seemed to help.I would definitely use this product again - I would just make sure I had shoes and long pants on .	1
If you have a small yard this would perfect ! It works great ! I have photos of what it looks like after 2 days . I will post them if I can find out how to get them on here . It 's so easy to apply . All I did was angle it along the edge and walk slowly while spraying . I probably could have leaned over a little more to make the line smaller but this is still pretty straight . Since I ca n't add photos of my dead weeds , I wanted to add that I love that I can see the product as I 'm spraying ! It makes for an easier application without over spraying .	1
I tried this out on a day when it was raining all day . I do n't know what & # 34 ; Rainproof in 15 minutes & # 34 ; mean on the canister , but it rained all day , I sprayed it on weeds in a crack because I could n't wait for the next clear day , and the weeds turned brown . I ca n't say how fast it worked since I sprayed it and did n't check again until the next morning , but they were all brown . I do n't know if I 'll have to actually pull them out now or if they 'll eventually die off but I do n't want to get my hands dirty so I 'm going to wait and see .	1
It works well for most grass , but does not always penetrate to the root . Does not work on sedges . Seemed to run out rather quickly . the foam is handy for seeing where you are , but foam melts and so later you ca n't tell . Pay attention to the area quickly or you can lose your place .	1
My house has grass that goes right up to the base of the foundation . The exterminator told me that if I killed the grass that abutted the house I might have less problem with insects infestation . I sprayed this foam all around the house and it absorbed quickly into the grass . I had to really keep an eye on what I was doing because the foam dissolved quickly and it was easy for me to lose my place . One can was sufficient to cover around the entire ( very small ) house . I checked it 2 days later and the grass/weeds were still there but I 'm hoping they will die within the week . Spectracide Foaming Edger was very easy to use and it did n't get my hands dirty . I may have to get another can and apply a second dose , but for now I will wait and let it work its magic .	1
I hate to use herbicides . They get into the water system , or animals can eat the plants you poison . However , I have weeds that grow up thru the cracks of the sidewalk in front of my house , and in front of the porch . I hate them too , and no matter how often I pull them up , they grow right back . So I got medieval on them , and tortured them to death . The can sprays a white foam , in a tight radius . So you are not likely to get poison where you do n't want it . ( Do n't use it on a windy day tho . ) After you spray the plants , they wilt in about a day , and they 're desiccated in about two or three days . I deducted the product by one star , only because I had to spray some weeds twice . Maybe I overreacted , but the day after I used it , some weeds looked like they were dying , and others looked fine , so I gave those areas a second application . The can promises not to let weeds grow back for months . Hopefully that 's the case . There 's not a huge amount of product in the can , so do n't waste it on any weeds unless you hate them , and need them taken out permanently.UPDATEA month after I sprayed away the weeds , they grew right back . Altho I have to admit , I 'm not surprised , however , the can promises to keep weeds from reappearing . Well , they grow back in about 4-5 weeks . At least it does n't poison the ground permanently .	1
We only moved into the area about two years ago and friends and neighbors have been very generous in sharing their plants . However , when a plant has been dug up , often the tiny rootlets are disturbed and many of my transplants did n't make it.As a result , I have started using a tiny bit of this on the rooting area of the plant to encourage new growth , and I have been pleased with the success .	1
It is very difficult to write a review of something that to use takes a certain amount of time to see the advantages of . The first thing this has going for it is that it is Garden Safe and so I will not have to worry about dangerous chemicals as I begin to get ready for SpringThe bottle is a generous amount of rooting hormone that allows one to use cuttings to propagate from already existing plants and in some cases trees.The instructions are direct and simple and it is easy to just stick the cutting right into the wide mouth jar and then plunk my cutting right into the well drained soil . As it is a safe product I do not have and will not have to worry about runoff of hormones into the general water supply.I will update when I see some growth .	1
My mother in law had a major green thumb , and I 'd see her put a cutting straight into a pot and later see it turn into a lush plant . Not me . I am a plant killer who has a black thumb . Nothing grows for me . When I buy a plant it seems to wilt early , knowing it 's condition has become terminal just from arriving at my home.I 'd like to say I 've turned that around with this product , but it may be too early to tell . Vine rules require that we review the product with 30 days , and frankly , that 's not enough time to see if my cuttings are truly growing well or if it 's my imagination.I took cuttings of some various geraniums in my mom 's yard ( assured that these are the easiest to grow ) , as well as a piece of white jasmine . I cut the plant on an angle , got it wet , dipped it into this powder , then planted it into potting soil with a bit of miracle gro in it . I did n't keep the dirt completely wet , just damp . After a week , nothing seemed to grow , but it did n't die either . Into the second week , I pulled one out and saw definite white roots around the base . I only wanted to pull one out , not all , so I 've been observing the plants growing . I think they may all take , except the jasmine , which may not be growing because it seems to be pulling out of the ground ( the cutting was too long I think ) .I will update the review when I know for sure this has worked , but so far , I 've seen good rooting on the eight cuttings I 've done .	1
I do n't have a green thumb and it has been rumored that I have the ability to kill silk flowers . I agree my gardening abilities are subpar but most of that is attributable to little time and less interest . However , this year I am motivated to have a great garden.It is too early in my area to plant anything outside , so I experimented on cuttings from my mother 's houseplants . The process is easy , clip , dip and plant . So far the results have been good . Both the ivy and the jade plant cuttings rooted within a few days and are doing well . The product container is quite small but not much is used and importantly , it seems to work . Quick , easy and effective , this might just be how to turn my thumb green . Definitely a good way to get a jump on growing season . Recommended .	1
Rooting Hormone is a lot of fun , because it makes it easy to turn cuttings into plants . If you see a plant at a friend 's house that you 'd like , just take a cutting , and try rooting it ( rooting hormone works on most plants , but not all , in my own experience ) .The amount in this inexpensive little jar will treat maybe a few hundred+ cuttings , because you only need a small dip into the powder of a cut stem . A nice touch is the inner seal to keep it fresh until you first open it . If you know an avid gardener who does n't have this stuff , it would be a nice gift which will yield long-lasting pleasure .	1
I have used this product before , and rooting powder makes a huge different . Prepare your planting medium , in seedling packs or pots . Make a hole in the soil with pencil or stick . Cut an inch or two of your favorite plant , trim to half an inch below last leaf joint , trim leaves , dip first in water and then dip in rooting powder , tap extra off on the inside edge of the jar , place in prepared soil with hole , press around stem , water gently and well . Keep moist until you see new leaves emerging , which means roots are also gowing underground . Cuttings grow very quickly this way !	1
Shhhh , come here ... I should n't tell you this secret but ... You do n't have to buy plants to have more plants , you can take cuttings from your plants and make whole new plants from them . It saves a lot of time and after a couple you 'll be hooked with your new Jedi powers . Not every plant will do cuttings so you 'll have to do some research , but hey you are on the internet reading this so you know how . This container will go a long ways so no worries there . Just get one and add it to your Jedi Gardening Bag along with your Lightsaber Trowel . The Force will be strong with you !	1
This container does n't look like much , but you do n't need much to get the acid to work properly . Dip the root tip in this powder and place the cutting in the proper medium with the right moisture . This may vary depending on the plant . The cuttings may wilt at first , but do come back to life once the roots have been established . The secret is being patient and keeping the plant evenly hydrated . I 've used other rooting hormone products and this brand works as well as the competitors .	1
While rooting hormones are not absolutely necessary , they do give your cuttings a better chance of survival . And it is so easy to use . Just dip the cutting in the hormone powder and plant it into a pot . My cuttings do seem to do better when I use rooting hormone.This bottle is inexpensive and will last through a lot of cuttings .	1
I 've got a huge container garden ( going on 80 planters at the moment ) and one thing I do a tremendous amount of is propagating plants from cuttings . There are a variety of conditions that certain plant cuttings will do well in ( some like to root out in a jar of water , some like to be deeply anchored in moist potting soil , some like being gently poked into dry potting mix ) but almost EVEY cutting can considerably benefit from a light dusting of rooting hormone powder . It 's almost like an added insurance policy- it helps kick start the rooting process in any condition.The Garden Safe brand is good- they are all comparable , to be honest , but this is one of the brands of products I use around my garden quite regularly . The jar is TINY , but since you should only be using a little bit it should last you forever.I 've been using it on geranium and plumeria cuttings and had *crazy* good success with both ( roots and signs of new growth within a few days ) , even if the cuttings were not the cleanest or in the best shape . There was only one plumeria cutting that it did n't help but that one had been struggling for over a year and was just a few inches high ( thought I would try it , but too little , too late ) .This is a good boost for cuttings- I highly recommend it .	1
Rather than explain how I 've used indole-3-butyric acid ( and also misused it ) to help with rose plant rooting , I thought it best to make a general comparison . That this molecular compound ( IBA ) works when used correctly has been firmly established even if scientists do n't yet know how it works.For me the issue was how Garden Safe compares with Miracle Grow and Clonex.Brand IBA comparison : * Garden Safe - IBA content is .1 % and is a powder . Sold in 2 oz container . * Miracle Grow - IBA content is .1 % and is a powder . Sold in 1.25 ounce container . * Clonex - IBA content is .3 % and is a gel . Sold in 4.8 ounce container.Findings : Clonex , considering prices of all 3 brands , is by far the better purchase if the goal is to get more IBA/buck.Disclaimer : I 'm not in any way related to Clonex and the main issue is really making sure to use IBA correctly to get desired results .	1
We start our 1/4 acre vegetable garden in February in the green house . If we use rooting hormone , this is the one we buy . However , my brother has gotten so good at the process that he rarely uses any hormone any more . Plants will root fine without the hormone but the hormone helps the plant transition from water to soil ( or pearlite or sand as another reviewer recommends ) .If your situation calls for rooting hormone , this is the one to use .	1
This two ounce container of rooting hormone don & # 8217 ; t sound like much but it will go a long way . I only use a dusting when using it so it will probably last me for years . I recently used this rooting hormone to grow a new knockout rose from a clipping that I took from one of my huge ones out front . It was extremely simple to do and anyone can do it . I clipped a nice little section from my rose bush . I clipped it at an angle just below one of the little branches . Then I got the bottom of the clipping wet and dusted it with a light but even layer of this rooting hormone . After that I planted the clipping in potting soil . I watered it daily to keep the roots moist . About two weeks later I checked up on it and it had grown very nice looking roots on it . For the time being I am allowing it to continue growing in the potting soil and will plant it in my flower bed when I am sure it & # 8217 ; s not going to frost again . This rooting hormone seems to work very well to me .	1
In the winter when there is no gardening done outside , I like to baby my house plants and get new ones by taking cuttings from those I have already . The best root hormone is TAKEROOT made by Garden Safe . I can trade new starts with family and neighbors . All that is need is cut stem from existing plant , dip into TAKEROOT and start as many new plants as desired . All I have to do is cut a stem off an old plant and dip into the growth hormone and let it take effect growing little roots and producing a new plant . My TAKEROOT hormone rooting compound came from Amazon and you can get yours there also . Use the winter time to garden indoors with root hormone and multiply your plants without expensive buying of mature new plants . Test out your 'green thumb ' with this Garden Safe product ... you will be amazed ! !	1
We like to grow basil inside to have year round and I will often take a cut and start another plant , usually works fine to let it root in water or sometimes I will stick the cut right in the dirt and it will often root that way . So I tried the TakeRoot on a couple cuts and they both took root and seemed to do so faster than normal . Will update when we have had a chance to try it when the weather warms .	1
I 've learned over the years from my parents and fellow gardeners a simple way to grow favorite plants using cuttings and rooting hormone . This Garden Safe Take Root rooting hormone is in powder form and allows easy application to cuttings . Previously , we just cut the stems , stick them into potting soil , apply some plant food , and hope they 'll grow . Results varied . Most cuttings grew but took a month or two . Now we simply dispensed some of this rooting hormone into a small plastic container and dabbed the cut ends of rose stems into the powder , placed them in clear vases with our household filtered water , and small roots started to grow after five days . After the roots grew longer , we transferred them into potting soil . The only concerns are the product safety issues ( from the label and Garden Safe website ) : & # 34 ; There are ingestion , eye contact and inhalation hazards associated with this product & # 34 ; . We 're not taking any chances so we wear clear goggles , disposable face mask , and gloves when handling this product .	1
I was very interested in Garden Safe 's TakeRoot , not for vegetable plants , but rather to grow cuttings from house plants . There are no green thumbs in this house , but we have always enjoyed philodendrons and would like a few more . The main ingredient , indole-3-butyric acid ( IBA ) , is one commonly found in rooting compounds.TakeRoot is very easy to use , but care must be taken to keep it away from any food products , pets , children , etc . This is n't a large container , but it should go a long way . The net weight is only two ounces ( 56.6 g ) and the container itself is only three inches high . Easy to use with excellent results . We 're looking forward to starting a few more plants this year from the one we already are enjoying.DIRECTIONS ( from the label ) :1 . The cut ends of the cutting should be slightly moistened before treatment.2 . Stir cut ends in Garden Safe Brand TakeRoot Rooting Hormone powder.3 . Remove excess powder by tapping on rim of container.4 . Plant treated cuttings in a rooting medium such as potting soil . Mist regularly.INGREDIENTS : Active Ingredients : Indole-3-Butyric Acid ( 00.01 % ) Inactive Ingredients : Other Ingredients ( 99.9 % ) GARDEN SAFE : Garden Safe 24-Ounce Insecticidal Soap Insect Killer Ready To Use SprayGarden Safe 24-Ounce Fungicide3 Insecticide/Fungicide/Miticide Ready to Use SprayGarden Safe Neem Oil , 16-OunceGarden Safe 24-Ounce Houseplant and Garden Insect Killer SprayGarden Safe Slug and Snail Bait , 2-PoundGarden Safe 20-Ounce Fungicide3 ConcentrateGarden Safe Crawling Insect Killer containing Diatomaceous Earth , 4-PoundsGarden Safe 93065 Weed and Grass Killer , 24-Ounce SprayGarden Safe Tomato and Vegetable Organic Plant Food 4-6-4 , 6-PoundGarden Safe Rose and Flower Insect Killer	1
I 've done gardening outdoors off and on for years , but I have to admit this is the first time I 've ever used a rooting hormone . Considering you only use a light dusting for each cutting , the jar seems quite amply sized . I do n't know how long this stuff stays potent before it stops working as well , but I expect I wo n't be able to use up all of it before that happens.I started rooting a Wandering Jew cutting and a Pothos . Both of those root pretty easily all by themselves , of course , but it does seem that they are moving along a little more quickly . ( To be honest , I do n't want to fail at this my first time . Call me chicken . ) I 'm using a clean eyeshadow brush to lift up the powder after I 've shaken a little into a saucer , then dusting the cuttings with that . A Q-tip works almost as well and is disposable . ( I 'm just nervous about contamination after my experience with spreading plant diseases all over my garden , so I 'm not going to be dipping any wet cuttings into the jar per the instructions . ) It 's a new experience trying to root cuttings for the garden , and like any new gardening skill it has to be learned and practiced . The price is right on this Garden Safe Take Root product , so why not play with it ? It costs about what ONE purchased veggie plant costs , and the potential savings is considerable . Think of all those mid-summer new tomato starts !	1
Given the right conditions and enough patience , cuttings can be rooted without the aid of rooting hormone products , but the adding them improves the odds.I 've rooted rose cuttings by simply poking them into the soil , but only a few out of many cuttings actually root and live.I often root suckers from my tomato plants to create more plants for a later crop . I can usually root them in water indoors , but being able to root them where I want the plant to grow would save time and trouble.Being able to propagate shrubs and perennials from cuttings will save time and money.This jar should last for a very long time .	1
This worked well ... clippings took in about 3 days ... really impressed how easy it was to use ... this jar will last for a full planting season	1
This is a small container of rooting hormone suitable for home gardeners . The active ingredient is indole-3-butyric acid ( 0.1 % ) , which is a very commonly used rooting hormone for both commercial and home gardeners . According to the instructions , you simply moisten the ends of your cuttings slightly , dip them in the Take Root powder , plant them in potting soil , and mist regularly until you see signs of growth . While indole-3-butryic acid is a common gardening aid , it is toxic ; it can cause skin , eye , and breathing irritation . If swallowed , you need to contact a poison center immediately . Surprisingly , for such a potential toxin , this little jar does not come with a child-safe lid , so you really do need to take precautions to make sure that it does not fall into the hands of inquisitive small children.I 've wanted to try rooting some of my own cuttings for some time , so I was delighted to find this product and give it a try . The label recommends it for African violets , roses , poinsettias , philodendrons , geraniums , coleus , woody ornamentals and & # 34 ; most other popular home , garden and greenhouse varieties. & # 34 ; I took some cuttings from 5 houseplants : a lime , an orange , rosemary , gardenia , and heliotrope . I followed the instructions , moistening each cutting , then dipping it in the Take Root powder before placing it in moist potting soil . I misted my cuttings 3-4 times per times a day . Four of the cuttings slowly died over the next 2 weeks . After 3 weeks , the heliotrope is n't dead yet ; it still has 2 tiny leaves hanging in there , so maybe it will pull through . I did a post-mortem on the dead cuttings and found some residual rooting powder , but no signs of roots . In general , you ca n't expect 100 % success when rooting cuttings . Perhaps they will work , perhaps they wo n't , but rooting hormone is supposed to both increase your chances of success and speed the process along . After my very low success rate with my initial trials with Take Root , I did some more research and found that I should have made sure my cuttings were taken at a node . I should also have removed all but a few top leaves to improve chances of success.In any case , after 3 weeks , I ca n't really say that I 've had any success with Take Root . It probably works as well as any similar product based on indole-3-butryic acid , but I personally have n't had any luck yet . If you are fairly skilled at growing plants from cuttings , this product will probably work fine for you . If you have n't started plants from cuttings before , be aware that you will need some experience and luck to get this , or any similar product , to work .	1
Garden safe take root rooting hormone is an excellent product ! I have never used a rooting hormone before and have not had too many failures , but this product makes the job easier , the cuttings root more quickly and it is not as risky . I now feel more confident that I will get more plants.It hurts if you lose even a few plants so I am glad I tried this.I think its great and I recommend you try it .	1
TOOK SOME CUTTINGS OFF MY CHOCOLATE MINT . DIPPED THEM IN THE ROOTING COMPOUND . HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO SEE HOW THIS PRODUCT PERFORMED .	1
If you have purchased a packet or jar of rooting hormone in the past , and used it to start slips of plants you 've cut from the garden , then you know what to expect from this . You open it up , dip your stem into the powder , and plunk the stem into your potting mix . It seems to work pretty much the same as any other rooting hormone and is n't any more or any less effective.Overall , this is a product that works exactly as I would anticipate looking at the label . There are no surprises , which is a good thing when you 're buying a functional product such as this .	1
I 've been using rooting hormone for at least the last 25 years . And all the brands seem to work equally well . They even have all come in about the same size container.Rooting hormone stimulates the plant 's natural ability to produce roots . Most plants can be propagated without rooting hormones , but it can require a tedious process and lots more time . Of course , there are exceptions ; in my yard , I 'm constantly trimming geranium , and I just poke the cuttings in the ground , where they take root on their own . For other plants , using the hormone increases chances of success ; it also increases the volume of roots , which starts the plant on a strong foundation.Here 's my typical procedure:1 . Choose the type of plant that requires and/or is receptive to rooting hormone ; this can easily be found by searching online for tips on using rooting hormone or on propagating whatever plant you have in mind.2 . Start with a freshly cut stem.3 . Spoon a bit of the hormone into a clean dish or cup . ( This helps avoid contamination from dipping the plant into the container. ) 4 . if the tip of the plant is dry , moisten it with a dip into clean water.5 . Place the tip of the cutting into the rooting hormone about 1/2 inch ( or according to the label ; some plants will need only the tip exposed to the rooting hormone ) . Tap the plant to loose extraneous hormone powder . No need to over-apply.There are various options after this -- putting the stem in soil , sand , or other medium . It will largely depend on the type of plant you are attempting to propagate.Happy Gardening !	1
Garden Safe 's Take Root rooting hormone two once bottle is the perfect size for the home gardener . This product should help home gardeners put down roots on any cuttings from their own garden plants or from plants shared from their friends . Directions are clear and in a short time the buyer will be propagating plants in time for spring .	1
This product works well and allows me to root some of my favorite plants from cuttings to give to friends . To use this product , you take your fresh cutting , dip it in a little water to moisten it , then dip in this container to lightly coat with the root hormone , then put in a pot with pearlite and keep moist but not overly watered . Do not allow it to dry out.This works like a charm and because a & # 34 ; dab will do you & # 34 ; this container should last you many seasons . Happy gardening !	1
I 've used Garden safe rooting hormone with Coleus , Sedums , Impatiens , Fuchia , Vinca vines , Mums , Hydrangeas ( yes , I do stick to the easy plants ) This is a very good price and this container will last a long time .	1
Part of the magic of the Garden Safe Rooting Hormone is how easy it is to use . There is no measuring or mixing . You just dip the cut tip of your cutting in the rooting hormone and then plant it.We used this to plant a long rows of trees on our farm . We wanted to plant an old heirloom tree that we could n't find at any nursery . When our neighbor 's tree sent up shoots we cut them to replant . We planted about 50 starts . We needed 2 1/2 jars to do all the trees but I was much too liberal with the first trees .	1
I dipped my coleus cutting tip in the hormone and it took root pretty fast as compared to growing roots in water . So , there is a benefit to this product .	1
As long as you do n't get it wet or forget to tighten the cover . If you keep debris out of the powder it does n't really go bad . Once you get too much junk in it , it gets hard for the powder to adhere.I like Garden Safe products , so when I saw it recommended here , I chose this brand . They all work pretty much the same and use the same active ingredients.For the most part , I use this for woody cuttings -- about 4 '' long . Cut the sticks cleanly and after dipping in this powder , stick them at an angle into a potting mix ( not much soil/dirt in the mix ) . My best advice is to rely on this very enlightening bookPlant Propagation : Principles and Practicesto determine which plants are conducive to this kind of propagating . I bought the Fifth Edition when it was new . Now they are up to the Eighth Edition . Buy the 8th and it is over $ 100 ; buy the 5th and it is less than $ 10 . There are several editions available on Amazon , and the older ones provide plenty of good info .	1
In the past I 've tried the liquid gel type which claims to be easier to use and better yielding yet frankly , I had nothing but negative results . Although this does require some experimenting to see what works best , I like the powder form better as it seems less messy and goes a lot further . This comes in a small container but provides a big bang for the buck - more than ample for most gardeners .	1
This rooting hormone powder is easy to apply and will help stimulate the natural rooting mechanism in plants . It wo n't replace knowing which is the best way to plant and nurture a cutting of the type of plant you are working with , yet it will increase your success if you are already doing things properly . For anyone who likes to propagate plants using cuttings these hormones are an excellent aid - you will see your plants doing more rooting than rotting , which is the goal for any gardener , pro or amateur .	1
I 've been using various rooting hormones ( both powder and gel ) for years and they work incredibly well , particularly with softer stemmed plants . The process is very simple , you just take a cutting ( I try to get cuttings that are healthy and at least 3-inches or so long ) and then pinch off any excess leave ( if there are any ) and dip each cutting into the rooting hormone . Then you simply create a hole ( I use a pencil ) in a small tray or pot of rooting medium or starting soil and set the cutting into the hole and then compact the soil around the stem . If you cut the cuttings first and have the pots ( or a big tray ) ready , you can do dozens in just a few minutes.I ca n't really verify how well this product ultimately works yet because it 's going to take a few weeks for my cuttings to take root , but it 's been fun trying to root different houseplants . There is more than enough hormone powder in this size jar to do probably hundreds of cuttings , too . It generally takes from about two weeks to several weeks for a cutting to root , depending on the type of plant . In previous seasons I 've created dozens of free geraniums using cuttings and rooting hormone and they have all survived . I also just tried ( with this powder ) to start 10 Christmas cactus cuttings , so we 'll see how they do.I have also used rooting gel in the past and it works very well ( perhaps a slight bit better ) , but it 's more expensive . The powder works just fine -- provided you keep the soil moist . I also mist them so that the cuttings take in some moisture from the leaves.Because cuttings need to be dampened before they are dipped and I do n't want to get moisture into the jar , what I do is to dump some of the powder out of the container into a small plastic dish and do the dipping there . Once I can see that the leftover powder is dry I dump it back into the original container . By the way , price-wise , this is pretty inexpensive as rooting hormone goes.I 'll update this review in a few weeks when I see what percentage of cuttings take root , but I 'm sure it will be very high . Again , it really depends a great deal on the type of plant and keeping the soil damp and in good indirect light . Nothing is as much fun as getting free plants !	1
Rooting hormones are a product that has been around for years - I remember my dad using it when I was a kid . I wanted to take a few cuttings of a rosemary plant , which are pretty easy to root . I only did 4 cuttings so I did n't make this into a full-fledged experiment , but I used the rooting hormone on 2 of them and left the other two plain . I only used regular potting soil ( someone else here mentioned sand - I 'll have to try that another time ) . All rooted within a month but the cuttings dipped in the hormone powder seemed to have a bit more roots . Definitely not scientific , but it looks good enough for me .	1
I got some Bontone Rooting Powder at Home Depot and then I got this Garden Safe and I figured I 'd try them side by side and see how they measure up . First off , the active ingredient is the same and in the same proportion in both products . The rest of what 's in there is 99.9 % & # 34 ; other & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; inert & # 34 ; ingredient . What that is , I do n't know ... but I 'd guess it 's the same in both of them.Both products did equally well at getting my jasmine cuttings to root , and I did n't actually get my & # 34 ; control & # 34 ; cutting , the one without any rooting powder , to root . Probably someone with a greener thumb than me could coax it into action without the hormone , but why would they when this stuff is so inexpensive and lasts forever ? Speaking of lasting forever , this container is 2 oz and the Bontone is 1.25 oz , and the Bontone tends to be more expensive ... so this one is definitely the better deal , but it will probably take you years to realize those savings . The real savings are in not having to buy so many plants ... buy one and propagate it !	1
I 've used this hormone for rooting cuttings and it does the job . The roots come out sooner and more vigorous . It does n't work on 100 % of the cuttings , but there 's probably other variables involved for the failures .	1
The tiny amount of the active ingredient is the growth hormone . I believe it does work , but is not a 100 % guarantee , either . The effectiveness seems to vary by species of plant , too . Much of this rooting work , from cuttings , seems to become more of an art in the hands of the person doing it . The other factors of temperature , light , and moisture weigh heavily , too.In addition to the method that is described on the container , I have had good results by placing the stems to be rooted into a water bath ( changed daily ) , after the initial dry exposure to this rooting compound . Good luck !	1
I successfully used this to grow lavender and various vines from clippings . I like to store the clippings in the garage with a garbage bag over them . The bag helps keep the soil moist and the garage is nice and warm .	1
I am very happy with my TakeRoot . This applies easily to my clippings , which I simply touch to water , dip in the powder , and do one light tap to knock off any excess before propping up in potting soil . The roses seem to take to it quite well.Take note to avoid inhaling , or otherwise making direct contact with this stuff ; not that you 'll grow roots from your fingertips , but the active ingredients are not something that should be absorbed into the bloodstream.This two ounce jar is likely to last for quite some time . For those who love to grow from clippings , Garden Safe TakeRoot is an affordable and effective choice .	1
I 've got a couple of rosebushes in the backyard that are absolutely stunning . I 've tried propagating from cuttings in the past , following a variety of methods I 've found online . I generally have ended up with hardened sticks stuck in the dirt or with rotted branches . This product , however , has actually enabled me some success with propagating . The directions are easy to follow , and there are actual roots growing from the cuttings I took from my rosebushes . Now only time will tell if I can take from here and nurture them into new bushes .	1
I 've used this brand and the Schultz brand of rooting hormone with good results . I have the best results when I use cutting from new growth early in the season.For good results you should have very clean cutting tools ( sterilized with bleach or rubbing alcohol ) , fresh perlite or a & # 34 ; light & # 34 ; potting soil & a sterilized container.I cut a bunch of fresh growth woody stems then I take them back to my work area and I cut them to about 8 & # 34 ; long near a & # 34 ; node & # 34 ; , remove all the leaves but one , make sure the cut end is cut at an angle , wet the stems & then dip them in the rooting compound & then push into the perlite or potting soil . You can put them very close together - 1 & # 34 ; or so apart . I always cut several more than I need because they wo n't all survive . If you get lucky & they all grow , you 'll have plants to share.Keep out of sunlight & keep moist but not too wet or they will rot . It may take a couple weeks ( depends on the plant ) but I check them by VERY gently pulling on a stem to see if roots are growing . If there is a bit of tension when you pull , you probably have roots . Try not to pull them all the way out or you 'll break the tender growth.The cuttings usually spend a couple months in the pot & then I separate them & plant them in 4-6 & # 34 ; pots . You could even plant them in the ground in a very protected area where you can keep watch over them for another season . I sometimes put them in a small corner in my garden so they can grow undisturbed until they are big enough to move.It all depends on the type of plant you are propagating . If it 's an easy woody plant to grow , it will probably be easy to root from cuttings . I 've had really good luck ( plenty to give away ) with Limelight Hydrangea , varieties of Ninebark & Forsythia .	1
For years I 've been using cinnamon to root my plants . This year , I tried out Garden Safe Rooting Hormone and wow - this stuff works wonders ! While cinnamon works well , I had a higher success rate using the rooting hormone . You only need a small amount of rooting hormone for it to be effective - this bottle will last quite a long time ! Be sure to keep your new plants well watered ! Highly recommended !	1
Works like a charm . I now have Figs and my Rose of Sharon rooting from using this power . Very , very simple to use also . Simply make a fresh cut on your cuttings , dip the cut into water and then into the rooting hormone . Some folks recommend pearlite , but I go directly into potting soil with the treated cutting . It works for me.Since you use so little of this product , this container should allow you to produce cuttings of your favorite plants for yourself , family and friends . I can highly recommend this product .	1
Being winter , I 've only got to try this with a few houseplants but they rooted quickly and easily.My method is maybe a bit different from some other folks - I typically look for new growth on plants , strip off the bottom leaves , then stick it in my mouth . Then I dip it in the rooting hormone . I take my index finger to make a hole in the dirt , and put the end with the powder stuck to it down then cover it up , keep it moist , and usually my plants take right off . Yep , I use spit . Works great for me.I have used pond water on poisonous plants . I do n't root plants with tap water . I would say about 80 % of mine take off . Woody plants can be harder to root , but if you will wait until they put out new growth , and take your cutting from the new growth , they are a lot easier to root . Some plants need the wood cut a certain way - you can look that all up on the web.1 jar this size lasts me about 1 season , and I do a lot of propagation .	1
If you want to take plant cuttings and have them grow successfully , rooting hormone is a must . A little goes a long way , so do n't overdo the use . I 've tried several , and think that they all work well . However , this is probably the best buy for the money that I have found .	1
I have always used a differen ( more expensive ) brand of rooting hormone compound with my Bonsai trees . Thi Garden Safe Product is indistignghuishable from the more expensive brands .	1
Taking cuttings from houseplants and overwintered annuals is an inexpensive and easy way for me to create plants for my spring garden . Using rooting hormone makes this process a lot easier than trying to root plants in water . Sure , some plants love water - like vines and spider plants - and sprout roots in days , but for most other plants I would lose half of them to rotting before there were enough roots to put them in soil.I used the TakeRoot Rooting Hormone on cuttings from a favorite Geranium and a red Angel Wing Begonia . I made a sharp cut , wet the stems , dipped each into a small cap-full of hormone and put the cutting in potting soil . I find cuttings root better using small pots , about 2 & # 34 ; x 2 & # 34 ; . I kept them towards the back of my garden window away from full sun but still receiving lots of daylight . The hormone worked and the plants are ready for larger pots.At only 2 oz , this looks like a small container , but a little goes a long way . It is the perfect size for my home garden and should last all season as I continue to take cuttings from additional plants throughout the summer .	1
I 've used both this brand and the Shultz brand of rooting hormone for many years . I 've had good success with both brands , and a few failures ( mainly due to not keeping the medium at the right level of moisture ) . I was pleased to receive this jar from the Vine program , just in time for starting my garden indoors ( we move all the plants outdoors once risk of frost is passed ) .I tried rooting a cutting from my favorite Jerusalem cherry plant , and in just a few days it had put out rootlets and was thriving . I used this hormone in a small vase of water and was able to get a rose cutting to sprout within a week . I have a cutting from a jade plant started right now , and it 's also showing tiny roots . This is a great product and will give your cuttings a great start !	1
Using plant cuttings is a great way to expand your garden . A lot of human error is the result of failed plant cuttings ( i.e . : insufficient or over abundance of heat , light , and/or moisture ) . A rooting hormone , although not necessary , can help stimulate root growth and this product works as well as any other that I 've used.For best results , first , select only cuttings from healthy plants ( very important - odds are that diseased/damaged cuttings will not root and you risk contaminating your rooting hormone which could pass disease along to other plants ) . The growing tip should be between 2 - 8 inches long . The cutting should be taken near a node and all leaves and flowers should be removed from the node ( if you do n't know what a node is - Google it , it 's much easier to & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; a node rather than to try to understand a written description of it ) . If you are attempting to root a hard-wood cutting , lightly score the cutting before applying the rooting hormone.Moisten the cutting lightly and dip the cutting into the powder . A little bit of rooting hormone goes a long way - the cutting should be dipped only slightly higher than the planting depth and excess powder shaken off by lightly tapping the cutting against the edge of the container.Plant the cutting in a high-quality potting medium . Make sure the planting hole is wide enough that the rooting hormone is not rubbed off as you push the cutting into the soil.Gently tamp down the soil around the cutting to remove air pockets . Keep the cutting warm , moist , and do not place it in direct sunlight . The length of time for a cutting to & # 34 ; root & # 34 ; varies based upon what type of plant you are working with ( when in doubt - Google your plant type with the words cutting and root growth rate ) .This product is called & # 34 ; Garden Safe & # 34 ; but it 's still a chemical so do n't get it in your eyes , do n't inhale the powder , and do n't ingest it . Do keep it out of reach of children , do wash your hands after use , and do keep the lid on tightly and store it in a cool/dry location.The product is in a 2 ounce container - that is MORE than enough product . Although there is technically no & # 34 ; shelf life & # 34 ; identified anywhere on the container - I would recommend replacing it ever year or two to ensure freshness.Happy Gardening !	1
it 's a little early to review this product because of the time of year , but I used it on several slips I had growing roots . I planted those slips in soil after using Take Root and they are still alive and doing well . That 's a good sign . As the season for planting progresses , I 'll report back .	1
I had the hardest time getting a cutting from my Money Tree ( Pachira aquatica ) to take root . I tried just putting it in potting soil after cutting it but that would n't root it and then I left a cutting in water for months and could hardly get a root . This time I tried rolling the cutting in Take Root and put it directly in the soil and I can tell you that it is n't dying like the others . I have n't had it long enough to give you a full report but I ca n't complain about the convenience ! One thing to note is that there are clear warnings that this stuff could hurt your eyes or skin so it may be easy to use , but do take precautions around children .	1
There 's something really cool about multiplying special trees . Like , the & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; olive trees in the far north of Jordan must produce the best oil - and best kept secret - that the world has to offer . You just ca n't replicate this with the commercial hybrid trees they irrigate in the desert.Anyway , as I am no expert on breeding new trees from old , I 'm happy to gain an edge with this rooting hormone . From what I understand , this powdered form should take much easier than other forms on the market . I 'm happy to have this edge , and also hope to multiply my fig tree for my parents .	1
I 've been biting at the bit to get to the place where it is time to plant.This has been a great tool in getting some rooting started inside to plant as it warms up.I had not tried rooting for many years so I did a bit of internet research to aid in this task ( Unless your familiar with rooting I 'd highly recommend this step ) While it is an evolving process so far I 've been please with the results.I have been attempting to root twice as many pants as I eventually want to have as not all rooting ( even with hormones ) occur . -- so far the success rate has been good .	1
We like to grow vegetables inside when its cold . Its fun for the kids and it ensures we have fresh veggies on hand.As with any plant when you 've got one you really like or just want to grow more and not wait for seeds you clone it . This product worked great for the assortment of veggies and fruit that we tried it on . In little to no time at all we were in business with roots all over the place.So if its a house plant , a flower , fruit or veggie and you want to clone it then pick up some of this stuff you 'll be glad you did .	1
I like house plants . I have maybe 30 or so at this time . Probably half of the plants I have are Christmas cactus ( schlumberga russelliana mostly ) and while they are pretty foliage wise through out the entire year , the shorter days towards November and December cause them to flower , thereby giving these plants the common name of Christmas cactus.and they will come back every year , provided you keep them in natural sunlight until the buds set on them . ( No indirect light at night , it will mess up the blooming time . ) Christmas cacti are fairly fragile when you repot them or move them , Sometimes there are loose segments that you can grow into a new plant . A good Christmas present is easy to make from the loose segments and the Take Root Rooting Hormone.Now you do n't absolutely _need_ the Take Root Rooting Hormone . You can put the little segments in a cup of water and they will take a few weeks to root providing they do n't rot . You could stick them in dirt and they will probably root if they do n't dry out . Either of these strategies will take quite a few weeks to see it the segments actually do root.If you take a segment of a Christmas cactus and put the tiniest bit of the Take Root rooting hormone on the open stem and place it in dirt ( and keep the dirt just a little damp ) , the segment will root much quicker and grow stronger than if you just use the water or dirt method . You can cut segments , dust them with the rooting hormone and quickly have a thriving pot of Christmas cacti , If you want to make sure you have tem ready for a Christmas gift , you must root them at least 6 months prior to December to ensure bloom , This time will allow the plants to become well established.Of course , you can use the rooting hormone for any plant you want to . I use it when transplanting plants into the garden . It helps the new plants to be established quickly.I recommend Taking Root Rooting Hormone highly to any one who has house plants or outside plants . It gives you the opportunity to increase your plants quickly at a minimum cost . And as any gardener knows , that is terrific , _enjoy_	1
I 've been in the Green Industry my entire life ( 50+ years ) and have used rooting compounds to propagate 100 's of thousands of cuttings , both professionally and personal use . Normally , I 've used Rootone brand but it 's getting harder and harder to find , for reason 's unknown to me.Within 3 days of making cuttings from 4 Christmas cactus and 6 African Violets , I have 100 % success with rooting . I did NOT use any extraordinary measures such as a greenhouse or heated rooting mat : just cut , dip , insert in soilless mix and viola ! , roots ! For the average gardener , this container will last you for years of use . I plan on using it this Summer to make cuttings of all my favourite coleus plants before Winter grabs them and takes them away.Bottom Line : Inexpensive , highly effective . Every serious gardener should have this in their kit bag . : D	1
I am a very poor gardener , so my lack of skill is a real test for this product . I figured that woody cuttings are harder to grow ( in general ) than softer stems like geraniums . So , my test included a few pieces of miniature ivy , a couple pieces of rosemary , and another flowering plant whose name escapes me now . Actually , that should tell you what kind of inattentive gardener I am . : - ) In any case , the Ivy and rosemary grew and rooted after a week or so . The unremembered plant did not do so well . I really wanted the rosemary to grow , so I guess it 's all working out fine so far.A couple of hints for those of you who are inexperienced gardeners like myself:1 . The instructions say to keep the leave moist by misting them at least once a day.2 . Keep the soil very damp until the new plants become very robust.3 . Rooting hormone is dangerous to breath , so please wear a dust mask when prepping.Now , I 'm off to see what else I can root . Hmmm , I have these 2x4s in the garage & # 8230 ;	1
I like this rooting hormone very well . It 's easy to use and it 's the best way to do regularly successful cuttings . Because it only takes a tiny amount , this one jar will help me give friends cuttings from my perennials for their own gardens and to expand my own gardens.Recommend for anyone who gardens and wants to do more with cuttings .	1
This is the same stuff that used to be called Shultz TakeRoot . It 's very easy to use , simply dip the end of your cutting in the powder , shake off excess , and put it in a hole in your potting soil . A chopstick makes a perfect hole . Next , keep it damp by misting , not watering , until you have roots.After having air cleaning plants in pots for years , I 've decided to do something a bit more dramatic by starting an indoor Living Wall.This product is key with such an undertaking.The cuttings are fast growing English Ivy ( hedera helix ) , that will be trained up a wire grid . Nothing exotic , but I think it will be quite nice when the ivy grows , and will be a bit more unique than the usual pot or hanging basket .	1
My mother recently gave me a plant that I almost killed , and I was afraid to tell her . I 've always had a black thumb , but I promised her I would take care of it . Neither of us know what it is , she bought it somewhere without a tag , and it 's beautiful . This little jar of rooting hormone came just in time . I followed the directions on the label and was able to root a few sprigs from what was left of the dying plant . It worked much quicker than I anticipated . I was able to see the result and it gave me hope that I 'm not doomed to kill every plant that comes through my door . The jar is very small , but a tiny bit goes a long way .	1
My dad is really into plants and has a beautiful collection both inside and outside of his home . A few weeks ago I took some filled pots up to his house and collected 3 clippings from some different plants that I really liked and wanted to try growing . So far this seems to be working well . There 's definitely been some noticeable growth and the clippings are looking nice and healthy.I found it extremely easy to do and I think the amount that you get is more than adequate . It 'll last a really long time and allow for tons of new plants . I ca n't wait to collect some new clippings from other people and give clippings to people that like some of our plants.I think this Rooting Hormone works quite well and I would highly recommend giving it a try .	1
I had a container of Schultz Take root , which has an active ingredient of Indole-3-butyric acid and it turns out that this is a newer version ( with a greener looking label ) . Indole-3-butyric acid is a synthetic version of Indole acetic acid which is found in plants and helps with cell division . The rest of this product is probably some form of talc , to ease application . I did read an article designed for commercial growers stating that liquid formulations are more effective , but only when mixed correctly and applied in a manner that does not cause cross contamination and should be remixed each time . Therefore , the suggestion was that for overall powder was more cost effective , but one should be careful when inserting into the growing medium ( soil ) to make a hole so that the powder is not all rubbed off as you insert it into the soil.Apparently different plants need different amounts ( or not at all ) rooting hormone . You can find this article by googling gpnmag and rooting hormones.Two ounces will last you a long , long time . This is a great way to build up your plant collection from plants you already own or ask your neighbor for a cutting of that rose you admire so much . My local library let me take some cuttings from a vine I admired ( which they were trimming ) which I rooted using rooting hormone . I later saw the same vine at a nursery for fifteen bucks . For the cost of one plant for the jar you can make hundreds of cuttings .	1
I 've used other , more expensive brands in the past but this seems to work just as well.It really is nice to be able to vet a clone of a favorite plant by getting a cutting to take root.From all of the other positive reviews besides mine it seems this is easy to use for anybody even if they have never done much gardening or growing before.Here 's to Happy Growing for your plants too .	1
It ` s still too early to have a solid verdict about the product ` s overall efficacy . But the geranium roots that usually rot when I try to grow plants from cuttings did not rot after being dipped in this stuff . Will they actually take root and grow ? Stay tuned ...	1
Read the instructions on this before using.Then prepare yourself . The product exits the can at high speed , in a large volume , and does fly a long way . The label claims 29 feet ; I did n't measure , but easily reached a nest at the top corner of s 2nd story window.The victims mostly drop immediately . If the nest has a large population , some may draw a bead on the operator , so be prepared to get out of dodge.With a member of our household severely allergic to stings , this is a must have for us to keep the stinger deliver vehicles at bay.Select with confidence ... use with care .	1
Each spring , we have about 4 to 5 wasp nests show up in the same places . We 've learned over time to take care of them quickly rather than wait . This product has worked great . It kills on contact . ( Which , I know this may sound weird..I do n't want the little guys to suffer . Their just doing what they were born to do ) I have n't tested the 29 ft spray because we 've been able to get about 15 away and feel safe about the situation . I also really enjoy the trigger spray rather than a top button . Careful though , it 's a fairly strong spray so be ready for it ! Another thing is that we own animals , and these ingredients claim to be fairly safe . Our animal kiddos are indoors , so I just kept them in a little longer after use rather than test that theory.Only con ... it 's decent priced online , but I 'm use to paying 6 to 8 in store .	1
I love summer ! ! I love the warm weather , having cook-outs and friends over for beer and crabs on my deck , and I even enjoy opening the shed up and getting out the lawn and garden equipment . The only thing I do n't like about the warm weather are the stinging insects that seem to prefer taking up residence in my shed , under the decking and along the gutters.I always pick up a can of Black Flag Wasp spray at the beginning of every season because nothing ruins a nice summer day than having a bunch of angry hornets buzzing your patio or deck . This spray allows you to saturate and destroy nests from a safe distance as well , so there 's no need to get out the ladder and risk getting stung when clearing out these pests . Simply saturate the nest , give the Black Flag time to work , and come back and knock the now dead nest down with a broom . Quick , easy and safe !	1
Best product I have found for killing annoying insects like wasps , bees , hornets , etc.Nice strong spray stream so you do n't have to be too close to hit the target . Quickly kills any insects it gets on and drives the rest off.Great product .	1
Now that the temperature here in northern Georgia has gotten into the 70 's the wasps and hornets are making their presence known . As I was opening the garage door to step outside a wasp landed on the edge of the garage door . It stayed there flapping its wings and glaring at me . I had the Black Flag sitting on a shelf about half way into the garage . I eased over to the shelf an with as little amount of movement as possible . I shook the can quickly and pulled the trigger . The spray traveled about 15 feet and hit the wasp . Kerplunk , down on the driveway landed the wasp . Dead as can be.I have used Black Flag brand spray every time I needed to make a wasp or hornet kill . This version is no exception to the past versions in its effectiveness.I noticed in the reviews by others that they were successful in ridding ants with this spray . I have fire ants galore that hide in winter but are active when the temperature starts to rise . I will give them a taste of this Black Flag spray .	1
I am not trying to trivialize the need to apply proper safety practices with this stuff.Although it is more or less safe for humans and pets , I sure as heck would avoid getting it on you or accidentally dripping onto child surfaces or pets . On the other hand , this stuff shoots nearly 30 feet and drops the little buggars right out of the sky . It kills them instantly and they stay dead . They say to wait until the cool of the evening or the early morning to spray , as more of the insects are in the nest and the cooler temperatures make them less agressive . This stuff works .	1
I am not big on using bug spray , but I do n't want wasp nests around my doors and garage . This product safely lets you get at the wasp nests from a safe distance . The strong stream that it shots allows you to hit just the wasp nest . It is handy to use and I feel better having some around . With the problems honey bees have been having in recent years I am sensitive about pesticides and I feel good about this product .	1
Wasps find me . No matter where I am , at home or at a vacation house , wasps know where I am and purposely build nests where I 'm likely to be.After one close encounter , I swore I 'd never , ever put up with another wasp nest again , even if it meant I 'd have to get a flame thrower and set the house on fire from where they were freeloading ( in the kitchen fan vent . Just try and turn THAT on with a wasp nest ! ) I love Black Flag . Aim , shoot , and celebrate dead wasps . Then get the husband to pry the darned thing OUT of the kitchen fan ! You WANT this on hand . Stock up now , before the wasps get you .	1
We have a real problem with wasps in our area every summer . They usually arrive in the late spring to build their nests and make life miserable for everyone . They 're very territorial and will even attack the honey bees and humming birds we like to attract to our yard . They build their honeycombed nests in the shady areas up under the eaves of our home . We have a large canvas umbrella over the table on our patio that they love to build under , too . One summer I even found an entire village of nests tucked up under the edges of our skylight . They are pests.I usually swab the aluminum soffits under the roof eaves with insecticide in the spring where the wasps usually gather and again later in the summer . It 's one of those chores like clean the gutters that is n't pleasant but has to be done . Well , this year I decided to try the Black Flag Wasp , Hornet & Yellow Jacket Killer , primarily because they claimed it has a jet spray ( up to 29 feet ) that makes application a safer ordeal . This could be very helpful because if I enter an active `` wasp zone '' near a nest it was very likely I would be chased around the backyard for a while.Black Flag has been making insecticides longer than any other company in the U.S. ( over 130 years ! ) so they have the experience I needed to help me kill the pesky insects around my home ; and their money-back guarantee was something I was looking for , too . There are five claims printed on the can that I wanted to put to the test:1 . `` Up to 29-foot Jet Spray. '' 2 . `` Eliminates the Nest. '' 3 . `` Kills on Contact. '' 4 . `` No Oily Residue. '' 5 . `` Long Lasting . `` Using insecticides is not child 's play and so taking common sense precautions is important . I always cover any exposed skin and use rubber gloves as well as goggles and a painter 's face mask when spraying a poisonous substance ; spraying on windless days is important , too . There are very specific directions for use printed on the can , along with precautionary statements and important storage & disposal information.One of my concerns about the trigger sprayer was how easy it is to shoot accurately over a long distance without missing my target , dousing unintended areas of my home and wasting insecticide . So , being a well-known invader to the wasp communities around our home I decided wait until near dusk when the wasp activity was at its lowest level and then moved as close to my intended target as I thought was reasonably safe and then moving backward once I 'd zeroed in on my target . That was pretty easy to do and I quickly discovered this product has a STRONG jet spray . It did n't take but a couple of seconds to cover nest with foamy lather . I did n't measure the stream but it was long . As expected , there was a noticeable odor that lingers in the air for a short time after spraying.As far as eliminating the nest and killing on contact this product did knock over half of the nests down , but there was some wasp activity in and around the nests after the initial spraying . I decided to leave the application at one burst for each nest and check the results the following day . In every case I found dead wasps on the ground and no wasp activity the next day . The fourth claim : `` No Oily Residue . '' This was easy to verify since our gutters , soffits and siding are all aluminum ; as Black Flag promised , there was no oily residue . Only time will tell whether or not this product is long lasting . I 'll try to remember to add a postscript later this summer on this product claim.I was surprised that there was one common safety feature missing on this product . There is a tear off tab located on top of the sprayer to protect against accidental discharge before initial use . But there is no cap or trigger lock to protect inadvertent discharge later after the tab is removed . This product should have some kind of safeguard in this respect so this safety oversight needs to be corrected . I did't use the entire can of Black Flag Wasp , Hornet & Yellow Jacket Killer , so there will be enough for next year , too . By the time I finished the application of Black Flag I did notice the jet spray did seem to be a little less intense . But I have little doubt there is enough pressure left in the can for next year , too . While I was posting this review I noticed that Amazon has a listing for a similar Black Flag product that kills wasps , hornets , yellow jackets AND scorpions . I read some of the reviews for that product and it appears there was some dissatisfaction with the sprayer . Evidently , the product I am reviewing may well be Black Flag 's new , improved version , even though it is not listed on the can that it is intended for use on scorpions . Overall , I was satisfied that this Black Flag product did perform as the manufacturer said it would .	1
I have trouble with wasps . For some reason they love my house . This opportunity came along , and I thought I would try it . It 's fine -- best if you spray it directly on the wasp . Word to the wise : stick around , track the corpse down so you do n't accidentally step on it and get stung anyway .	1
I am now at a point where I hate to see anything living die . Except for wasps . I hate them . With a passion . I have a scar from being stung by a red wasp 15 years ago ( seriously - I did n't know that was possible but my skin doctor confirmed it ) .I battle red wasps every year , and live in a two-story house on a steep incline . Every year I get out a ladder , and just like a scene with Clarke Griswold putting up Christmas lights , I seem to manage to have the ladder turn or collapse on me , barely escaping injury and surviving to fight another day . Let me tell you , there is nothing quite as exciting as balancing twenty feet off the ground and spraying a nest of a dozen wasps with a puny bug spray can . So long story long , I was excited to see that the product has a range of & # 34 ; up to 29 feet. & # 34 ; Well , I literally measured the range on level ground with a measuring tape . The spray stream is very powerful and solid to about ten feet . At 15 feet , the spray is starting to break up , and beyond that , the spray is quite scattered up to 25 feet . If you have roof eves 29 feet away , do n't expect to kill wasps at that range ( you might hit one or two with a drop and make 'em mad though ) . The only way I can see that the 29 foot range would be reached is if you were spraying DOWN , but unless you have a well with a wasp problem , I doubt that scenario is in the cards for most people.If you can score a direct hit , the spray will bring down wasps about as quickly as gravity will allow ; they fall right off the nest or out of the air . But unfortunately for me , I still need to do the balancing act on a ladder ( much to the amusement of my neighbors ) to reach the high eves on the house.I give the product a solid 4 stars ; it works , but just not at the maximum advertised range . I have yet to come across anything better , and if I do , I will update this review ( assuming I do n't fall off the ladder first and have to resort typing with a straw or by blinking , in which case my wordy reviews will become much more succinct ) . Thanks for reading , and good luck with your wasp problems !	1
If you have ever watched Billy the Exterminator , you have seen him and his brother get up close and personal with many wasp nests . Unless you like getting stung like a pin cushion and swelling up like Violet Beauregarde , you really want to be as far away as possible . But since they have yet to create a Drone Delivery system for wasp nests , this is you next best option.You also need to use it correctly , short bursts will make it last longer . One long stream will exhaust the pressure from the can too fast . It has a very fast knockdown and kill and I especially love the trigger because it provides much better control when aiming at those wasps aiming at you . It also has a residual effect for the wasps that are away when you kill the nest . Personally I would advise leaving the now poisoned nest there for a day or two before you knock it down to get the latecomers . And of course it also will work on other insects , but unless you are infested with spiders , I would use a regular insecticide for them.Also worth mentioning , there are two types of wasp sprays on the market , basic spray and non-conductive foam . If you nest is anywhere near electricity , use the non-conductive foam spray instead of this type .	1
My husband is anti pesticide . With that being said , I love this spray . I have n't found anything safe for honey bees that actually works against wasps . It seems to keep the wasps away for at least 30 days . I sprayed some under our pool slide , and we did not get any in , or under the slide when we opened the pool . We usually get several , and a few usually come out stinging when we start up the slide . Did n't happen this year .	1
Our farm is visited by bald faced hornets every year . My wife and I are allergic to insect stings so a hornet killer has to be quick and work from a safe distance . The Black Flag brand does this well . One good stream to the opening of the nest and they all die in seconds . I really do think that this is a literal life saver .	1
We entertain a lot outside during the summer months and there is nothing more irritating than to have yellow jackets and wasps swarming around you and your guests while eating . They nest in rafters , under wooden benches and around our row boat . I do not have any negatives to share , but I would like to tell you what I like most:1-I love the trigger dispenser , rather than the traditional push button spray method . It allows for steady stream of treatment.2-It is guaranteed or your money back ! 3-The best part -- it sprays up to 29 feet away , vs. equivalent in Raid , which is only 22 feet.Overall , a good product that works well with a price tag that is lower than its competitor , Raid .	1
In my perfect world wasps would respect my personal space and stay far away . Unfortunately they do not heed the no-tresflying signs and think nothing of setting up nestkeeping on my porches and eaves . With this can of Black Flag Wasp killer , I can stand on the other side of the porch or patio and aim the spray at their nest . They die quickly and I can then knock the nest down.Wasps are less active when it 's cooler , so it 's best to attack them at dawn or in the late evening , when they 've settled in for the night.This product also works well for those webworm pods in trees . Every spring my ornamental plum trees are invaded by those nasty things seemingly overnight . They are smart enough to weave their homes up high where I ca n't reach them , but with the mighty power of Black Flag , I can just aim and spray and bye bye webworms . A great product to keep on hand for & # 34 ; just in case. & # 34 ;	1
During the spring and summer , we frequently have problems with wasps outside around our house . Although an exterminator could fix the problem for a season , they are rather expensive just to spray for some wasps . Therefore , we have always relied upon wasp sprays to kill wasps.Raid Wasp & Hornet Killer , 14-oz . Aerosol Canhas always been our choice in the past . However , after using BLACK FLAG WASP AND HORNET SPRAY , we might make a permanent switch . Compared to RAID , this can of BLACK FLAG WASP AND HORNET SPRAY has a much farther reach . Also , since it includes the little red straw , it has more accurate aim as well . BLACK FLAG seems to be just as effective as RAID , so on that point it 's a draw . Overall , I am very pleased with BLACK FLAG WASP AND HORNET SPRAY and due to its extended reach and more accurate aim , I will probably start using it instead of RAID WASP AND HORNET KILLER	1
When spring begins , the wasps come out , and they are not going to nest around my house ! I 'm not sure if it actually sprays 29 feet , but it 's a good strong blast and it goes pretty far . I would suggest wearing a face mask and a hat , especially if it 's windy out !	1
I 've used this before and I really like it . My house seems to attract wasps and yellow jackets . At this point in time , neither are visible . I tested this spray and while I ca n't attest to a 29 ' spray , it easily reaches the shutters on the second floor . As far as I am concerned , the further I can stand the better when getting rid of these pests . Since they are not out yet , I am going to make a leap of faith and suggest that my past successful use of this will hold true as far as killing power . Spraying power , I can attest is just fine .	1
I like this mosquito lantern . It was easy to assemble and easy to use . The repellant goes in the bottom and is turned on by a button that also turns the light on at the same time .	1
This is a great packed item , came through with nary a scratch , and the Cutter Brand is one which we have used for years . Always we have been satisfied with their products and this is no exception . Bug season for the Mosquito is not quite upon us as yet , but we are sure that this will work as touted since it is by a company which makes quality products and can be trusted . The unit comes with batteries and also one refill that last three months which would take you up to frost when mother nature will put the pests to sleep until next year .	1
I delayed writing my review because mosquitoes have been less of a problem this year , even though I live it the deep South . Nonetheless , I have a daughter who is a mosquito magnet ( heavy breather ? ) so I lit this lantern one evening when we were sitting outside.The lantern was easy to setup and had a soft blue led light , quiet fan and emitted a lovely lemon scent . We were sitting at a small table watching the children play ( they were covered with insect repellent ) . I did n't get bitten at all but my daughter got a couple of bites on her legs , under the table . I think the product works but I might have been better off with just setting the lantern in front of us without the table.Since others have indicated you can run this lantern for two straight weeks , I figure our will last three months , at which time I 'll need to replace the repellent but not the batteries . Since a refill costs $ 9 on Amazon , that 's only $ 3 a month to use .	1
This cool looking little lantern comes with 4 AA batteries and one container of scented mosquito repellent . Each refill is supposed to work for up to 3 months but I am sure that its effectiveness would be greatly reduced after that long . The lantern itself is very small and cute . It 's black with plastic ( looks like glass ) windows . You remove the top and install the batteries and open the refill container and load it into the bottom of the lantern . Then you flip the sliding switch that is on the bottom to turn it on . When you turn it on the fan in the middle will turn on and will circulate the scent through the lantern and out the top . It provides up to 64 sq . ft. of protection . It works well to sit out on a deck or on a table to keep the nasty mosquitos away . It also has 4 LED lights at the top of the lantern that make it look like a real lantern . The fan is very quiet and you wo n't even hear it unless you get real close or hold it up to your ear . I hate wearing stinky mosquito repellent so I really like this option to repel them .	1
The Cutter Mosquito Repellent Lantern came with easy to read and follow instructions . It was a little difficult to lid over the batteries area off . The scent of the repellent is pleasant and not too powerful . You will need to keep the lantern in a protective area as it is lightweight . It was my experience that a gust of wind can blow it off a table , etc . While using the lantern it appeared that it not only kept the mosquitoes away but also other flying insects .	1
Since it is summer time here in Texas I thought I might need something like this . On those days when we all get together and grill it up out sided I knew this device would come in handy . So once I received it I put to the test , so id it work ? It worked wonderfully and killed off all of those pesky mosquitoes . I am not a big fan of those guys as I am sure you are not as well . I do recommend this for any one looking to get rid of them as well .	1
I find this to work about as well as a citronella candle , but it 's certainly more stylish.One of the best ways to keep mosquitos away is a fan . Mosquitos can not fly in high wind . I like to have a cigar on my patio . I have a tower fan which I place right next to me , and I never have a problem . I use a tower fan , which blows `` top-to-bottom '' and protects my entire body from mosquitos . Certainly this does n't work as well when you have several people over , but you can also use box fans and other types of fans . With a tower fan , you can purchase it with or without heat . If you purchase a heater , then you can simply use the `` fan mode '' so it will be very useful both in the Winter and Summer . Amazon.com offers several nice options .	1
I live in the country and mosquitos here will pick you up and carry you away . I tried this little gizmo on my front porch and it works absolutely great ! Works with 4 small batteries , which are included , and a small round , replaceable disk that fits into the bottom . There are small LED lights that put off a very soft glow , and an internal fan blows air across the repellant disk to emit and spread a bug free barrier around where you are sitting . I love it and would recommend it .	1
This is an attractive , effective repellent device from Cutter that has worked well on my outdoor deck in repelling mosquitoes from the area , and from being a nuisance.The housing , a useful , mildly lit lantern makes a nice centerpiece or deck accessory . I do wish it had been a solar , rechargeable light , but perhaps in the next model . It is nice that the product does come with four AA batteries , a loss leader for main feature , the foil wrapped mosquito repellant.I do wish there was a way to close the Cutter mosquito repellant between uses , as I am afraid the product will leak out more quickly than it is needed , and I find this to be the only real design flaw for the consumer . Otherwise , this product is attractive and works as promised .	1
This trek down research lane is sponsored by my klutziness . See , I threw away the box after I 'd read the directions because it did n't look very hard . A few days later when I went to use it , however ... I was able to get the top off the cartridge reasonably easily , but had a very hard time placing it correctly into the lantern and getting it to stay there . I mashed the side of the container by accident -- because it 's very thin and flimsy -- and the scent thing popped up at an odd angle . So I pulled it out to see if I could knock it back into place . I could n't . I could n't think of any way to get the scent thingee back in properly without touching it , so I finally just reached in and repositioned it.It turned out to be a sponge with some kind of liquid in it . I had to reposition it twice , and then after I 'd gotten it up and running , I washed my hands multiple times , but the scent did n't come off . I freaked out and thought , `` I know it 's DEET-free , but what IS it anyway ? Do I have some toxic substance on my hands now ? `` So I did some research . The liquid is linalool , which is a fragrant liquid alcohol component of several plants -- mint , cinnamon , and is one of the main components of lavender essential oil . The scent has a mild sedative effect , which is why lavender is used as a calming/soothing ingredient in things like bubble bath and eye masks . Linalool is a floral scent and is used in many fragrances and cosmetics . Relief ... I do n't have to scrub all the skin off my hands now.There 's no magical `` masking carbon dioxide '' happening here -- it 's just diffusing this scent into the area . And does it work ? Well , it turns out there 's actual science supporting it.I read the abstract for the article `` Efficacy of Botanical Repellents Geraniol , Linalool , and Citronella Against Mosquitoes '' in the Journal of Vector Ecology , a peer-reviewed journal . They concluded that indoors , linalool diffusers repelled mosquitoes by 93 percent . `` Outdoors , citronella diffusers placed 6 m from mosquito traps repelled female mosquitoes by 22 % , linalool repelled females by 58 % , and geraniol repelled females by 75 % , '' the study says . It concludes that geraniol is more effective , but linalool still does a good job of reducing mosquitoes . ( Male mosquitoes do n't bite , in case you 're wondering why they cared only about the females ! Females bite you to get your blood , which they need to make eggs to carry on their dastardly species . ) So basically , this lantern should n't be your only defense , but it should help ! I 'd still suggest wearing clothing that covers you well and possibly using bug spray , but this is worth adding to your arsenal.One caveat : linalool does n't have a perfect safety rating . It breaks down as it 's exposed to oxygen , and over time , it can cause allergic reactions including eczema . Considering you 're meant to use this in an outdoor setting , I do n't know how much that matters , but I 'd still suggest getting rid of the used cartridge quickly and not letting it sit in there beyond its useful life -- particularly if you take it indoors .	1
This is a clever concept and construction to replace the citronella candle . It is moderately effective . The lantern has a top compartment for 4 AA batteries ( and they include them in the kit , how nice ! ) There is a disposable cup with a foil cover . That 's the mosquito repellent . Inside the lantern is an LED light and a small fan . Push in the button ( sort of a slide on the bottom ) and the light goes on , the fan turns and disperses the repellent.I keep this on my patio table between the two chairs on the deck because we joke that the State Bird in Delaware is the mosquito . ( Actually , that 's not true . The State Bird of Delaware is the Greenhead Fly . ) Mosquitoes , however , are more annoying and more dangerous . It 's moderately effective ; right now , the skeeters are not so prevalent but we 've had a lot of rain and I expect as summer drags on , I expect I 'll have to spackle these all around the deck to stay bite-free.It seems to work better than citronella . The button on the base is kind of cheap ( tends to want to slide on by itself ) and there is no cap to re-close the repellent cup but all in all , this is a welcome device . Since you just need to buy the cup refills of repellent , it 's relatively cost effective . We used to use burning coils that would hang over the table when we worked in Thailand and they seemed more effective but they are n't available in the US . If you do n't want anything burning , say , a candle , or if you are sensitive to smells and smoke , this is a good alternative for mosquito repellent .	1
I am very sensitive to mosquito bites and have a wonderful deck in my backyard that opens to lots of trees , water , and wildlife . It is always a challenge to enjoy the outdoors and not get eaten alive . This lantern works well . Cutter , known for effective bug spray , in combination with the fan , keeps the mosquitos away . The lantern 's light is soft and can be used as ambiance , but it is low lighting . There is no way to use the fan and bug repellent without having the lantern on.Since it is still early in the season , I will update this review when the mosquitos are out in full force .	1
I had been waiting for the full blast of mosquito season to try out this lantern and write a review of it . Full blast mosquito season is definitely here , but it has been raining nearly every single day and I have only found one opportunity to try out the lantern . The mosquitoes are bad here and are the thickest at dusk , and that 's when it starts to rain.The one time I did get to try it out I 'm pretty sure there were fewer mosquitoes than usual . The acid test will be my kids and they were n't with me at the time . They get bitten 4X more than me or my husband . I have not finished trying out this lantern , but I 'm already overdue writing a review for it.It is solidly constructed , made out of very durable plastic . It came with batteries so that 's always good . It emits a soft white glow , not really bright enough to easily read by but is pleasant nonetheless . The fan motor is very quiet and I like that it does n't use poison to kill , but just a scent to mask the carbon dioxide we naturally emit from breathing and through our skin . It says it can repel mosquitoes up to 64 square feet . I 'm not sure what the dimensions of a tennis court are , but I will take the lantern with me tonight to see if the mosquitoes are repelled . We get bit often while playing tennis and it is very annoying . Overall for now though , I am so far pleased with this product . I will update this review after tonight .	1
I live on the east coast of the US and my yard is covered with trees . In the Summer , we are in a constant battle to avoid mosquitos . My yard is a breeding ground because it never truly seems to dry out . We avoid going outside once the bugs become apparent and rush from car to house and house to car to avoid multiple bites.I am always skeptical of new devices . I try not to be persuaded to purchase any because mostly , let 's face it , they are a waste of money . When I was given the chance to try this one out , I decided that I did n't have much to lose.Initially , I was pleased with the look and design . It is a small plastic lantern with smoked white plastic 'glass ' . The bottom is open , there is a small fan inside with a light . It comes with 4AA batteries and one disc of repellant . It was easy to remove from package and easy to open . After putting the batteries in , we turned it on and enjoyed the glow for a few seconds . It would be great on a deck or outside table , especially because of the soft light.That evening , I opened the repellent package , which resembled one of those individual peanut butter serving cups . I very carefully peeled back the foil top and gently inserted it into the bottom of the lamp . It appears to me that the plastic cup should slip in and then you turn it slightly to 'seat ' it in place . While this worked for me , it never fully caught it , making the repellant cup repeatedly slip out and fall . I finally took it to its permanent spot and inserted the cup and instructed no one to touch it . I turned the light on and we left it for a few minutes while we remained inside.It is true that when we came out , we did notice less bugs in our general porch area . No perfection , but as close as one can get . If having dinner or a party or just wanting to enjoy a small outdoor area , I can see this working well . WIth no wind to carry the scent , I would think this would last for a week or so . With no way to reseal the repellant , I am not sure how it will last the 3 months ( when it clearly states continuous use should last 14 days ) .My only problem with this is the fact that this cup will not stay in place . I have picked the disc ( which is like an oil soaked donut shaped sponge ) and replaced it back into the cup several times . I washed my hands really well after each use but it does have me worried about repeatedly having to deal with it falling out.Also , if there is a better way to keep the disc in , I 'd love a handle or cord to possibly hang it with . That would increase its usage 10 fold . I have placed many personal photos in the product description . Enjoy !	1
While the Chicago weather as of late has been unseasonably cold and I have n't had the chance to put this to the full test of high temps and high levels of humidity , I have been very pleased with the performance of this repellant lantern on the several days we managed to creep into the 70 's . It is a stylish piece that blends in well with any backyard set and covers a relatively high radius for being the small size that it is . After a few uses in a backyard that is often filled with mosquitoes , I have managed to avoid any bites so far this year and I definitely credit the cutter repellent for that . I will update this review after we reach the peak summer season to let everyone know how the lantern held up .	1
This is better than most deterrents I 've tried . It 's totally quiet even though it has a fan . I LOVE that batteries were included ! ! ! The scent is pretty strong , though . I tried it on the table on our deck , on the railing , on the floor . All over , but it gave adequate protection . Not perfect , but good .	1
After trying many repellents over the years that never worked , I gave this a try and was very pleased with the results . The repellent in this works by hiding the CO2 we breathe with the citronella smell so the mosquitos ca n't detect you and therefore , do n't decide it 's time for a feast ! I used this several times at night when the mosquitos are the worst for several hours and only had one bite versus 10-15 like I 'd normally get . So it 's not 100 % perfect at repelling but it definitely works ! The fan inside the lantern is very quiet and there 's an on/off push tab on the bottom to power it . It actually came with the 4 batteries it needed so that was another bonus.Now to the reasons I gave it 4 stars:1 . The box indicates that the cartridge it comes with lasts 3 months but when you read the fine print , it says if you use it a lot throw it out after 2 weeks of use.2 . The light in the lantern is pretty but very dim so the light part is useless especially if you are taking this camping.3 . My biggest complaint is that the little container of repellent is not resealable so if you want to store it for later use , you can't.Overall , this product is highly effective and I 'd definitely recommend it over other citronella candles and similar products .	1
An effective mosquito repellent with batteries included to propel a small fan to disperse the insect repellent that keeps my deck mosquito free on warm summer nights.The Lantern has a nice light and is reasonable in price . I am really hoping it will last 3 months but I will get another just in case .	1
I am a mosquito magnet , and this Cutter Mosquito Repellent Lantern is great ! It is quite effective at close range ( i.e . when I am sitting right beside it ) . It came with the batteries which was nice ; assembly was minimal and very easy . The fan is exceptionally quiet ; the light is not particularly bright . My only gripe is that I ca n't just leave it outside as the lantern is not weather-proof .	1
I keep this on my front porch , which is mostly uninhabitable due to mosquitos . We 've used it five times and I only got bit twice , compared to my usual six to ten major bites . I think the light is very nice and pretty , though nothing you could read by . The instructions were pretty clear and made sense , especially after you see it working . Four AA batteries are included , which is great . The repellent pod was difficult to open , but that may not be a bad thing . The scent is certainly more appealing to me than citronella.My husband believes it would be most effective if it is set on the ground or floor instead of a tabletop . I do n't agree with him because of the fan . The repellent is circulated quite effectively and I ca n't help but wonder if the top half of your body would go unprotected if it were down too low.Overall , a good product that has worked for us and one that I recommend . It is not a perfect solution to mosquitos , however . There may not be a perfect solution for every area .	1
metal too soft , its all wore out after light use , the thread on front already smooth out.lots rust on the back puller/handle part , need something with better material , rather buy once and be done with it for many year .	-1
I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid ( I 'm 61 ) . We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem . First of all , this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move . If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects , get something else . It has to be moved . You ca n't drag it and you ca n't turn it around and make it go the other direction . I have found I have to check on it as often , if not more often , than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler . First , it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence . Then , it kinked the hose and cut off the water . Finally , it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels . Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water . No kink this time , checked the button on the bottom , could n't get it going again . I went back to my oscillating sprinkler . At least it 's easy to move around . I think you need to use this on a very flat , very straight lawn . Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves . It did n't work for me . I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it were n't so heavy to move .	-1
UPDATE : Originally , I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them ( I bought 3 ) for a while , I 've changed my opinion . Yes , the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses , but Flexogens are still heavy . These Flexogen hoses DO kink , and they kink easily . The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel , lay it flat on the grund , and then turn and turn and turn ( twist/rotate ) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no `` waves '' or loops . I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and , holding the end , walked across my yard . I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling . The hose formed 9 kinks ! What a pain in the hand , elbow and shoulder to straighten it ! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water , this hose becomes unwieldy . The hose turns so that my wand is upside down . It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward -- requires using both hands . Fighting this hose is painful , very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel , the hose twists and turns , causing it to again form waves and loops , which become kinks . Again , you have to twist , rotate , etc . to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground . As you reel it in , you have to stop and repeat the process . My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this . You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses ( 100 ft ) at big box stores and clubs for about $ 25 . Do n't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands , I needed to replace my heavy , rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight , easier-to-maneuver hoses . I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard . After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses , I chose this hose . I 'm glad I did . While it 's still heavy , it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose . It 's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a `` lightweight '' hose . It is NOT light . It 's substantial . I found a local store that had this hose in 25- , 50- and 75-ft lengths . I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length . I could n't feel much of a difference , so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose ( but lighter than my rubber one ) .This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it 's more flexible . ( I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years . ) I 've only used one ( I bought 3 of these ) for about 1.5 weeks . It 's been too hot , too muggy and too rainy to use it much , but I 'm pleased so far . I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years . The solid brass fittings are thick so they wo n't get dents that cause leaks . Because I have n't dragged it around the yard yet , I can not say whether it really is a `` no-kink '' hose . I recommend this hose because o the quality .	-1
I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee . After a short time , the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement . A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement . Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty ! Now Gilmour is selling them . But it 's the same hose - `` Flexogen '' . The hose itself it actually quite good if you do n't mind replacing the hose ends eventually , I 've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them . Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose . Lifetime warranty is n't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company ( Gilmour ) wo n't honor the warranty . And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate , Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses . I wrote to them multiple times and was told ( without explanation ) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses . If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty , you may not get it.On the Gilmour website , there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced . On Amazon , it does say `` This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee '' . It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package . Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp. , so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement .	-1
I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews . I have a small backyard , but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out . I have no standing water or what so ever . My neighbors might , but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.I followed the instruction , hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go . Oh , I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom . A few zaps here and there , but nothing spectacular . I left it on out there for a week , and saw no difference . Still got attacked by mosquitoes . Two weeks , same thing . After a month , I gave up and took it down . There is no point to waste electricity . Oh , it served one purpose : light up that corner of the yard some.So , do n't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity . I am almost sure you will be disappointed . This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill .	-1
This light is pretty worthless . It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but did n't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population . I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable . The bulbs blew after 1 season . Replacement bulbs are $ 40 each plus shipping . It takes 2 . That is $ 90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $ 80 for the whole unit . Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately , the only thing I 've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices . They are all unreliable too . Skip the zappers and traps and use deet .	-1
I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy . Sorry to get rid of it . The new one was not really working right . hardly kill bug .	-1
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1 & # 34 ; branches , wet or dry . Does not cut 3/4 & # 34 ; branches . It may cut SOME 1/2 & # 34 ; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it . Have not decided on a new one yet , since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different .	-1
We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it , because the handles are mounted for lefties . That is , the two hand-grips are each curved to the side , giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it . This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig . But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to `` steer '' the Claw to the left to get them to dig . Since us righties have more strength in our right hands , it was very awkward to `` steer '' the Claw to the left . We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and have n't used it since .	-1
Currently I hate this thing . I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it . I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years . It was better than any mower I 've ever owned . This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like . Pooptastic . I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass , but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well . Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block .	-1
I 'm not sure how I missed that important point , but I did . I do n't see that clearly mentioned from scott 's , either . This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills . It just does n't have the leverage to cut the grass . So I 'm back to the mower . One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces , but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push .	-1
I hate gas powered tools ! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem . Obstacles are a definite problem . The maneuverability is quite limited . With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles . That was n't the biggest problem . A little extra weed whipping to be done . The biggest problem is the quality of the cut . If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great . This mower is for people who LOVE grass . Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day . I hate mowing and grass . I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it does n't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks . Some people coddle their grass . They think of it as a family member . They talk about their grass non-stop . They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour . They have chemicals for weed control , ants , grubs , PH balance , feed . They seed and water regularly . They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns . Their passion for their grass is second only to their family . If this sounds like you , great ! It 's great to have a passion and this mower is for you . If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing . This mower is not for you .	-1
Cuts well , etc . ; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more . After assembly it was fine . But who needs that added hassle ?	-1
I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing . It did n't work out . The second time I used it , the grass had gotten a little high , so there was a lot of back and forth action . It took forever , really . I know that this product is n't meant for that , but that was my situation . Anyway , as I was finishing the handle came apart . There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together , and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing . The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah , I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing , but that should not have happened . I followed the assembly instructions to the letter . It was really a very simple assembly . I did n't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions , though . I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL ( like leaving town for a couple weeks ) , this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped , lumpy yard , do not buy this product . Just do n't . It is so hard to use . I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice , flat yard , but as it is this thing was worthless to me .	-1
Couldm't cut my grass very well . Misses some spots because it just did n't cut it . if the grass is taller than 2 inches , this is not mower for you . Need to spend the money and get something that works .	-1
Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty ? That is the typical warranty on used product . If the manufacturer has little faith in their product , then neither do I .	-1
Save your money - Use Styrofoam cups with a blend of soils - this was a ridiculous and very expensive attempt at greenhouse gardening ... ... ... ... .	-1
I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better . It is solid and easy to clean . I did n't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short . But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great . The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING : I am going to have to lower my rating on this . The hummingbird feeder works fine . The issue is the yellow `` bee guards . '' Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow ? So if these `` bee guards '' ( dumb name ... should be called bee attractors ) were any color other than yellow ... like RED ... then I would n't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I ca n't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue . I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed . We searched the grass below and found 3 of them . There were no gnaw marks , chew marks , bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers . What removed them ? I do n't know . But now that they are gone , the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir . Like I said , this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects , I will and never put it back up again .	-1
This is difficult to clean .	-1
i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely . hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket , but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star .	-1
I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this . I also read the reviews raving about this hose . Since these hoses are maid from remnants ; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get . My luck was n't good . The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately .	-1
ridiculous pricing on these new Webers ... where once you could get a 22 '' model for less than $ 70 , the company now charges ( and never discounts ) upwards of $ 100 or morehave to agree with other reviewers about : bad quality control - issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sizedpoor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles , but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles ... loose fit overall - something seems amiss at the factory - models are not assembling with as tight tolerances as in the pastWeber used to be a solid name in the U.S. charcoal grill market - i 'm afraid that this reputation is slipping down a steep slope of obscurity if the QC continues to slidei recommend:1. better quality control2 . standard hinged grates for all models ( you will win big fans ) 3. better tolerances4 . revert to hardwood on handles ( 'handles ' heat better - get it ? ) btw , i use cheap aluminum round cake pans in the ash catcher - works better than an expensive model upgrade to catch and remove waste charcoal	-1
This grill has one major flaw ... ..surprised it is still being sold due to product liability . The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces ... like your deck , your pine straw , or house . For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system . If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires , you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill . I love the way a Weber cooks , but this model is needlessly risky . And if you have one of these grills , take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill . A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes . This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly ... ..it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task . If you value the property you live in , or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence , avoid this flame thrower .	-1
The coons steal the bait from this trap at will . I 've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it would n't engage the trip at first . They advise putting bait past trip plate , but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait , another serious design flaw . There are traps that work , this just in NOT one of those . Save your money !	-1
This trap can actually catch mice , but if they are n't small , will only injure them . It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat , who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown . Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it . The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap , then euthanize only the problem animals with ether ( found as `` starting fluid '' in automotive stores ) . Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures . It 's also extremely flammable so take great care .	-1
Yes , these are way easier to open . I have a near phobia about things that snap..especially mouse traps . I can not , physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap . I know , weird , but it just freaks me out ! So , I got these and was so excited ! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice . Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself . So I tried these traps . Lots of them . I go for total overkill ( pun intended ) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles ! Well , these do NOT kill anything . They spent weeks with nothing in them . But the old mouse traps ( my hubby sets them ) had about one every few days . He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady ' traps . Sigh . I know these look great , and they are super easy to use , but they will not kill anything . I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review . Also , the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with ? What a gross , awful , torturous hassle . No thanks . Hope this helps !	-1
I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap . There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs . As a result , the flea trap is of no use to me . These refills are of no use to me as well and that is why I can give only one star . They cost only $ 5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item . I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option .	-1
I purchased this in May 2011 . One year later and I 'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle . Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months , so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous ... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types . The nozzle worked well in the beginning , though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it would n't last many years . After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop . Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking ... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it .	-1
Bought it in May of 2010 . Did not use it from November to April . That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable . Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy .	-1
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick , and at five feet away it 's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick . As a result , it broke on the second day . Amazon replaced with another , which broke due to same issue , but this time was too late to return . I bought another , more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else : ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner	-1
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush ; NOT ! ! ! ! ! It was worth a try , but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush . I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I 'll give it to my brother . : > ) Note : My rating is strictly for the said application .	-1
I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas . I tried it out but decided to return it . Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer ( 18 volt ) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do . I wanted it to work for me but no way !	-1
Action works well enough , but the blades only cut if you use the very tips . I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools .	-1
Fiskars badly missed the target on this one . Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though , but in all honesty , this is almost as bad as having nothing at all . Yes , it does work , but not very well . Yes , it 's sharp out of the box , but wo n't stay that way for long . I 'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R & D ; department actually used the finished product . If they did , they 'd realize that it 's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass ( maybe less ) . After that , ergonomics , build quality , and most importantly , fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First , the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath . Second , the steering knob needs to be larger , adjustable , and attach to the pole instead of the top handle . Third , the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there 's too much flex in the existing one . Fourth , the pole should be at least 4 '' longer . Fifth , the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment ( or dispose of plastic altogether ) . Lastly , the blades should at the very least , be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened ! I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face , but here they really took the low-end , budget approach . It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment . The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening , but who here has a living indoor lawn ? I guess we 'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points . I 'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version .	-1
I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly . I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13 : I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house . However , I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand . They are just too large for me . I think the swiveling handle is the culprit . I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks . They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands .	-1
I have been doing yard work for 40 years , so I am no `` backyard rookie '' . This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it . The `` PowerGear '' fell off and could n't be reattached firmly to the pruner . I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say , everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product . Poor products deserve bad reviews , both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered . Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit . That said , I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly .	-1
The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly , BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers . if you 're trimming an outside branch , that 's not a problem , but I 've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these , make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you 're going to be muttering to yourself a lot .	-1
I got this for me , but gave it to my wife . I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines , etc . in our wooded area , but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers . I was looking for something more `` beefy '' , but this seemed a little delicate for my use . My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden . It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for ; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do . I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket . I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board , but there 's no opening to do this with , and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down . Instead we have to throw it in the `` gardening tool drawer '' where it is slightly more difficult to find.UPDATE : after one season of use , my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden . She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers , but they should be more durable .	-1
I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy , but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose , the male end just snapped in half . The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap . Yup , it was under normal water pressure but it was n't like I was using the hose as a tow rope , or pumping benzene through it.I 've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years , but never snap in half like that.Next time I 'll listen to that little voice .	-1
The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100 ' hose full of water . The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose . Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year . This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk . I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price . It looks like it will work forever . Also , this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8 '' hose . It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft . If I had it to do all over again , I would have purchased a quality reel the first time .	-1
I 've had this for four years . It leaked from day one . Finally took it down to see if I could fix it . The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $ 9.50 . On a 4 year old item , replacing the part does n't make sense . Since this hose is right next to my front door , I have to have some sort of reel . I 'll look elsewhere .	-1
This would have been a zero star review if I could have done that . Yellowjackets would fly around it but would not enter . After three weeks I tried to return and Amazon did n't even want the POS returned , just gave me a credit . I guess not having to return it is worth one star .	-1
Do n't waste your time or money on this peace of pretty plastic . Using the bait that came with it and the bait refills I bought extra , it never trapped one yellow jacket in an area well populated with the little pests . Save your money and get a good fly swatter and some spray for the nests .	-1
We had hundreds of wasps in our tree so I ordered one of these , followed the instructions and waited for the massacre . NOT ONE DEAD WASP after 3 weeks of use . I changed bait for 3 more weeks , nothing . I changed bait again and still nothing after another month . I half expected the wasps to build a nest around it . Bah , annoying .	-1
I have a time to time yellow jacket problem where I live so I bought a yellow jacket trap and this bate to help with the problem . I followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets . I left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket . Yesterday I took it down and threw it in the trash . Waste of money .	-1
I 've had this up for a week and it 's got one yellow jacket . I notice that some people recommend apple juice , but the instructions say to just add water.I 'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great , but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets .	-1
I know the difference between yellow jackets , honey bees , bumble bees , paper wasps , and bald faced hornets . It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder . With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap . With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week . Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap .	-1
I am guessing the 'attractant ' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES , and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds ( thousands ? ) of flies inside the bag . It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK . It 's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross , a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse ! Find a different solution .	-1
I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal . Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted . In my case , in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster . The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds , they do n't die . Even the young ones . I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house , but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch . I 'll post later about customer service .	-1
This is well made and sturdy but I just do n't find myself using it because it 's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you 're carrying tools as well . Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store . It 's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I do n't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that 's more of a chore . It just does n't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft .	-1
Update and downgrade . I 'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply do n't like it . I 've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business . This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it . I 'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up . There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder . Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large `` feeder station '' outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I 've tried a lot of feeder designs -- some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels . I 'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever ( and funny ) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder . And they are determined little creatures . I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100 % of the time , and I 'll get to that at the end of this review . But I 'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own . I 'm not sure that this feeder does that , but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that 's a pleasant surprise . It also seems pretty well made , but I have some doubts about some of its construction features . Here are some pros & cons : Pros : *The dome on top and the lid look as though they 'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder . Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds . *As I said it 's a large-capacity feeder and holds three pounds of seed . That 's pretty substantial , so I like that feature . *It was simple to assemble , all that you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop ( using a small nut ) on the dome . Took less than two minutes to assemble everything . Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use , the perches were already installed and that saves time . On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts ( to shrink them ) and that 's a pain . *Overall it seems very well made , but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws -- so I 'll update this review in a month or so.Cons : *First and foremost , I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down . The idea is that the squirrel will fall off ( from its own weight tilting the base ) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he 's on the feeder . I 'm not completely sure that that 's a possibility , but I was able to get my finger caught ( gently ) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray . I certainly do n't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw . Again , the risk may be pretty low , but the way this is designed , the feeding perches are attached to a collar ( that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray ) and that 's what moves . It 's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you . *Also , I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed . Instead , this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder ( again , much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you ) . The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice . When there is a catch try , the food gets eaten by the birds . *The tube seems a bit too flexible to me . The way that you mount the lid , for example , is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid ( the lid , not the dome , they are two separate things ) . It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely -- and also , every time you grab the tube , you squeeze it and the lid can pop off . Not a major flaw , it 's minor , but it 's an issue . The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down , you do n't have to remove it and it fits very securely . I 'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not , they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I do n't like this feeder , but that 's not quite true . I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works , both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds . If I do n't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground , I 'll be satisfied . As I said , I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials . I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base . I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself . I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK , I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have . I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole ( plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely -- it works beautifully ) and a baffle that goes around the pole . Squirrels can only jump about 4 ' off the ground maximum -- and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle . So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4 ' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from , they simply ca n't get up the pole . I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it : sunflower , suet and thistle . It works : in five years , not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I do n't have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own . So I just hung it on a 4 ' pole ( a shepherd 's hook ) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel 's jumping range . It 's only been out a few days and the squirrels have n't discovered it yet , but they will -- and soon . I 'll try to keep a video camera handy and I 'll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels , I find them very interesting -- but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc . I 'll post an update shortly .	-1
When I received this product , the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer . They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder . The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware . Since I received this as part of the Vine program , I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler , but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious . So far after 2 weeks no birds . It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star ? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging . Not worth the time and money . Buy something for less money . A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to . We have six feeders and no squirrels . Now deer are another thing altogether !	-1
Issues with the feeder : -the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook . It was impossible to secure it , and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic , part holding the seeds , is a bit thin . It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted , which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds ( 1/4 to 1/2 cup ) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube , seems way to loose , maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds , but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern . Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs , one in each side of the tube top.observation : -only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small , and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are , so again , only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion : For the price , currently $ 73 on Amazon , there are better , more sturdy options . I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one . **Edit Oct 3 , 2013 -- So after only a few weeks , I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out . And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1 .	-1
Simple assembly ( two minutes worth ) is required for this feeder . The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the metal prongs on the roof ( you can not see this in the stock photos , as it is covered by the squirrel dome ) . I have uploaded a photo of the top . The roof has a 2 inch opening for seed and a bar across it , so that the baffle part can hook onto it . To fill you have two choices , remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic , the plastic is flexible enough for this , but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it . Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening , which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed . I really do not like this , especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels ( darling but clever things that look like koalas ) . They are acrobatic and determined . They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days ( and they usually do get into them quickly ) but it remains to be seen if they will learn . Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars . The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders , and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking . I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain . The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder . Filling it so annoying , that I can not recommend it at all . I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders , ( you can get three of those , with some money left over for the price of this one ) that have multiple ports ( which birds like ) and which are MUCH easier to fill . Squirrels can get a bit of food from them , but they do have to work a bit for it . Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest . I am going to use the baffle ( which is very nice powder coated metal ) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders . If the baffle were sold separately , I would buy some more of those .	-1
All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct . The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed . On the feeder I received , the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there 's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it 's stuck to a window . Once it 's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill , and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups . Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it 's not worth paying the postage to send it back . Despite the much higher cost , I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects .	-1
This arrived on the 19th and I started using it the last week of Feb . It is now March 4th and it has stopped working . No , it is not the light bulb , I changing it a few times and still nada . So about 7 - 10 days use and it is broken already . Total waste of money .	-1
The only thing in this that should be there is sugar . The rest is stuff you should n't be adding to your feathered friends diet . This stuff is also three times the price of baker 's sugar from any old grocery store , four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve . This is a bad buy , bad for the birds and bad for your pocket .	-1
I picked up some of this mix last summer at a local agricultural center . It 's an old brand that is easy to find , and the price was right . My first outing with it last summer was a total bust . I mean I mixed the stuff , put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees . If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it , they were obviously disappointed for they never came back . Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it . At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late . I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north , ( the ruby throated ) . It 's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you . But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on . I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing . ( I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper , but just not worth the mess and trouble to me . Just my opinion , but its stands ) . I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon . Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand , I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth . I love it . It 's definitely a little pricier than this mix , but well worth it , trust me . I do n't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills , but I do n't really care . I found something that 's reasonably priced , easy to use , and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it . In conclusion , I do n't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers . Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc . My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it . It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here , but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me , and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season . I have left a link to the Mills brand , and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work ... Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet , 3-Pack	-1
There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix . There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds . This is reason enough to not buy this product . Buy a product without the dye.Better yet , just buy sugar . Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar . Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved . You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird 's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food . Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION . DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey , use only sugar . Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds . Sugar Only !	-1
Hummingbirds are wonderful . They 're amazing , unique birds , but you do n't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.If you want a feeder , try this one : Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederor something similar . I 've used this type for years and you ca n't beat the fact that it 's glass , and that you can buy new bee guards . ( They get moldy . Do n't bleach ... replace.You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.As far as food , you can do two things . Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like ; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar . You do n't need red dye , and should n't use it . It 's bad for the Hummers.I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces , and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula . Their bad.It 's cheap to have hummingbirds . And easy to make your own hummer-chow . Do n't buy this .	-1
I love Perky-Pet feeders , but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this . They do not need artificial anything , especially food coloring ! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil , and 1 part white sugar , let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool . If you are too lazy to do this , you should n't be feeding hummers . It only takes a few minutes , and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks . Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar , and small insects .	-1
This mower hit a small rock on its first mission and that enough to break the unit and send it to the dump .	-1
Big and floppy , When you tighten them it feels like you cut off the blood or they fall down off the knees .	-1
I wore these twice and they skinned the ... . out of my knees . Yes , I had the straps adjusted correctly . Wo n't use them again . Use a kneeling pad instead ! The kneeling pad has worked beautifully ! No more skinning my knees .	-1
This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself . The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it 's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed . Save your money ... .not worth the hassel .	-1
Using these in Japan . I have used them previously in Canada . They were sent to me by family since I would n't have purchased them again . In my case at least , Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate ... at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night . It was the same back in Canada , at least the kill rate was n't any better with the cartridges . The other down side to these ( if they do have any effect ) is that it 's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind . If the mosquitos ' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great ... if not , then what ? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these ... I would just hang another zapper . I 'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective .	-1
I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it 's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor . However , the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20 ' away . When an object is close , the water wo n't hit it , even on minimum range settings . What few drops are hitting the skunk , he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow ' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily ( hopping through the grass ) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation ( 360 degree vs. a smaller sector , etc. ) . That allows you , within limits , to fine tune the area of coverage . The smaller the area of coverage , the more effective the scarecrow is , since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc . But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches , not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows . The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap . They even include sealing rings , so there is no leakage . However , I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic . The thing is fragile , as emphasized in the manual - no pushing , pulling , etc . on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings . For example , I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $ 50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re : skunks is not borne out in my experience .	-1
This looks like a well built sprinkler . It seems to work for a lot of people , but it did not work for me . The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level . The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden .	-1
I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death ( literally ) . He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process . I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer , and it may work well for that because they are large targets . It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat , a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller , less intelligent and less numerous pests . It is probably great for an area infested with pests though , hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs , but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough . It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler . If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves , it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds . It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints , they can hide behind the plants , and when the Scarecrow is aimed low , every plant movement ( breeze blowing a cucumber leaf ) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it wo n't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests , this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it , which rarely happens in my garden jungle . The motion sensor concept does n't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants . It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much . It does n't work well . We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing , and the dichotomy for me , is it appeared to get rid of the pest . We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK . So for that , I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would . The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals , but it cost me $ 60 to save $ 10 worth of cabbage.Cats , dogs , groundhogs , squirrels , rabbits , etc . appear to be driven away by it . And the battery has lasted several weeks . I just ca n't give it anything but one star because it does n't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe . The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product , and one that is actually affordable , would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes . It would be much cheaper and just as effective . You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $ 7.00 sprinkler , or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants . But if you have tons of deer , then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying . You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time . I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house . It is in the way much of the time , so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings , lawn mowing , kids want to play in yard etc . But I did discover an alternate use ! ! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow . : - ) OK , now would you pay $ 60 to entertain your kids ? OK , so sell it as that . Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool , the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind . The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment . I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do , scared away a varmint eating my plants . It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids . But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works , kind of , but it is not what it advertises itself to be . A motion sensor can not work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT ! This would get 5 stars as a kids ' toy ! ! So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars ?	-1
I added teflon to the water connections , and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on . Dry test worked fine i would hear the click . But once I added the water and did nothing . My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible . I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions .	-1
Im 6'2 '' and this thing is tiny . I always have to hunch over . I wish i bought a longer weed eater . Also i wish it was more powerful .	-1
This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I 'm just inept . I could n't catch the flies to buzz them . I 'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried . For us , this does n't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy . This product does seem useful for larger , stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products .	-1
I do n't own these but saw them at a flea market . No question in my mind why they were up for sale ( but should have gone in the trash IMO ! ) My friend discovered -- the hard way ! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin ! Mind you , this friend is a large manly guy , not easily affected , yet he howled and dropped it ! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here ! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices , nor my father with his pacemaker , or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen . What were they thinking ! ? ! ? ! ?	-1
This is the cheapest made product I 've ever owned . To insert the 2 batteries , there is no flap that you open . You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver , then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor . Insert the batteries , put circuit board and switches back in , insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut ( 3 each ) , hoping the screw does n't fall out while you 're holding the nut . Are you kidding ? I 'm returning this , because I do n't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries . I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries , you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle .	-1
I bought this product along with composter ( compost wizard jr. 7 cubic foot compost tumbler ) . First , I examined the box trying to find ingredients , none of them was listed , so who knows what it is . It made me feel uncomfortable , because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical . Also , I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not , but since there is no disclosure of ingredients , you stuck to `` take their word for it '' . Plus , what if you have an allergy for it , but since their no information what inside ; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second , I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost . I do not think it made a difference at all . My composter does its job with or without it just fine , it is black and generates a lot of heat , I water it or add greens to keep it moist , and turn it weekly . Did not feel any speed up whatsoever . Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick . Do n't waste your money ! ! .To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria , I added ( as book on composting recommended ) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms , so they can start working on new pile of compost .	-1
The saw has good and bad qualities ... PROS.1 . Price is comparable to other brands..2 . The height of the pole is adequate..3 . Home Depot sells replacement chains ... CONS.1 . Balance is an issue . It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2 . Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area . As a result , wood chips need to be removed between uses . Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3 . Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened . As a result , an accurate cut is almost impossible..4 . The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage . After losing it , the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide , move it forward , and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5 . The unit is underpowered . Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6 . It is very cheaply made . For example , the chain guide is thin . As a result , it bends to the side . Second , the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time . Third , the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless . It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills .	-1
I have had this pole saw for three years and have used the pole attachment once or twice a year for the first two years . During the second year , the trigger mechanism broke and did in the pole section , and the whole thing has been sitting for over a year waiting for me to jury rig up a toggle switch in place of the broken trigger.I am about to get back into this process and that is the reason I was looking up a replacement when the Amazon `` you purchased this item in 2007 '' notice came up ( I do like this function from Amazon as it saves me from reordering stuff ) Back to the pole saw.I did expect the pole trigger mechanism to last longer than it did and Remington needs to re-visit the design.Added a JPG to product page as you can only add videos to the reviews ? ? ? ? ? ? ? It shows a SPST $ 4.00 switch installed in the place of the plastic piece of junk that comes with the unit and the trigger hole filled in with silicone to stop stuff from getting in to the area.The saw also leaks most of the oil ( chain lube ) out when it is sitting , so put something under it.I have to do a lot of this type of thing these days to make products work : See my other reviews .	-1
Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days , you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill , at a cost of about $ 4 each . Depending on what you pay for the propane , attractant and CO2 cartridges , it sums up to a cost of $ 20 around or more at each tank refill . Since you have to refill the propane tank , replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days , this adds up to an operating cost of over $ 400 per year ! I 'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying .	-1
It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it would n't start . I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring , including wasting three of the `` clean out '' cartridges and it still does n't work . Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose . Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line : avoid this product .	-1
This product is a waste of money . It will only last for one season and its ' effetiveness was minimal . Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience . After mine stopped working ( the first time ) , customer service was marginal at best . I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem . Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray .	-1
One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device ( actually two of them ! ) to control mosquitoes in the yard . Yes , it caught mosquitoes , but it did not eliminate the problem ; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines . The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes , it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in the overall population . It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free BackyardCutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067 , that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.I did not like this product for many reasons : it had a high initial cost , it required replacing the Octenol attractant ( more $ $ ) , and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks ( more $ $ ) . In addition , it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby , and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets ( more $ $ ) . Basically , it costs too much to operate , takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort , and most importantly , it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes ! So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed . I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes . They will be future landfill items.Save your hard-earned dollars and avoid this product and its clones . Use the Cutter Bug-Free Backyard spray instead.konedog	-1
Expensive hunk of junk . Orig . purchase date Nov. 2006 , after the first one we 'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended . The 'head ' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice . If you get a replacement head from them , there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date ( even though they sent you a new one ! ) . Save your money for something else . Ours is dead again . We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon , but we 're done with the Defender-we 're throwing it away .	-1
I bought these last fall thinking they 'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way . I do n't remember using them at all last year ; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together . They stay open about an inch and a half ! There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk . Too bad , the other Fiskar products we have are great . They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board .	-1
I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with ! We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you do n't care about nature and other living beings ! Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you can not throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison ! Terrible product !	-1
After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests , none of these test results could be trusted.1 . Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon : pH read `` 6 '' ... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more ( pH of nearly 2 is lemon , so these tests give unreliably `` alkaline '' results ) . The purified water test also came out `` alkaline '' . All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result , 7.5.2 . Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions : none of the K , P , or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes , 20 , 30 ... or even 24 hours later . Manure compost should at least read `` adequate '' for nitrogen ! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either , so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So , all in all , it was a tremendous waste of money and time .	-1
This is a nice sturdy product but it does n't work well on my deck railing . I have a board railing with slats , rather than a thick beam , and the unit just falls off if bumped . When I move it so it sets against the slat it does n't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail , but it 's not supposed to need that . If you plan to order these , get just one first , and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias .	-1
No way does this product perform as promised . And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work ! I do n't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck . At the top of the rail , one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat . Any which way we tried it , it did not hold , would not grip the railing and kept falling forward . The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing . How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing ? Only if you assemble it OFF the railing ; then you ca n't get it ON the railing . ( I think I got all the parts : I received the basket , two L-shaped arms , six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts . )	-1
I bought this simply because of the reputation Havahart has . The other Havahart traps I own , like the 1025 , is of top quality and made to last a lifetime . When comparing the two , it 's as though they were n't even built by the same company . This model is simply a joke . The sides are so uneven I had to bend them in so that the doors would close without leaving a gaping escape hole . I also had to bend the hatch bars because they would not fall into the fasteners when the hatch was triggered . I did catch one mouse , but without my straightening of the unit it would not have even been functional . ( Note to owners ... you really need to read the instructions on how to adjust the sensitivity before you say it does n't work . ) That makes this unit NOT ready to use right out of the box.Other notes ... There is no handle so you must be careful how you handle it so you do n't get bit by the rodent . The top corners are also razor sharp and you need to be careful not to get stabbed . The corners should have been rounded off for the extra $ .10 in cost.It is important to note that all traps must be cleaned with with bleach and then soap after a catch . The urine and feces detracts other animals since they consider the trap `` marked '' . Based on that point , it is also important to know that cleaning this unit is painful as the windows are unfinished and act as a cheese grader on your hands . Once again , a few pennies should have been spent to finish off the rough edgesHavahart 's build quality with this model is pretty disgraceful . I wish the company would have thought twice before they permitted this cost-cutting AND let their quality control go down the drain .	-1
I have a couple of the larger Havahart traps and swear by them . Those are solid , well-built , and foolproof . This model is exactly the same as their larger 2-door trap , just shrunk down . Unfortunately , everything fits together very loosely , which makes it tricky to set the trap , and much too easy to trip . The `` U '' -shaped bars which lock the doors down have a tendency to fall out . The long bars attached to the doors , which hook to the trigger , also fit very loosely . Setting the bars onto the trigger involves taking two cylindrical pieces of metal , about the size and shape of the point of a ball-point pen , and balancing one on top of the other . This is trickier than it should be , and the slightest jar will trigger the trap . It helps if you take a large pliers , or set of channel locks , and flatten the ends a bit so they will stay mated better . A strong wind can set this off , and a storm certainly will , making these unsuitable for outdoor use . Note also that a man-size hand wo n't fit inside this trap , so you will have to carefully toss the bait in and hope it lands on the trigger , or keep trying until it does . There is no handle , so you need to be careful about where you hold a filled trap to avoid getting bit . You can make these work inside , but be prepared for some aggravation . Overall a disappointing product .	-1
Not what I expected . This is to be added in sitting water . My mistake . I thought it was a dry type of killer feed .	-1
For every soil sample I tested this powder with , it indicated it was 7.5 ph . I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5 , which is the highest the meter will go so I 'm assuming it 's just bad powder . I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester ( also bought on here , good stuff ) , and it showed the real PH values ( 5.0 for my peat mix ) , 6.5 for my other regular soil . So it gets to keep a star because I 'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester .	-1
I have a few B & D ; 18volt tools and I decided to buy a weed whacker and this electric broom . I was in for a surprise.The weed whacker works great and the battery lasts for ever ... as an FYI ! I charged the battery the day I received it ... a full charge of about 18 hours..to be on the safe side . Put the battery in and went on to do my cleaning around the deck etc ... . Yes there was air ... it was OK..but not enough to sweep much . 15 minutes later it went to half power , and 10 minutes later it DIED.My first reaction - the battery is bad , lets try a different one and if that is the case I can call B & D ; for a warranty replacement . NOT the case ... all batteries in this thing died in less then 30 minutes and thus this is useless for me.Other B & D ; 18volt tools , including the weed whacker work for 45 minutes plus and usually have full power for the first 30 minutes.Sorry B & D ; but this is useless , IMHO . 1/5	-1
Plastic bag with a few metal rings . Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides . The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook . If this was free , you would still not want it . Get a pot and a tomato cage . ; )	-1
I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006 , thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area . I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio . When they arrived , I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find . Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method , but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks . My husband ( operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong ) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil , both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October , with our first frost . If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs , do n't purchase . Considering the trouble I had with this product , I would not purchase this item again , and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly , try the traditional method . I 'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground !	-1
Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world . I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results ... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy . I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes . Well to make it short , the harvest was embarrassing . I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability , watering , nutes , and overall yield per plant . Well the 3 gallon performed the best , giving me way more than 5 pounds of tomatoes easily every couple weeks . The topsy turvey even underperformed the 1 gallon and thats hard to do . These crimson cushions are HUGE and PLUMP , almost as big but not as dense as a beefsteak and in the T.T . they looked like cherry tomatoes , the color was , flavor was missing , and most of all the beauty of the plant just wasnt there . Great idea gone bad since this a path off of vertical growing . Vertical can get you 10 x the yield of any ordinary plant in any size container , but this is not as good of an idea as originally thought up . Hope this helps , stick to nature and dig a hole , dont have one than buy a 3 gallon pot and reap the benefits . One love my friends	-1
I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success . I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die . Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer . I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help . I will not buy these again .	-1
I am a Master Gardener , which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours . We ca n't teach old wive 's tales , just scientifically proven plant info ( but some of the old wive 's tales have been proven , so they are O.K . : - ) ) . These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness . They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants . I am giving two stars for the novelty factor , but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down	-1
This thing really makes no sense at all . I was given one of these as a gift , so I used it . But I also grow tomatoes in a garden every year , so I will use that for my pro/con comparison after using the Topsy Turvy this past summer.Cons:1 . Costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato plants.2 . Needs potting soil which adds to the cost.3 . Must water EVERY day or the tomato plant drys out very quickly.4 . Does n't produce nearly as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground ( or in a big pot ) .5 . Not reusable as the `` bag '' became brittle and falls apart after a summer in the sun.Pros:1 . Takes up very little space as long as you have a place to hang it ( note : it must be a sunny place ) .2 . Seems built well enough not to break easily ( at least for one summer 's use ) .3 . You do n't have to `` stake '' the plant so the vines do n't break . Hanging upside-down , the vines are fine.4 . Plants growing upside-down are interesting to look at.But really , this thing makes no sense . Why plant something upside-down ? You could plant your tomato plant right-side-up in this thing and you would probably be better off , and you would not be bothered with the extra effort involved in planting it upside-down . In fact , you could buy any decent-sized hanging basket and plant a tomato plant in it and let the vines tumble over the side of the pot and have nearly the same thing . Or just buy a big pot if you have a place on the ground to put it ( but staking the vines would be better then ) . But , it does n't have to be upside down . The upside-down concept is just a gimmick to get you to buy this thing instead of a regular hanging basket.Since I have this thing and a place to hang it , I would have probably used it again , excepting for the fact that the plastic `` bag '' becomes brittle and falls apart when you touch it after a season in the sun . So you wo n't be able to use this year after year as there is no way it would stay together when handled enough to replant another tomato plant in it . They should have used a plastic that is n't destroyed by the sun . So do n't buy this thing with the thought that you can use it season after season.Anyway , the kids look at it strange , so at least it is interesting . But that bit of unusual-ness is its only real value . If you just want tomatoes and do n't care about the upside-down gimmick , there is really no reason to buy this . Just buy any pot or hanging basket and plant your tomato right-side-up.But it does work , and once you plant your tomato you do n't have to stake it up , and it is interesting to some to see a plant growing upside-down , so I give it a rating of two stars even though I find it really is pretty goofy to begin with . And you are not going to get as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground . But thinking about it , if I used my own money to buy it ( instead of receiving it as a gift ) , I would only give it one star . Really , it is a silly thing useful only as a gimmick to grow a tomato plant upside down . If this is your only choice , buying tomatoes at a farmer 's market would probably make more sense .	-1
For starters , there are no instructions . Look at the pictures . There only two screws and they hold the body to the base ... kind of . There 's a door on the front , seems intuitive , but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open . Maybe I 'm slow , but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where . Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit : I just used it and could not dump the ashes . Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab . With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which is n't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing . I really want to love it , but , so far , we 're not doing well .	-1
I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient . After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping , we just felt that it did n't cut it . We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so ( the saving grace was that there were 3 of them , so there was always another one ready to go -- so long as you were using one machine at a time ) . Also , I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes . The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges . The blower blows grass around -- do not even think about using it on leaves . I can not speak for the weedwacker , as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it .	-1
Clearly of quality construction , but far too expensive given options that are available . Mine were stolen from my garage , and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $ 19.00 . They come with a life-time replacement guarantee . The $ 19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use .	-1
The travel settings are very difficult to use and it often sticks . It also sprays as much water out the side as forward . The tripod is the only good thing about this sprinkler .	-1
This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening . The foam may be water resistant , but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it . The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used , and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on ( for instance your knees and sticks below your pad ) . The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening ; therefore , I would not recommend this product for gardening .	-1
I was disappointed since I thought it would be stronger . I still use metal trowel for digging when durability of a tool is needed .	-1
I am not happy with this trowel because it bends when digging in hard/compacted soil . I suppose if you have sandy loam ... you might be good . Not for me .	-1
A baby red squirrel ... well ... .this is his dream buffet ... attaching photos ! I will attach 5 photos as proof ... He 's a cutie and he is very photogenic ! I bought three of these . Scroll down to Customer photos the last 5 photos are mine ... It 's a very cute squirrel but to call this squirrel proof is totally FALSE !	-1
I only had to keep this for one day to realize that it had a manufacturing defect which may or may not be evident on others.The cutting blade only has a washer on one side . When you try to cut something as large as 2 & # 34 ; the blade will bend to the sideand cut into the stop . Bad deal . I returned it for a friskas which I am happy with .	-1
The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle . Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end . That means that you can use a soapy paper towel ( rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap ) , to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush . This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean . It comes with a small `` S-Hook '' for hanging , too .	-1
I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied , however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk . If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly , they leak , and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded . The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on .	-1
Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away . Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked . Since then , the other three started leaking also . Do n't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months , but I am going to try . I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years . Somebody `` improved '' them.Update : I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever . Hav n't received them yet , so I do n't know how these will perform .	-1
The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away ( better than the saucer kind ) but it started leaking after a couple months . Pretty unreliable .	-1
The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle , much nicer than plastic . Even at that , the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder `` mop '' or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic , this feeder is not even useable . I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy . It leaks when the wind blows . It leaks when the temperature rises . It leaks just because it feels like leaking . And that attracts ants , armies of tiny , biting ants . I 've tried filling it to almost the top and I 've tried putting just a bit of food in it - does n't matter , it leaks.Even if that were n't a problem , I still would not like this feeder . The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean . The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties . A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all . I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold , and be bad for the birds.So , this product is for the birds . And very much NOT for the birds , not if you care about them .	-1
Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me ( it is made in China ) , I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive . It looks just like a barn on my daughter 's farm . It is red , has a weathervane on top , windows and a metal roof . It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much . Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything , but so far they have not been attracted to this feeder . I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it . It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived . It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it . Apparently , the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food . We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old , we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water . This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds ( Cardinals , Finches , etc . ) will return . The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there has n't been that much activity at the new red feeder , they too are n't visiting us too frequently . I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well , here is an update : after using this bird house for approximately two months , it has broken . The metal rod that holds the rooster on top ( this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into ) has vanished . This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and can not find the rest of the pieces anywhere . Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside . I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration .	-1
The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it 's flimsier than it looks from the photos . The construction is thin sheet metal , with sharp edges.I do n't know why there are so many positive reviews . It 's a less effective feeder than cheaper options ( i.e. , the birds do n't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic ) , and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed . Meanwhile , the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger ( which is shown in the photos ) , or it has a large shaft through the middle , so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top , but it 's also poorly engineered .	-1
I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby . The birds do n't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet .	-1
I have had this unit for seven months , now . It honestly is just a cheap device , turned out cheaply , to cash in on the solar craze now going on . I 'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy . This unit does not . Yes , it reads fine on my multimeter , when I check it , but the battery on my RV is not staying charged . I have gone through two charge controllers , so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit , here . I am in a city with almost 90 % very sunny days . This panel gets full , blazing sun , just about daily , for seven hours . You get what you pay for , and you do n't get much , apparently , at the price this unit goes for . My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit . It charges and holds charge when I 'm on the road . Again , it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel . Spend more for a better unit .	-1
As a few others have posted , in here , the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor . The wiring on my unit was reversed . Once I set things right , the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure . My battery died in the bargain , due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel . I 'll try one more and then update this review . Update : I just ordered : KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp , 100 Watt , ... At just $ 10 , on this site , it 's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition . The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate . As far as the reversed wiring goes , in all electrical applications with connectors , an exposed contact is normally the ground , coming from a power source . The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact , which would result in a shock . This scheme is reversed , obviously , in the non-powered side of the circuit , ie. , the thing you 're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described . When I called Sunforce 's rep , in Canada , and spoke with him , he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring . That 's really curious , as others have posted about the reversals , as I mentioned , above . UPDATE : 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly . You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit , as above , alone . It costs much more and is inferior .	-1
My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit . But if it works better than the others , perhaps it is worth it . I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house . After two weeks of testing , they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug . I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition , the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it 's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time . The buzzing noise is loud , you will hear it if you are in the same room . Finally , this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect , it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $ 34 a pop , it just does n't strike me as good value for money . At this time , I can not recommend it.I 'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try , the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic plastics without it . This feeder has many _great_ properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
Before ordering , I was afraid of having a cheap plastic bearing inside . No where in the internet , including manufacturer 's web site , I could check the spec on this part , nor anyone of reviewers commented on the type of ball inside . This one does incorporates metal ball bearing , but have a similar characteristics as $ 0.99 plastic part , badly leaking water at the joint . Time wasted to make it function like a simple shut-off valve , in order to save time required on returning , just priceless . Now , I understand why unusually high number of negative feedback on this junk . Over last few years , we have become so acquainted to junk imported from China , it 's just amazing how some users will tolerate badly designed and manufactured pats.I had no idea that designing a water shut-off valve was such a difficult task , that requires a special skill . It 's made to leak , no matter how much connector is tightened . I thought Gilmour was a reputable American manufacturer , and I 'm totally off . Do engineers at Gilmore check the prototype before sending its design to full production , or do marketing people actually check if it 's viable product ? Please do not write reviews without thoroughly checking them first , or post phony reviews your untruthful reviews are wasting other people 's valuable time .	-1
I cooked my seeds with this contraption . The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control . Though all in all I like that all the components were included .	-1
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product . The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense . If it was that easy , there would n't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening . But I do n't buy a dedicated germination kit . The standard seeding kits available for $ 3.00 are fine . I have one I like for the windowsill , not because I love the brand or soil it contains , but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL ! ! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly . The cost is ridiculous and , if you really want to heat your seedlings , then put an electric blanket or throw under them . You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $ 20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket , the seedlings start a bit earlier . And if in a colder area ( basement/attic ) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear . But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area . If you want a smaller area , fold the blanket . Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70 , but your environment may be different . Do n't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate , these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money . If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you ca n't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window , then get a heating blanket and a grow light . Much cheaper in the long run .	-1
This would be a great timer . It is easy to set . Keeps the settings when you change batteries . Resists water . Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program . The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability . Mine stopped working within a week . The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon .	-1
So far I 've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers , but I 've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart . The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died ( and it was my fault ) when I left it out for a day during a freeze ( note : I live in southern Texas , and by `` freeze '' I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night ) . The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate . I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer . Having learned my lesson , I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry , insulated , garage . The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less . The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring . When spring came , the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine , the physical water restrictor would no longer move . I ordered replacement # 3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue . I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again , same exact issue.Now , I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue . Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly . However with my two `` mostly-broken '' units I 've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion ( I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit , it all looked the same ) . I should also note that I have aOrbit 62032 Yard Watering Systemin my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running . After multiple tries with the 62001 , I 've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robustOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerin hopes that it might last longer than a year.I 've given these units two stars ( instead of one ) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units . When these worked , they worked flawlessly day-after-day . Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze . I just wish they would last .	-1
This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons . This one did n't even last this season . not wasting any more money on these things .	-1
Granted , out of the box this API water agitator does n't look like much . Packaged with ( 3 ) metal legs , ( 4 ) rubber anchors and ( 1 ) metal agitator , set up takes seconds . I slapped in two D cell batteries ( not included ) and placed this unit into our bird bath . I like the fact that no wiring is required . It is quiet . The continuous agitation does repel mosquitoes . There is a rubber gasket in place to prevent water seepage into the motor housing . Trust me it does n't work.I 'm not a big fan of the snap in metal legs . The legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion . I get about three months juice before its time to replace the batteries . I add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear . It must work because I see both birds and butterflies dropping in for a visit . Now the bad news . It did n't even make through the summer . The high price tag on this lemon is another reason to think other options .	-1
I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain , especially since I bought it for my wife , who is short and catch reach the top of the van . Also , do n't mistake this for an ice scraper ; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle .	-1
Bought this about 4 years ago from another site ( much more expensive ) . It worked well.The pole holding it gave out ( wet soil from heavy rain and snow ) , and the feeder hit the ground ( frozen grass ) . It literally smashed into about 10 pieces ; I do n't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings ( over the tops ) did NOT break . Only this feeder broke ! ! I suspect that it was either weather-worn , OR an old ( ER ) feeder with limited life to the plastic , OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away , I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected ( anchored in cement ) , i.e. , NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame : an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY , they said that an animal probably got at it , but they could n't guess which one . DUH . I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break , AND that the other barn style feeder , only a few feet away , was not touched , basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr : Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder ! ? I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos . I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they 'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer : NO REPLACEMENT ; must have been an animal attack ( their words ) .BOTTOM LINE : Forget the lifetime support . They wo n't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company . The emails were almost accusative ; really off-putting , as if to discourage further contact . And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break . We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I 'd like this feeder again , but I 'll be d ... .d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime ? An ant 's ? Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that `` some '' animal attacked it , and they do n't support animal attacks . Great excuse ( not ) .	-1
The birds do n't like it at all ... .I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do . I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this . If you do n't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor , and it 's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground . I would have to say that I ca n't see how a squirrel would get to the food ... I will say that about it . But what good is it if the birds do n't get to it either ? I 'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds .	-1
For everyone out there that is an avid bird feeding enthusiast , you are by now well aware that you will spend half your time selecting seed , buying feeders , setting up and tending to them , and the other half battling squirrels for control of them . Squirrel 's are nothing less than amazing in both their tenacity and technique when it comes to getting at the bird seed we desire so desperately to keep them away from . Squirrel baffles of all shapes and design are only effective about half the time at best . And weight sensitive perches are soon made obsolete or at least only partially effective when word gets around as to how to hang down from above and keep your body weight elsewhere . This very expensive squirrel buster is really nothing but a little better design on an old idea . The weight sensitive perch is nothing new . Its been in the arsenal of attack on squirrels for quite a few years now . A weight sensitive perch is only as effective as what 's overhead for the wily squirrel to hang his feet on and drop below . The squirrel buster does just about as good a job at making the top of its feeder pretty near paw proof as I have encountered , but not totally . My neighbor who owns one of these has seen quite a few squirrels attempt to drop from above to the seed below only to slip and fall , ( much to her giggling delight ) . However not a day goes by that some future Olympian worthy fellow somehow manages to lock his feet above securely and feast on the spoils now at his disposal below . Now that she has had it for a few weeks it has become an everyday event that at least a couple of squirrels beat the system . Its my opinion that there is no such thing as a foolproof squirrel busting feeder . This one is close , but at the price their asking for it I do n't consider it a worthwhile investment at all . Take away its design and its no better made than any other feeder costing half its price . It will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean . Its all up to the individual of course . But its my take that this feeder is extremely overpriced regardless of its promise and performance . If you are interested in a feeder that is every bit as squirrel proof as this one and is about a third the price , try the Backyard Bistro bird feeder available on the web . I own 5 of them and they are made of very tough impenetrable vinyl and aluminum and its shape and hardness makes it just as effective against squirrels as the buster here . You can even buy six of these in a case for the price of two of these feeders , and with free shipping thrown in . Check it out and see for yourself . And happy hunting !	-1
As mentioned in other reviews , this is NOT for cars and trucks . I bought it for use on the riding mower , filling smaller cans and for my dual sport bike . It 's virtually impossible to fill any of these without spilling.But worst of all , it split along the seam at the top and sloshes gas out when carrying and fills it 's storage area with fumes . Forget it !	-1
I have this and several other cans with this new stupid design ( thanks liberals ) due to all the tree hugging environmentalists . You end up spilling more gas with these new cans and need 3 hands to try and use it with some success . These are worse for the environment then the old style which were fine .	-1
I purchased this fuel can because I have a small diesel Kubota Tractor . I needed a five gallon can in order to fill the tractor 's tank . The tank on the tractor is conveniently located on the top of the tractor . I have found it pretty much impossible to fill the tractor with diesel from this can without spilling all over myself , and all over the ground , creating both a safety and environmental problem.The ill conceived idea behind this gas can is that the pour spout is rigid and you have to rest a lever on the pour spout on the rim of the gas tank , pushing up on the lever , and then releasing the flow of gas . This does not work at all . You end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand . Remember the can is 5 gallons , and it is too heavy to try and support with one hand . So , for this device to even come close to working , you need at least 3 hands , and preferably four . In frustration , you finally take the pour spout off , and pour directly from the can into the tank , which pours diesel all over yourself.Making the device even more useless , it does not have a vent opening anywhere , so even under ideal circumstances , you can not pour from it.One wonders if they even ever tried to use this thing before they sold it.AVOID ! ! !	-1
To call this & # 34 ; spill proof & # 34 ; is ridiculous ! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine . Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout , thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister , and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work . I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead . If I can find a replacement cap at least I wo n't have completely wasted 20 bucks . Not recommendedPros : will hold 5 gallons , does have 2 handles , is fairly stableCons : the nozzle is a waste of time , there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place	-1
Update : Stopped working effectively after about 16 hours of use . James on a twig slightly larger than a matchstick and then makes a whining noise and a nice electric burning smell until I whack it with my hand a few times , then it 'll work in a promising manner until you actually bring the blade to bear on a hedge . I 've found that the cutting bar is so flimsy you can bend it permanently without much effort . Might be why its jamming all the time . Might be interesting to try to bend it to a semi circle for custom cutting before I jam it into the garbage can ... No power , fibber marketing guys , impractical for anything other than marginal light duty work here and there . Very first piece of outdoor equipment that I 've bought that just stopped working after a short usage period . Maybe i 've been fortunate. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- original review : I 'll say something good first . Its not the worst hedge trimmer i 've used . ( update : yes it is ) That having been said , the box shows that its ten feet long , and after fiddling with it for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to extend it and reading the manual twice , i came to the conclusion that this includes the height of the person holding it . Love the marketing spin ... The cutting end is a good 7-8 lbs . Try holding that at an angle on the end of the ( actually ) four foor pole for a while . Would have been brilliant to put the motor on the bottom and some kind of actuation through the pole and just the blade on top.The specs say it 'll cut almost a half inch . Not exactly . Anything about a third of an inch or so will stop the blade dead . Now you 've got a heavy cutter on the end of a long pole stuck on a branch . If you 're lucky , you 're also on a ladder.Not worth a hundred bucks .	-1
Too heavy and kink . Hard to carry around . Expensive to much for female gardener . I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds .	-1
These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves . Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal , that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature . Cooking mitts , on the other hand , need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat . They also need to insulate even if they 're wet.I found that this glove , despite being well made and attractive , is no good for holding hot items . At best , it protects hand and arm while grilling , if you 're using tongs , lets say , over a very hot fire . Just do n't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it .	-1
I LOVED this filler & gauge , until I started blowing tires . I had a hunch the low price for this gauge was too good to be true . Although the convenience of the filler/deflator is fantastic , the quality of the gauge itself is horrible . After blowing two tires on one recent trip , I used two other quality gauges to verify the pressure . It turned out that my tires were all over inflated by 15-20 PSI . I filled them cold like I always do ( either in the evening or the morning ) , but they were way over inflated . This had never happened to me before . I have two of these inflators ( one in the garage and one in the RV ) , so I pulled out the other one to double-check the gauge on that one . Compared to my other two high-quality gauges , that one was off by almost 10 PSI too . So I threw both of these in the trash and stopped using them . It 's a shame too , because I loved these things . It 's not worth it if the gauges are n't accurate though .	-1
Written in the blush of new ownership : Let 's be clear , this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw . I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning . Having said that , it cuts very well , has sufficient power for the purpose , is not too loud and is well balanced . It is well made for the duty for which it is designed . Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic . Mine is metal . It looks like it might be pretty light , but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it . I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use . I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience : Over the past 10 months or so , I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks . I do n't think this constitutes a lot of use . The painted name on the bar is barely marred . The chain is still quite sharp . Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain . Chain is nice and sharp , everything is great , except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still . Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted . I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted . This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated . The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the `` general questions '' section was closed , their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time . I ca n't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase .	-1
These are not brass . They are made from cheap pot metal ( recycled mix of aluminums ) covered with a thin brass plating . ( The similar looking Orbit brand is made this way too . ) They will work well for a while , long enough to lure you into writing a great review for them , but they will eventually fuse to the real brass fitting on your hose and your faucet and may not be removable without ruining both your hose and the faucet on your house . Before they get to that state , as the metal deteriorates , they will begin to dribble , so you will be tempted to tighten them further , making later removal impossible without damaging your hose and faucet . Since the metal is aluminum , not brass , the inserted piece will scratch a bit each time you insert it or detach it , and over time this accumulation of wear will cause it to leak at the fitting . The black plastic over the fittings will twist and fail to grab the knurled metal beneath it , so you may have to use a wrench to install . Again , these will work very well for a year or so , and after that you are cuing up for a big problem . Gilmore alleges a guarantee on these , but other reviews have said they do not respond if you call them on it , so your only recourse would be if Amazon would cover it , which is unlikely at the point where these will start giving you trouble . Either way , they are n't going to pay for your ruined hose fitting and faucet.The good news is that there is a better set available on Amazon , also made by Gilmore , and unless they have cheapened the design or materials since I last purchased them , they are far superior : Gilmour 09QCGT 2-Piece Green Thumb Brass Quick Connector Set for Hose	-1
Threads not good and I had to toss it in the junk pile.Saving it for a crooked hose thread where it might workwith a force crank . Be careful . If buying retail look for damaged orimproperly mfg threads .	-1
Birds do n't like this feeder and have never used it to feed from despite my moving it to various locations in my attempt to get them to feed from it . Useless !	-1
I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds . I knew instantly this was a mistake , but thought I would give it a try . One lasted only a few days at best . A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground . Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground . The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps , but again , the same thing happened . Food everywhere and a useless feeder . I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience . Sorry to have to give it a one star , but I ca n't find a reason to even go for two .	-1
PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE AFTER THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW.We have been plagued with squirrels for years . Our neighborhood has vast numbers of large oak and pecan trees with a smattering of fruit trees . These provide food and shelter for these little critters so they multiply like crazy and typically overrun the area . They dig up flower beds , destroy container plants , dig holes in the lawn and devour one small bite out of every pecan and piece of fruit before it matures . If that 's not bad enough , they have chewed through the wood trim on our home and made nests in the attic . Squirrels are NOT cute little cartoon critters . They are destructive tree rats . Over the years , I 've tried to keep them at bay by using various home remedy methods -- from putting ground red pepper around plants to using a pellet gun to permanently remove individuals . Nothing worked . They liked hot pepper and for every one I killed , three more would take its place.With this in mind , I was skeptical of `` Deer Off '' . But I was willing to give it a try and I actually think it may be working ... at least for the short term . After spraying a liberal amount of `` Deer Off '' around the base of trees , in flower beds and around container plants , the squirrels seem to be staying away . It 's been a little under two weeks since the initial application of the product and I 've only seen one squirrel at a time in the back yard . In the past , they came in gangs of more than a dozen -- sometimes as many as two dozen at one time . So far so good.The label says `` Deer Off '' deters animals by smell and taste but it is odorless to humans `` once dry '' . I never noticed an odor as I sprayed it and I have a pretty sensitive nose . It 's also supposed to last for months even after rain or watering of plants . I ca n't verify this but I 'm keeping my fingers crossed . If there 's anything I dislike about the product it is the silly battery-powered sprayer container . I 've noticed this trend in lawn care products recently and I do n't like it . Batteries and battery-powered pumps add an unnecessary expense to the products , they add unnecessary complications should electrical components fail and they add unnecessary waste to landfills . It 's not difficult to pump up a sprayer and let air do the work . And , of course , air is free . In my opinion , the advent of battery-powered sprayers is a dumb marketing idea that should be rectified as soon as possible.I 'm giving `` Deer Off '' four stars due to my short term observation that it appears to be working with the local squirrels . Docked one star permanently for the battery-powered sprayer.UPDATE 06/12/2012 : I guess I was too optimistic . The squirrels are back . Digging in the lawn , digging in the flower beds and digging in the plant containers.Yeah , that did n't last too long . No big rains to wash it away either . It just quit working . And at over 30 bucks for the large bottle , I ca n't recommend it as a temporary solution .	-1
Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program . However , while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels , I guess rabbits did n't read it . The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect . But , judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards , I suspected it was n't working . My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere , perimeter and main lawn , and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away . Maybe they like eggs , but it does n't appear to work on rabbits , at least not the ones I have here in San Diego .	-1
This did n't seem to accomplish a whole lot and I found getting it up and running sort of fussy . Maybe the wildlife in other areas is a little more bothered by it , but here it just ended up being more trouble than it was worth for the amount of actual effect that I felt I was getting .	-1
The instructions for this product are easy to follow and I had it ready to spray , theoretically , within seconds . However the sprayer just would n't spray . I checked and replaced the batteries . I took it apart several times and still could n't get it to work . I read the directions again and noticed a phone number with the pledge that the company 's highest objective was to serve the customer . So I called and got a toy company . They informed me that they had been bought by another company and they did n't have a forwarding number . I got on the internet , located a working number , and finally got to talk to a human being after the usual push button 1 , then 2 , and so on . She said she would be happy to send a replacement product . But I needed to get a specific number off the bottom of the package . I hunted down the package but alas , the number had been defaced . Too bad for me and I was unable to get a replacement.I decided to just sprinkle the product around my flower garden but it did n't have any effect at all . So maybe the liquid needs to be sprayed directly onto the flowers which was impossible to do without the proper sprayer . So basically it was worthless . I 've tried other products from this company that worked . Maybe you will have a different experience .	-1
The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks , not the claimed three months , and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I 've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them . I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard . Two weeks later I 'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well . I like the safety lock just below the sprayer 's trigger . I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved .	-1
it was easy to assemble , it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that 's all it did . The rabbits came last night , and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage . I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine . 10 1/2 hours later , all the 25 ft. row of collarobi ( sp ) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets . They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down . It DOES N'T work . All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray does n't matter if it does n't work and it does n't ... . I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in , coons and skunk and deer ca n't . Save your money ... ... ... ... . put barbed wire around your garden ... UPDATE : I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it , including the motor on the sprayer . I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES , I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing ... .. The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless ...	-1
As a gardener , I 'm familiar with Deer Off . Like most of the smelly deer repellents , it works , but has to be renewed after rainfall.As a codger , I 'm finding hand-held sprayers somewhat of a chore , particularly when spraying the whole garden , so I welcomed the idea of an electric spray gun.Unfortunately , this one does n't work.I read the instructions carefully , shook the container , inserted the feed to the pump and pulled the trigger . Result - not much . The pump whined away for a while , but nothing came out of the nozzle . Eventually , after several minutes , with the batteries starting to show the strain , the pump primed , and a stream of liquid came out . When I adjusted the nozzle to convert the stream to a spray , the result was disappointing - there was n't enough pressure to produce a decent spray . I tried spraying some of my shrubs , but the results were unsatisfactory.As an experiment , I tried cleaning the intake with water , in case it had been blocked . During the process , I found an interesting phenomenon - the pump produced a good spray pattern when handling water , but not the thin sludge that is Deer Off.Bottom line - it does n't work . It might be better with a more powerful pump .	-1
The sprayer works well and it 's so convenient to use . Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it 's absolutely amazing . Not a squirrel since and it does n't hurt the birds . Where has this been all my life ? June 2012 update : The pump only worked the first time and since then I 've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver . Even then , when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry , NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers . I guess anything is better than starving . Ditto with the squirrels . They eat their way through the product to get to the food .	-1
It does n't mention this in the product description ( but does on the bottle ) , but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants . Well , I 'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem , and if I ca n't spray it on things I 'm going to eat , it 's useless to me . This , despite saying it 's safe for use around kids . Had I known this from the description , I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses , and it does keep the deer away ( although it stiiiiiinks ) .If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale , I 'll update .	-1
I ordered this product in desperation . The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden . I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat . 1 day things were good then my peas disappeared . I am very disappointed .	-1
When I saw this offered , I jumped on it . So far the deer had eaten all my lily 's , including my day lily 's and were beginning to start on my tiger lily 's . Add in the echinacea and my beautiful garden was almost gone . As soon as this arrived , I began spraying.Assembly of the unit was easy . Batteries were already installed , so it was simply a matter of unscrewing the cap and placing the siphon hose in the canister and tightening the lid . Unfortunately , the batteries were dead . So a run to the store for new batteries . Try again . The sprayer began spraying when depressing the trigger button . ( Batteries should be packaged separately so they do n't run down , me thinks ) Sprayed the flowers and the area around them . Given the smell of this stuff , I was sure it would work . ( Yes you can smell it and it is vile ) . One caution , do n't spray on a windy day if you have to stand downwind of the sprayer . I could feel the hot pepper working in my nose and mouth.Went inside and waited to see what would happen over night - would the deer be back ? In a word , yes . From the amount of deer dung ( copious amounts ) on the ground around my flower beds , it was more like a herd instead of one or two . As I walked closer , two rabbits jumped from the echinacea and hopped across the yard . All the day lily blossoms were gone , as were the heads of my tiger lily's.Does this stuff work ? In a word , no . Maybe it 's just the wild game around my place , but it seemed to me that Deer Off was more like a salad dressing attracting the animals instead of deterring them .	-1
I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels . Well first of all , it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds . Then , when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least , the squirrels do n't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell . Even my dogs do n't seem to be bothered by the smell . In fact , they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs , I ca n't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but do n't waste your money if you have squirrels . This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters .	-1
I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence . Unfortunately , one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter . I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away . The result was $ 60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain . It did n't my local animals one bit ! Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat ! Actually , I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden . Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music !	-1
I was excited to try this product out to protect my roses from hungry deer - but I could not get the battery operated sprayer to prime . It seems an overly complicated design for a simple product . Now I will have to pour it into a traditional sprayer to see if it works .	-1
I had high hopes for this product , as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds . This product works as advertised , flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters . Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action . However , the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official ; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells After three days or so , the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant . They are persistent pests that wo n't hide in terror on seeing me . Believe me I am quite scary . I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment .	-1
Well , I 've tried everything I know to do , and so has my husband , to get the sprayer to spray . The batteries are good and properly inserted , the motor is functioning but nothing will come out . We 've carefully followed the directions on priming , checked for kinks in the hose , turned the blue nozzle to to the `` on '' position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid . Yet , it simply wo n't spray.Since the sprayer wo n't work , my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed . So , at this point I do n't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters , but the sprayer definitely does n't function as it should . Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing . I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied .	-1
Deer Off and I are not doing as well as I hoped due to the smell , drought , batteries , ingredients.The drought and water restrictions have all the varmints in survival mode seeking food , water and shelter . More regularly seen squirrels and rabbits plus formerly unseen creatures ( bobcats , coyotes ) have arrived en masse . So taking a chance on Deer Off was a no brainer to get them to move along . I do n't have a DEER problem so I can not indicate if this works on them.However , it FAILED to repel the squirrels and rabbits and was an unpleasant HUMAN experience due to : - non-working batteries I had to replace , - pungent smelly concoction had me gagging , - ingredients can cause allergic reactions ... READ detailed ingredients BEFORE purchase.Although an application of this deterrent can last up to 3 months , heavy rain and your lawn sprinkler can rinse it away requiring another application of Deer Off . The battery powered sprayer makes for easier application without your trigger finger falling off and their customer service is pleasant and helpful.All in all , I would n't buy this product .	-1
Just like other animal repellants ( and I 've tried many ) , the Havahart repellant ( Havahart also make traps ) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy , so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products . In fact , you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective : repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables . Deer , squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged .	-1
I 'm not sure if it 's supposed to be this way , but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk . The package was marked `` ready to use , '' so I know it 's not meant to be diluted . I do n't know what happened , but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency . Since I received it , it 's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing , but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out . The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off , this would be a great product . I ended up `` painting '' some of the leaves of my squash where I noticed the rodent damage yesterday . I 'll report back if they quit nibbling . If it works , I have ornamental plants that the jackrabbits wo n't leave alone that I 'll try it with.The dogs enjoyed the smell of the Deer Off . I really did n't detect any obnoxious odor .	-1
I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while . It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time , and the relatively large expense of the product . I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds . The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals , so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food .	-1
I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine ! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer . They tend to come ( and go ) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product . Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch . Batteries included ( and installed ) . All I had to do was take off the cap , put the hose in and tighten the cap . Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low ( in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle ) ... that 's how siphoning tends to work : ) ~ After just about draining the batteries , the liquid *finally* started coming out . Of course , I had to replace the batteries after I 'd been spraying for about three minutes . Not sure if the batteries are cheap , old , or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days , the deer were back and were snacking on my plants . I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd 's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder . Well that worked like a charm . Not ! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that 's about all I could smell . If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY , REALLY work , try Liquid Fence . I 've been using this product effectively for about ten years . You can get it in mixed form ( a bit cheaper ) , or in concentrated form ( which is what I buy ) . That is more expensive , initially , but it is well worth the cost . Here 's the link , I hope it works : http : //www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1341177361 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond ! Rotten eggs , vinegar , garlic and tons of other great , stinky stuff to keep the deer away . It does n't work on squirrels though ( I have n't found anything that does ) . And you have to reapply as new growth appears ( deer loooove the tender greens ! ) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants . Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work . You WILL smell this when you spray ! Do n't be downwind of it : ) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off . HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence : )	-1
SEE UPDATE at end for the rating change from 3 star to 2 star.I obtained this item through the Amazon Prime Program . I have a large yard with bird feeders and that attracts a lot of squirrels and rabbits . I have tried chasing them off , but that is almost like swatting at a fly with a tissue . A lot of exercise on your part , entertainment on the critters part , and nothing changes.I thought that since this product is safe to use around animals and did not appear to be a bio hazard that I would give it a try . Here are my thoughts on the product : First , the Sprayer:1 . While the unit comes with batteries ( 4 AA batteries ) , they did not last more than a few minutes . I had to install new batteries to get anything out of the sprayer.2 . The sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray . While it will put out a stream , it does not go very far . As for a wide spray , I guess wide is in the eye of the beholder . It is not very wide and it only travels about 3 feet from the sprayer . I good hand pump sprayer that you can re-use for other sprays would work much better ! I have a 1.5 gallon sprayer that is pumped up by hand and it sprays this material 4 times farther and gives a nice fan spray ! I would have to rate the electric sprayer a 0 Star product as it is just not worth using and it comsumes batteries quickly.Second , the Deer Off Product:1 . The product seems to work as the rabbits and squirrels have not been back at the feeders since I used the spray . Of course , it has only been on for two weeks and it has not rained , so I do not know how long it will last . Still , it is working and that is saving my plants and the seed for the birds.2 . Having a premix product is fine , but it is a very expensive way to do anything , especially if you have a large area or if you need to reapply the product after a few weeks.Overall , I would rat the Deer Off product well , but the packaging and the battery powered pump I would not recommend . If you can buy the product as a concentrate , I would recommend it . I gave the product a 3 star rating due to the battery powered pump and the fact that it is a premix.UPDATE : Well , I guess two weeks is about the limit . Just a couple of days after writing the review the rabbits were back . I put the rest of the concentrate I had into a hand sprayer and then sprayed the plants again . That worked until we had a small rain shower pass through and then the rabbits were back.So , I now have to say that for the price this is definately NOT a good solution ! !	-1
The actual fluid may very well be working - it 's hard to tell . My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it 's more trouble than it 's worth . The alkaline AA batteries that came with it were n't producing any spray , so I replaced 'em with rechargeables . This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey 's fix but honestly , I 'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid 's effectiveness - well , *I* ca n't smell anything , but the DOG can , so he has added his own ingredients to the mix . We 'll see how THAT works out ! .	-1
Dead batteries , hard to push the safety switch to the safe position while keeping the sprayer pointed away from yourself.Fine print on the bottle says do not use on food plants , even though the Amazon page said that the product is recommended for organic gardening . Being OMRI listed and USDA approved for use in organic gardening is in direct contradiction to the instructions on the bottle.I had planned on using this for my cherry tomato plants , but the instructions on the package clearly say do not use on food plants.I did sacrifice one of my tomato plants , since I felt that a test of the spray would n't be complete without a plant that I know the deer love to eat.It was difficult using the sprayer , first was discovering that it had dead batteries , then of course I had to find replacement batteries . Then it took quite a while for the pump to prime . The safety switch is very difficult for me to place in the safe position while pointing the sprayer away from me , it might be easier for other people , as I have some limitations to hand strength.The spray went on ok once I had gotten all the bugs out of the system . It appears to work , but we have had quite a bit of rain , and it is very possible that the deer found somewhere else to munch on plants.Overall a two star item , since I grow mostly food plants , and I think the directions on the package over-ride what it says on the Amazon page	-1
It 's absolutely amazing ! I am an animal whisperer . All I have to do is spray the Deer Off around my landscaping and the critters they come a running . Not only is the salad bar open , but I 'm obviously using a peppery salad dressing that the critters love . Whooo hooo ! Is n't that how it 's supposed to work ?	-1
Upon getting the spray , I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up . It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started . Once i did , it was very good . It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream . There 's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all , reminded me of yogurt . It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you 've sprayed . The main ingredients are egg , capsacian and garlic . Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans . I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I 've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far , the squirrels are n't attacking by bird feeders . They ca n't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers . I wanted to give this a try because I ca n't spend all day chasing them away . They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat . You 'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders . I do n't care about the grounds but not on the feeders . I sprayed the polls and the feeders , without getting the openings for the seeds . I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds do n't seem effected at all . They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues . There were a few squirrels but they did n't stick around long . Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them ... lol . Again , I 'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts . Keep your fingers crossed ! UPDATE 6-14-12 : No Good , it seemed to work for a few days but now the squirrels are back and climbing up the plant hooks again . I sprayed the hooks and the bird feeders till they were dripping with the spray and it did n't stop them . Oh well ! on to other inventions .	-1
I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck . I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and it seems to have no effect on the squirrels .	-1
I have a bird feeder on top of a 10 ' pole , which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off . 5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off . I chased the squirrel away , and he was back in another 5 minutes . The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly . I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently . I also worry about poisoning the squirrels , since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically , on their underbellies , and then lick it off .	-1
I was only able to `` spray '' with this for a minute or so . Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything . I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old , but that did n't help at all , so it 's a mechanical fail.I 'm a person who cares about the environment , and the packaging disturbs me . The holster is plastic and does n't have a recycle number on it , so that will end up in the landfill . The battery powered sprayer does n't either , so the outside of that will end up in the landfill . Even though I 'll see what I can do about recycling the insides , I 'm sure many people wo n't and that will also end up in the landfill . To save the earth I 'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer . Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer . Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers , the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads . Product fail .	-1
This review reminds me of the old joke about the box of baking soda in the fridge put their to keep away elephants . The rationale is that if there are no elephants in the fridge , it must be working . I like the delivery system on this , it beats the heck out of the squeeze pump . I only saw deer once in my yard and after I sprayed I have n't seen them since . The big `` but '' is that I do n't have empirical evidence that the reason I have n't seen them again is the spray . It is easy to use and I guess it is working but I am hard pressed to offer any proof.addendum 6/8/13 I went to use this again and the battery spray no longer works . I ran it in warm water thinking it may have gotten gummed up but to no avail . So one use it worked , the second use the battery spray failed . I did replace the batteries although it was making noises with the old batteries , I gave that a shot anyway . Still did n't work . Since my primary reason for liking this was the delivery system I have downgraded my review rating .	-1
I have moved into a neighborhood teeming with wildlife : deer , raccoons , rabbits ... As much as I enjoy it , I 'd also like to have some landscaping . After carefully researching deer-resistant plants , I re-landscaped the whole yard with those choices . For additional insurance , I followed all of my neighbors ' advice & bought deer repellent . I chose this one as it specifically includes rabbits in the description of animals repelled by this product whereas the local nurseries could only steer me in the direction of deer resistant plants . I recognize that when animals are hungry they will eat anything but I used this product exactly as directed , we have not had a great deal of rain , & the rabbits & deer have eaten everything in my yard . According to the directions , it still should be working for at least another 6 wks . My neighbor uses a product called Plantskydd , also non-toxic & it really seems to work . It has an odor that would gag a sewer tank repair person but it does air out & still seems to keep the animals away . I would recommend that over Deer Off .	-1
I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing . I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem . Yes they are a problem . As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased , I was very careful , I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined . I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were clearly not tapped properly . If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head . It was not a question of lining them up , the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading and tapping pipe , I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine . The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right .	-1
I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof , and I was eager to try this version ; it seemed like a perfect upgrade . Unfortunately , I 'm very disappointed in it.First of all , one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked . It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder , but it looks a bit cockeyed . NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name ( and price ) .Next , I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder , not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little . With the roofless version , I could simply turn it over , shake out the hulls , add fresh seed , and shake it until all the seed was under the grid . That ca n't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.The posts are not fastened to the feeder ; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit . The roof is only balanced on the posts , not fastened , so if you turn over the feeder , posts go flying . The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger , which goes through the roof , so the screw and washer ca n't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way . Bottom line : The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it . Bare-handed most of the time , as it 's a fiddly process to get it all back together . In the cold and snow . Every couple days.The quality and filling hassles did n't stop my trying to use it , though . What ultimately retired this feeder was that `` Squirrel Blocker '' turned out to be merely a naming convention , not a description of the feeder 's performance . The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground . Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side , piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it . Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels ca n't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they ca n't climb up . If you have such a location , would like to add a platform feeder , and have a setup ( e.g. , handy picnic table ) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it , this feeder might fill the bill for you . It 's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects , and I think it would last a long time.However , any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it . If I had such a location , I would surely use it . Meanwhile , I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels .	-1
I occasionally get a bird using it to hop to another feeder but I have n't seen any stop to eat . A cardinal sized bird shy away from it . Squirrels , on the other hand , have no problem at all jumping on to it . I believe it was able to eat from it as well . I 'm not sure what to do with it now .	-1
The great reviews swayed me and I got this . I find this no better than a $ 5 or $ 10 sprayer from my local shop . Coupled with the $ 15 delivery charge from Amazon on this , $ 35 is a bit of a joke . The other thing that bothers me about the sprayer is that the spray is not `` instant '' . I press on the button and it takes a half second to actually come out ... also , more annoyingly , when I release the button it takes a good 2 or 3 seconds to stop spraying . This is seriously a pain when trying to do some precision spraying of fertiliser or medication . I 'm also not too impressed that there is no way to spray off the body of the sprayer . It would n't have taken a lot for the designers to allow the spray nozzle to connect to the first connector on the actual body of the sprayer . All-in-all , I feel really ripped-off by this . I only wish I could return it but Amazon will not allow it unless I pay to ship it back , which , at the lowest rate , would be about $ 30 . C'est la vie .	-1
Upside-down is the way to go . The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said , squirrels wo n't touch thistle , but they do like the seed mixes . This feeder is all plastic , including the perches , unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches . The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off . Also , the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch , so there 's a good chance of its falling out.In short , if this feeder lasts a couple of months that 's about all one can expect . If you want a more durable feeder , pay more for a better built model !	-1
I returned this product before I used it . I have chain saws but thought this would be an easy grab-and-go item for smaller jobs . But the thing requires oil every ten minutes of use ... ..and it takes a little doing to uncover the oil hole and do the job.It just seemed like an expensive toy that would be more trouble than cranking up the chain saw .	-1
I purchased this for use in my basement , cutting wood for the fireplace . I liked the lower jaw idea to avoid digging the chainsaw into the floor . Unfortunately , the design is extremely poor . The upper `` jaw '' kickback cover actually hits the chain when closed.One of the illustrations in the manual shows this upper jaw open perpendicular - when opened this far , the rear of the jaw actually impacts the chain . The chain cuts a large oval from the rear of the cover . When the jaw closes , it often does so at an off angle , actually hitting the chain , chewing up the upper jaw and dulling the chain . The lower jaw also closes crooked about 50 % of the time , causing the chain to cut into the lower jaw ! A photo on the box shows a person obviously cutting above shoulder height - yet one of the first warnings in the manual is to never cut above shoulder height ! This is common sense , but who approves the marketing and packaging ? ! ? The upper jaw has no `` stop '' except a small plastic flap . This broke off the third time I used the saw.If you run the saw with no wood in the `` jaws , '' the jaws snap open and closed as the chain randomly impacts them ! NOT SAFE ! When it cuts , it jams easily . Pieces of `` thready '' wood that a normal saw would kick out , get jammed up in the small gear that drives the chain . This has happened several times . Cutting dry wood - no problem . Cutting green wood , the `` thready '' pieces are a constant problem , necessitating the removal of the chain cover.The automatic oiler seldom works . I have to manually oil the chain . I have tried calling B & D ; 's toll free customer support number . I can never get a hold of anyone . I am regretful I purchased this shoddily designed item . I will add some photos showing the problems .	-1
I purchased these and then decided to run to Home Depot and see if they had them so I could use them sooner until my package arrived from Amazon . Home Depot had another brand called Revenge . I used the 4 from Revenge , each one smoked like they are supposed to . a few days later when the Giant Destroyers came , I needed to use those too and unfortunately , they did n't smoke , they shot a bright angry orange flame as if it was a blow torch . The GD 's you have to thread the fuse into the bomb which I thought was dumb . I also found that the GD 's smelled with stronger sulfur and could n't wash off the smell from my hands . I do n't know if they work or not as again they were blow torches and not smokers . Wo n't buy these again . Maybe i got a bad batch ? wo n't take the chance again though .	-1
This house may ( or may not ) leak , but it has a much more serious problem . My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other , so it 's useless . My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end ( as do all faucets ) . Also , the product smells really bad , so I 'm returning it to Amazon .	-1
Do n't waste your money on this piece of junk . The manor in which it stays open does not function properly at all . Real bad design ! ! There is no making this junk work . STAY AWAY . USE SOME OTHER TRAP !	-1
This electronic deer repellent is interesting , but I 'm afraid that there 's little way to know if it works . The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device , which sends an electrical shock to the deer . The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item . The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees . I 'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard , but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now . I guess that 's good though ... right ? I would say nice try , but maybe a bit off the mark .	-1
Well , for starters I live in Wyoming where deer in the yard is a menace , and if you are trying to start a yard with deer around forget about it . For three years now we have tried to re-landscape and resurrect our yard . Our high desert location is a major hurdle , but as our neighbors lawns prove it can be done the greatest enemy is actually the deer.These rods were just one more thing we tried and failed with . To be fair the scent that they are treated with is acorn which would be a completely alien scent to the deer in this area although I was hoping that it might lure them anyway . The rods were ignored . Also , I believe that the rainstorm that has hit us in the last three days might have shorted out the rods some how , as birds are roosting on them.This was an interesting idea and I was looking forward to seeing how it would pan out . So far the only thing we 've tried that has actually had any degree of success with has been straw . We covered the entire yard with straw to try and protect it for the winter and the deer actually seem to hate that . They wo n't even walk on it . Unfortunately when we raked it up for spring they 're baaaack !	-1
When human beings displaced deer from their natural habitat , we did something very disruptive - we replaced it with a much better habitat . Rather than pick among the sparse native shrubs , the deer now have a huge selection of succulent new food , imported into their environment at enormous expense . Not only that , but the suburbs discourage the predators which might have kept their numbers down : the many traffic accidents do n't compensate for this.Better habitat - fewer predators = uncontrolled population growth.Result ? Waking up in the morning , to find that all the tulips have vanished . Or worse , waking up in ER to find that you 've just collided with a deer.In the suburbs , the deer population has grown out of all proportion . We 'll welcome anything to keep the damned things out of our gardens . Unfortunately , killing them outright is illegal.The concept of the product is fairly simple . It 's basically a low-powered cattle prod , with a deer attractant . The idea is that the deer is attracted by the smell , licks the device , gets a mild shock , does n't like the experience . If they do it often enough , they get conditioned to stay away . Deer are not particularly intelligent , so the process takes a while . I 've been using devices like this for a few years . It works , a bit , but not well enough to replace deer repellent chemicals . The most effective repellent ( apart from a fence ) is spraying , but it has to be repeated . ( Even repellents do n't work for the young deer , who are unbelievably stupid , and will eat anything , including poisonous plants . ) This particular product is a tad clumsy . Others use a scent-impregnated piece of plastic , which needs to be replaced once a month ; this one has a ball of cotton wool , plus a bottle of attractant . I suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away . The instructions confirm this . Apparently I 'm supposed to add new attractant every week , and after rain . Not good.The instructions also recommend changing the attractant every so often , 'because the deer get used to it ' . This approach works for repellents , but is completely wrong for something designed to condition deer to stay away . I rather thought that the whole point is for the deer to associate the smell of the attractant with a shock ! Now that I 've installed these things in my garden , I realize that the people who design them did n't realize that they are supposed to blend into the environment . What possessed the manufacturer to give them red tops ! I 'll continue to use it throughout the season . If it seems more effective than its predecessors , I 'll let you know , but initial impressions are not favorable.Good luck in the Fight .	-1
This is a set of 3 battery-operated devices that are supposed to deter deer from eating your plantings . The devices consist of a plastic stake , about 18 '' high that you stick into the ground with a handy foot tab . On the top of each stake are two metal wires connected to a battery-operated charger , surrounding a casement that is to be filled with acorn-scented cotton balls ( cotton-balls and acorn scent included in the package ) . The intention is for the deer to be attracted by the acorn scent , sniff the top of the stake , get a mild shock from the wires , and then high-tail it out of your yard.The stakes were rather simple to assembly and load with AA batteries ( 2 needed for each stake ) . Instructions said to insert an entire cotton ball into each casement , but it was rather difficult to get an entire cotton ball in place . According to instructions , several drops of acorn scent should be distributed on the cotton balls after every rain , or at least once a week . I found it a little difficult to re-apply the scent drops with the sticks in the ground -- it 's much easier if you take the stakes out of the ground so you can apply the drops at an angle.The stakes are green plastic with red tips , and would probably be child-magnets for small children , so they are n't recommended for use around children . My hunch is that 1-3 year olds would learn to avoid the stakes even faster than deer , but I still would n't want to use them around young children . Older children might be tempted to pull up the stakes and use them for sword fighting , so they probably would n't be good to have in yards with older kids either.On the package , the manufacturer notes that the stakes are `` very effective '' in suburban areas where deer density is low and damage is mild , infrequent , and unpredictable . And `` not effective '' in rural areas where deer density is high , and damage is extreme and frequent . In other words , they 're most `` effective '' if you do n't have a real problem with deer . I was n't aware of these limitations when I ordered the product , but tried them out anyway in my blueberry plantings in front of my house , which is in a rural area with plenty of deer . I aimed my game camera at the stakes to see whether I could catch deer being deterred . My camera showed dozens of regular visits by deer to the blueberry plantings , in which the deer looked happy , content , and well fed , but not very deterred .	-1
I have to say that I am at fault for this one . I must have taken my stupid pills the day I requested these . For some reason I was thinking that `` electronic '' meant that there would be a sound deterrent or a light or something besides a shock . I should have read further before ordering.These were easy to assemble and install the batteries which were provided . My happiness ends there.The first thing that makes no sense is the `` lure '' that is applied to the tops of these . As a long time landscaper I learned eons ago that you never intentionally `` lure '' whatever you are trying to avoid ( i.e . japansese beetle traps ) . Only frustration and madness lie that way . So in order for these to work , you have to lure the deer to your yard so they can essentially stick their noses in the scent and therefore get this mild shock . It is all about training the animal as you would a dog with invisible fence.As someone who lives in a heavily wooded area I can tell you from nearly 30 years of experience that if a critter wants it , they will get it . Short of a physical barrier they will find a way around.These may be OK for someone in a suburban area , but if you have kids that are touching things these would be a no go.I 'll keep spraying repellent and letting `` nature take it 's course '' .	-1
We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York . Lots of deer . These have an odd way of working . They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer , then they use a shock to repel them . It 's a bit odd . Unless the deer actually touch the wires , they are never repelled - only attracted.I have n't done a statistical study , but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be . Previously , they would wander through . Now , they are curious and stick around because of the scent . I have only seen one deer ( a huge buck ) touch the wires . It only seemed mildly phased - and did n't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around . There are package warnings , but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage , but pretty unpleasant .	-1
When I requested this , a key bit of information was not listed on the Amazon product page . This info . is printed on the outside of the box & it says : Very Effective - Suburban Area . Deer density is low . Damage is mild , infrequent , unpredictable.Effective - Suburban Area . Deer density is medium . Damage is moderate , frequent , predictable.Effective ( if repellent is moved as deer travel pattern changes ) - Rural Residential Area . Deer density is medium to high . Damage is extensive , frequent , predictable.Not Effective ( A fence is the best option ) - Rural , Non-residential , Agricultural Areas . Deer density is high . Damages is extreme , frequent , unpredictable.I see this & say oh no ! I am in the `` Not Effective '' category aka `` do not buy this item - go get a fence '' I go on line & view the page thinking it must be here & I missed it . Nope . The above info . is not provided . Now you have it so you do n't unknowingly make the same mistake I did.Because I already committed to the product I gave it a go following the instructions . I chose a path the deer take past our young fruit trees . I put the lures along the path . They did nothing . I moved them in a tighter range after seeing the deer eating the tops of our young trees . Added more scent ( you do this once a week ) & the deer are out there everyday . No matter how tightly I have placed these together to protect even a tiny area as if I was not in the country or putting them along the path of the deer as directed it just does n't work . I did not place them far apart from each other even though we have a lot of land . I still followed the directions by choosing small areas to cover . I want that to be very clear.As far as the assembly goes , they were not as easy to put together as I thought . Before you snicker , read . Everything was very easy except trying to fit the middle pole into the bottom pole . On all 3 poles I had extreme difficulty . I thought I would end up breaking the little hard plastic tabs . I followed the assembly directions exactly & because of this the ends were charged & scented - all 3 . I 'm at my garden bench with charged polls rolling around while I battle it out trying to get a seemingly simple task accomplished . I grabbed a slender metal garden stake tried to keep the poll from rolling & discharging on the other polls or by the back of my arm hitting it while I tried to do 3 things with 2 hands , push in the tab , push the poll into the bottom & hold it still on the bench while not hurting myself . I know it probably sounds pathetic but I really did have a heck of a time with the bottoms . I would recommend putting on the bottoms first so you do n't have to worry about the charged tops & then assemble the rest per the directions . I think I would have had a much easier time if I did it that way . For once , it would have been better NOT to follow the directions ! At this point after weeks of using these I 'm not even sure what to do with them . I guess I could move them yet again , but I just do n't see the point . They are still out with the few fruit trees & they are scented with lure , but why ? They just do n't do a thing .	-1
I put these up in my yard around the fence line . The deer still came into my yard . Did n't seem to make any mind of these stakes . The instructions say to place them at the areas away from what you want protected . I followed the directions and the deer still enters the yard and eats the plants.Maybe if you combine these with other deterrents they may work better . I do n't know . These do n't seem to work .	-1
I agree with the one-star review titled `` Pointless '' written by `` Kitten Kisser '' . I live in an area that falls between the last two categories `` Rural residential '' and `` Rural non-residential agricultural '' - I have high deer density , damage is frequent but unpredictable . Since I installed them , I have n't seen any deer in my yard , but my schedule has been erratic , so it 's not unusual . I 've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes , but not near the other two . But then , I do n't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes , at least as long as the supply lasts . And I 'll move the stakes , as the instructions say . But since my walnut tree got partly eaten , I do n't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job .	-1
I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard , since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned , if a bird alights on this , they will get a shock . If a fox or dog sniffs it , they too will get a shock.Not to mention children , and since we do n't have a fence in the front , children do cut through out yard.So , maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful . But if you live in the city and you do n't have a fence and there are children around ...	-1
Deers are the worse pest in New England . Not only do they destroy our gardens , they also spread Lime disease , a serious deer-tick born ailment that is named after a Connecticut town . For some unfathomable reason , the local politicians decide that , ours being a proudly liberal town , any hunting or trapping of deers is strictly forbidden all year round anywhere within the town border , making this town uniquely pro-deer in the state of Connecticut.Poor home owners who can not put up six-foot tall fences all around the properties are pretty much defenseless against these nasty invaders . Last year , my entire crop of okra as well as my wife 's prized lilies were gone in a single evening . It was not that we chose to do nothing , but the deer-repellant spray was washed away in a drizzle and the deers were free to munch on the tenderest new shoots . This year , we feel we have no choice but to pay up for the somewhat rain-resistant but much more expensiveDeer Scram 25 # Deer & Rabbit Repellent Granular White Pail . This blood/garlic mixture has worked for us so far , but I am constantly worried that the smell is fading fast with each rainy day.When I saw the phrase `` electronic deer repellent '' on Amazon , my heart skipped a beat in joy and wonder . Could this be the silver bullet to our deer problem ? I made the big mistake of not reading the detailed descriptions and the reviews until the item arrived . This `` repellent '' uses acorn scented oil to ATTRACT deers to one 's lawn only to gently send them away with a mild electric shock . Question 1 : what if the deers choose not to touch the metal part with their noses ? Question 2 : What about the deer ticks they carry ? Question 3 : Why would I want to attract all the deers in the neighborhood to my small property in the first place ? Do I really want to remind them how many tender and juicy flowers and vegetables I have just planted ? There is just no way I am going to put this boondoggle in my lawn . The only legitimate purpose of this thing I can think of is to use it as a bait while waiting around with a bow or a rifle , assuming that the acorn oil actually works . Maybe someone should market a similar product under the brand `` Havabrain '' ?	-1
**** Revised Review as of 6/16/11 ****I originally gave this product two stars and said it was `` ineffective '' . I am revising this to , `` causes more deer damage '' . It actually increased the number of deer visits to our yard , which is NOT a cottage in the forest ( suburbia as noted below ) . After giving it two weeks , my family begged me to please remove the `` repellents '' because they were bringing too many deer into the yard . My son erected a more effective measure ( metal wire fence ) and this seemed to do the job for about the same amount of money . Bottom line , I tossed these worthless ( actually , harmful ) units into the garbage can after removing the batteries . Avoid them unless you want more deer . If you do want more deer , it 's cheaper to go to the hunting supply store and buy the acorn scented deer attracter , soak a piece of cotton with it and leave it on a stick or something . It works about the same as these things , and it will be much less expensive . **** End of Revision ****We live in a suburban area in California 's `` Silicon Valley '' with paved streets , curbs , lawns , gardens and ... deer ! ! ! Out plants are eaten year-round by deer . They come down out of the hills where they live and trot down the paved roads a mile or so down to our home . We 've tried a lot of methods to either protect the plants ( fences , wires , predator scent , etc . ) with mixed results . So , when I had a chance to try out this new `` Electronic Deer Repellent '' my hopes were up for a while.The term `` repellent '' is somewhat misleading . these stakes are supposed to work ( they did NOT work for me ) by using a deer attracting scent ( acorn is the one that comes with the set ) to bring deer in contact with the wires on the top of the stake . The wires are charged up by two AA batteries much as an electric fly swatter , if you have seen or used one of those . The deer are supposed to be shocked when they put their nose on the wires as they attempt to get to the source of the acorn smell . So , the deer ca n't be `` repelled '' until they are `` attracted '' . The theory is understandable , but our results show it is seriously flawed in practice.In order to save your reading of the rest of this review , let me say this product had no positive effect at all on our deer issues . In fact , it may have worked to attract more deer ! Details:1 . Packaging : the product comes in a compact cardboard container that has three of the units . They require a modest amount of assembly . My set came with the requisite two AA batteries for each stake , but then this was a set for review . I do n't know if the commercial product has the same . The box is about 19 '' x 4 '' x 4 '' , which means it is easy to ship . The packaging seemed adequate to protect the goods , but not frustrating to open.2 . Assembly : I asked my 14 year old daughter to assemble the units . She did so with relative ease . The instructions and tasks to be done are simple . The units come in three main pieces ( spike , lower shaft , upper shaft with the power head ) , plus the two batteries . She had a minor struggle getting some of the plastic lock buttons to engage with the holes in the metal shaft , but it was not epic . Overall , it took less than ten minutes for her to finish . We will upload the video later this week.3 . Activation : The most difficult part of the use of these `` repellent '' stakes is to add the bait . You must stuff some loose cotton into holes in the top of the stakes and then add some drops of deer-attracting scent ( the kit comes with acorn scent ) . Inserting the cotton requires you to have a small stick , flat blade screwdriver , or similar to poke the cotton into its place . Then , you add drops of scent . The scent must be re-applied every few days.4 . Quick test : since our family has used electronic fly swatters for a few years , we thought this product may have some possibility of success . So , after putting it all together we tried to shock ourselves with the wires - which is against all the instructions and warnings provided by Havahart - and felt very little shock . Very , very little . As in , not enough to bother us at all - less than you 'd get from the door knob in your home after walking across the wool carpet . In our opinion , probably not enough to worry Mr. Deer.5 . Testing : the instructions claim 1100 sq ft coverage and we followed them to the letter . Our results were that MORE deer seemed to visit that part of the garden and that more deer returned later . We are giving it a few days just in case.Bottom line : it 's a crock !	-1
At first glance , the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent seems like it might work . It supposedly attracts deer with a scented lure ( a cotton ball at the top to which you apply the supplied scent drops ) and the deer , if they nudge it with their nose , get a shock from the wires that run down the post.Unfortunately , this underestimates the deers ' ability to bypass the post and munch your garden - as most deer would do . The package notes that it is designed for `` light deer pressure '' installations , such as urban back yards , and not for more rural or even suburban situations . My house is decidedly rural with high deer pressure , and the Havahart made zero difference in deer foraging in the garden . As you get only three in the package , you might need many more to protect even a small garden to any significant degree.And even in the urban setting , where this might work better , anything that attracts deer probably makes things worse rather than better . In this way it is a lot like the Japanese Beetle traps with their pheromone lures - while the traps may catch a lot of beetles , they also attract more beetles to the area.Sadly , the only thing that seems to really work on deer is a physical barrier , perhaps reinforced with a continuous electric fence .	-1
I set this up near my barn , and alas the deer seemed to ignore it 's effect.They still frequent the proximity of these stakes . I have tried everything , now I will feed the deer , and give up on the garden !	-1
I think I ended up purchasing this due to the wonderful color choices . I chose Yellow , its super easy to see in the grass . That 's where my positive review of this product ends . It never worked correctly from the start . All functions worked great , except the soaker . It sort of just squishes water out of a little bit of all of the other functions and around the edge ... Comparing it to any hose nozzle I 've used in the past this is n't how the soaker function is designed to work . It was n't hardly worth my effort to send it back . The other ( and more important to me ) functions worked so I just dealt with it . I have now had it for right about two months and I realized the little metal piece that holds the on/off grab bar on the `` on '' position is missing . Now THAT was a function I deem essential . I used it all the time . I think two months is a little bit short to fall apart ! Its possible that I got a bad apple , but I would n't buy the identical model to replace it . I 'll try something else .	-1
This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use ( maybe used it 4-5 times during that time ) , the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere . Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use , and it seems they were right . No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere . I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Do n't waste your money , get something better .	-1
When I turn the water on , the nozzle starts spraying water , without me touching it or pushing the handle . Today I wanted to wash my yard , I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on . By the time I got to the hose , the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed . The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply . This is totally unacceptable .	-1
I bought this and a bag of Scotts grass seed to cover an area of my back yard that was recently regraded after construction . The spreader worked OK for the first few minutes , then became harder and harder to crank . Too much friction for the plastic parts maybe . I 'm glad the space I had to cover was n't any larger . What a pain . I could have done just about as well pitching handfuls from the bag . I think I wasted my money .	-1
This would maybe be 3 stars if it worked outdoors , but I would not chance it ! It has a very cheap build for the cost and has the electric switch and electronics on top , exposed to weather , so I would not want to use it outdoors ( as I had intended ) . I bought a simple Haveaheart trap and sent this back . If you intend it for indoors , it would work probably fine , but it still looks cheap for the price . I just was unimpressed .	-1
For two days , I 've giggled with glee upon seeing the unit 's flashing red light of SUCCESS . That was until I kept coming up EMPTY and disappointed the bugger got a free meal . I 've reset and refilled with a few dog kibble about 10 times and zapped NOTHING ! I 've been dry toweling the plates after every 3 entry and departures to avoid dirty build up that could impede the powerful , much desired RAT DEATH RAY.After attempting to access the Ratzpper.com website which is UNAVAILABLE , I called the 1888-DEAD-RAT several hours ago without a callback . Now those furry critters are catching a break until I get sturdy traps and toxic waste disposal gloves . I HATE mice , rats & most icky rodents and have no plans to continue running a fine dining establishment for them.This contraption is too blankity-blank expensive to be a bust . In case you have n't guessed it , I DO NOT RECOMMEND this thing ! PS CALL Amazon Customer Service if purchased through them for a refund.UPDATE 1/22/2013A smart and pleasant Technical Support person from Raticator called with helpful hints . Having a moist cloth/paper towel leading to the front of the Ratzapper acts as a WELCOME MAT to a `` shocking experience '' when the critter makes contact with the metal plates inside . The Raticator company provides support temporarily for Ratzapper which is no longer produced . With that in mind , you need to consider that when getting a Ratzapper . Getting a refund and finding a consistently working pest eliminator is my goal .	-1
I 've used Deer Off before and did n't have very good results with the sprayer so I decided to try the concentrate formula.It states to NOT use on plants that are intended for human consumption so all of our garden plants that are getting eaten by the squirrels and deer have no hope at . We used it on other plants and the plants that we applied it to had burned brown areas on them in a few days.We also applied it around the bird feeder to keep the squirrels away and to some trees to keep the deer from rubbing up on them , all with no results . The best thing that we have found is to try and plant Deer-resistant plants when possible . For the garden , I have no clue how to keep those pesky squirrels out .	-1
I have 12 bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard . A lot of the bird food falls to the ground . This works well in feeding large birds that are too big to perch on the feeders . It also attracts many squirrels . I have separate feeders for squirrels but they are not satisfied with just their feeders and gobble up the bird seed as well which leaves very little for the big birds . I sprayed Deer Off around the bottom areas of the bird feeder poles in the hopes that squirrels would be repelled . After the Deer Off had dried the squirrels returned in full force to their old stomping grounds . I swear I could hear them giggling at me.This product should be labeled `` Rip Off '' based on its cost and lack of performance .	-1
My problem is rabbits , cats and squirrels.This product is more difficult to use than Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular Shaker . You have to dilute the concentrate , then spray it from your own sprayer . I was tempted to just pour the concentrate around , but did n't . This product sprays on the foliage , while the granules stay on the ground . This may be a better product for deers since they are not close to the ground , but deers are not my problem.The product smells horrible , but that 's how it works . Do n't spray it in the wind . Really . I mean it.You can still smell a faint odor when it dries.It seems to wash off after one rain.It seemed to have no effect no rabbits , squirrels and cats . For these critters , the granules seem to work better.Finally , the measuring cup that comes with the concentrate and sits on top of the cap shattered in transit . This was annoying .	-1
Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for `` putrescent egg '' or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of `` Deer Off . '' I 've followed the direction , applied this product twice to the same plants , shrubs , and area . I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off , and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks , bushes , even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred . They continue raiding the raised beds , climbing to the bird feeders , and generally seem unperturbed . If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks , then that would be one thing . So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground . I think , however , that my presence may be the deterrent during those moments of respite from the rodents ' continual engorgement .	-1
The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy . They 're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand . I just do n't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests ( fleas , ticks etc ) .I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away . The product 's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time . I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence , it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that 's it . This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions . It did n't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product .	-1
I have reviewed several different Deer Repellent products in the past 2 years and am still hopeful that either something new that works will come out or a new formula of an old standby will do the trick.The market is still prime for a great product to emerge ... ..The putrescent egg and hot pepper combo is not working . I think the local southeastern deer are starting to like hot & rotten.There are a couple of other details that make this product loose a couple of stars besides the fact that it does repel all deer : - The advertising that you can use it on organic gardens but not anywhere near food crops is misleading.- The price at $ 38 for 32 oz is slightly over $ 1.18 an oz and 32 oz only makes 2 gallons of repellent . This is suppose to treat 400 ornamental plants 4 feet tall or 4000 sq ft of plantings . But spraying top and bottom of leaves as per directions really gives much less than 400 plants . These would have to be very small . I estimate that with my professional backpack sprayer with constant pressure tip installed and on a very fine mist spray pattern that I would only be able to spray approx 100 ornamental 4 ft tall plants . Not sure where they are getting their numbers.So I am still waiting for that perfect deer repellent ... ..Sorry this may not be the review you were hoping to read about . Please comment if you have found a product that works great and I will add your comments to this review.2 stars . 3 lost ( one each ) for effectiveness , advertising , and cost.Hope this helps .	-1
Deer Off 32 Ounce Deer , Rabbit and Squirrel Repellant comes as a concentrate , so you will need another container to use . I have a fenced in property so do not have deer . However , I have rabbits and it does n't work to deter the little buggers . I gave it 3 stars because I do not know if it is effective against deer .	-1
I got this to put on vegetable plants that were being decimated by squirrels . When I read the instructions it said to not apply it to any plants that produced edible foods , that it was not safe on human food . As that was the point for this product , which is kind of marketed as a natural repellent ( I was imagining it was wolf urine , or something ) this is pretty much useless for me .	-1
The squares are about 4x4 inches . Animals just get tangled in it . Birds can fly right through it . It is an AWFUL product . Look for & # 34 ; deer & # 34 ; netting at your local feed or hardware store that is made from fish netting type material . Waste of money .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it . This feeder has many great properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives ( of which there are many ) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
Not anywhere as near useful as I 'd hoped . Slow and a lot of hard work for very little gain . I would not recommend it .	-1
I have clay soil . It immediately clogged the tines . You can keep making holes with the tines clogged , but since the soil is not being ejected , all you are doing is further compacting the soil below . You may think you are helping your lawn , but you are actually making it worse . I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry , or sandy , and therefore likely to eject from the top . With my type of soil , which is fairly common , it was basically useless . Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this .	-1
Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like . This , unfortunately , is n't one of them.I 've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic , so this , if it worked , would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness , in case that was the issue . In each instance the aerator jammed , repeatedly . In some cases , un-jamming the unit was very difficult . It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I do n't recommend this unit .	-1
the first day I had it and was digging and planting in my garden the main shovel broke in half at the neck I am more careful now but it was very low quality material and split way to fast and way way to easy	-1
Well , it worked for a little over a year . I used the trimmer twice a month with no issues.I noticed the blade was getting worn down and quite dull . Changing the blade proved to be the downfall of the trimmer.To change the blade you insert a screwdriver in the slot behind the blade to lock the hub . The metal around this hub is very cheap pot metal . The metal hub broke apart in 7 pieces when trying to remove the blade nut.I hope everyone has better luck than me , but I wo n't buy another one.I 'm kinda miffed that this trimmer only lasted 13 months . They should n't be disposable .	-1
Tried this for a Month with no results . The unit no has moisture and corrosion and has died . I waisted money on this one . I swabbed the plates to keep them clean and kept the peanut butter away from them . Too bad I liked the idea but it 's back to the old Victor 'finger whapping ' old fashioned trap .	-1
I 've used every mouse trap on the market over the past 20 years , so I have a pretty good perspective on which ones are most effective ( at least for New England mice ) .I tried this electronic trap in a an attic where several other types of traps are also installed and catching mice . The electronic trap never caught a single mouse . Eventually the batteries died . Between the zero success rate , and the need to feed it batteries , I put this model at the bottom of the list of all the different types of traps I 've tried.The old fashioned snap traps are the cheapest and most effective traps . Unfortunately , they also come with significant drawbacks : They 're unpleasant to deal with after you 've caught a mouse , you ca n't use them where children or pets might find them , and they 're a little tricky to set . Glue traps have similar pros and cons , and they have the further disadvantage of seeming inhumane ( even if you do n't have an emotional attachment to mice ) .The best trap I 've found , by far , is the Victor `` Tin Cat '' model . It 's a metal box with one-way trap doors . Mice seem to find it irresistible , and it can catch several mice in one night ( in fact , it 's almost as if the first mouse in the trap attract others ) . The biggest downside is that it 's a `` live catch '' trap , so you have to check it every day and then take it far away from the house to release the mice .	-1
So far my mice simply enter these traps , eat the bait , and leave ( sans zap ) leaving some mouse poop right nearby as an F/U to me that they were n't falling for my fancy zapper traps . More traditional traps I bought after these also failed to catch any mice ( but at least the mice did n't take the bait this time ) .My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it has n't been an issue for years . That is if you do n't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill ... Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal . So , loving electronic toys , I got these expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed , followed by traditional snap traps which also failed . So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the snapers . Time to try something else.I promise to update this review if they ever come through.PS : Cleaned all the contacts , tested the batteries , not over-baiting , or letting the bait touch the contacts . As I bought two I am doubtful that they are defective , just apparently not very effective.UPDATE : Caught one mouse in a snapper trap ; same bait . So far the zappers have got none.UPDATE # 2 : Latest count is These traps = 2 kills - Old Fashioned snapper traps = 4 kills . I seem to me mouse free now .	-1
Pros : - Compact , sturdy , easy to setupCons : - Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above , actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean . The peanut butter ca n't sit in there forever , eventually it gets a little rotten and you do n't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned . The peanut butter , once smeared to the back wall , is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment . I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks , qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol . Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point , I expect more . Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you 'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them ? It 's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you 'll likely agree with me .	-1
This is a good price for a no-frills garden sprayer . I 'm not expecting a miracle at this price point and because of its all plastic construction , durability may be an issue . For $ 10 , I can live with ordering a replacement if it breaks down after a 8 months to a year , but hopefully it wo n't . [ Product has now failed . Please see update at end of review . ] I was looking for a labor-saving way to hydrate the more delicate plants and flowers in my garden and maybe administer some plant food through foliar feeding . I had been using a spray bottle and all that squeezing was very tough on the hands , so I finally decided to do the right thing and get a sprayer . Assembly is very easy . Attach the hose to the wand , attach other end to bottle . Fill with water or your desired mix of fertilizer or bug killer , insert and screw on the pump/handle and you 're ready to rock 'n ' roll . Flow rate is very satisfactory and you can adjust the spray pattern from a single stream to a fine mist by twisting the nozzle cap . Fully pumped , the stream reaches approx 25 ft out.Design FlawsI do n't like that the carrying handle and the pump action are one and the same . There 's a little notch that the handle locks into when you rotate it clockwise . This secures the handle in place so that you can carry the sprayer . To pump again , you have to twist it 1/4 turn counter-clockwise so you unlock the handle . Once fully pressurized , dissipation rate is good , but I did n't like the extra step of having to lock and unlock the handle each time . I have to set the sprayer down , unlock , pump , lock again , pick up , then spray . Another minor issue is the squeaking sound of the pump , which I do n't really mind , but just pointing it out in case you do.A secondary problem is the length of the hose ( about 3 ft. ) With the sprayer being held in a relaxed position in one hand ( hanging straight down like a shopping bag ) , I can only bring my other hand to about mid-chest height in front of me . I ca n't raise my wand hand above my head to mist tall trees and objects . On mist mode , you can comfortably spray anything from ground height to about 8 ft without having to raise the bottle higher.Thirdly , there 's no caddy or snap-in clasp to keep the wand secure when the sprayer is not in use . I am expecting a random mishap to snap the wand because of this -- either someone walking by and the wand snagging on some clothing , or it being stepped on . The wand looks especially fragile and susceptible to cracking . It is this product 's weakest link . Some sort of loop for attaching a shoulder strap to wear the sprayer would also be a welcome addition.Overall , the Chapin 20000 is easy to use , but not without some design annoyances . For what I paid , I am satisfied with this product so far.UPDATE : DIY Strap Add-on ModificationI was able to fashion myself a strap for the sprayer out of 2 key rings and a camera bag strap . Stamped onto the vertical support vane on either side of the neck is a circular identation ( visible in product blowup ) . You can punch it out with a screwdriver and insert the key rings , then attach a shoulder strap . I now have a wearable sprayer that leaves my other hand free for other gardening tasks . It 's a bit clumsy and looks funny , but it works.UPDATE 8/28/10I am downgrading this product to 2 stars because after 4 days , the spray release mechanism has now unexpectedly snapped off . I had concerns about the durability of this product because of its all-plastic construction and did not expect it to last for very long , but less than a week is unacceptable , with less than 4 gallons of use out of this sprayer . The handle is reattachable via snap pegs , but it wo n't stay on due to the force of the spring in the release value . The clamp had become worn . When pushed down , the lever pops back out . Buyer beware ! Not recommended .	-1
In order to unlock the pump handle you have to turn the handle the same direction as you & # 8217 ; d turn it to open the lid thus releasing any air still sealed in the reservoir and misting your hands with the chemical in the reservoir . So , once you have the pump handle unlocked you have to wedge your fingers down onto the collar and twist it to re-seal the lid . Then you pump it up , press the handle back down and lock it back in place . You have to go through this process every time you want to pump the reservoir back up . I returned this item the same day I opened it .	-1
It does work and works great when it works , but having to stop and unstick the line from itself is a pain you know where . This is my first wire purchase for a specific trimmer I just purchased , though , so I do n't know if this will happen on other brands , but it never happened on a previous trimmer I had .	-1
We have lots of leaves in the fall in spring and the second time we used this the strap came off and we had to fix it . So I ca n't recommed this .	-1
This is a certifiable piece of junk . It lacks sufficient power to cut anything . Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery . I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job .	-1
We 've had many trimmers over the years . These by far are the worst we 've ever had.The problem is the design of both the grass shears and the mini hedge shears . They do not cut anything . They are dull and set too far apart to effectively cut anything.Plus for a 7.2 volt , which should be very powerful and have a long life battery this machine fails.I usually love Black and Decker items , but these were returned after 10 minutes of attempted use .	-1
Please do n't let the fact that this nozzle costs a fair bit of money fool you into thinkging that this is an all metal product . See the screw right in the center of the stainless steal spray head ? It 's attached to a thin plastic core . So , when you twist the outer rim to seat the metal spray head thereby shutting off the water , the relatively thin plastic core is stressed and in short time , snaps . The spray head is then no longer attached to anything , falls out , and water gushes everywhere . It becomes a useless hunk of metal and plastic parts . I am going to try a high strength 'epoxy ' repair but I do n't hold out much hope . Rather than twisting the rim to shut off the water , you could use one of these ; Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valveto do the on off work.After further consideration : If they made parts available , I 'd fix it , put it back in action and appreciate its other , more robust characteristics.But until they do , I do not think you get what you pay for.UPDATE : Epoxy does n't stick to the kind of plastic they used to make the core .	-1
During their seven to 10-day life span , Fungus Gnat females may lay up to 200 eggs into the cracks and crevices of growing media . Moist-growing media containing high amounts of peat moss are particularly attractive to adult females.I have 2 , 50 pellet pot jiffy seedling starters . I ordered these for refills because it was more fpr a cheaper price . Now I know why..You can tell these were at least last years old stock or older . You can tell that simply by how long it takes the pellets to absorb the water . It should really only take 1 minute to absorb . These took over 3 to 5 minutes . Most of the seeds I planted when using this batch of pellets did not grow . I was going to try to save the peat to mix with some potting soil.When I opened the pellets there were tons of Fungus Gnat Larvae feeding on the seeds inside . YUCK Yuck Yuck ! THANK GOD I CAUGHT THIS BEFORE THEY TURNED INTO FLIES ! MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN INFESTED ! Yes , I blame these pellets and not my seeds or myself . I have never had this issue before.In order to not waste the money I spent buying these I am going to have to spend more money on an insecticide and mix it with the water , when using them..Yes , I am sure the eggs were in the peat pellets and not from me or my home etc.I Know these are old stock , and had eggs in them hence , bad stock ! I will not be buying from this seller again ! Buyer beware.This is my first ever bad review . Trust me , that tells you something ! ... ... Move on !	-1
After ordering a couple other of the wrong size pellets , I was excited to get these under the impression that they would be the correct 42mm size . As received by seller toolboxsupply , these are the 36mm pellets ( which , by the way , seem to be much more widely available ; I 'm having problems finding the 42mm size anywhere , but I was REALLY expecting these to be that size because the product 's title explicitly states this ) .I assume this might depend a bit on the seller -- but I doubt I 'm going to try buying these from Amazon again , this being my second attempt . I am hesitant to rank the *product* down for that reason , but it 's really apparently a problem with this *listing* and one that I do n't want others to fall into this trap . I 'd avoid this unless you do n't really care which size you get -- but if you have the flats already ( and I do n't know why or how you 'd use these without them ) , it *does* matter.I 'd like to give the product itself more stars : while perhaps more expensive than loose seed starting mix , these work well and are very easy to use assuming you follow the directions . Plus , the netting is easy to remove when transplanting or potting up with minimal root disturbance ( as long as you do n't let the roots get so big they creep through the netting ) . But it seems exceptionally difficult to find correctly-sized , reasonably priced pellets for your existing Jiffy flats ( they make at least four sizes I know of , ranging from 30-50mm ) . But because of problems with the listing or at least some sellers , I do n't think I can do that . I 'll revise if this problem is ever fixed , because the product itself does work well if you manage to find the right one among Jiffy 's lack of size labeling ( and apparently Amazon 's or others ' confusion ) . Additionally , Amazon 's return process is easy.For those who actually want 42mm pellets ( the kind that come with theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand perhaps others ) , Jiffy 's official refill is theJiffy 5777 Refill , 25-Count , but you 'll notice that on Amazon , it 's more expensive than the original kit with that number of pellets plus the kit ( flat and dome cover ) itself ! I was able to find it more cheaply elsewhere , but just be warned.I 'd be curious how many others actually received 42mm pellets as the listing states or who maybe did n't notice that they got the wrong ones . I 'd also be curious who they purchased it from .	-1
I have used peat pods for years now . I was not impressed with these due to the basic problem that these did not work well with seed , and I did compare these with some others I purchased at Home Depot side by side . The others 100 percent sprouted and grew , and these 1 out of 10 grew I am sorry to say .	-1
Unbelievable expense when adding in green house expenses for such a poor yield . Very disappointed in the way all has gone so far ... ... ..	-1
This is a great little feeder . Sticks very well to the window and does n't get poopy ( let 's not talk about the window sill beneath ) and holds a pretty decent amount of seed . My acrobatic squirrels can leap onto it when I forget to throw out enough critter food to appease them and after at least 3 years of doing so , they finally broke it . So today I 'm ordering another one . Nothing fancy here , just a durable and fun bird feeder.Updated 5/29/2013 : the replacement I bought has a quality control problem with the suction cup portion that holds the feeder to the window ( kinda important ) . One of the suction cups was noticeably thin and seemed to have a hard time holding onto the glass . Turns out ( after cleaning the glass multiple times , moistening the cup or not moistening it ) that it just wo n't hold onto the glass for more than , say , 30 minutes . This is without any squirrel attacks . It just falls away . So half the support for the thing is just not there and shortly after you place it , it will sag to one side hanging on the one good cup and look really , really sharp ( not ) . Oh well , at least I got one working suction cup instead of none.Yes , this is a very inexpensive item but it 's not a high-tech or complex item to get right either . It 's meant to hang onto a window . If it ca n't properly do that , there 's a problem . This is likely a sample defect but it should never have gotten to the end user in this condition.Fortunately the remains of my old one were still in the trash bin and I retrieved the old window attachment part , which still works fine , so I 'm good for now . Glad the trash pickup was n't a day sooner or this thing would have ended up in the bin the following week .	-1
I would love to review this product , but one of the pieces arrived broken and there 's no number or address to ask for a replacement part ! I 've informed Amazon , but it 's been almost a week and no reply . So , here 's what I can tell you . The bench looks beautiful . Nice , dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly . But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing !	-1
I 've never heard of the company that 's selling this . And I 'm glad , because when products like this , they 'll be out of business VERY soon.I 'm not going to detail every problem with this thing , but perhaps enumerate a few:1 . The stain is applied completely unevenly . Some pieces are much darker , and there are run/splotch marks all over.2 . There is no protective material around anything in the box . This leads to problems later in the life of the bench : a . There are numerous spots all over that have had their stain rubbed nearly completely off.b . A couple people come with pegs in them : all but two come broken.c . A long piece that appears to be provided for additional stability : broken in the box ( no visible damage to the box. ) 3 . The top wood grain in the picture looks nothing like what I have . It 's just more of the same `` stain '' glopped all over.4 . The wood pieces , especially the center support piece , does n't line up correctly . It 's about an 1/4 of an inch too short.5 . Want to call the company to ask for spare pieces or warranty info ? Too bad for you : there is no contact information anywhere , save for the outside of the box - the same place that has this product incorrectly labeled `` OUTER DOOR BENCH . '' The correct label : a bunch of broken scrap wood.The only redeeming factor of this entire piece of garbage is that the instructions are n't confusing because of a bad translation : there are a total of 4 words , and some weird picture/diagrams that are n't entirely accurate for putting this thing together.Do n't waste your money on this . It 's absolutely horrible . If you happen to get lucky and they figure out that padding small pieces during shipment is a good idea - and hire some QA for other aspects , it 's still not a very good product : most build-it-yourself pieces , when you screw them together , have the metal hardware generally hidden from view . Not this gem : the `` official '' pictures here appear to be some cheap 3D renderings and not an actual product picture ; you can see screws in the legs and across the top ridge in the real thing.A bad design for a bench from a company that likely has no quality assurance . Do you really want to waste your money on it ?	-1
This is a nice looking bench if you do n't look too closely . The finish is rough and uneven in many places as if it were applied unevenly . This does not give it a rustic look but instead looks sloppy . The quality of the wood is poor . It looks and feels like pine , although it may be fir . It 's definitely not a hardwood.The bench was shipped UPS and arrived in a thin cardboard box , not the usual sturdy box that I 'm accustomed to receiving from Amazon . The pieces were loosely wrapped in foam . No bubble wrap , nothing to secure it but some tape . Consequently , I was n't surprised that them main support bar ( the curved one at the bottom ) was split in half . Because it was split on an angle we were able to repair and secure it with zip ties . Looks a little odd but it worked . Several other pieces have cracks in them but were not broken all the way through.Since I received this as a Vine review item we proceeded to assemble it rather than return it . Assembly was very easy and we had the bench put together in about 10 minutes . The screws and hardware provided were high quality , better than the wood for the bench itself ! I am using it by my patio table on the back deck . It seats two and is sturdier than it appears . Only time will tell how well it will withstand the rain and sun . If it becomes unstable for people to sit on , it will be re-purposed as a stand for some of my potted plants in the front garden.Because of the high cost ( $ 89 ) , the horrible way it was shipped and the broken parts ( others have had the same problem so it 's not just my UPS route ) , I am forced to rate this lower than I would have liked , but it 's just not worth it unless the company makes some changes .	-1
This product is very cheaply made . Although my bench had all the parts and none of the wood was broken - it is very clear that the wood is very soft ( probably pine ) and will be a one-season bench . The one I received also lacked the rustic 2-tone look that the Amazon picture presents . Mine is stained a dark brown and it almost looks like it is painted . The finish is not consistent and there are quite a few spots showing irregularity that could have easily been smoothed out when the finish was still wet.On a plus side - the one I received went together quickly ( I would recommend using a cordless drill/driver ) . The assembly directions were only illustrations and although they lacked detail - there was enough information to put this bench together with little problem . My product was adequately padded during shipping and it did n't suffer any damages through the mailing process.Overall , this is a very basic bench that two people can sit on . There is no doubt in my mind that it is going to wear very prematurely and frankly if you want to extend its wear - you probably should be storing it in a dry area when it 's not in use . I personally think that it is horribly overpriced for the quality and workmanship . My Bench was a complimentary product through the Vine program - I really think that had I paid for this item I probably would have sent it back .	-1
I assembled this bench right after it was delivered . I expect MUCH MUCH better quality for the price of this bench ! The directions are bit confusing because the wooden parts are labeled A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , etc and so is the hardware .It is not very big , you could fit two people but it would be tight.The quality is poor . There are all kinds of marks , places where the finish was gone do to damage . There were a couple of places where big chunks of wood were missing but they put the finish right over these areas.The finish is very splotchy with areas/spots that are a different color than the finish . Many scratches , digs , rough areas on the wood . It looks like they may have used a wood filler in some areas and instead of sanding those areas down and staining to match the wood they just put the finish over these areas , but it did not adhere and the wood filler comes off.It looks like they used odd pieces of wood , ( pieces maybe leftover from other projects that they did n't want to waste ) , or collected leftover wood from a lumber yard , I do not know . I do know this bench is poor quality and I question how well it would stand up to the elements . I think I will sand it a bit and use some marine grade polyurethane on it .It might work better as a plant stand ! or instead of a fire pit bench you could use it to burn in the fire pit ! ! I took several photos but you can only do a video on here . I would never recommend this bench to anyone . Way over priced for the quality and construction .	-1
I applied the product as stated , still had problems . I even threw it in a garbage can with 1 bag of garbage to see if it would scare anything off.. nope . Luckily my garbage is far away from the house where it is n't a horrible issue and I can feel good I feed the critters all year round .	-1
Maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often . Maybe . It does n't affect the squirrels at all . The Deer Off spray from Havahart works better at keeping the squirrels away but even that is only temporary.Maybe it will work better for others . We have what amounts to a wildlife sanctuary in our back yard . The neighborhood is full of pecan and oak trees . Those trees are full of squirrels . We have bird feeders to attract birds . The bird feeders also attract the squirrels . The birds and squirrels attract cats . Sometimes the cats get lucky with a bird or squirrel but mostly the cats just hang out and turn the flower beds into latrines . The squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic . If the cats would only eat all the squirrels and leave the birds and flower beds alone it would be welcome . Does n't happen . And this stuff ai n't makin ' it happen either.This stuff does n't work for us . You might have better luck ... if you 're not living in a wildlife sanctuary like we are .	-1
This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients . It even looks like pepper , and smells somewhat like pepper . The three main , active ingredients are : # 1 . Oil of black pepper : 0.48 % by weight. # 2 . Piperine ( comes from black pepper ) : 0.185 % by weight. # 3 . Capsaicin : 0.032 % by weight.The other 99.3 % are `` other ingredients '' .When you open the big blue jug , please note , it is five pounds by weight , but the jug is about 3/4 full , so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home , which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats , chipmunks , and deer . I also have a pet dog and cat . I did not expect miracles , and as with any product of this type , you need to accept that it is a deterrent , which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors , nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals , I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times . Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property . I tried a couple of applications in various places . None of the chipmunks , cats , squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all . I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions . In fact , I ended up applying it heavier than instructed , and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But , if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach , I do not see any reason to pay $ 5 or $ 6 a pound for this product . 5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces . Since the active ingredients ( various forms of pepper ) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar , or about half an ounce , you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own , homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs , I use a mixture of tap water , some chili powder and one egg ( left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle ) , along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion . So you could possibly not use the egg ( attracts some animals , even when rotten ) and add a little more pepper , dish soap or baking soda . You 'd end up with something that would work as well as this product .	-1
I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees , but it did n't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they ca n't just jump from tree to tree , so I decided to try this product around it . Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree , the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations , but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product did n't stop or slow that process .	-1
I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly . I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden . Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants . What a disappointment .	-1
I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders . I have six squirrel proof bird feeders . My squirrels , Mensa members all , have figured out how to overcome the `` squirrel proofing '' and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty . I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders . As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances . This is a genuinely useless product , at least as far as squirrels are concerned .	-1
I did not have any success repelling rabbits with this product . I wish I had though , because I hate rabbits and they 're ruining my lawn.I had much better luck using this product : Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerGood luck !	-1
This product is presented as a safe and effective deterrent for a variety of animals . The active ingredients are pepper compounds , the scent of which can deter animals . However , I 've found that many animals are n't really affected by the application of Critter Ridder , either because it wears off quickly or is n't active enough in the 1st place . If you use it I would recommend a solid application in the areas where you 'd like to repel animals , if it 's too weak then animals can easily adapt and ignore it . Also , rains neutralize it , so it 's a waste to apply it during rainy season . I believe you could create your own herbal animal repellents with plant oils and extracts and get better results than using these granules . The granules may seem convenient and safe , but so far they seem low on the scale of effectiveness . The cats , dogs , and rodents in my area do n't seem that disturbed by this repellent , and applying even larger amounts in hopes of making the application stronger would make the cost excessive .	-1
I was excited to try this , as I 've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer . I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is , even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure . I closed the lids tight . That same night , it was worse than ever -- garbage knocked over , trash all over the side of my house . By the time I saw it , there were flies swarming and birds picking through it ... meaning that I guess flies and birds do n't mind this repellent either ! It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it 's safe and approved for organic gardens -- but it 's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area , and you 're advised to wear gloves while applying it .	-1
I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk . I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating . It just kept digging . I covered its entrance with bricks , it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder , which seems like just what i needed . I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it 's own scent ... The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced ! This may work with deer , but apparently not skunks !	-1
