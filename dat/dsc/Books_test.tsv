Good story line . I do enjoy the setting as well . Having heard stories from both my husband and my in laws , I can really relate to Scotland , Glasgow at that point in time .	1
Father Christmas is a very cut Christmas book for children just in time for the holiday season . A cute dragon santa is the star of the book and the story line is about the first Santa ever . Fun book !	1
I enjoyed this short storyand feel its well worth a red . The writing is vivid , and gritty . You see what the author writes . Theres some twists at the end that seem to imply much more to the story.Different feel than most apoc or zombie/monster tales . Well worth checking out if your looking for a brief walk on the darker side of survival .	1
Me gusto mucho esta historia , la verdad es de mis generos favoritos de lectura ; es un libro facil de leer y de esos que no pueden dejarse tan facilmente : ) me gusto la relacion entre Juliet y Robert , aunque para mi gusto se pudo escribir mas sobre el romance , describir con mas detalle sentimientos y su relacion ; aunque no es de aquellos libros que te dejan sin aliento por la historia de amor , me parecio muy bonito .	1
I love these guys , in just one sitting I can bring myself up to speed on historical happenings or people in History . This is so great because people nowadays do n't give time to sit down to a book of a hour or more on these issues . I think we all need to remind ourselves of our past and this is a quick way to do it . Highly recommended .	1
If you have read Lao Tzu you owe it to yourself to read this terrific interpretation of Nagarjuna . Written in the same style as the Tao Te Ching , this book can be read in a few hours but has more than enough wisdom to last a lifetime.So many simple , powerful guidelines for a fuller , truer life.I also really enjoyed the George Carlin inspired thoughts ! A great book to add to your spiritual library .	1
Another great work from Dennis Waller and this is a well translated book and excellent content . The author have done a great job in keeping the content simple to understand , reading and understanding 260 verses did not took much time .I also read another translationTao Te Ching- Lao Tzu , A Translationby this author and enjoyed it.I highly recommend this book to all readers liking this genre	1
Having never heard of or read the `` Tree of Wisdom '' before I was curious and enthralled by this book . The author does an excellent job at giving you a good history and background on this ancient text so that when you read the work itself you are ready to really digest the wisdom . Great book !	1
Although I have always found Lady Jennings 's Victorian gay stories too short , I have continued to read them nonetheless , five and counting ! To me it looks very much like an addiction ... but this time with `` Complicated Affairs '' it 's even better ; this is n't a short one as usual , but a novella , what a treat ! She has the knack for creating the ideal atmosphere that very easily and completely engulfs you from the beginning and this time is no different.The plot is simple but executed with precision , talent and wit . There are two amazing flawed , yet beautiful men who are so very different that you wonder how the author is going to make it work . Her stories are always wonderful in their detailed descriptions and elegant phrasing . It allows the reader to easily visualize every place and situation , to absorb the ambience and live each emotion . And here again , you can not help but be involved in the character 's life and all these elements combine to make the story all the more credible.Where Sebastian Cox is a charming rakehell , a gamester who drinks too much and who does n't care for his lovers , Carl Whitmore is a very private gentleman who has chosen to more or less withdraw from society . He came back from war wounded and with a broken heart . One man is all boldness and rather wild while the other is all discretion and restraint.It all begins like a game of seduction for Sebastian , one is the hunter , the other is the prey or is it the other way round ? There are misunderstandings , misconception , mistakes , confusion , burning and explosive passion ... in the end there 's hope for more , maybe love and trust ... who knows ? It was sweet , romantic and hot with a very satisfying ending and all this is tastefully written . A great read ! I give 4 stars .	1
I grew up on the shores of Lake of Egypt . I loved water as a child . Adulthood has changed things . You would be hard pressed to get me out on a lake today . The thought of something touching me below its murky surface chills me . I 've imagined alligators resting on the bottom floor of public swimming pools , and other ghastly stuff . Sara Brooke 's `` Ghost Swim '' grips you from beginning to end . It has that wow factor some ghost stories do n't have . A compelling read all around . `` Ghost Swim '' does n't disappoint . Read it for yourself and see . The story will stay with you long after the last page . I look forward to reading more of her work in the future , and so should you . Watch for her !	1
This book was different but sooo good ! It demands a sequel based on the ending and I 'm hoping to see one .	1
I enjoyed every minute of it . I 'm sure all readers would . it is a must read . I 'm going to read his other works as well .	1
I think that I have read all the Blake Hartley novels available on Amazon and have found them all enjoyable . These stories are presented as & # 34 ; Softer & # 34 ; crime stories ie . without the very descriptive & # 34 ; Blood and Guts & # 34 ; scenes , but enough detail for an everyday description of a Police Inspectors life , making it a very believable story .	1
Not a bad easy reading book . Love the English mysteries have . Makes for a little excitement but they do n't make your skin crawl . Love the way they have to have their tea . The English are really great people and we can learn a lot from them .	1
I love the ending . I would love to see more from these two , however I love the way she wrapped this story up in this book . Great writing !	1
This is a practical and nice pattern , in a winter were it is impossible to get warm anywhere this is a great addition to anyone 's wardrobe .	1
This short story definitely had a twist and I loved it -It had me torn at some points and so pleased at others ! SL Scott is good with keeping her stories fresh and not being able to expect what is going to happen next ! !	1
My only complaint , not long enough nor enough history of the main characters . However , this book was a pleasant surprise . I 'm not going to spoil it for any future readers , but this book was definitely worth the purchase .	1
For a first book this was amazing . I truly enjoyed everything about both the main characters . If you are looking for a good read this is it .	1
The author has crafted a simple , yet informative book with powerful information for anyone suffering with any form of gluten problem . This book is short enough to read in one sitting , but filled with great information of what gluten is and why it effects so many people . He explains the reason for writing this book and outlines a number of ways to deal with gluten issues . This is a great source of knowledge and information presented in a straight forward manner . Highly recommend this book to those suffering and their family so they can understand the difficulties associated with gluten .	1
For a short story it was really amazing and left me awestruck and wanting more ! ! Looking forward to the first book ! !	1
WOW - from the beginning of the first page to the end of the last i was hooked - line and sinker ... ... Could not get enough of this gripping , witty , romance - defiantly recommend purchasing the second half of this suspenseful or even better getting the box set with the other great Riley J. Ford novel Into you . Had to read this book every chance i got - eating break , walking on the treadmill , waiting for the kids at the school gate ... ... could not put it down ... ... .	1
Loved it but hate that you have to get the next one to follow the story . It was free but the next one you have to buy . not cool .	1
I 've been reading articles by Jackie Clay for well over a decade . She has articles in several magazines and I 've yet to see a question posed to her about food preservation she could n't answer . This work is a collection of question and answers from various magazines , so it is n't like reading a regular book about canning , but it will give answers you wo n't find easily elsewhere .	1
So I borrowed this book thru book lending . I was reading along totally immersed in this world the author has created when bam ! It ended . I looked at the percentage and saw 98 % . Darn it . Forgot it was part one . Now I am on the search for the rest of the story . Need to read it ALL NOW ! ! !	1
This was a wonderful book . Truly enjoyed all three books . Looking forward to the prequel . Adding Ava Claire as one of my fav authors .	1
This book was helpful however , not very detailed . I did get a few pointers and used them when I opened my Facebook account .	1
Sue Grafton books are very exciting , I love all her books . Would recommend this book very highly . The title character is very interesting .	1
Humans wanting to be robots , robots wanting to be human , this story has it all : a little bit of romance , a little bit of intrigue and a lot of soft ( but fun ) science-fiction . This is a good read for someone looking for a well-written but quick story . And , of course , robots are always fun .	1
What a wonderful book of self discovery . So often I 've seen others as well as myself coat their lives in unhealthy cocoon . Sometime we feel being fake is easier or safer in our society but it 's not fulfilling . This book shows how to recognize and express your natural self in a fulfilling , life changing way . I highly recommend it .	1
Royce , you 've knocked it out of the ballpark with these easy-to-cook soup recipes . Right off the bat you advise making a vegetable soup stock , which for most seasoned cooks is probably elementary , but it was the first time I 'd ever heard about keeping such a stock for when the soup mood strikes.I loved the simplicity of the recipes and the easy instructions . I also liked it very much that you give the nutrition facts for each soup at the end of the cooking instructions . My favorite recipe so far is the Cream of Broccoli Soup recipe . It is listed as one of the spur of the moment soups . Highly recommended !	1
This story was far too exciting for a bedtime read ! I could n't put the Kindle down until I knew he would be safe , which means technically , I should still be holding it . I truly hope this will become a series . I thought the writing was excellent and the premise thought provoking . Give it a try , it 's well worth your time !	1
Robyn Carr has done it again . With 15th and 16th Century stories about England and her Kings with a little love story thrown in.I also recommend By Right of Arms , The Blue Falcon , and Chelynne .	1
It was a very cute short story that kept me going and did n't want to lay it down . I would love to read more of these ! Thank you	1
A wonderful and a cute short story This would have been a great love adventure in Venice at Christmas time .	1
Very good from authors that I have not had the chance of reading yet . All the stories were very fresh and interesting .	1
This short story is the `` meet and greet '' to a budding romance . In just a few pages we get to know the characters and by the end , wish we knew how their story continues . I 'll definitely be looking for more pieces by this author .	1
This writer put a lot of time and effort into developing her & # 34 ; world & # 34 ; and the result is a fun and exciting read . You will be amazed at the details and figurative language that make the reader feel like an up-close-and-personal observer . Though there is a satisfying resolution of several issues , the ending is most certainly a beginning as well , leading perfectly into a sequel ( hint , hint Ms . Shaw ! ) .	1
This is a sweet romantic fantasy novel with a splash of adventure . This book leaves open for a sequel but has an ending ( no dramatic cliffhanger . ) Characters : The book is written in third person following both Carina and Marek . Carina is an emotionally abused girl by her father and sister , but that does n't stop her from finding herself . Although she can be submissive to them , she has strength and courage in her personality . Her one respite is to care for the critons ( fantasy creature ) . King Marek becomes smitten with her and the story takes off from there . By taking Carina and Marek 's point of views , the reader is able to understand the motives for both parties and their decisions better . As with most romance novels , misunderstanding fuels the beginning of their fragile relationship . The `` bad '' characters are mostly one-dimensional but they have some complexities to them . The reader does n't get too much background on them to understand their motives , but they work in the story.Plot : The plot , at least romantically , is about average in that many books carry the same idea within their own story - misunderstandings , finding out true love , etc . The adventure side of the plot was well written and I finished reading the book in 2 days . It kept my interest and kept the characters moving forward.Overall , I liked this book . It had a likeable heroine and hero within a fantasy world . If you like fantasy romances with a splash of adventure , you would like this book .	1
I was leery of getting a book ( even though it was free ) with so few reviews . I was thoroughly surprised and very happy I 'd chosen to download it . I will put this author on my 'watch ' list and follow . It just put you into the story so well . Take a minute , download then spend a few hours enjoying a different world . I did and loved it ! !	1
This book was exciting with romance thrown in . The characters were very interesting and very believable . The plot of the story was easy to follow .	1
What better tour guide than a bug eyed extraterrestrial in a purple spaceship ? And what a clever way to introduce children to other geographical places . I 'm hoping this is just the start of Humphrey 's adventures . Clever , charming , brilliantly simple , and very effective teaching vehicle ( a little spaceship pun there ) . Highly recommended for young children .	1
Frozen confectionaries are ubiquitous in America . Who does n't have fond memories of Mister Softee plying his trade as ( s ) he slowly wends their way down neighborhood streets throughout the summer ? Or being able to ride your bike to the local Dairy Queen or some other mom-and-pop ice cream stand with a friend or two and partake of a Dilly Bar or a Peanut Buster Parfait ? Nowadays , it 's most likely cheaper to buy a half-gallon of ice cream at the supermarket than fork over several dead presidents for a Good Humor bar being sold at cost to a bunch of neighborhood kids . When I was a kid , a single-scoop ice cream cone cost forty cents . Nowadays , the same item can run you almost four dollars.This is no exaggeration.As much as these frozen goodies saturate our collective memories , Stephen Williams asserts that there is a much healthier and cheaper alternative -- -the popsicle . ( Or , as the Brits would say , the iced lolly . ) '' Popsicles : Healthy Snack in an Instant '' declares unequivocally that , like its sister tome about smoothies , making your own popsicles using fresh fruit is not only a better , wiser alternative to cakes and cookies and other assorted sugary flotsam , but also leaves your wallet a bit fatter as well.Why would this be ? Generally speaking , consumers pay for advertising ( read : brand name products ) . So , popsicles that come in a box with the trademark label `` Popsicles '' will cost more than , say , `` Hyde Farms Brand Popsicle Treats . '' Not only is the former much more widely known , but the higher cost is justified due to the tremendous amount of advertising sent out by the manufacturers of `` Popsicle . '' Revenues need to be recouped somehow , and since `` Popsicle '' has been a brand name that 's existed for over a half-century , there is not much doubt that people who are craving a frozen treat on a stick will have no real strong objection to paying a bit more for a trusted brand . Increased costs are marked up in gradual , subtle increments so as not to spook the public , and so , as the price increases slightly each year , rationalization and justification set in . `` Popsicles '' provides recipes for making numerous variations on an old summer standby , and Williams exhorts his readers to take advantage of them as often as possible . He ties together the idea of making and eating a variety of popsicles with the larger , long-term goal of living and maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle : `` Eating healthy is the best choice you can make today to change your life . . .popsicles are a great ( dessert ) that ( require ) almost no effort at all . . . ( b ) ecause they 're delicious , fancy and healthy ! '' ( intro . ) I have had the opportunity and pleasure to review Williams 's writings , and he consistently churns out sound , well-intentioned books that cater to helping his readers help themselves improve different aspects of their lives . He has written books about being assertive and confident in social settings ; about learning and developing latent talents and interests such as cooking and blogging ; about staying physically and emotionally well ; about maintaining proper diet , and so forth.Williams continually writes with enthusiasm and a certain je nai se quois ; it is evident that , though he may get a bit rah-rah at times , it is done without malice and should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt . `` Popsicles '' is a book that fits a particular niche : namely , cooking and/or entertaining at home . It is written for all ages and allows the imagination to be let loose . Creativity and fun are its overarching traits and in no way resembles the solid , classic colors and flavors that have been the popsicle 's trademark for decades . Flexibility and adaptation , such as what graces the pages of Williams 's work , allow for certain products to survive into the twenty-first century . Hey , if Heinz ketchup can be mass-produced in a dark green hue , then why ca n't the popsicle be produced in colors that span the known spectrum ? `` Popsicles '' outlasts any brain freeze .	1
my girls love this book they have been having me read it to them since they were 3 and 4 years old . having it available in ebook format is awesome now they get to read it to me	1
This book is excellent for bedtime ... or even in a classroom ! The illustrations are delightfully whimsical as well . What a great story !	1
We like this story over all ! Will be reading it frequently I am sure , just wish it had the read to me option .	1
The newest in the series and hard to put down . This author does not dissapoint and ca n't wait for the next installment . It 's been a thrill ride from the very first book in the serious and it continues to thrill .	1
Story line is great , with the wit of the lead lady , ith her guy pals . The twist and turns of the other characters go along well with the lead male and females . Enjoying them !	1
This one might be my new favorite of the series . Brute has always been a background guard character who was big , but sweet . Elise we met in the previous book as the horribly abused fox shifter that Maddy and Ricker rescue . I was a little concerned about how these two would actually work and how much freaking out would be involved.The romance in this book was a lot slower than the previous installments . This was done for obvious reasons , but it made for a lot more time spent with the dating phase and the adorable-ness that is Brute trying to win over his mate . Elise proved herself to be a tough chick and Brute is her ultimate protector ( even though she can still rock it on her own ) . The overall storyline is still progressing in a positive direction , even with some turns down to a deep dark place . The Ridgeville pack is growing with each passing book . Eventually , I think , there will end up being no more mate-able options . Unless we get to see Grayson 's mating book come up , in a few years.I 'm still loving these yummy little books . For fans of paranormal romance , with smutty goodness , these books are the perfect quick read .	1
This is the best one yet . Emotions are well done . A very enjoyable read . I was even tearful after the photo scene . Well done .	1
This book was very good and informative . I have found several sites that were helpful for finding good books to read . It was great to find websites that help you find what you are looking for ! I use several sites everyday ! Thank you for such precise information and helping me find such great sites .	1
I really enjoyed this story . It kept my interest all the way through . I believe God does work miracles in our lives and that He loves us very much even though we are broken vessels . I think you will be happy that you chose this book .	1
This book had more action than the first ! I usually do n't buy all of the books in a series , but I just could n't stop reading this one ! Well done !	1
Well not g what I really expected from this book the first one was ok to buy well let 's just say if read better .	1
Where Treasure Hides is first and foremost a love story . Alison Schulyer and Ian Devlin met on a train platform in London in August , 1939 . Although they fell in love immediately , circumstances continually tore them apart . Alison 's family owned a prominent art gallery in Holland , and , although Ian was heir to a title and an estate , he was serving in the English army . War loomed ahead of them , but Alison was afraid of loving him for another reason . She believed she was cursed by a fate that would cause any man she loved to die . But Ian would n't give up , and Alison was unable to deny her feelings for him for very long.Although Alison and Ian 's love story was the basis for this novel , it was n't all mushy . There was a lot of history included in it . It moved fairly quickly , covering time from 1939-1945 in it 's approximately 500 pages . Ian was captured on the beaches of Dunkirk , and sent to a POW camp in Germany . After attempting to escape , he was moved to another camp , where escape was considered impossible . He remained there for two years . Alison took comfort in the fact that he was safe from the fighting there . She did n't know that he eventually escaped , and while running across Germany toward freedom , he was asked by a dying woman to take care of her young daughter . Meanwhile , Alison and her family worked in Holland , first to hide treasures from the Nazi 's , then to smuggle children out of Holland . When they were caught , Alison escaped both the Gestapo , and the unwanted advances of Theodor , a German who intended to marry her to further the Aryan race . She fled to safety in England , where she was reunited with Ian . But Theodor was n't finished yet . He conceived a plan to get her back , and nearly destroyed her and Ian 's love forever.I enjoyed this book more than any I 've read for a while . While it is historical , it was n't bogged down with dates and names of army officials or information about military movements . ( I like reading books like that , but I know that is n't everyone 's cup of tea . ) Because of this the reading does go more smoothly and much faster . And I always love a good love story ! The way the book ended there could be a sequel . At least I hope so because I definitely want to read it.I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for this review . All opinions are my own .	1
I loved this book so mush . I wont however be reading the next books in this series since this ended in a way that felt perfect for me . I am not that much a fan of menages or switching partners ... But this is a lovely read and a BIG recommendation to every m/m fan out there .	1
Wow I loved everything about this bookie as sucked . Right into the story of to get the rest of them .	1
I wished that there was more in this little book ! The projects are simple and fun and can be used in different ways to make something special . It is worth looking into at the seasonal holidays .	1
Have not looked this through book yet , but in time I will spend time reading this and enjoy the book .	1
Very interesting story line . Hope there are more Jordan and Kayci to come , especially now that Jordan understands his ability !	1

Did the book really make me cry ? Yes , it did . I cried a lot during this book . It was so sad . Monica was better than me cuz I would not have given Elgin 8 years of my life . He was a dirty dog . It was funny to me how he was Mr.Perfect and then the he asks her to marry him and he up and changes . I did n't see that coming . I 'm glad Derwynn stayed the same . I did n't think after his love for Moica that he would even move on for a while , but he proved me wrong . It was a good book . Very sad though .	1
What a gem . I was unsure when I started reading this novel but it is a wonderful book for Austin fans and fans of a well written and amusing story .	1
I loved this book . It was a pleasant return to all the lovable characters , but told from a new character 's point of view . New storyline and a few new characters , but I liked that this story moved the old characters forward and managed to keep that wonderful English country tone and setting .	1
I have read many Pride and Prejudice variations / sequels and this novel was one of the better representatives in terms of authentic Jane Austin-style wit . Furthermore , characters remain true to the original story , so even though Lizzy and Darcy do not play central roles , you still continue to enjoy inhabiting their world for one more novel .	1
This review is from : Dark Return ( Seeker , # 2 ) ( Kindle Edition ) 4.5 super stars ! WooooooooooooooooooooooW ! I just ca n't explain how much I liked this book . The first one was good but this one is scary good.I finished it a minute ago and I 'm so excited , I want to jump and dance and bang my head against the wall because I 'll have to wait until who-knows-when for book 3 ! As always , Taryn 's writing style left me speechless . It 's fluent , fast paced , entertaining and fun.Also the characters are well developed and we have a very interesting addition , that apparently will be also in book 3.I love the fact that we get to know more about Kai 's past life in a sort of flashbacks . This gave him more realism . He is still beyond sexy and cocky and I love him for that but now he also is easier to relate to.Kai and Janie 's dynamism while they are together is stunning . Kick a** couple ! Tania , what a great character and I love her being a 'bada** ' vampire leader as well as a fashion lover lol.Janie improved a lot , she was way better in this book than the previous one.The only reason why I did n't give it 5 stars is because the love story here is not as strong as in the first instalment.The end was utterly amazing ! A super huge cliffhanger ! When I reached the end I was thinking like : What ? ? ? is this already over ? ! ? ! ? ? ! It was too short !	1
Only Robert J. Crane can make me literally laugh , scream , gasp , cry , and smile during reading . I loved this book . I could n't put it down . The ending made my day .	1
This is one of those books that I wish I had read a long time ago , when was starting out trying to communicate with men . I thought I knew how to do that but after reading this book , I realize realize that what I knew about was communicating with women . i 've always expected men to respond to conversations the way my girlfriends do . now when I think about some of my past relationships , i wish i could have a do over . From ex 's to bosses to lovers , this book breaks down men 's needs in conversations and their limits . a lot of this applies to general relationship issues i think , Very valuable .	1
This is a handy little guide to taking better photos . It has lots of great tips for shooting in various scenarios . I got a little confused with some terms and it seemed to end abruptly ... I was thinking of a 4 rating . Then I noticed how the Table Of Contents was all nicely indexed ... I think this would be the perfect little guide because you can just jump to the exact scenario you have.It turns out to be kind of the perfect use for the Kindle as a quick reference guide . Nice job.I think you 'll get some great ideas in this book . I agree , it 's a keeper.Yours , Ed Kaine , Authorrecognition of a prisoner	1
This is a good breakdown on the fundamentals of photography . The author provides a lot of valuable info on how to use the various camera settings as ISO , Shutter speed , F stops , etc . and how to use them to shoot a variety of shots . He explains in detail how to photograph both scenery and people . There are many fine photos that he uses to support his points . I think this book is an excellent read for budding photographers and anyone interested in improving their photo skills . I highly recommend .	1
Very well written ; Outstanding short stories ! Enjoyed it to the last page ! Really enjoyed the stories being in Maine . Great book !	1
A very interesting collection of short stories . I enjoyed all 4 of them . The subject matter was twisted and spoke volumes of the current state of the human race . Definitely recommended as one of my favorites in the genre .	1
This book is a great continuing of the first . I hope that everyone gets their heads on straight and the third book is as great as the first two .	1
Written from a very different perspective , this well-written erotic tale speaks from the male point of view . None of the flowery , romantic lovemaking in this one but rather the raw , realistic side of a sexual relationship with a twist . With the frequent change between who was actually the dominating partner , it kept me turning the pages well into the early morning hours . Definitely recommended for you adventurous erotica readers !	1
Science fiction fans ! I found us an author to fill the void left behind by Arthur C. Clarke and Carl Sagan , and his name ? Steve S. Grant . Mr. Grant has written a brilliant novel entitled The Dreamer Genome which begins in 2020 , after a scientist conducts genetic manipulations , in secret , to give human fetuses the ability to survive long periods of hibernation . In other words , he splices genetic material from bears and humans to create a prototype for cryogenic life.When the clandestine lab is destroyed to avoid discovery , test subjects are scattered and the reader watches these boys grow up and gets to monitor their changes . All of the boys live fantastic lives but genetic failure claim the lives of many . The reader and the scientist who created these boys learn which genetic manipulations worked and which have not . As the boys grow up , some of them , resent the corporate greed that rules them and fight to live an ordinary live , even with extraordinary genes . The reader sees the struggle of a few young men try to be individuals who have their own hopes and dreams fight against their pre-programmed purpose . They do not want to be guinea pigs who must give up everything to further scientific research into cryogenics but many of them can not escape their fate.It is even more difficult to escape when the man who you have known as your father a scientist who created you for observation.Love , hate , and genetic destiny are major themes in this book and they are explored from a variety of points of view . The Dreamer Genome presents some very realistic potraits of human beings . There are villains who love and heroes who hate . The multiplicity of the ethical issues that surround human experimentation and the scientists who work on such experiments are portrayed with depth and feeling . This is a book that will make you think long after the book is closed.The Dreamer Genome tells us that to live forever , things will be sacrificed : hopes and dreams ; morals and sometimes even men .	1
Enjoyed it ; Took me longer than normal to read it . It was a different slant on a mystery , love episode.I would read some more of the author 's books.SW	1
I was looking for a book that was clean , good character development , and enjoyable . This book was it ! I loved the story line.Laura comes home after receiving an email from her sister , Candace . She is not sure what to think because when they were younger , Candace bullied Laura . When Laura arrives & # 34 ; home & # 34 ; , she finds a big mess ! Candace and her husband are virtually separated and both working too much . Her brother , Thomas , is taking care of their kids . Laura finds she is still in love with Dalton , who is living with her brother . She loves her niece and nephew and gets to teach them some valuable lessons about forgiveness , love , kindness , and learning to give things to God ! Is there any hope for any of this to be fixed ? Communication , love and forgiveness are key elements of this book ! I will definitely read more from this author !	1
I have been privileged enough to have a couple `` sneak peeks '' at Daniel Swensen 's writing - both this , and a couple other projects in the works , and I am in awe of his skill . His ability to capture human nature , its frustrations and double-edged triumphs , to communicate the raw edges of life without scalding your conscience - this is his forte , and it is well exhibited in this tense , gritty short about a pyromaniac gone rogue . `` Pyromanic rogue '' might be a better turn of phrase , for Alexa does n't just set things on fire like any principled arsonist - she IS the fire , holding an innate ability to engulf what she likes in flame - buildings , boxcars , people . She 's subtle , too , able to hold her gift in and use it in more nefarious , backhanded ways , such as in her early retaliation against her mother . In quick succession , we are given flashes of Alexa 's life as she goes from isolation to neglect , to betrayal of multiple stripes , to being the lone vigilante against the covert operation that wants to make her their top secret weapon . The only chink in her armor ? Cav , the man who stands as the lone strand of sanity in her tormented life , and who is both her heart and her hate.Tightly crafted with pathos and precision , Alexa 's cascade of moral dilemmas will keep you twisting and turning with her to the very end .	1
I started getting into paranormal books on Kindle with this author . This book did n't disappoint me . It starts with the king repaying a debt and the story took off from there . Interesting sex scenes with different partners . Love characters even the so call bad guys . You know the outcome but you keep reading to find out how , since this supposed to be last of the series . It brought you update about characters previous books in the series . I hope she finds a way to give status about the villain who was put in situation . I enjoyed the read .	1
This book also includes links to the video content of it ... absolutely amazing and powerful information for any business ! I 'm so glad I took the time to watch and read and listen to the info given here . It will change my life and the way I do business !	1
The short story is exactly that . If you expect a novel in the way of all of Laurie King 's books I have read thus far , you will be sorely unsatisfied .	1
I have n't had time to read this yet but when I do I will be sure to let you know how it is .	1
AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE , I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE AMAZON PROCEDURE WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO SIMPLY READ , AND RATE , A BOOK WITHOUT SPEWING MY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY IT WAS , OR WAS N'T , A GOOD READ . IS N'T THE RATING ENOUGH ?	1
This is a story your kids will love . In her attack on Santa Claus , the witch casts a spell on him , turning him into a succession of creatures , both animal and human . Their doings will delight young children . Without giving away too much , I loved the red cat with the pink nose , and children will love the smelly diaper ! Like all good children 's stories , this one has a moral ending : the young witch redeems herself and becomes worthy of Santa 's love and attention . It reminded me of Dr Seuss 's Grinch , and the Cat in the Hat 's struggle with the spots .	1
Great book . Very heartfelt and funny . Colorful and sad but a great book to read and I enjoyed reading this book	1
The author brings problems to life . One woman 's medical needs leads her on a path to happiness . Add in her handsome boss and life ca n't get much better . Enjoyable from start to finish .	1
This is a free download for word buff members but it is very helpful on what words work great in scabble some unknown wordsor words you might know but just do n't remember . Great tool	1
Richard Bowker presents an awesome look at the role of a P.I . in a post-apocalyptic world . My first reaction was what on Earth would the remains of society need a Private Investigator for & # 8212 ; it & # 8217 ; s unlikely a P.I . would be hired to checkout phony insurance claims when there ain & # 8217 ; t no more insurance companies . Richard builds a compelling plot with polished nuances sparkling for the reader . The plight of the survivors in Boston is rather frightful . The contrast between the shattered United States and merry old England is striking . He provides a nicely developed depth to his cast of players , and with all things considered , their surroundings are believable . I liked how he addresses real world money issues and there isn & # 8217 ; t a P.I . with a pocket full of cash & # 8212 ; but a meal at a London McDonalds is affordable . Richard did a marvelous job of resolving all the dangling loose ends & # 8212 ; including a few dangling parts the reader doesn & # 8217 ; t suspect are dangling & # 8212 ; so to speak.Enjoy often & # 8230 ; John	1
this book is a hard read as I need the dictionary yet it is very interesting . I love the way it starts out explaining the author and his background . After watching the movie and then the videos on the 10 and 25 anniversaries I wanted to read the book . It is proving to be a very time consuming project as the book is over 2000 pages . l feel it is a very good book to read and understanding what was happening during the time period and yet is still happening now .	1
Unusual story about World War II and the impact on a part of the world about which I know little . I love Australians , so the intrigue there was very good for me . Definitely recommend .	1
Of course if you enjoy Dorothy Sayers ' fiction , you 'll enjoy this collection . A note about the contents : This collection includes stories published in the books Hangman 's Holiday and Lord Peter Views the Body . It does not include the stories published in Striding Folly or In the Teeth of the Evidence .	1
I enjoyed this series from beginning to end . The characters are great . The stories are filled with humor and steamy romance !	1
The men in this trio of books are tough guys the ones that you went to school with , friends of your brother 's you know the hot ones who are too flirtatious and not the marrying kind not for you to date ... . until they meet the ladies in this trio ! I loved the setups that Ms. Herron has for each couple , just twisted enough to keep me up late reading each story ! I wish I had a family like these characters do ! Will definitely be reading more of this author 's work !	1
I loved it ! I wish I Love Lucy was not a short story and full on book like the others . I loved the women as they we 're independent and tough . Definitely a good read .	1
This is a wonderful set ! A contemporary romance that will definitely make you laugh out loud ! It has wonderful heartwarming connections , a few steamy scenes , and a little suspense thrown in too ! It has a wonderful message about things in your past and keeping secrets from those you love . I definitely recommend these three books ! Book Junky - [ ... ]	1
I love how Rita lets you get to know her characters . By the time you finish all three books you feel like they are your friends .	1
I loved Evan and Gabe , but this was too short ! I need more of these two . Nothing like to hot studs bonding over tattoos and bikes and steamy play time !	1
I was given a copy of this book by the author for an honest review.I loved this story . Evan is a man who for years has spent his life denying his true self . Getting tattoos to allow the pain of the needles to release the need he denies himself . The story takes you on a journey of self discovery and coming to terms with your true identity . A truly romantic and loving read . Passionate and erotic.Piper Kay does an amazing job bringing her characters to life and allowing you to immerse yourself in the journey along with them . A steamy novel.A great read for anyone looking for an erotic romance . That does n't skimp on the romance just for sake of scenes.Love	1
I was fortunate to win both book one and book two of this series . Basically the review I left for the first one is about the same for this one . However , in this second book of the series the cast of characters became even more alive with their different quirks and personalities . Each one is definetelly an individual and well described through their thoughts and actions . Again , love , faith , action , fame and drama surrounds the whole family which makes this a great read . Easily understood , faith based yet not overwhelming . I am intrigued with this writer and look forward to reading the next book . Once you fall in love with these people who have now become alive to you , you just have to find out what is next .	1
Book one took me a few minutes to get into , but once I did , I quickly downloaded books 2 & 3 as well . Maeve has a way of making her characters come to life and it 's not just a mushy boy meets girl and now everything 's perfect- it 's about two imperfect people that are perfect for each other , problems and all . I ca n't wait to read more about these amazing characters in book 3 .	1
This book starts out pretty raw and honest . And from there gives the down and dirty details as to why we 're overweight and unhealthy ... most of us live our lives on the CRAP diet : Caffeine , Refined sugars , Alcohol and Processed foods . From there , the author introduces better choices in food , mindset and action to turn your health around . I found a lot of useful information I will be applying .	1
Whether you are a busy woman or a slow elderly person , this book is important to read for your health ! It contains extensive and very understandable information on healthy living that I have been researching to find answers to for years . Not only do I want to recommend this book to everyone interested in working toward good health and longevity , but also would like to thank the authors for the many valuable tips given all through this book . One example , I have been trying to find out which salt is the best , healthiest to use and where to buy it . Well , I found that out and much more by reading this book and am so glad that I did . I have used much of what I learned in altering my own family recipes to be more healthy and would like to thank the authors for their contribution to our nutritional knowledge.I have been a caregiver for a number of friends with debilitating diseases and this book has helped me encourage them to improve their diets as well . Also , this book is very informative and readable ( I could n't stop reading it and finished it in one afternoon ) ; and the techniques presented for dieting , detoxing and healthy living are quite doable for everyone.By Martha Love , author ofMom 's Island Bakens : Over 50 Altered Recipes For a Happy Gut and a Healthy Heart	1
I really enjoyed this book and will be looking for more by Price McNaughton . It was rather easy for me to follow the characters even though some parts split between characters , there was only a few times I was confused as to which character I was reading . I found this book to be very well written and very well put together . I did not see the ending coming the way it did , bravo Price for keeping me on my toes to the very end !	1
Unbelievable that this is the first book written by McLaughlin . Excellent all the way through . I love mysteries but usually have an idea who is the bad guy . This one took me completely by surprise . I like the first person aspect as well . Great read . Did n't take me long ! !	1
Ca n't wait for book number 4 ... .I have really enjoyed this series of books . The story line is really good . I recommend this to everyone thank you , cashewR	1
This is true to the form for a Calvino story . I think Vincent may have gotten a bit more violent and I do n't think Moore knows Burma like he knows Thailand . The passion for place and the nuances of Thai life are so important in Moore 's stories that I find the difference in the level of sensitivity to things Burmese a bit of a letdown - only to be expected from one as well-versed in Thai culture as the author . Still ... the usual good read .	1
This book , Wolf 's Promise was much better than Wolf 's Haven . I loved it . There were some intense moments that were n't there in the first book . You did n't know what was going to happen from one instance to the next . Nick was the perfect Alpha male . I ca n't wait to read the last book in the three book set that I bought .	1
Bitten was everything I thought it would be , and oh so much more ! There was the paranormal aspect of course , but the drama and intense feelings just draw you in.Not to mention the super sexy , smoking hot love scenes ! Lexi Maxxwell scored big with this one , ca n't wait for the sequel .	1
Alone , Kiera Hunter arrives in Phnom Penh , Cambodia to be greeted with a monsoon , a runaway tuk tuk and two thieves who attack her to steal her belongings . They get her suitcase but she wrestles for the backpack as if her life depended on saving it ... .and it does . Her future plans anyway . It holds the answer to a secret that her dying Grandfather made her promise to find . Unfortunately , this treasure is hidden deep in the jungles off the Ho Chi Minh trail where humans just are n't welcome . The prize , an icon of a woman on an elephant , Trung Trac , the greatest female warrior in Southeast Asian history is priceless and the Buddhists have long given up hope it still exists . There is only one man Kiera can trust to help her retrieve this statue -- to even get her to her destination and to the contents from her grandfather 's ancient plane crash . His name is Porter Vale . The minute they meet chemistry sparks and the conflicts begin . Seems there 's two other rich dudes who want to get to the plane also , and they 'll go to any extremes to get what they want . This adventure is reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie with the same engaging characters and the typical following of explosive action . This wonderful story never gets boring . It 's written so well that before the reader is aware , you 're pulled into the exciting adventure and the pages just keep turning . Who cares about anything like sleep or work ! ! : - ) With lines like : `` I reserve hate for evil people . If you get me killed I might change my mind . Until then you 're just a real pain in the as- ! '' I found this to be one of my favorite romance/adventure books in a long while . Hope there 's more to follow ! !	1
I loved the research , information and detail regarding the Viet Nam war and its aftermath in Laos . Also details about the people , traditions and life in that region . The story was full of action . But there was in my opinion poor character development . There was n't even much physical description of the characters . I could n't quite connect with them . And their romance was not believable . But still a good story .	1
I recommend reading them . I like the plots , the editing , the story flow , and the characters . The only stand out thing I do n't like is that they are short stories which feel like single chapters to a larger novel , and I have little patience waiting for a much larger section of reading to sink my imagination into the world and story this author is painting a picture of .	1
I found myself wanting the story to continue . What will happen next and why ? Please put all of this in a book , which would be better in so many ways . Still , I recommend this series . The first few I have read have been very good reads . Since I read at least 2 books a week , that is high praise from me .	1
This one had me literally laughing out loud at my desk . Never send a diplomat to do a dog 's work .	1
Once again our faithful author has scored a bullseye . Using his favorite character Wilson and his trademark sense of humor , he has written a very entertaining chapter !	1
Enjoyed this mini-book and plan to buy the combined series after I finish reading the rest of his works . What I liked best about Scalzi style is his sense of humor that creeps in every so often . Does go into detail from time to time , but I find this to be just the right amount for the story.Just bought THE GHOST BRIGADES and am looking forward to reading more about Jane Sagan .	1
A solid opening to Scalzi 's new short-form series . Probably not the place to start , but recommended if you 're already a fan of Old Man 's War and its sequels .	1
As usual , this is a great book with powerful characters . I look forward to reading the full series . I 'm locked and loaded on my kindle !	1
Too short for my liking , I thought I was sitting down to a good full length novel only to suddenly find it ending and that it was only a short story .	1
I want to read forever about John Scalzi 's alternative universe and human future . The politics in this opening chapter are also ot unlike the book I read about Elizabeth I 's spymaster for it 's account of how diplomacy really works !	1
Lt. Heather Lee and her squad have been called to squash a rebellion on a colony world . They do their job and are enjoying drinks afterwards when they are kidnapped and tucked away somewhere no messages can get through to their brainpals . Not to mention Lt. Lee wakes up naked , tied up and blindfolded being spoken to by someone who calls themselves Number Two . She 's being asked questions about the Colony Defense Force movements and capabilities which if she refuses to answer she will be shot . With only her brain she must figure out how to get out of the situation she finds herself in.Scalzi does it again with this very short section of the book . I ca n't wait for # 9 !	1
Really enjoying this , unfortunately I have another week to wait for the next installment ! Keep up the great work , mr scalzi !	1
Ok . I am completely hooked . At $ 0.99 per fix , my 401k is in jeopardy . Mister author , master writer from the great beyond , do n't leave the story junkies jonesing ( let 's beat this metaphor to seat ) for the next installment . Maybe you could do this on radio .	1
This book contains a series of articles that appeared in print and online on Scientific American website , primarily between 2012 to present . Most of the articles are written by specialists in the field , including some by leading researchers and Nobel Prize winners . Overall the book makes for excellent reading and makes cutting edge research intelligible to the ordinary man . Reasonably priced and definitely well worth a read .	1
MAGGIE IS THE THIRD SISTER OF THREE HIGH LIGHTED BY EACH ROMANCE IN THE WILD WEST . MAGGIE IS CONTENT THE WAY HER LIFE IS BUT CAN NOT GET A CERTAIN MAN OUT OF HER MIND , OR LIFE . AFTER MANY TURNS AND TWISTS , A HAPPY ENDING . THIS IS A SAGA OF THREE SISTERS HARD TO PUT DOWN AND YOU WILL WANT TO GO ON TO THE NEXT BOOK JUST AS YOU FINISH THE FIRST ONE .	1
I absolutely love this series ! This wrapped up some questions I had from previous stories . Well worth the read if you looking for a legnthy series !	1
Jesse , I know that Nicki cares for you very much and does not want you to hurt and be sad over her . There is someone out there for you . You and Sean are great friends do n't let her spoil that bond .	1
Another great addition to the Hell Yeah series . This is a true to form story for the series with amazing characters that will steal your heart and your breath ! Ca n't wait to see what happens next .	1
This story is awesome ... ..from lowest of lows to the highest of highs . The story of Zane and Presley is captivating ... ..for each look to the heart & really learn what love is . This book contains , love , lust , friendship , loyalty , betrayal , & the promise of what is to come.Highly recommend ... ...	1
WOW ... .Zane has been an attraction since I first met him in Sable 's other book . Zane can see more than most sighted people ever could until he meets Presley . At times he feels he is n't good enough for her . Presley is shy and a wallflower due to scar . They help each other over come the insecurities . A very good love story . As with most of Sable 's books it was a quick read for me . You get so involved with the story you ca n't put it down . Another must read . Sable is worth it go get the whole set you wo n't be sorry ! ! ! !	1
Sable Hunter has reached for the reader 's emotions with this one . She reached for them , grabbed them , twisted , turned , carressed , loved , and cherished them ! This installment in the Hell Yeah ! series takes the reader on a journey that is on a deeper level than the previous books in the series . Being able to watch Zane and Presley discover each other along with themselves with all the maddness that is the McCoy family ( now families ) evolving around them . I could not put this book down even while laughing , getting angry at Zanes family , the cruel girl 's being mean to Presley , or while crying during the last section of the book . Cheers to Miss Sable Hunter ! You did not disappoint with this installment and you have quickly become one of my favorite authors ! Thank you !	1
I won a copy of this book in Elle Casey 's Springtime Indie Book Giveaway.A page turner ! This has some really fantastic characters , given depth and personality and realistic , complicated lives . Even the minor characters feel like real people . It was so refreshing to see someone like Devlin , who has hardened herself after having been dealt a fairly crappy hand in life , having to deal with a supernatural threat on top of everything else - especially as opposed to becoming smitten with a supernatural love interest - and interesting to think about precisely what made her seem like a good target.There is very little humor in this book , but that does n't mean there is n't any softness or love . There is nothing easy here , and that 's partly what makes it so good . I am looking forward to reading more from this author !	1
I & # 8217 ; ve read other books by this author and enjoyed them . Stake You grabbed my attention because of the cool cover and title . The story didn & # 8217 ; t grip me at first , but I kept reading and before the halfway mark , I was anxious to find out how it would all pan out for the heroine , Dev.We guess that the creepy new boy at school is a vampire from the very start . Dev describes him as an Edward Cullen wannabe who wears sunglasses indoors , and pretty soon he has a vulnerable girl under his spell.Dev ( full name Devlin O & # 8217 ; Mara ) , our protagonist , is a tough girl . She & # 8217 ; s had it hard looking after her alcoholic mother for the past number of years and spends most of her time outside of school working long hours at a pub to pay the bills and put food on the table . It & # 8217 ; s clear something bad happened in her past with one of her mother & # 8217 ; s loser exes , but Dev doesn & # 8217 ; t talk about it , or let herself think back too much . She & # 8217 ; s closed off , even from her boyfriend , Deco , and close friends.Her other love interest is Base , a decent , attractive guy with family problems of his own . These two should be together . The reader knows it , Base knows it , and Dev pretends not to know it . Grr , if only I was at that school to sort those kids out . Dev resists her feelings for Base because of a lie her bitchy friend , Shauna , told her years ago . Now the thing I couldn & # 8217 ; t understand was that Dev knows exactly what kind of trouble making cow her friend is . She must realise Shauna lied to her about Base & # 8230 ; Anyway , I suppose I & # 8217 ; m looking at all this high school drama through my grown-up eyes rather than a teenager & # 8217 ; s.Moving on to our villain . Sully is a creep . He scratches at windows , preying on vulnerable girls who & # 8217 ; ve had trouble in their life . He seeks out who he calls & # 8220 ; broken girls & # 8221 ; feeding off their pain , adding a new dimension to vampires . Dev isn & # 8217 ; t so easily entranced , however . Sully may be a vampire in this book , but he & # 8217 ; s a metaphor for the type of abusive man who controls the woman in his life with fear . Sully is a slimy , repulsive being , the kind of guy who enjoys making his girlfriend feel weak and dependent on him , cutting her off from other people.Stake You is quite a dark read for a Young Adult book with a vampire . Dev & # 8217 ; s homelife is just awful , and Base doesn & # 8217 ; t have it much better . They & # 8217 ; re both far too responsible and burdened down for people their age . Dev and Base & # 8217 ; s investigation of Sully is the most interesting aspect of the novel , for the simple reason that together , these two characters are compelling . I wouldn & # 8217 ; t mind spending more time with them . ****There & # 8217 ; s nothing beautiful or sexy about vampires in this book , and as such , it stands out from the crowd .	1
I was given a free copy of this book for an honest reviewI loved Davina ! ! Davina is trying to make her own movie and is hiding stolen property from her job in the house she is renting . Jake ( a cop currently leave ) has recently taken ownership of the house that Davina is renting and he knows she has something to hide . It made me laugh whenever he tried to spy on her to figure out what she was hiding . Oh and of course the brownies ! I love that she found a way to get him in her movie too ! I only gave it four stars because at times I just felt like some things were being dragged out , though I loved the story .	1
A very readable novel centred around a doctor who has lost his mind and also featuring a dermatologist . Well-drawn characters , an interesting plot and a worthwhile d & eacute ; ouement all make for very good read .	1
I did n't know anything about Steampunk before looking at this book , but the name caught my attention so I downloaded it . It 's a fun little quiz/game thing that I think kids would like doing . You are asked questions and then you click on the links . If you get it right , you go forward . If you get the answer wrong , you are told so and then you get the link to go back the original question so you can try again .	1
I chose this book to get some more information about features on the keyboard for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 '' . I appreciate this section of the book . I felt it was helpful and explained some items I had stumbled upon by accident.The book is written well and easy to follow along.It could be more informative with more details on how to use the camera . The pictures in this section were missing in my book.It was worth the investment .	1
Well written and easy to follow . This book explains a lot about the whole process of saving seeds.One of the easiest and most useful books I have read in a long time .There are some great ideas in this book and want to recommended this any one looking information on saving seeds .	1
Great story . Reminded me of Maya Banks Highlander series , but much steamier and with a pnr twist that was unique in the genre . Highly recommend .	1
I wanted to start a backyard garden , and wanted to try and keep it as organic as possible , an did not have much knowledge about where to start . I saw this guide and decided to pick it up . It explains everything for the beginner , like picking a spot to put the garden , how to preparing the soil , getting rid of pests , and even how to pick the vegetables.I thought the author laid everything out clearly for the beginner , and I now had an idea where to start at least . I am hoping to lay in a garden this spring , and am using the ideas presented here when planning everything . A great book for the beginner gardener , or someone wanting to become more organic with their garden .	1
This was a well crafted and inspiring book ! The thought provoking knowledge leads you to be one with this author . Gaiven Clairmont you have truly achieved your goal in writing this book ! Great Read ... . Rosalyn	1
ThisThe 7 Lamps of InspirationThis was a gift from its talented author , Gaiven Clairmont , to me as a way of helping me to lift myself through a particular hardship that I have endured nearly all of my life . I found that reading through Gaiven 's words truly comforted and consoled me into the kinds of realizations that are not so easy to come to terms with . This author has composed such a loving and nurturing view of God and his special powers over our daily struggles and motivations . I could not help admiring the deep insightful perspective that Gaiven is blessed to share with his readers . I would put down this book for a while , and it carried me throughout the day and night until I returned to pick it up again . Such is the power of this author 's persuasion . I recommend this book highly , to anyone . One does not have to be troubled to benefit from reading the words within . Everyone can feel good from reading Gaiven Clairmont , a truly exceptional spiritual envoy of God , whom I am very blessed to call a friend . Get your copy of The 7 Lamps of Inspiration as a gift to yourself . You will be so glad you did .	1
The start of the book was a bit odd to say the least , but once it got going you could n't tell how the ending was going to be , and that 's a good thing . Stick with it and it will be worth reading .	1
This is a little background from the ending of Angel Unborn , which is great by the way , and this lets you see from Ursus ` point of view . Came across the first book in a bundle and this author had me hooked . I am now reading the next one Angel Unleashed , it 's awesome .	1
I feel in love with this sister and am eager to get to know the rest of them ! Very well written and developed . I had forgotten what Maelyn was about as it has been a little while , so went back and read it again . Loved it the second time around and I know I will read Coralina a few times also . Excitement , clean romance , and endearing characters : I will never grow out of this type of story ! I am a grandmother , but still a young girl at heart !	1
I loved this book great ending but it 's kinda unclear great book for young girls not the regular pretty princess book	1
Wrath & Righteousness is a wake up call to a nation that is putting 'political correctness ' before common sense . This country was founded on principles that included a 'loving GOD ' and His gift , & # 34 ; a free will to chose & # 34 ; . This book describes the very possible consequences of our moral decay and ungrateful hearts . It also showcases the hearts of brave men who are willing to give their all for our country and of their families who bravely stand with them . If ever there was an example of why womanshould not be fighting in the special forces units , this is it . It is not exciting , it is gut wrenching and every God fearing Americanshould read it .	1
The Jack Noble series continues and brings with it twists and turns and excitement . Looking forward to the next one .	1
The start of the Storm family adventure . An epic western with action and interesting charactersMatt Chisholm has a nice writing style and his western are classics .	1
This is the story of Johnny Breede . A young man whose life is n't really going anywhere , content to goof around and get drunk and high with his best friend Kurt . That is until Kurt winds up dead , asphyxiated in his father 's GTO . That same car that his father killed himself in some years previously . Now an evil has been unleashed and Johnny must piece together the mystery before anyone else dies . A mystery that will involve Kurt 's family , the woods , Johnny 's boss , some missing children and a malevolent entity connected with the car . Can Johnny solve the puzzle or are more people doomed to die ? This was quite creepy . It was a book that I shall be thinking about for quite some time I think . I enjoyed it very much , this being the second book I have read from this author . The characters were all well-rounded , but not really likeable in the conventional sense . The were all wasters but somehow I was invested in finding out more about them . The paranormal aspect of the story was introduced and handled well . Be warned though , some scenes are quite graphic , both gorily and sexually . Not for the faint hearted ! If I have one gripe though , it is the car . Supposedly the focal point of the story , I would have liked more back story to it . This is another fine offering from DarkFuse , and I recommend it for a creepy , stay-with-you ghost story.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review .	1
This was one of the first apps I got after I received my new Kindle Fire . It really helped me decide which apps I wanted to use .	1
Thus book was very good . Easy to understand . I had a few of these apps already some I did n't . Some I did n't know even existed and they are awesome apps . Well worth the cheap money it cost , under 2.00	1
These were truly wonderful books . I could not put them down , every page was exciting..but the third book is unfinished , it ended right in the middle of a story ! What happened ? After reading 3 books , I want to know the ending ! I hope the author plans on finishing this story with another book..if not , I will be very disappointed.EDIT : To those who loved these books as I did..I just read Willow is releasing her 4th book in the series in March ! I for one can not wait !	1
This is an interesting story of one vision of an afterlife and given that I was intruiged , I will definitely read the last in the series to see how it turns out . The mixture of holding onto the earth life while embracing the new spirit life was quite entertaining and illustrates how people behave as they embrace a spiritual path in normal life , so that in itself made this book a good read for me . Have to agree with the other reviewers that the overbearing boyfriend is not a good role model ( especially for the afterlife ) but that was the only area that left me uncomfortable and that was okay as it felt intentional as part of the story . As always I applaud the courage and imagination of authors when I read a book and here again is another shining example .	1
I ca n't believe how in detail it was but I need to get the second part . I hope it will be more parts to come .	1
I really enjoyed this snippet from Lorien , It really hs me hanging for more ! Am looking forward to reading more about the Lorien heroes	1
Love this series ! ! These books tie in together so well . I ca n't wait to see where they go next with the depth and diversity of the characters .	1
Hush Money Pt 1 is such a great read I asked the author could she turn it into an entire book ! I loved the story line and I was very upset that I read it too quick . This book just goes to show that when you do dirt you get dirt . Great job and I recommend it to everyone !	1
this book is so interesting is hard to put it down and the author explains how to apply it to daily life .	1
I have been purchasing the series on the Life and Prayers of the Saints and Apostles and have been very happy with them . I did not know much about St. Jude , so it is really great to be able to read his biography and also prayers that St. Jude the Apostle used in his life and ministry . Thank you so much for another wonderful book .	1
This book is a must read - I must read more like them. ! ! ! It 's funny , you WILL laugh out loud a few times . I found myself actually able to picture each dog vividly every time I would read about them : ) It will keep you turning the page ! Marissa in p.c. , florida	1
This was such a light hearted fun read . I laughed out loud at some of the some of the statements throughout lining up the dog traits with human nature . Just a light hearted read	1
This comedy has one of the most original story lines I have come across in a long time . It is truly a feel good book ! A group of people die before their time , they are sent back as animals and an angel so they can solve a crime . The four dogs and one cat live with the most beautiful guardian angel out there . This angel is probably the world 's worse cook , but they all love her anyways . The Golden Retriever usually says the blessing before the meal , and you guessed it - he prays for better food . Each of the dogs bring a special talent or two that they had when they were human . One of them was a designer and now makes them all costumes ; another can fix cars , and so on . Can you imagine a small dog at a sewing machine or a basset hound trying to undo the lug nuts on a flat tire ? Besides being hilarious , the book is for the most part PG rated , so the tweens at your house can enjoy the book with you . The author says this will be a series , if so ; I can not wait for book 2 .	1
Cute story with a fun and off beat story as the dogs are the sleuths and they have an angel guardian who cares for them and a cat who is the higher angel . The personality of the dogs was right on target . A dog lover will like this book . Enjoyable light reading	1
I just loved this book . It has more than I had hoped and a great detective story as well . If you love dogs and detective books , DO N'T MISS THIS ONE !	1
... and I agree with the author that protein-filled breakfasts are best . Interesting enough , the body 's number 1 fuel source is fat and then protein . The author did a fine job on this book and it is a steal at the price so grab it because it is well worth your time and investment .	1
I really like the Willow Brown series . This was a short-but-sweet read , so I breezed through it too fast . I liked it a lot ... a perfect little story for the Holidays .	1
As usual , a great little read . It seems I just can not read one of these stories without a smile and a laugh . Thanks for the `` Christmas '' present !	1
Jo and Jane make a great team with a healthy respect for each other 's magics . The story left me wanting more , I want to know what happened when they got home , what happened to the characters left behind , how Morrison reacted when Jo told him of this adventure . If you 're a fan of one of the authors or both , this is a must-read .	1
I really , really liked this book . I 've read all of the Walker Series and Jane Yellowrock and always eagerly await the next one . When I saw this one I was a little skeptical if it would live up to these stories . Wow , it really does . Jane and Joanne interact so increadibly well , I had a huge smile throughout the whole story and feel like I have new BFFs ! Definitely read this one , you will be so glad you did - but it 's best I think after you read all the other ones first .	1
A glorious story of overcoming the trials of life and living with life as God lets it unfold , never giving in to sin or fear . Dottiek	1
It took me a couple weeks to actually tackle the project that is formatting an ebook . First , I had to get Scrivener and learn how to use it . After a few days of getting the feel for it , I decided to do a test ( mobi ) file using Ed Ditto 's How-to book . In a matter of minutes , I not only managed a clean mobi file , but I also learned how to manage Scrivener a bit better ( the first couple of chapter 's of Ditto 's book has a better tutorial , in my opinion ) . I 'm a visual learner and Ditto has snapshots alongside his directions , which is a definite bonus.This book will probably save me several hundred dollars a year in professional formatting services . It is well worth the $ 4.99 , as well as the cost of downloading Scrivener ( which I did n't have prior to receiving this book ) .	1
Well worth the money . In truth , well worth more money.Writers who want to publish their own work and have it distributed far and wide : you should buy this book . And buy Scrivener while you 're at it . Once done , read and implement the advice you find here.It did n't take me an afternoon . It took me somewhat longer than that . Blame it on trepidation -- I certainly do.If you follow the advice in this book , well thought through advice , and well presented advice with images to show exactly what needs to be done , you 'll create output that will be accepted by Amazon , Barnes & Noble , and Smashwords right out of the gate.I 'll have to get back to you on iBookstore . They have n't gotten back to me as yet.This was an excellent purchase .	1
Just plain and nice to the core . NICE . I thought there was another version with different authors and all of that but this was as nice as all the other ones .	1
This was an enjoyable read and interfered with things I should have been doing ! In other words it was hard to put aside .	1
This one is where Lucien and Elise come to terms with each other and find more things they never knew .	1
I had to honestly pick my face up off the floor . I could get to the end fast enough . I felt like the little girl the AT & T ; commercial ... I wanted more ... Like I really enjoyed reading this and I want more , but there was n't any more ... .The revelations that were revealed are insane . The connection between Lucien and Ian I would of not guessed Evvvvvvver . I truly and utterly loved how this series came full circle . I am still in awe ! Thankfully I threw caution to the wind , said carpe diem to the $ 1.99 for 2 chapters and having to wait a entire week for my next fix of mommy porn . Elise being the person she is allowed herself to have verbal diarrhea , which ultimately set things in motion of being manifesting itself . The one thing the I could not appreciate was the fact that she made this unveiling about her . How Lucien would never forgive her and blahza blah . It 's like lady take a breathe , this man just had a major blow delivered to him ; he needs time to process The burden these two men have carried throughout their life is ... ... . MUCHI do want to warn that we are left with a somewhat cliffhanger as it relates to Ian and Francesca , which I am sure will pick up when Because We Belong novel is released . As far as Lucien and Elise their ending had an almost not so happy ending , but somehow Lucien had to look within his self and made magic happen . Ms.Kery I applauded you for getting me out of my reading funk.I will happily read any and everything that you write . I do ask that you have some mercy on me and give more of Lucien and Elise there has to be more to those two and I am aching to find out what it is.Review originally posted at : ShawnaSurvey.com	1
The prequel was interesting enough that I want to know what happens next . I am going to look for the next book .	1
This book is awesome , not too inappropriate or violent . I read as two teenagers discover their powers and save what they lost . You should really read this book , you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I read the first Lennox and of course had to read this one too ! I can only pray you have some peace in your life ... .hire some ghost budgets ... .or it seems like you need someone who deals with demons . I was saddened that you and Nick divorced ... .in the first book the 2 of you seemed so in love . You are a wonderful author ... .keep up the good work and may God bless and protect you .	1
I liked the details and photos in this book . The video links were what made this book standout from other nature titles that I have in my collection . The kids loved watching the octupus in action !	1
This is Book 1 of the Touched trilogy . The story starts off with Phoebe and her two sisters just being born and their dying mother telling them what their gifts are . They all have inherited gifts : Phoebe is a truth teller-she can tell when someone is lying , Chloe is a seer and Lily is the healer . Phoebe is now 17 and thinks that her gifts as failed her as she has not felt anything yet and her sisters have full use of their gifts . All that changes one day when Phoebe 's best friend Tonya lies to her and Phoebe hears a voice saying Liar and she starts to cramp up . She believes her friend is in trouble and that Tonya 's new boyfriend Trevor is trouble , but Phoebe 's boyfriend Nathan and her Nanna convince her to not rely on her gift and give Trevor a chance . Phoebe will have to decide whether to trust her gift or to stop obsessing over Trevor being a bad person . I do n't want to give away too much of the story as it would contain spoilers.This story grabbed my attention right from the beginning . Phoebe and her sisters are typical teenage girls . I enjoyed their interactions with each other because even after all they normal arguing they did it was so apparent they loved each other and were always there when needed . I did get a little frustrated with Phoebe and some of the immature ways she acted but even Phoebe realized how she was acting and in the end it was fun watching her grow and change . The characters in this book had to deal with real life issues . My favorite sister is definitely Lily and I look forward to reading the next book in this series which is told from her viewpoint.I received this ebook free through LibraryThing Member Giveaways in exchange for an honest review .	1
Mini is a young woman with a powerhouse personality in a small body . An employee at Read , Drink and Be Merry : A Fine Book Salon and Coffee Emporium , she seems to be the only one who cares when her boss is brutally murdered on Black Friday . The suspect list is endless as the victim seemed to have had an argument with everyone that day . Mini 's comfortable little world starts looking a bit iffy depending on who in Colin 's inner circle takes over ownership of the store , and who his killer is ! Many times this little lady had me laughing out loud with her inner thoughts , and I really hope Mini 's adventures will continue in her very own series !	1
The last time I read about the Salem Witch Trials was in High School and reading the Crucible.Now , Salem Witches tells the real inside story.Well written , well researched.I recommend it .	1
Okay , I admit to being a big fan of cats ... they 're independent thinkers and I 'm servant to a few of them ... so I know that Mr. Kusy really understands how cats think , behave and misbehave . And that 's fine by this reader . But there 's more here than recording anthropomorphic cats . This hugely entertaining story and its companion piece Ginger the Buddha Cat are masterpieces of story-telling in the tradition of Aesop , Kipling , and other great writers who knew you can put great humor and occasional wisdom into the mouths of so-called less-intelligent beings . What I admire about the writer , beyond his obvious literary talents and ability to tell a great tale , is his knack at combining everything from interesting travel ( here : Barcelona ) , to shrewd observation of people as well as animals , to superb characterization ( I can never forget some of the strange but fascinating people who populate his works ... do check out Kevin and I in India , and Rupee Millionaires , and you 'll feel like you 've spent years traveling the length and breadth of India ! ) . And these little feline-based novellas will do the same for you : great people with all their foibles , adorable and less-adorable cats ( my eye is on you , Ginger ! ) , and sweet , wandering tales of overseas adventure and karma that keep you wanting what will come next from the fertile mind of Frank Kusy .	1
Emma Bells father despairs of her ever marrying . She wants to travel . Emma travels to America with her father and ends up engaged to a rich American gentleman , or so she thinks .

Emma meets , the upstanding Sheriff of Great Bend Bob , he does not believe in harming women , but he does believe in old fashioned discipline.This was a very sweet read . More about the journey of the couple learning to trust each other . Ben just wanted to keep the sweet Emma safe , even though she had a tendency to want to just do her !	1
I really enjoyed All Fired Up ! While this is the second book in the series , it can be read as a standalone . Cara is an organized control-freak and the oldest daughter of an Italian family . Cara is determined to try to expand the events side of the restaurant , but her soon to be brother-in-law Jack is n't on board . Shane Doyle is the new pastry chef at the restaurant . His sexy Irish accent and mix of dominating and easygoing demeanor really get to Cara and undermine her control.Shane and Cara really connect in Las Vegas , but Cara is determined to remain in control and she pushes Shane away . Shane pushes her to try things outside of her comfort zone . I love how Shane was there for Cara and really understood her . He pushed Cara to open up to her family while keeping his own secrets.I loved their relationship and they had great chemistry ! Vegas , the stray cat , was a great addition to the story . Jack , Lili , Jules , and Tad were interesting secondary characters . I would recommend this book and I 'll reading more books by Kate Meader . *I received a complimentary copy .	1
Reviewed by Kimfor Read Your Writes Book ReviewsWhile I liked and enjoyed reading All Fired Up , it doesn & # 8217 ; t compare to its predecessor , Feel the Heat . It could be considered wrong for me to say that . The two books are SO different . Feel the Heat is funny and hot and funny . I said funny twice , didn & # 8217 ; t I ? All Fired Up is serious , deep , and at times , heartbreaking . This book shows Kate to be a multi-dimensional writer. & # 8220 ; We fool ourselves into holding onto the pain because the alternative-that we might get too used to days without it-would likely drive us mad with hope. & # 8221 ; - Cara DeLucaCara DeLuca comes off as being a cold , heartless woman . She stands out in her big Italian family , with her small frame and blonde hair . Cara tends to rub people the wrong way . This isn & # 8217 ; t something intentional on her part . But it serves her purpose in not truly allowing people to see who she really is.Shane Doyle is an Irish charmer through and through . He has dimples and a smile that can charm any woman he meets . Shane has a tragic past that he & # 8217 ; s trying to overcome . His whole life he has been told that he isn & # 8217 ; t worthy and will never amount to anything . Despite all of this , Shane has paid his dues and is an award winning pastry chef.Shane and Cara are two people who have deep dark secrets they don & # 8217 ; t want to share with anyone . However , in the midst of a drunken bachelorette/bachelor party , these two find the one person they can indeed share their secrets with . These two are so good for each other . Unfortunately , their road together isn & # 8217 ; t going to be a smooth one . They will need to fight for the love neither one of them was originally looking for and overcome their demons to have what they really want most in life.For me , I found All Fired Up to be full of surprises . This book will definitely give you heartbreaking moments that will make you want to cry . But , it still has the funny moments that I craved.If you were to ask me what I love about Kate Meader , I would have to say , & # 8220 ; I love that she makes her characters real . She gives her characters real issues that you see everyday . Kate doesn & # 8217 ; t write romances where everyone is perfect and you have heroes and heroines who are afraid of commitment . Kate truly hits home with her characters & # 8217 ; issues and shortcomings . She gives you characters who are not size fours , who are battling self-image issues , abused childhoods , dyslexia . Kate shows that everyone can be loved and find happiness . That everyone deserves to find love and happiness. & # 8221 ; Source : NetGalley	1
By jove , Amanda Egan has done it again ! Drawing the reader in , straight away ! The Willoughby family , like many families , are not devoid of their own individual problems . Before the siblings ' descend on their mum , Maggie , for Christmas , each of their story is told , and their characteristic/trait is revealed . Now , I 'm not sure whether Amanda 's 'Novella ' is intended to be humourous , but , I could n't stop laughing at the way she potrayes one of the siblings ! A lovely Novella , with some surprises , capturing the essence of Christmas . Highly recommended ! Thanks Amanda for another great read ! I simply adore your work !	1
These jokes were cute and tasteful . It 's something one would expect an elementary school teacher to read to children . Perfect for adults with children .	1
Protecting the Princess is the fifth book in the Mountain Woman Adventures series . Deputy Marshal Kate is protecting an opera singer from overseas while Marshal Man is recuperating at home from a gunshot wound .	1
Another terrific novel by Author Fowler . This story puts our Deputy Marshall Kate on a very unique assignment guarding a Princess opera singer from the Netherlands . Our Kate matches wits and skill with many hired killers trying to take out the Princess . The Marshall as usual always gets her man ! It 's a fast moving story , holds your interest with a very clever story line . You will enjoy !	1
Good resource that covers history of athletic shoes , how to get the correct shoes for you , the difference between running and walking shoes and more ! It also has links to some useful videos to help you further . And here 's a hint for the ladies : Since women 's shoes are typically more narrow than men 's shoes , buy men 's . Why ? More room in the toe box .	1
I have read all of these so far and really enjoy them . Once you start youwant to read from beginning to end right away . Looking forward tobook 8 : - )	1
To get into a story within the first few chapters , I have to want , nay , NEED to find out more about the characters : their stories , their lives , what happened in their pasts and what 's going to happen in their futures . To be fair , I 'm not normally a space-travel/sci-fi reader , but I have to admit that this excellent teaser hooked me in with its character-driven opening sequence and `` end . '' The Shigure itself is a great figure of mystery as it really is more than it seems , and its crew and special guest have a chemistry that makes you want to pull for them.This is a smart , suspenseful ride that leaves us wanting more . No pressure , of course , Mr. Young , but ... write fast .	1
In some ways , this is n't an easy book to read . Nobody likes to think about death and perhaps the thought of a book detailing a woman 's impending death sounds too depressing . But it is n't . I found the book compelling to read and inspiring that this woman showed courage and determination to live her life to its fullest . It must have been very difficult for the author to compile this book from her Mother 's journals but it 's a tribute to her Mother that she did so . This should be required reading for anyone who has a family member or friend dealing with cancer - - or for anyone dealing with it herself and wanting to know what might lie ahead .	1
I loved all these books . All about the cowboys and their lives . Love at first sight and the things they will do for love . I could n't put them down.. First time reading Lorhainne Eckhart 's books . I will definately be looking for more stores by here .	1
great reading , grabbed attention immeadiately , making you feel as if you were there , kept me interested till the end & then wanting more .	1
This series warms your heart in each story . I did n't realize there was one before this and ca n't wait to read it .	1
This book is in a genre that i never read but when i read what it was about and it was free i thought what the heck..lets try it ! So glad i did ! While totally far fetched and off historically I found it fascinating . I figured out early on what was probably going to happen but it didnt matter it was a great story and i am heading off to download the second book !	1
I really enjoyed this book ! This is only my 3rd book in the Military Sci-Fi genre , but I think I am really going to have to place this in my favorite category . I learned a lot about ancient Rome , and the time travel theories really make you think . I immediately purchased book two in the series which I am reading now	1
Really lovely story about Adam and Joe . It takes a near tragedy for both Joe and Adam to tell each other their true feelings . Shame it was n't novel length.After an accident , Adam loses his memory . He may not remember details of his life but his heart knows the truth . `` I do n't remember you '' I rasp . And somehow that is worse than the pain , because this man has shed tears for me , has hardly left my side , and I 've just forgotten him . `` Maybe up here . '' Joe gently strokes my forehead , then slides his hand down to hover over my heart , `` But what about in here ? '' It 's so simple but it 's true . deep down inside where it matters most , I do know him . From the moment I opened my eyes , something in me recognized him .	1
Sweet , full of gentleness and warmth . Even for Amy Lane 's lower angst stories , I felt this one was one of the lowest which was fine by me .	1
3.5 starsThis is probably one of my favorites out of the Advent Calendar this year . It 's sweet but slightly heartbreaking . Berg , who 's just out of the Army , is very sad and lost . He always settled for guys who wanted him and not necessarily for ones he wanted . So , when he goes to see an ex-lover he gets a nasty surprise . DJ , who 's the neighbor of the ex , comes home to find Berg standing outside his house looking dejected . Not wanting to be alone on Christmas Eve , he invites Berg to spend the holiday with him.I really liked this story because Berg is kind of broken and does n't really know what to do with himself . He 's an ordinary guy with ordinary looks so he ca n't understand why DJ would want someone like him . Even though Berg does n't think he 's attractive , DJ thinks Berg is sexy as hell and they both hit each others buttons . I really liked this story because of that raw sexual attraction . The writing is phenomenal and engaging and the story is slow but yet not . I felt like I could actually feel the connection between these guys , which made the story very appealing.The only problem is that this one is pretty much one big smex scene . For me , I hate when stories are like that but the author 's style drew me in even when there was so much smut . I really enjoyed the story but I really hope there 's a sequel because I want to see what happens to these guys next ! !	1
What an awesome story of the adventures of a Brother and Sister that Go inside a Trunk for an Awesome adventure .	1
I enjoy reading these books , it is nice to have characters you know appear in successive books even though each story can stand alone . Looking forward to even more , perhaps one featuring Gordon 's brother Garrett and his daughter Emma . Haddix 's books are beautifully written , suspenseful without being morbid , and her characters are always believable .	1
This is so much fun - I 've always enjoyed quizzes and brain teasers , as they exercise your mind and help keep it fit and working at optimum levels . I 'm also a self-confessed music addict and so I really enjoyed this because I 've learned so many fascinating new facts ! I agree it is very addictive , and I love the interactive quality of the book - it makes it so much more fun and satisfying when you know immediately if you 've gotten the answer right . All I can say is , I hope there will be more books from this author !	1
This book was really helpful for my daughter as she studied Romeo and Juliet for school . It was set up so she could easily read the & # 34 ; translation & # 34 ; and not get frustrated .	1
I would recommend to anyone who enjoys an easy reading , enjoyable story with a few surprises included for good measure .	1
I am sort of sad to see this series end . The whole concept was interesting and thought provoking . I did enjoy the series and suggest it to others , the books are short and move right along .	1
This series has been a wonderful exploration of a complex and vibrant world . David Birkenhead is a colorful character with some real troubles and heartaches . So finding out how his life turns out proves to be a great way to close out the series.Sadly , this is not the best story in the series . The earlier books , Ship 's Boy , Midshipment and Lieutenant have far more character growth and action than Admiral , which in some ways plays out a bit like a victory lap for David . Yes , there is still some political intrigue and he has to lead the naval forces of the Kingdom in forcing the Empire to surrender , but the sharp decisive actions from the earlier books is gone , replaced by dinner meetings and whispered discussions.This has been a great series . I have to admit I 'm going to miss visiting with David and his friends and seeing how he fights his way through life . In the end a very good tale was spun from a simple premise and a character who proved to be a lot more than the simple Ship 's Boy he was in the first book .	1
I wish these recipes were around 20 years ago when I went gluten free ! ! The photography is great and the recipes inspiring . The author covers lots of territory with really interesting recipes . Thanks for all your efforts	1
Let me just say that this recipe book has just been consigned to my favourite spot on the book shelve . I have tried several of the cookie recipes and they have definitely been a success among both family and friends this Christmas . As usual with this author 's cookbooks the recipes are simple and easy to follow with well set out methods and a variety of choice for all tastes . Highly recommended .	1
After reading part two , I have to say ... UGH ! Milly , why in the hell would you leave me hanging like that ! 'Everyone had their limits . If you pushed them too far , you paid the price . They walked away , Forever . ' -EmilyOkay , so in the second installment , we delve deeper into Emily 's life . More black outs , more action with Henry ( not that type of action you pervs *winks* ) , more creepy run ins with the Misery-Makers , a 6 year old girl who kinda creeps me the hell out ! Seriously ! How can she live there ? And to top it off , lets throw in blacking out in front of Henry ! Yay ! ' `` Mmm , '' I mumbled . Was that it ? Well done genius . Oh no , was I blushing ? What I really wanted to do was kiss him . What I actually did was black out . ' -EmilySo I looove the developing friendship between Emily and Pippa . Pippa seems like a fun girl with a hint of daddy issues that makes her almost needy to have a guy . The hotter , the better ; ) But , even though that can sometimes be annoying , Pippa pulls it off with her spunkiness and loyalty , which is a great thing for a character to have : ) ' `` I want one like him for Christmas . Wonder if sexy Seb sends love poetry . '' Pippa 's eyes glazed over . ' -PippaNow , do we get any insights into whats the cause of the black outs or the universe jumping ? No , but we get a little hint that turns into a sneaky suspicion that leaves you wanting to bang your head against the nearest hard surface , demanding the book reveal all of its secrets . ( I think my Kindle is tired of hearing me threaten it ) . 'His mouth must have only been millimetres away from me . He responded by kissing both my eyelids . Was he holding back ? Why was he torturing me ? '-EmilyYou may be thinking to yourself 'Hey , if it did n't at least reveal something what the hell was the second part even about ? ' Well , the second part was very much like a burlesque dancer . You watched it move , was tantalized by it 's slow , sensual cadence , saw it start to reveal small parts of itself , then BAM ! Down went the curtain , making you stare at the stage with a look of disbelief . 'What else ? oh there 's a guy at St. meril 's who 's driving me insane , in a confusing way . One minute he 's annoying and condescending . Then he does something really sweet . He 's the type of person who gets under your skin , even though you barely know him . You 'd have a great time working out what his problem is . He 's perfect case study material . '-Emily & # 65279 ;	1
I am often disappointed with books that attempt to continue a story that is so well written to begin with . Not so in this case . The characters are as well drawn as in Circles and the story continues flawlessly . In fact the story is much more intriguing because we already know the characters so more attention can be paid to what happens to them . The richness and depth of the background is so subtle one could overlook it if it was n't such an integral part of the complete book . There is supposed to be another book in this series and I eagerly look forward to its release .	1
As someone that has always worked to have good skin , I found this book to be extremely valuable . Knowing that the skin absorbs what we apply to it , I have always been careful about choosing quality products . However , good quality natural products are expensive . Author Adele Shepard provides recipes for natural skin care products that you can make at home for a minimal cost and maximum benefit . I loved this book , and would highly recommend it to anyone that wants better , and healthier skin .	1
You 're always in good hands when you have a date with Faith and her Diana Rivers mysteries.Not quite the same age as our very revered Miss Marple , but equally shrewd in the sleuthing department , Diana is considerably younger and -- no offence to dear Jane -- very attractive.You do of course know that the minute Diana and her husband , Steve , and toddler , Poppy , head off for a short holiday in England from their home in Cyprus , that it will certainly be an eventful one . And it is . As amateur dramatics ' enthusiasts , the opportunity to be part of a film version of a play they both formerly acted in seemed a good enough excuse to have a break and catch up with old friends and fellow actors.They stay in a beautiful large house -- the venue of the photo-shoot -- in the stunning Cotswold countryside in the middle of an uncharacteristically hot British summer . Perfect conditions for a much-needed holiday ; until one of the actresses involved in the shoot has a tragic accident , closely followed by the murder of the owner of the manor.Diana , in top form as always , pieces together the jigsaw ; she is a step ahead not only of the police , but of the reader too . Faith , in her own inimitable style leads to a climactic ending , leaving no stone unturned , and keeps you on your toes until the last minute.Faith 's novels are always well balanced ; there is just enough detail to paint a picture , her style is precise and clear , and I 'm always entertained and can click the last page with complete satisfaction.Diana deserves a short break from sleuthing , but I ca n't wait for her next adventure .	1
The strong form of the first three Diana Rivers mysteries is maintained in the fourth , `` Camera , Action , Murder ' . Author Faith Mortimer continues the high standards of storytelling and well-placed description that are a hallmark of the series as a double murder during the making of a film in a Cotswold village is investigated by our dependable heroine . With plenty to keep the reader involved and guessing right to the end , this is an excellent read and is highly recommended .	1
Every book was well written , tastefully romantic , with a sensual sexiness . I look forward to reading more books by Janelle Denison . My new page turner .	1
I gave this a 5 star , but would have given it a higher rating if Amazon allowed . I do not usually read romances , but I did find this one absolutely wonderful ! Wayne and Lexi did not start off well when they first met . How their relationship develops will keep you on the edge of your seat . All I can say is thank God for the sage Greta ! This story is very well written . The characters are totally believable and you can relate to them . The author has a winner here and I will be looking for more of her books.Well worth the read .	1
Good story . Lightweight and simple . Not much dept or conflict , the usual fixtures in a romance novel , but enjoyable nonetheless . I think it 's more towards erotica than romance anyway . Very witty , sexy and fun to read . Not too serious or complex . Perfect for a relaxed evening .	1
This is one hot read.How the characters meet is one of the most romantic scenes I have ever read . Not giving the plot away I will be recommending this book to everyone .	1
An unusual approach to mystery , religion , and the age old struggle of good vrs . evil . If it were not a work of fiction , it would explain the inquisition . Much to recommend it . Hard to put down .	1
Swigart writes an imaginative tale , weaving ancient religions with a new twist to the inquisition theme.A good read for a rainy weekend . Willing suspension of disbelief and a strong stomach required .	1
I stumbled upon this series of book quite by accident . They are quite entertaining , and not at all what I expected .	1

I read Lost and found rather quickly I know its a short story and all but its the kind of story that makes you grab your seat and hold on tight because its gon na be fast paced ! Two big things stuck out and that is 1 this needs to be made longer and continue where it ended ! ! Because ending like it did , made me want soooo much more ! ! Number 2 I really like the title and love the cover but I think I am missing something because it does n't fit the title I mean ... . all in all Amy has her work cut out for her because I am going to bug her for more ! Anyone who picks this short up is not going to be disappointed plus Remy is sounding like he would make quite a catch he already has the knight in shining armour thing going for him ; )	1
I enjoy this series and I expect to read more of it as books are published . It is a bit on the juvenile side . But , that 's ok too . I do n't think it warrants review as great literature , but as I said , I found it enjoyable and well written .	1
Well developed characters and believable story line . This book is different than anything I have read in a long time . It left me feeling hopeful and happy for all of us out searching for the answers to starting over and learning from past experiences . I will be looking for more books by this author .	1
It is n't easy for writers to capture the child narrator because adults often underestimate children , the depth of their emotions , the reach of their understanding . Tony Gilbert not only captures the 6 year old child 's voice perfectly , he captures it with such tenderness and empathy that you 'll see that cloud resting over your shoulder and hovering over your bed , too.This story highlights two topics that are often misunderstood and ignored -- the process of grief and the pain of mental illness . I think Tony handled both very well , but I especially appreciated his handling of mental illness . It is n't easy for adults to understand it , much less a child ; but somehow the child in this book seemed to understand his father and what he needed more than anyone thought . I saw the ending as one of hope , as a promise of a new beginning for father and son.I hope we see more writing by Tony Gilbert in the future .	1
This is a good science fiction read , with like-able characters . There is a prophecy that Maya is mentioned in . It will explain why she does n't relate to her stepmother , and how she survived the car crash . She also learns about her heritage , and is `` trained '' to be who she was born to be . What side will she pick ? What happens to the shifters ? There was definitely an imaginative dimension , and I am waiting to see what the author is going to describe in the next book . I did n't like the loose ends , and I wish that the ending was more definite . I did like the relationship between Maya and Summer , and I can not wait to see how they progress in the sequel.I am giving this book a 4/5 . I was given a copy to review , however all opinions are my own .	1
If you are looking for a new young adult fantasy , look no further . Identified : the Maya Price Story is a page-turning adventure with many subplots and themes that I 'm sure will be further explored in new installments . At least I hope so ! While I did like Maya as the story unfolded , she is a fierce heroine , I gradually began to question her choices . But whereas most young adult fiction leaves it at that , Mills creates Maya to be accountable for her actions and the consequences they bring about . All of the characters are relatable and I quickly became invested in the story . Two dimensions , vividly depicted , and written in a third person perspective ( Maya 's ) , had me quickly turning the pages to see what would happen next . I also really liked the journal entries from another character or Maya from a future time , that gives clues to future occurrences or more detail on the past.All in all , a very stellar read and I ca n't wait to read the next one ! By the end of the book , I was frantic to find out what happens next !	1
i loved this story , has a lot of humor in it.a nice coming out , self learning and accepting yourself as you are . and a little elf who keeps wind up smelling like scotch	1
this short series in addicting , i mean short stories because thats what they are . the end abruptly and leave you craving the next book . i only hope the next one ( which i believe is the last ) is a little longer so we can get all the cryptic story lines figured out . and hopefully an epilogue . hint hint ms cooper lol ! great short read ! ! !	1
Omg why ca n't man like capo be real ? ? ? ? ? Love love love loved it wish it was more please tell me it 's more ! ! ! !	1
I love the book . I love the characters . Still some errors but the story is great . I hope she continues to write .	1
I loved Hood Love . But I cnt say I love 2 . The chnage in writing style was too much for me . I feel the way ur first book in the series was written is where it should b kept . Other than that the lani chick n him still goin bak to her was wrking mi nerves ... . but the arguements are real life . I love that the senerios are things ppl do go thru . If there is three go bak to your style and what u want .	1
In the beginning they were arguing a lot over the same thing but it kept my attention I think the 1st book was better , love how it ended though !	1
Wow , this book personifies the things that I value in a cookbook ; Original recipes , fantastic professional food photography and recipes that even a novice can do and not be intimidated by.One of my pet peeves in short cookbooks is the utter lack of photography . This book has great photography . For example the pic of the finished product is done with a macro lense ( for up close photography ) that features BOKEH ( means the background is blurred and the pic of the food jumps out in sharp focus ) and the pics of the ingredients are all in sharp focus . This is PERFECT food photography so if you plan on writing a cookbook , study this photography and duplicate it.Many women have not had any cooking instructions and these recipes are all super simple so that even the most novice cook is not threatened by them and yet the finished product looks professional instead of amateurish and even an accomplished cook would be proud to serve these great looking desserts . The first rule of cooking is to make it LOOK GOOD.Kudos maam and outstanding job and priced just right at the retail price . I hope that it becomes to be the best seller that it deserves to be .	1
Unique story line . Keeps you reading and hanging on every word . Ca n't wait for the next one ! The author does very well in his character development , and in this book we find out things that we did n't know or expect at all .	1
First , a thank you for it being in the kindle lending library . I do n't know if authors choose to participate or if Amazon simply picks the books for the program , whichever it was i am glad to be able to read it.Excellent invasion series . If the idea of alien invasion intrigues you even a bit , then you 'll find the money well spent on this series of 3 so far , i would have gladly paid , but it would n't have been until payday . The lending program is terrific .	1
This book is another one of Stephen Williams ' handy how-to guides and in the case of this book I did find it to be refreshingly useful . Williams takes us through a step-by-step guide as to how we can keep our relationships from getting stale . He provides extremely useful tips that are very specific and also very thought-provoking , for example , how we can often smother each other and not give each other the healthy space that is needed in a relationship . He also gets sexier and gives you some creative ideas as to how you can spruce up your sex life so that things never become dull in that department . Most importantly , he gives us reminders about things we already know about and gives our minds a push into the right direction of making sure we keep our connections with our partners strong and identify and nourish the reasons we connected in the first place to create the bond.The general theme is that of relationship building and I felt this book to be sincerely helpful . Williams has written similar books on this topic but I have definitely enjoyed this one the most as I felt I could really understand the points he was putting across and most of them I would apply to any relationship I was in . I would recommend this for anybody who is in a committed relationship that they cherish and want to maintain a happy and healthy partnership and life together , particularly for couples who have had children or have been together for a very long time .	1
As I said in my review for the last book Cold Grave , Craig Robertson is a brilliant author recommend both as a bookseller and a reader , perfectly capturing the unique nature of Glasgow in both location and character , as well as proving himself the equal of Rankin and MacBride in the realm of Scottish crime fiction . Despite my huge praise for the last one , I think he has outdone himself here , as once again he shifts the focus of his characterisation using the ruse of a dual timeline ( venturing further back than the previous book ) and with a nice little nod to the intellectual interplay of another extremely famous crime read . Quid pro quo Mr Robertson.Witness The Dead is the third of Robertson 's series featuring Tony Winter , a scene of crime photographer who possesses a unique eye , and at times a slightly disturbing type of empathy with the victims that he photographs , but unlike Snapshot , the first , and its follow up Cold Grave , this book not only includes the usual characters , but puts into sharp focus Tonyfs uncle Danny Neilson , a former policeman , and a case that has always haunted him personally . As Robertson skilfully integrates the rich detail of the 1970s crimes and subsequent investigation , Winter and his police cohorts , find themselves at the centre of a series of murders that bear a striking resemblance to the Red Silk Murders . I really enjoyed Robertsonfs careful and well-realised depiction of 70s Glasgow , capturing the atmosphere and period detail perfectly , and Danny Neilsonfs closeness to the original investigation is central to the emotional punch of these scenes in particular , as he becomes completely consumed by the case.Likewise , the contemporary investigation , not only gives Robertson his usual latitude with his always entertaining and slightly troubled band of regular characters , but also leads the reader to an interesting mental tussle between Tony , Danny and the intriguing but evil Archibald Atto , the man convicted of the Red Silk Murders . The interplay between Winter and Atto is wonderfully disturbing , as both men recognise in each other , the seed of certain behaviours that each exhibit and deal with in contrasting ways- but how different are they really ? As the pressure builds to track the modern day killer , Winter and the police team , although infused with the normal gallows humour that Robertson so wickedly carries off , find the body count growing in direct correlation to the original Red Silk case , leading to a tense and gripping investigation that keeps the reader thoroughly hooked throughout . With the undercurrent of tension between Winter and DS Rachel Narey with the ending of their formerly top secret romance , the tension between Narey and a new doppy DC who infuriates the hell out of her , and the normal blustering of her boss DI Addison being forced into a joint investigation with the equally blustering DCI Kelbie and the antipathy between them , Robertson has produced not only a cracking police procedural packed full of murder , but a brilliantly realised study of the professional and personal relationships of those who seek justice for the victims , whilst trying to keep a grip on their own sanity . A great read .	1
I 've always wanted to read again the sign of four again I 'm enjoing every step of the way , sherlock holmes has always been a reference to amazing times and anticipation	1
This collection was fantastic ! There were so many stories and all had there own unique twist ! I highly recommend this to any mystery lover !	1
Any serious Kindler who reads detective novels should have a copy of the classic works of one of the originators and master of the genre in their library - especially as it is currently free . If a collection of such classic out-of-copyright books is available free in the US it should also be available free in other countries.In my original review ( now edited and almost completely changed ) I used the catchphrase : `` Elementary , my dear Watson '' and was surprised that I got some down-votes . Nobody helped me by commenting that this phrase was never actually uttered by Holmes in any of Conan Doyle 's books . I think we owe our familiarity with the phrase to Edith Meiser 's scripts for `` The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes '' radio series , broadcast from 1939 to 1947 .	1
Such a creative story and characters ! I 'm enjoying this author 's alternative reality ! Absorbing , but not gruesome . After a stressful day at work , what could be a better escape ! ?	1
This is a very excellent book that anyone can benefit from ! You will not be sorry you got it . Check out other books from Backwoods Home , too .	1
Not the paranoid panic of the survivalist , nor the overconsumerist . A good common sense guide to being prepared for unfortunately ordinary disaster situations	1
I really liked these short and sweet stories , sometimes too short , sometimes just the right length . Perfect to read on a cold night , Christmas or not .	1
still reading but have enjoyed much would say you would love it also many short stories just a joy to read	1
Este libro no me resulto entretenido en lo mas minimo . Me gusta leer los libros hasta el final , por eso lo he terminado	-1
I gave this one star for the effort Tony Cavanaugh put into writing the book and that 's all.As a Sunshine Coast resident I found the references to the local police and some of the members of certain suburbs offensive.At the end of the book Tony excuses he comments about the police , not some of the residents , and I suppose he thinks this is ok . If you are going to insult the people of the Sunshine Coast perhaps you should have used fictional suburbs and as you did `` some '' fictional streets.I also found the chapters where the serial killer was speaking were horrific . Hope there are no potential serial killers out there getting ideas from Mr Cavanaugh 's writings.My advice to you Tony Cavanaugh is to go back to writing scripts and forget the novels .	-1
But this was a total waste of my time to even read . I am not , nor do I aspire to be , an extreme couponer . So perhaps that is why this book did nothing for me .	-1
I hated this book ! ! ! It was the worst ! Do not even waste your time . Too much gay sex and very little story .	-1
There are no recipes in this e-book . It 's nothing but links to The Doctors / 17 Day Diet Club website . The links take you to their board where contributors submit recipes - for free . Shame on this `` author '' for selling work that does n't belong to her .	-1
No prelude , no plot , no finish . I think Ms. Aames should offer more of a story than just the coupling between two hard bodies .	-1
How do you respect a man when he stands there and let 5 men try to rape a women with a rope around her neck ? And then the same day he does n't like it when a man talks about sex with a women it should be private ? So far hate this guy , I ca n't call him a `` man '' because he is n't one.24 percent into the book and I ca n't stand the man . Why do you blame the woman when a man beat and tried to rape her ? I do n't think the author knows we are supposed to like the man because everything he does just makes me hate him and I do n't know if you can fix it before I give up . So far not worth the money.32 percent and I hope all the men die . You tell her to come on the hunt , you allow your men to hit her and feel her up and it is her fault or but she laughs ? I 'm think I 'm hating the author more than the characters.So I have finished the book . So this book was nothing but men beating , forcing sex on women and verbally abusing them . The man man say he will never force a women but he did during the whole book . And I ca n't stand how a trusted friend drugs you so the man can have sex with you and marry her . The man never said sorry for mean things he said and did to her . I ca n't stand how she loves him , the moves thing he did was force her to have sex with him . And we women of course will love a man after that . I think she was just as stupid and could n't stand her . There was nothing about this book I liked but my o.c.d does n't allow me not to finish it.There was no romance and sex does n't equal romance or love . I want my money back the book was that bad . Sorry but very degrading to women .	-1
This was a good , interesting plot . It was let down by the writing . It is difficult to write in the present tense and I find it unnatural to read it . There were many grammar errors and sometimes the tenses were very confused . I think this could be a really good book with some editing . Having said that I did persevere to the end , which I do n't usually do , because I found the plot intriguing .	-1
I was disappointed with this offering from Mr. Carter . I have enjoyed past work but this offering not on the same level as other work . I had a hard time following the story and it took me longer to read . I think this was not one if Mr. Carter 's best works .	-1
I wish I could give this book 0 stars . It was horrible . The book was all over the place . Tons of misspelled words . He was using the word `` dam '' fo the actual curse word . Not to mention , their were tons of grammatical errors and the punctuation was either in the wrong place or non-existent . The author also italicized almost a lot . The majority ( if not all ) the times he italicized something , it did n't make any sense . I will not be reading any of the sequels .	-1
by thoroughly disgusting characters . You start out rooting for Ben , until discovering what a pathetic human being he is ; willing to commit murder , cannabilism , and necrophilia to stay alive or get his rocks off . Creep .	-1
Would love to read more ended way to soon great story line for a shortly makes you want it to be longer	-1
Did not like this book , and it is very short . Would not recommend it . I like something with a little more of a story .	-1
This was a quick read last night before I went to bed . Not too badly written , but so many co-incidences ? And , in this day and age , the prejudice against female cops is a little too over the top.Beside the point : The cover of the book mentions Kristina Andersen as the author - but the Amazon page says M. Zanzibar.The same goes for another book titled & # 34 ; Blood Money & # 34 ; , which was actually a whole lot better than this one .	-1
I like her other books . This one is not on my Lis-Likes-List . The sharing is just too much for me . I 'll stick with the rock stars .	-1
most of these & # 34 ; freebie & # 34 ; books are poorly written . this one was barely okay . well , most of them are only just barely okay	-1
I really could not get into these stories because they were so unrealistic . Not as all sure the author had even been to the places he included in the stories .	-1
I am now 5 books into this series and while I liked the first book quite well I wish I would have stopped there . I have kept reading the books hoping to see something develop but other than the increasing sexual relations of the cast nothing of real interest happens . I have the next two books and since I bought them I guess I will try and make it through them ( purchased them since they are basically a cheap read ) but I after the first book I would n't recommend this series to other readers .	-1
This book is an example of disclosing less that the total picture . It seems the writer visited a few places in Turkey , read a bit of history and became an overnight expert on the country and its people . The book is ill structured ( fairly well condensed history just thrown in whenever ) , needs editing and the writer needs far more information on which to form his conclusions .	-1
I was disappointed in Jaid Black and a few others I only really liked a couple . I do n't think it was worth the money I paid .	-1
I wanted to like this book because I thought the idea of the same story in two different books from two points of view were intriguing ... like He said/She said the movie . But IMHO , both the man and woman in this book were irritating , and they never stopped being irritating . The woman is a beautiful wreck , who is insecure and makes a lot of bad decisions because of it . The guy is irritated by her especially after she goes of alone again and again with her ex-boyfriend . But when he calls her on it and walks away she has gall to accuse him of abandoning her ... and he apologizes ! I was almost hoping they would both find someone else by the end of the book , but maybe they deserve each other .	-1
Same problem as book 4 and 5 . The e-book version would not open .I loved the series wished I could of finished it . Other than the problem I mentioned I would rate it a five star on the series .	-1
I was enjoying the book , until I realized that it is not a complete book , I have read other books by other authors where they left the reader hanging and now I never buy a book by that author , I feel like a book should have some kind of ending , instead of nothing ! I will probably only get book two from this author if it is free , I do not want to pay for an unfinished book..I am referring to the book about the town of Strangeville .	-1
terrible short story . thought i would enjoy it but turns out im extremely upset i even wasted a measly $ .99	-1
If you are into the emergent church movement and believe that no one can know for certain what the Bible is teaching then this book is for you . Like Rob Bell has done in his removal of hell Tony Jones has done in his removal of original sin.If you are a true Christian then these 2 quotes from Jones should immediately stop you from reading this book : In one place Jones says , `` I 've been very clear on this point here and elsewhere : I do not think it possible to begin with the Bible . We always begin with our own hermeneutical assumptions . Always . No exceptions . A human being can not escape her/his own hermeneutical horizon . You are encased in it , just as you are encased in your own skin . There 's no escape . `` Only an unsaved man or woman could make such a statement . A truly saved person will ALWAYS begin with the Bible . If he begins with his own understandings and then tries to fit the Bible into those understandings then he is doomed . If you are truly saved then the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth and that only through the Bible.In another place Jones says , `` Now , it probably wo n't surprise many for me to confess that I do n't think the creation of the cosmos really happened in quite the way it is described in either Genesis 's second creation narrative ( Genesis 2:4ff . ) , or the one preceding it in Genesis 1:1-2:3 . `` Did you read that quote ? ! If you are not surprised that a man who professes to be a Christian and is writing a book debunking what God 's word teaches is here denying that God is describing His creation EXACTLY as it is stated then I fear that you are not a true Christian either . When a person is saved and the Holy Spirit comes in then you KNOW that all of God 's word is true , including His narrative of how He created this universe.One question that I would ask : Why was it necessary for our Lord to be born of a virgin ? Why did He have to be planted in the womb of Mary and not come through the seed of man ? Think about it ! He could not be tainted with even the slightest molecule of sin which He would have had if He had come through the seed of Joseph and the egg of Mary.I am deeply concerned by all of the positive reviews for this book . Are any of these people true Christians I ask ? If you do not understand original sin then you can not understand the need for an atonement either . May God have mercy on Tony Jones and those in the emergent church movement and may He save them from the wrath to come through the atonement provided by the sacrificial and substitutionary death of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .	-1
The story and poems were cute but not the best . The unexpected problem was my 5 year old feeling disturbed my the Q monster . She was so bothered that she could n't enjoy the book .	-1
This book was very disorganized and a poor plot line . Often the characters would change without notice making it difficult to determine who was thinking/doing what .	-1
The many typographical errors in this book that are jarring for the reader detract from the author 's often far too simplistic message . Poorly edited . For me , these errors rendered the book unreadable , but as a free download for my Kindle , I got exactly what I paid for . There are far better resources available on this topic .	-1
If I could I would n't even give it one star . I usually do n't review books unless they are really good , but this one is sooooo ... .. bad I felt compelled to warn others .	-1
The general plot was cute . While I like romance books , the sex scenes are poorly written . I ended up skipping pages .	-1
This book makes a lot of claims about revealing new details of Tesla 's lost works . But I did not find one new detail in it which I was n't already aware .	-1
I wish I had been warned before hand about him previously being with another male . Had I known I would not have given this book a second glance ( not my cup of tea ) . Since i did read a portion of this book about as much as i could stomach b/c lets face it , the book is plain TERRIBLE . I think the one star is a tad too nice and much more than this book deserves . Im completely baffled by all of the positive reviews , actually im not . people these days seem to be okay with the decline of quality in todays reading .	-1
The basic storyline in RIVER 'S RUN is a Fantasy Romance staple : Human women whisked away in some fashion by aliens . The author incorporated a plot device that I thought was pretty clever -- the women were circus performers -- which allowed them to have some skills , such as knife-throwing and acrobatics and even pyrotechnics/explosives , which your average human woman-off-the-streets would n't have ( though having them be incredibly skilled in all the areas , and more , was over the top ; and each of them spoke six languages , really ? ) I thought the writing was n't bad . Not fabulous , but not the really atrocious writing so often found in e-books . There were the usual proofreading errors and a couple laugh-out-loud misuses of near-homonyms ( note to authors : know the meaning of the words you use ) , but again , I 've seen much worse in other e-books.There were a couple big problems I had with this book which caused my two-star rating.First the sex scenes . The cave-man dominance , pain/ '' pleasure '' type of sex is n't attractive to me to begin with , but what is with modern authors thinking anal intercourse is sexy ? Most of us are grossed out by the thought of someone not washing their hands after using the bathroom , yet somehow the hero sticking his fingers in the woman 's anus ( she , of course , loves the `` pain/pleasure '' of it ) and then using that same hand to continue with `` lovemaking , '' that 's supposed to be sexy ? I admit this was the point I began skipping through the `` love '' scenes , but I do n't think I missed the part where the hero got up and sanitized his hand . Ick , ick , ick.I also found the hero 's instant lust/ '' mine ! `` /mate reaction particularly unappealing . Throughout most of the book he vacillated between cave-man physical and sexual dominance ( because everyone knows when a woman says `` no '' to a man , she really means `` yes , please '' ! ) and moments of complete turn-around sensitivity . That just made the relationship unbelievable.There were some things I liked about the book . The women confounding the macho aliens with their circus skills was pretty fun . Okay , now that I think about it , that was pretty much what I liked about the book . The alien world , the various aliens , all of them were n't really given much depth . I wish the author had cut the sex scenes down about 90 percent and used those pages to develop the relationship between the lead characters , as well as further developed the secondary characters and the alien society.All in all , I recommend readers pass on this book unless they 're looking for pain/ '' pleasure '' erotica in a generally retro-mentality fantasy futuristic book .	-1
Not Sabrina Jeffries ! ! ! When are these authors going to realize that not all your fans are ready to give up the BOOK ! ! ! that thing with pages that has been around for centuries . One review said `` a good FREE book '' when do your reader of a real book get a `` FREE BOOK '' . I have spent a fortune reading romance novels , and I only read certain authors , but I have never received a FREE BOOK , what kind of discrimination is this . Sabrina has a book coming out in June , why ca n't you release the kindle and add this novella , or what ever you call it , at the same time and include `` The French Maid '' in the June book at no extra cost because the kindle was FREE . This is the third review of Kindle books , for three different authors and I will not give up , shame on you . As I have said before not everyone has or can afford a kindle or a computer and believe it or not some of us still have library cards , my neighbor reserves her books at the library and sometimes has to wait for the books . How would you feel if you were following a continuing story and had to wait to get the book because the library can only afford several books . I preorder books as soon as they are released to Amazon because I want to have that book that cost $ 7.99 , on the day it is available , and `` The French Maid '' was $ .99 considered free by one reviewer . I give my books to a group of elderly ladies who ca n't afford to purchase them and they are going to laugh their butts off if I asked them to read a story on a kindle or computer . THINK YOU WRITERS we are here and we read BOOKS .	-1
I was hoping to find recipes that would be enticing for both Diabetics and non-diabetics . I did n't really find anything that appealed to me . Maybe it 's just me , but I was disappointed .	-1
The titlle is interesting the story is not I was not able to get past the first 20 pages ... ..The constant whining ( I have togo to work as a maid , I have two twin children yada yada ) and the instruction on how to pronounce Italian were -well-really annoying . Perhaps it got better further on in the book but I just could not get there .	-1
Very predictable and a little silly . I kept saying , 'why not just ask her ? & # 34 ; or 'what woman in the old west did n't know how to at least get onto a horse ? ' It is a good practice run , this writer maintains control of her character 's personalities , and the storyline ( while predictable ) holds through the book . So , I would n't throw it at the wall , but it would be safe to pass along to a nursing home .	-1
It is not my type of book a little too much on the Sci- Fi and I like more realistic themes .	-1
I have read some of his books in the past but this one just could not grab me by chapter 3 .	-1
and not enough story and character . I prefer plot to descriptive acts in the stories I read , so I did not care for this book .	-1
I read both the first book and this one in the series . I wont read the rest of the series ... mostly because I dont care what the characters are doing . When I read a series I want to be sucked into a story line and when I am not reading the book I want to wonder what the characters are doing now ... This author writes very well ... she goes to a lot of trouble to write beautiful descriptions ... but that is part of the problem ... it seems she is so focused on describing things that she forgets that she is supposed to be telling a story . The book seems to have a lot of filler time ... and a little bit of actual story . It feels like you have this one scene where stuff is happening ... .and then filler description stuff about what she has for breakfast or is thinking about or what the cat is doing , what she is going to wear ... until finally something else happens ... then more filler stuff ... .. the story just never pulled me in . My favorite parts were when stuff happened ... When Jason met Ara and when she was in the hospital ... the descriptions in her head in the hospital were wonderful ... they made you feel what she felt ... I didnt really believe the Mike romance ... it just seemed forced ... she didnt mention Mike in that sense in the first book and he proposes right away in the second book ? hmmm ... and he just seems to be a perfect doormat ... All in all ... the writing style if good ( although I hated when she kept calling Aras mouth a `` gob '' ... it just got annoying ) ... the story telling was not so good ... in that ... there just was not enough actual story ... . if the next few books are the same then I would say she should take out all the filler and put the action parts together in all the books to get one really good story ... . I might check this author out down the road to see if her stories become more action filled ... because I did like her writing ...	-1
To be frank , I thought this was a rather dumb and not thought out book . It made no sense what with all the twitching ... .	-1
I jus t do n't go for gruesome descriptions in a book . I read for pleasure	-1
I have enjoyed , for the most part , reading this series . I have stated in previous reviews that the entire story should never revolve completely around Xandra . She is boring and self-absorbed . I think this was a chance that the author missed to show X. a little bit more mature . Not sure if I will continue reading this series . The plot is going nowhere .	-1
Full disclosure - I was provided a free copy of this book by the authorUnfortunately , I ca n't say that I was able to get into this book . I found it hard to grasp what the plot was as it seemed to shift from location to location and person to person on a regular basis . This perhaps did n't allow for the scenes or the characters to 'gel ' with me . I also felt that there was n't enough initial depth with the characters in way that would endear them to me . this made it hard for me to become part of the story as I felt as though I was always looking from the outside rather than being part of the story.It is n't that the book is hard to read , it just did n't seem to grab me initially which made it more difficult to follow . I put this down to what I felt was a lack of character development and depth at the beginning of the book . I will readily admit that I am not a huge sci-fi fan so that perhaps also detracted fro my enjoyment of the book . The plot and the characters just did n't jump out at me early on a grab my attention . Perhaps if I had been more into sci-fi I would have enjoyed it more .	-1
I have read the book because the author approached me to read and review it . A couple of days later I decided to write the review . And I realised that I remembered little of the book . It was full of small tips , but never told me how to become rich . I remember snippets like `` save 10 % of your income '' which was combined with some examples , but that was about it.The book touched a lot of small tips , but never a congruent plan . And the tips themselves can be found in lots of other books.A few times the author says something about himself , and gives a small example . But after every example you are left wondering how it all panned out and what he did in that example.Adding up the criticism given above , I can not recommend this book . I would even go as far as to suggest spending your time reading other books if you have already had some exposure to the personal finance and personal development literature .	-1
I lost interest in this book in the second chapter . I could n't & # 34 ; picture & # 34 ; the characters at all . The plot was monotonous and I would n't recommend this book at all , even for free .	-1
This entire book glorifies and romanticizes abusive relationships under the guise of & # 34 ; learning how to love & # 34 ; . There is no love here , just a male protagonist obsessed with controlling the woman he is determined to possess . She 's not a human being to him , she 's a mountain to be climbed . The story was incredibly triggering and did nothing but remind me of abusive men I 've met/been involved with , and I imagine it would do the same for others . GIve it a pass . There are better love stories out there .	-1
I got this book because of all the hype there was on it and the movie but found both to be not worth the time to read or watch .	-1
Nasty little novella inspired by the Richard Matheson short story , `` Duel . '' While traveling to Show Low , Arizona after a meth deal gone double homicide , a motorcycle gang of military veterans encounters a mysterious semi-truck driver who declares war on them.While the novella does have a lot of intense action , the characters are one-dimensional and so it does n't really matter whether they die or not . Hill and King tell us that the motorcycle gang is family , but never really show us how they are family . The `` big reveal '' at the end of the novella is too pat and too clean for the messy world that Hill and King create .	-1
Not only is the spelling and grammar horrendous but parts of sentences are missing and the word order of sentences is incorrect .	-1
I do n't think I ever read a book like this . I agree with the 1 star reviews . The heroine Nora had no backbone . It was hard to believe she fell in love because she certainly did n't love herself . The book as a whole could have been really good , I think it had a good idea . The book itself was written very well . This is my first book by Liz Grace Davis and it was well written.Spoilers ! ! ! ! ... .The main character Nora was very annoying , doing everything to make her dad happy including leaving the man she loved ( Shane ) and about to marry a man that abused her ( Liam ) . Than comes Ethan . The times she was in Dreadra was boring and long , I was reading fast to get through the pages . Who goes to a basic culinary class for 6 months , than ready to run a kitchen and open a her own restaurant ? ? ? I liked the secondary characters and the town . I just did n't like reading a romance where Ethan was still in love with another women but quickly saying the 'i love you 's ' to Nora . Than he leaves her for this other women and she does n't tell him the news that he should hear . I was surprised she got pregnant since the only thing written was cuddling & kissing . Nothing else was even implied . There was NO passion what so ever . The character I feel most sorry for is Shane . Even though he is not in the book as much as the others , he is on Nora 's memory , than when they see each and its obvious he spent the last 5+ years only thinking about her she and hurts him again . She does n't seem to have regard to anyone 's feelings . I think she was one of the least favorite characters I have ever read . There was just a lot in this book that did n't feel right and certainly did not have strong characters . I think I will be deleting from my kindle .	-1
I wanted to like this book so much because the plot seemed liled one I would enjoy . The issue I had was the writing sytle . It was so distracting . It went from first peron to third peron and back again . An editor could have smoothed out these bumps .	-1
Let me begin by saying that the yardstick by which I judge much military science is the work of David Weber in the fantastic Honor Harrington series . That said , `` Hegemony '' was a disappointment in that I found the science distracting and the military underpinnings weak . It may well be that this criticism says more about me than the author ; nonetheless , there you have it . It lacks the deft characterization of Weber at his best , and the science , for me , simply drives the plot in an obtrusive fashion that left me cold . It seems to me that , in the best of the genre , the science is almost invisible in service to the far more interesting interactions of characters in the stress of world and life altering combat . That simply is not the case here .	-1
I enjoyed `` Box '' , so I immediately downloaded `` Bad Doctor '' expecting it to be just as good . Unfortunately , it wasn't.It was n't as well developed and lacked the quirkiness and flow as Box . I expected more hospital drama on the prey ; the two new nurses were sort of thrown into the story ( so soften the demeanor of Dr . Box ) and the story just was n't funny.Not much else to say on this ; I 'm disappointed .	-1
This story has a heroine who is quite exasperating in her beliefs and feelings about the man who adores her . All the women seem to bend except both her and her sister . They seem to be stubborn and even a bit stupid . The sex scenes are for titillation purposes only . It 's ridiculous to think that these Northmen were sensitive and accomplished lovers anxious to provide for their women 's needs in every way , even to the point of crying with them.If you think these kinds of books are really historical novels then you are fooling yourself . They are just romance books set in another time , and not realistic or very historical . Still , not everyone wants to learn about real times in a novel , like in the wonderful book Down the Common . Too bad there are not many books that compare to this gem .	-1
Let me say first off , that this book would have really benefited from someone doing a little proofreading , spell checking & grammar checking . It is double spaced . The formatting is quite bad as far as indentions and margins go . Technical issues , yes , but they can be and often are quite distracting . It makes it seem as if Ms. Reid is trying to pass off a very short book as a full length novel . It had other issues as well . When you call an item ` swum trunks ' , you may need to check your finished work . Using gage when you really mean gauge not once but twice ... there is at least one instance where the author used the wrong word entirely ... but hey , the word she used and one the should have used both started with the same letter , so , oh well . Please proofread ! Please use spell and grammar checks . They may take you a little time in your rush to post your newest book so you can start selling it ... but they certainly make you look more professional and give your reader a better quality product . Using them in combination is a must , since one pass through a spellchecker is generally not enough . It can be tricky catching some of those mistakes , even the glaring ones , but your readers will appreciate your efforts.That aside , the names of the characters in this book ( as mentioned in another review ) almost all end in the same long E sound ; the ` main ' characters at least . This is kind of annoying too and seems as if the author was stuck in a rut here . Maybe making a list of all your characters so you can see them together would have brought this home to you & you perhaps could have used a little more imagination in naming them . The characters are all rather flat and ` black and white ' . By that , I mean that the good guys are all good with no flaws & the bad guys are all bad with no virtues . They come off as being cardboard and not real in the most human sense of the word . The good guys each have one defining character trait . Rosie is stupid . Stanley is cranky . Bradley is patient . Mary is perfect . ( See the trend with the long E sound ? And we have n't even explored the other characters ' names , like Katie , Maggie , Andy , Timmy , Mikey ... etc . ) Also , some kind of ` hick virus ' has infected Stanley . In the beginning of the series , he was a cranky old coot , but that was part of his charm . Now , he 's an uneducated , bordering on illiterate old coot whose grammar has gone downhill since book 4 or 5 . He uses ` ai n't ' and ` iffn ' in almost every sentence . He never had that problem in the first books , and now , all of a sudden , he 's just gone downhill . Maybe he 's senile . If that 's the case , please tell us , so we wo n't think that you are.The story of this book is better than book 6 . However , *SPOILER ALERT* the scene at the wedding in the end was ridiculous . We 're supposed to believe that a drunk breaks into the wedding with a gun and no one does a thing , even the chief of police , who is also in attendance , leaving it up to Mary to single-handedly stop him from killing someone . Sorry . It 's too far-fetched for me to buy . Ms. Reid should have thought about this scene a little more and romanticized it a little less . This book has fits of sap in it from time to time . Thank goodness , nothing approaching the amount in book 6 though . Overall , the story-line for this one was an improvement over the last one . Fixing the formatting and errors would have gone a long way in helping the reader overlook the sap and lame parts of the story . It was far more predictable than the first 4-5 books , but much better than 6.The series and story line had such potential , and the first 4 books were fun to read . I 'm rather sorry to see that it is n't living up to that potential .	-1
I read the sample version of this book on kindle and found it interesting , it felt like a different and unique plot . However , when i purchased the book and progressed onward with the story , it reminded me of B.V. Larson 's Star Force series . I could relate each scenario of this book to that of Star Force series . It just felt like i was reading the same book again . I would say that over 70 to 80 % of the material is straight from Larson's.If this book has gotten your interest , i would suggest read Star Force series on Kindle by B.V. Larson . It is much more satisfying .	-1
I was expecting this fantastic book considering how many of them there are . That is not what I got . This was terribly written and no imagination what so ever . I was very disappointed . Thank goodness it was free otherwise ; I would want my money back . I think that the author needs to do a bit more research next time before she tries to act like she is a pro in the BDSM world .	-1
This book gives the reason Why reflectors are good , but does n't really go into the more technical aspect of it . I would 've liked to see more examples of how to use it effectively .	-1
It really looks like it would be a good book but I wo n't give it a try for 12.99 . At those prices it looks like it would be a print book not a kindle book . Sorry .	-1
very boring , i did finish this book . i felt like i wasted my time . the story is not so much about undertaking but about her life in the new frontier in Canada	-1
It happens too fast . Love takes time . They do n't know each other . He wants wheat Simon found.Silly little story	-1
So , I thought I 'd give this one a try . . . and I 'm quitting at 27 % ( according to my Kindle app ) . Chaste , this book is not . And while I understand that there are many who would really enjoy it , the violence and extremes just are n't something I go in for . Her father has been violent , frightening . . . and so far , she 's willing to do anything with a man ( except that which might result in pregnancy ) , and I 'm not willing to keep reading to see if it gets better.If you 're looking for a truly romantic book , this is n't it . More like a soap opera . . .	-1
this maybe a case of insufficient editing . The style of writing is stilted , awkward , and difficult to read . I was unable to finish this book , and was disappointed by it . It certainly did n't live up to the 4 star rating .	-1
I 'm a easy mark for a Darcy and Lizzy story . This one had a sweet story , well-balanced with romance and angst . However the poor grammar and many errors where very distracting and sometimes annoying . There were also many misused words .	-1
Loved the Heroes hated the Heroines in The Soldier and The Virtuoso . So disappointed when I had enjoyed The Heir although a lot of lemonade and marzipan ! Buy The Heir , forget about the other two !	-1
Finished all the books but became increasingly irritated with the idiocy of each character . The series seems to be an attempt to produce something along the lines of the Stephanie Plum series created by Janet Evanovich but falls a long way short of accomplishing anything like it . The short story was not really a story at all , more like setting the scene for the next book .	-1
Not a lot of variety . Honestly , not many of the recipes appealed to my family . Next time I 'll read more of the book before I buy it ... even at a low price . A waste of money .	-1
First of all gluten free and wheat are NOT the same thing . Several reviews here seem to imply they are . But my wheat free beef with this book is that it is only a few pages long and , for me anyway , did not summarize the & # 34 ; Wheat Belly & # 34 ; book . You can learn more about the book by reading the reviews or go to the blog . This pamphlet should be free , it 's not even worth $ 2.99 .	-1
So predictable I could have written it from the first chapter on . . . A total waste of my time .	-1
A grammatical issue that bothers me is when an author uses past tense and incorporates the word NOW which just confuses the reader instead of grounding them . The bum thing has been done to death and there is nothing fun or original here . I do like a quick read once in a while and it was okay to burn some time .	-1
Thin on specifics but in general some good advice for beginners . I agree that video is important in marketing your ebooks . Author gives a passing nod to fiction writing , but it takes talent and skills to produce a masterpiece , not just `` suspension of disbelief '' as he blithely states .	-1
What the Founding Fathers believed . For people who downright deify our Founding Fathers , the religious right is really hostile to accepting them as they actually were , which is not particularly religious , especially by the standards of their time . But David Barton , a revisionist & # 8220 ; historian & # 8221 ; whose name comes up again and again in these kinds of discussions , has spread the belief far and wide in the Christian right that the Founders were , in fact , fundamentalist Christians who are quite like the ones we have today . Gov . Sam Brownback of Kansas confirms this , saying that Barton & # 8220 ; provides the philosophical underpinning for a lot of the Republican effort in the country today. & # 8221 ; Barton has convinced the right to believe in their fervent wish that the Founders were religious and even theocratic with quote-mining and outright lying . He likes to whip out this John Adams quote : & # 8220 ; There is no authority , civil or religious & # 8212 ; there can be no legitimate government & # 8212 ; but what is administered by this Holy Ghost. & # 8221 ; Problem ? Adams was summarizing the opinion of his opponents ; that wasn & # 8217 ; t Adams & # 8217 ; view at all.Barton & # 8217 ; s reputation took a hit recently . His most recent book , which tried to portray Thomas Jefferson as a & # 8220 ; conventional Christian & # 8221 ; who wanted a religious government , was so bad that even his Christian publisher decided to reject it . But according to Politico , that & # 8217 ; s just a small setback and Barton is quickly being restored to his position as an authority on history for gullible right-wingers . So that means his lies continue to grow and spread in right-wing circles & # 8212 ; such as the completely made-up claim that the Constitution ( which only mentions religion to insist the government stay out of it ) is based on the Bible .	-1
I received a copy of The Wrong Sword for an honest review.Henry the Rat has been living in Paris as a con artist thief for a long time . After selling their latest sword Henry thinks he 'll be set for a long time . Too bad he sold the fake sword to Geoffrey Plantagenet who offers Henry a deal . He helps him find the sword Excalibur and Geoffrey will let Henry and his friends live . So off Henry goes to try and save his skin except when he finds the wrong it wo n't shut up and gets him into even more trouble . Now Henry is on a mission to save all of his close friends from Geoffrey and find a suitable knight for the noble but annoying sword Excalibur.This review is going to be short because I do n't have too much to say about the story of Thw Wrong Sword . I gave the story a two star rating because I honestly could not get into this book at all . There was never a part of The Wrong Sword where I was finally interested in what was going on with the story or the characters and every time I had to go back and pick this story up I was dreading it . Now mind you this is personal preference and I am sure many people love Henry 's story with Excalibur but I was just not one of them.The Wrong Sword is very action packed ; there are murders , fights , wars , and a tiny love story that goes with this book . Henry is very cunning and while the sword and Henry fight and argue a lot their bond is almost unbreakable . Ted Mendelssohn wrote a very intricate story where thieves can become knights and swords can be extremely annoying.All in all if you 're looking for a story with magic swords and lands of King Arthur are mythical and twisted then this is the book for you .	-1
As a Christ Follower , I find such products as this an absolute disgrace to the FINISHED work that Christ accomplished in paying for ALL of our sins . The only reason for a Purgatory is if Christ didnt do enough to atone for ALL our sins . & # 34 ; Purgatory ' like so many other made up Catholic doctrines are an abomination to the person of Christ and completely nullify what The Bible says . Theres a good reason why Jesus kept saying : 'DO NOT die in your sins ' ... yet we have the alleged safety of Purgatory to get us fully cleaned up so we can enter heaven . You get Christs FULL righteousness imputed to you IF you are willing to trust in his total atonement of all sins . Dont count on this manmade fallacy to finish the job . And dont think you can pay for a loved one to exit Purgatory sooner. , for thats just a neat money making scheme . Finally , dont allow evil teachings to invade your Mind . This DVD was a very slick piece of propaganda for the Follower of man- invented religiosity	-1
I did not like to this and thought it was very tasteful . I would not read again no story line .	-1
I was optimistic after seeing this book got an average four-star review . It seemed at last somewhat interesting to start . But within 30 or 40 pages , all I could do was roll my eyes . ***SPOILER ALERT*** Stop reading now if you seriously are considering this book ! ... ... .So after being essentially abandoned by her father for two decades ( or so she thinks ) , within hours of seeing him for the first time in more than 20 years Rusty is ready to hit the small town and find herself a complete stranger to marry , so she can give her father a grandchild ? Because she thinks it 's his dying wish	-1
I got this book because of all the rave reviews . I should have known better and read the negative reviews too . The story had promise but fizzled out very quickly . The main characters got on my nerves with their behavior . I would expect that sort of idiocy from teenagers not so-called adults . And I just do n't see how she could forgive her father so quickly . I mean seriously ? He is manipulating you , no matter what his excuse . I was very disappointed .	-1
Terribly written . Terrible plot . Don & # 8217 ; t bother reading this book . I kept waiting for something entertaining or interesting to happen and it never came . Thank goodness I did n't pay for this book or I would have wanted my money back .	-1
Romances certainly are n't my favorite literary genre , and this book was no exception , involving a woman who swears never to date another cowboy but does so regardless .	-1
Tool me forever to read this short book because it was n't interesting or captivating in the slightest . Standard romance formula .	-1
The typical Miss Marple story where she saves the day with her keen senses . However , it was n't the best I have read .	-1
I am a beginner , and I need the el and la before the nouns . Returned this one because of the lack of articles . I also found the extended pronunciation for each word a little much , but others might find that more helpful than not .	-1
Story was Good but just to short l would have liked to have read more I was into it then it was over . SMH	-1
Too weird and gruesome . Only got a sample of this book but did not buy it . It was too strange .	-1
Much to short to grab you . Not the usual from the Johansens . I 'm truly disappointed . They could have expanded the contents to make it interesting .	-1
The only thing noteworthy in this book is the presence of Eve Duncan to introduce a rather unlikable heroine . I did not like it at all , it was a chore to get through it !	-1
This whole thing seemed to me like a total fabrication with zero credibility . Currie 's done much better with the Warrior 's Wings ( Valkyrie ) and Odyssey One ( Into the Black ) previous . Looking forward to additions to the two former , not more of this BS.Steam Legion	-1
This has to be one of the most poorly written books I 've ever read . The grammar , sentence structure , and misuse of tense were completely distracting . I was n't sure whether I wanted to break out my red pen and start marking the pages , or just throw it in the trash ! The story line was mediocre at best , punctuated by random erotica that was no more than poorly written soft porn . There is no subtlety , interesting depth , or layering in the plot or in the interactions between the characters . All in all , I feel rather misled by this books rating , and recommend you save your money .	-1
Stupid book ... sorry I bought it , is this enough words Amazon ? Why do I need to keep typing here ? These word limits are stupid ...	-1
His Island Bride , while not written poorly , was overly simplistic in its telling . It was almost juvenile the way the characters thought and talked .	-1
Very boring attempt at analysis of a killer . I can not think of twelve more words to say about it .	-1
The author has a good idea then manages to mangle it into several pieces that do not always match . A good editor would have made a better book out of his work .	-1
Not recommended . This was a free read , thankfully . Boring . Not even worth the read for a free book . Skip it .	-1
***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS***I found it impossible to write this review without revealing a lot of the story , due to the number of plots in the book . I feel that I can not properly review the book without giving away some secrets.While it is awesome to start off a tale with a bang by means of a mystery , in this slim volume there are way too many mysteries . Lucy has decided to work at a summer camp for one month in the summer . Despite the fact that she has ( 1 ) never worked at a camp and ( 2 ) never been the the US , she is on her way to Northern California . Driven in a limo by a non-communicative driver , she is dropped off at Camp Aquinas with little ceremony . There she meets Steve , a hippy with questionable hygiene and nicotine-stained fingers . And no one else . It appears that she has arrived before the other counselors and campers.Out for a walk , Lucy finds a boy floating in a river . To her horror , he appears to be dead . As she tries to get to him , his body floats free of an obstruction and disappears over a waterfall . She will never forget his face . Lucy runs back to camp and tells Steve what she has seen . Though he assures her that he will contact the police , she does not believe him.A former prefect at her school in England , Lucy is all about rules . While she was n't a popular student , per se , she certainly had her share of friends she could relate to . So why was n't she fitting in at the camp ? One reason is that , at Camp Aquinas , there are no rules . None of the other counselors seem to like her and she knows her three bratty charges hate her , since they told her to her face.For a short book , it was certainly wordy . Like faucet 's on too high wordy . There was a lot of information repetition , like the author was signalling that we were supposed to remember this especially . Dad left the family , Lucy 's so smart , rules are important to Lucy , etc . Lots of back and forth between past and present.Lucy is a stiff and reserved goody two shoes . She is the kind of girl that thinks everything needs to be structured in order to be fun . If I were at that camp , I would have run her underwear up the flagpole . The only other character that is fleshed out in any way is Steve , who runs the camp ( though he is in no way 3D ) . He is the complete opposite of Lucy : no rules , no schedules , no plans , no worries . He apparently has never heard of soap or that as the head of a summer camp for children , he should probably not be smoking pot . Oh , and here 's his surprise : Steve used to be a big-deal corporate lawyer ! Oh the irony ! The rest of the characters are flat caricatures . The mean flirt , the hunky virgin who 's never kissed a girl , bratty campers , stupid country cops , beehived librarian . Knowing the question raised at the end of the book , that makes the behavior of the camp 's secondary characters very perplexing . Maybe that 's what was intended , another mystery ? Then there 's this David Lucy keeps trying not to think about . That 's another mystery strung throughout the story . Let 's just say that he and Lucy are no longer together . There are at least five more mysteries that I can count ( ***MANY MANY SPOILERS*** ) : Why did Lucy 's Dad leave ? Why is Lucy at the camp ? What 's up with the teepee ? What 's inside ? Woah . There 's the boy from the river . He 's alive and having fun at camp.Wait . DAVID was supposed to be at camp ? Though I wo n't reveal what Lucy discovers at the library ( practically the only thing I do n't , I know ) , suffice it to say that there will be no answers to any of these mysteries in this volume.2 of 5 StarsPoison Oak Summer by AK Dawson was published April 24 , 2012 by Unsung .

I loved SVH when I was a kid , so I was pretty excited when & # 34 ; Sweet Valley Confidential & # 34 ; made it 's debut . I did n't like the whole Jessica/Todd situation , but at least the book held my interest . Now that this 6 part series has come along , even the writing is awful . The plot is terrible . Some parts of it , like Lila 's reality show , is just ridiculous . Her character is titally unbelievable as a real person ! I 've read the first 2 installments in the e-series and I have no desire to finish it .	-1
I gave this book a chance because of the amazing reviews it got ... Unfortunately , I enjoy reading books with interesting plots and realistic characters.In this book , everyone is rich , no one does very much , and misunderstandings occur constantly . I spent the whole book thinking `` WHY do n't they just talk to each other if they love each other so much ? '' It got to the point in which I did n't even care what happened.Wimpy romance , horrendous story line , and a waste of my evening . Also , `` he shook his head '' normally means the opposite of `` he nodded , '' but not in this book , apparently .	-1
But even if it was not my genre , and taking into account it was a short story , this was not worth the read .	-1
. . . . and YOU 'RE NOT IT . And shame on Amazon for allowing you to profit via the name of a well-known author.How dare you take the nomenclature of a well-known cook/chef for your sleazy `` free '' little kindle book . Shame on you . With your serious lack of originality , I doubt you 'll be going far in the cookbook publishing business .	-1
If you like your Catholic spirituality at the junior-high self-righteous butterflies-and-rainbows level , you 'll LOVE Sister Justicia.But if you 're actually a Catholic who is intrigued by the potential in the dilemma of a realistic , faithful nun who has a good heart and a genuine conflict between doing what seems to be right and what actually IS right ... go somewhere else . You wo n't get it here.I had high hopes for this book . Catholics , probably more than any other faith tradition , have a long history of being able to laugh at ourselves . We have a long history of `` personalities '' and quirky , interesting people who find quirky , and sometimes offbeat , ways of serving God that end up doing amazing good . When I read the description of the book , I thought if anybody could carry off that delicate balance , Bell ought to be able to do it.I was wrong.Cataloguing what 's wrong with this book would take almost as long as the novella is itself . There are weird timeline things going on here ; on one hand , Sister J seems to have been a nun for a long time -- but on the other hand , she 's young enough and ( apparently ) new enough that people still recognize her in her old `` persona . '' Several other things happen in periods of time that seem unreal , perhaps because of the constraints of the novella length . But by far , the worst gaffes -- over and over -- are those misrepresenting Catholicism in general and the consecrated life in particular.Sister J indulges in violence needlessly , selfishly , and seemingly without much conscience involved-and then justifies it in her so-called `` confession . '' She has no concept of obedience or submission to the nun who 's supposedly her superior , even though she would have taken a vow of such at her profession . ( She does n't even call Sister Sarah `` Mother , '' although the story leads us to believe that Sister Sarah is , in fact , her Mother Superior . ) She chides Sister Sarah to `` Read the Book ! '' ( meaning the Bible ) , while disobeying that same book in regards to both immediate community authority and civil authority . She keeps invoking God 's law as `` higher '' and that she 's following it ( in typical `` spirit of Vatican II '' self-absorbed fashion ) , but there 's no prayerful discernment shown of that law and her part in it . ( Does this woman ever pray , in fact ? There 's no Mass attendance in here , there 's no community prayer with the other sisters ... I guess she does n't think that small detail is important . ) She has this weird notion that she can get `` black marks '' against her name and get bounced out of the religious life for it , as if she 's an eighth-grader in some Catholic reform school ... when in reality , the difficulties people point out with her living the religious life should have ( and would have ) been dealt with LONG before she was in this spot ( in formation , particularly ) . She wears a habit with `` nun shoes '' on one page , and then later on talks about the difficulty of running in `` pumps '' -- as if `` nun shoes '' and high-heeled pumps are the same thing ? In other words ... who did this author have as a technical consultant about the consecrated life ? Sally Field ? This is n't a novel about a `` rogue nun . '' This is a novel about Hollywood and the media 's version of what a nun is , overlaid with a bunch of self-righteous `` spirituality '' and `` justice '' that is cringeworthy at best and insulting at worst . It gets one star because the writing , in the sense of pure craft , is great . The details , however , are a mess . If an author ca n't even be bothered to capitalize such things as `` Magisterium '' and `` Church '' ( both of which would be capitalized in Catholic reference ) , his ignorance about his subject matter is embarrassingly clear . And no one bothered to correct it , either . If you ca n't get those basic things right , your premise will end up full of holes , and this one does.Do n't waste your money . $ 1.49 's too much for this pap .	-1
I was drawn to this book by the title because I lived in Montana for more than 20 years . The author did write lovingly about the beauty of Montana . The stilted dialog drove me nuts . I have never heard anyone , anywhere speak like these characters . I am not a prude , but at least one-third of the book is graphic descriptions of sex which , in my opinion , add little to the story . The rest of the book is a string of highly improbable murders . I slogged through the book hoping to discover what the 5-star reviewers found , but it did n't happen . I was about to breathe a sigh of relief thinking I had reached the end ; sadly I was only about half-way through . The book was way too long . I will give the book 2 stars for the Montana setting , but for me , it was really only a 2-star read .	-1
Why was this printed ? There 's no storyline . There 's no meat to this manuscript . There 's nothing holding it together in a cohesive structure . Nothing with angst thru the story pushing the H/h apart as it draws them together . Nothing to keep the reader interested in the base line wanting the couple to overcome the obstacles and have a triumph at the stories climatic moment . There was no climatic moment . My 8 year old tells better stories . Yes I can quantify my opinion because I am published . I do not get how the author got this in print unless it was self pub . Do n't waste your time do n't waste your money .	-1
This took some time to get into , particularly as each days account like a diary felt like it had to be described on twitter ( 150 characters or less ) . Other than the dogs , there was little character development . i enjoyed the historical aspects of some of the places visited butt these were brief and looked like they were copied from a travel brochure . Perhaps the trip was too big and done in such a short that time the accounting of each location became too brief . I did not like it as a travel book to consider places to visit , not did I like it as an adventure tale of a trip around France , as it was a mix of both and failed to meet either .	-1
whoever is interested in learning about special forces must read the book.Even if it is not a big source of information anyone can learn something .	-1
do not know why but did not like this quick free read . usually they are better but just could n't get into this one .	-1
This `` book '' is extremely short and contains extremely short descriptions of each company if any at all . The author does n't give you any insight into the companies and for some just provides a link to their website . A huge portion of the book is an advertisement for her other books and an `` about the author '' . There is no way this book is 55 pages in print and is more like a booklet . While the book is extremely short , there are some decent sites , but nothing you ca n't find with a quick Google Search . Stay away from this book , and while I do n't know about her other books , I 'll be staying away from this author . Many of the 5 star reviews this book has received are by people who have n't purchased the book ( not an Amazon Verified purchase ) meaning they either bought it and refunded it , or more likely were paid to review it .	-1
This was a short cute story . Had lots of sex and growling between two lion 's . I hope if Ms. Kyle has another book it 's a little longer and has more '' story line '' .	-1
Recipes were difficult to read on a tablet . The second half of book was interesting for tried and true remedies on how to do things or what to use for every day questions .	-1
The story could be interesting even if out of my comfort zone . But I do n't think it 's been handled well and deeply how it deserves.All too easy , simplistic and superficial.And after all these years of pain and sufference the heroine is too forgiving and unmindful of her own fears.Really possible and so quickly ?	-1
This was a good , quick free read . It kept me interested for awhile and just when I was starting to wander , pulled me back in . Not bad for a free read .	-1
I 'm not sure which was worse , the lack of character development or the lack of editing . Both of these things were frustrating and spoiled any enjoyment I might have had .	-1
Stories were too much alike . Seems to be all written to the same outline.Cleared from my kindle before finishing .	-1
i got this book when it was a kindle freebie , and i am very disappointed . OK , it actually sucked.this guy Michael is a drug dealer . he was on his way to California to finish delivering drugs when he had to stop for gas . He went inside for a red bull and saw the prettiest lady alive . Well , that girl had a boyfriend and when he said something , Micheal punched him in the chest and the guy died . everyone at the gas station freaked out and the clerk pulled out a gun and said do n't move . Micheal took the gun and killed like 4 people.the pretty girl 's name was Jezebel . he made her come with him . Micheal then keeps having weird experiences where people die around him . Jezebel would kill people who would be a threat to them . Jezebel is a demon . She could make Micheal do whatever she wanted.Micheal went to church and confessed everything . the priest was trying to get him help to rid of his evil when Jezebel would keep coming around and killing the priests.Micheal then knew what he had to do to save his life .	-1
This was horrible . how can this even be called a book ? i am amazed at how this got published.it doesnt deserve a star rating	-1
The writing style of this book is horrible . I could n't even make is a quarter of the way through it was so horrible . If you like reading good books this is n't one of them .	-1
Wish I could say great , but have to say , needed grammer , spelling , and editing . Was like it was a rough draft , it needed help , before putting on amazon . Writer has potential , but failed to proof read , mistakes everywhere . Hope she does not give up , needs editor or a good proof reader .	-1
It had the potential to be a really good read , but the grammatical errors and typosruined the book . I had to stop halfway through and deleted it from my kindle . I wasn'tgoing to write a review , but I decided that someone needed to post the truth.Sorry , but ship it to an editor ASAP !	-1
There were so many errors in this book it almost made me laugh . I 'm no expert , but even a BS in biology can tell me this is chock-full of scientific inaccuracies . This was my main problem with the novel , although I did think quite a few scenes were simply overdone . The suspense element was very much there , but many times dialogue and situations felt contrived and fake . I 'm not sorry I read it and someone without a scientific background would probably enjoy it alot more than I did .	-1
It was just ok . I spent the majority of the book trying to figure out what the mystery was . When I did , it was lack luster but overall a descent read . The only thing that turnsme off to this writer completely is his mention of Southern University in a negative light . *News flash buddy : However you may feel about Southern University , it 's bright and well adjusted graduates do read , moron . *	-1
Why , oh why do romance/erotic novels ( of any kind ) always have to start in the same unrealistic fashion ? All it takes is one look , one eye to eye contact and suddenly..BOOM ! ! Lust , desire , unbearable attraction to one another , cocks filling and twitching at the littlest mention of the name of the new object of one 's every wet dream , electricity crackling during the slightest touch ... All that , from 1 to 100 in 0.001 seconds . Truly amazing.Gah.If all these novels were to believe it 'd be hart not to come across guys with raging bone*s bulging their trousers every few minutes in RL . It really must be so hard to be a member of the male species ... It 's really sad that that many books get spoiled because of this kind of utter , unbelievable insta-everything , which is overdone to such a degree that I ca n't possibly find anything remotely believable in the whole setup of said romance.I need build-up , god damnit . A more realistic setting . And in this particular book : a little bit more brain and common sense . Because , really ? Tossing your whole set of principles over board , risking your career and your life ( because prison becomes a very likely option here ) in favour of a quick shag , because lust is clouding your brain ? Not a thing any halfway decent cop or detective would go for if his object of desire was not only a criminal , a gang leader with dozens of murders under his belt , but also the person who shot said cop just a few weeks ago . I believe that men are a little bit more in control of themselves than that . Or am I that wrong , that delusional ? I was about to give the book and its author brownie points for , at least , settling for overdone insta-attraction instead of the whole insta-love thing ( which is even worse ) , but I was wrong about that , too . Insta-love , hello , how are you ? I ca n't even decide what 's most ridiculous here : that they 're agreeing on some rules regarding their relationship according to which they have to leave all gang and cop business out of their love affair , thinking that that will actually work out , that they call it a relationship pretty much after their first shared kiss , that they trust each other immediately ( hello ? Gang leader ? Cop ? ) , or that the great Detective Gabe constantly tries to comfort Angelo regarding the hard and difficult gang-related decisions that he has to make , like making an example of one of his gang members whose loyalty was n't a 100 % with the gang by torturing and killing him . Gabe constantly tells Angelo that he 's there for him and that he can talk to him about anything ... which , what ? Rules . Have they really already forgotten about them after like 10 seconds ? That being said , this book 's setting/premise had potential . If done well , in a more realistic and believable way , I find myself enjoying the bad boy - cop liaison ( even if rather unrealistic in RL ) . The action part did n't hurt either . Long time since I read suspense and , yeah , it was time to go there again.But this book was definitly the wrong choice .	-1
The wording of this book just does n't flow well . To many obscure words that are n't used in everyday conversation . The story itself had promise but never lived up to its potential . The loose ends were not wrapped up an tied neatly together as it should have been . A good proofreader or editor would have been helpful	-1
this book is a waste of time . now in my country delilah is a whore and this is what this woman is a whore . so pathetic and sad how they portray a woman . JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN HER AND BROTHER ( HE do n't know they are not related ) but this woman screwing everyone WTF	-1
A good series but this one has a bad ending . It felt like the build up and then it just ends . WTF . I enjoyed the conflict and resolution and the insights into the people and their motivations . I felt like the background on the mother should of been a side story but I understand how that tied into this book . I am as ( I am sure you 're aware ) mad at the hanging ending . It is blackmail I tell you . If you want to count on me to buy the next book , write really good , do n't play games of leaving me hanging !	-1
What 's Hot : If you love bagpipes , porridge with salt instead of sugar and guts in a bag , you 'll feel right at home with this book . Like haggis in a witches ' cauldron it forms a tasty brew , mixing the mystical , historical , romantic and Celtic to good effect . The dialogue is thick with a brogue that combines Irish and Scottish ingredients , while the range of characters is similarly diverse . Witches and druids rub shoulders with priests and lairds , while selkies swim past.This is an adventure romance infused with enough exotic characters and spicy politics to whet the appetite . There is plenty of sex sandwiched between the political and social realities of the era , which add depth to this slice of old fashioned fun.What 's Not : Be wary of indigestion if a sometimes awkward , overly decorative writing style grates on you . Characters switch from shouting to sighing and other cliched reactions in a disconcerting way . The flow of dialogue and description is often more lumpy than smooth . The exposition at the beginning is lengthy and intrusive and most of it could have been cut . Some of the sex scenes suffer from cliche and overblown language . This lack of subtlety can leave a bad taste in the mouth and distract from the fun of the story.Summary : Fast food , rather than fine dining , this tale still offers some tempting treats . It may not satisfy completely , but offers plenty for the reader to take away with them . However , if the Not so hot points above are likely to annoy you ( and they almost certainly will ) , it could pay to look further down the menu for your next read .	-1
Many of these recipes use pre-made ingredients that we do n't buy.I like to cook using fresh , good quality ingredients .	-1
I have enjoyed the first 3 books , but i may have over done it . I didnt finish this fourth book	-1
This series is very sweet and good for someone who enjoys religious reading . Well written and very clean written book .	-1
I could n't finish it . Read a few pages then had to stop . Not my kind of story . No romance . I did n't care for rape of a boy by a man .	-1
Once you get past the dense language so popular in older texts you see a man who was clearly either ahead of his time and poorly understood ( very likely given the many groups that have used Nietzche to back up wildly different points of view ) or you have a guy that was very full of . . . Himself . I probably have to read this a few more times before I can make a truly informed decision .	-1
I have to say I did not finish this book and it was not very interesting . There was a lot of background information but not much actual nursing information . Too much author rambling for me .	-1
No star review is not possible ... .I downloaded this thinking it was fantasy fiction , but it is only a romance novel , perhaps a Harlequin reject at that . The writer seems to have grabbed nothing but buzz words , thrown them into a computer , and then strung them together with an amateur 's plotline . We have Hollywood soap stars with plastic surgery , bondage , drug use , promiscuity , and over-the-top wealth ; a mish-mosh described using a tiny ( misspelled ! ) vocabulary . A sense of the twee is everywhere - quite the disconnect with the clumsy sexual innuendo the author brings up for no reason at every turn . After our thinly-conceived heroine coyly seduces everyone she sees , there is no actual contact other than chaste kisses taking place . Is that a romance novel device or what ? I am glad this was free ! There were so many things to dislike ... Irritatingly , the misspelled words are on almost every page . ( When will writers and editors figure out the difference between `` discreet '' and `` discrete '' and use the right word ? ) Now I notice it is 99 cents -- still too much to pay for it .	-1
The only photo is the one of the cover . If these cakes are so mind blowing then there should be pictures showing us how great they look . I got this book because I thought there would be good decorating tips and photos showing how to decorate the cakes . I should have taken advantage of the Look Inside feature first . If you like making cakes from just a recipe and figuring out the decorating yourself then go ahead and get this book but if you were hoping to see what the cake looked like before making it you are out of luck .	-1
Awesome story of a solders personal war with some bomb makers . Very short but I recommend it as a good read .	-1
It seems that the first chapter that is read before the purchase is the only good part of some books . That is the case with this book . It seems like there was little or no proof READING . The story was too drawn out .	-1
I was disappointed in this book as it was listed as a Christian book in the description . Very bad language and story line .	-1
this book just did n't make any since to me . it was too much of the same thing through out the book .	-1
I had high expectations of this great American , but old Been lets us down with this rendition . I 'll have to get a good biography of Franklin to overcome this disappointment .	-1
This book seemed chucked full of info at first , but now that I think of it , perhaps its too much info to be completely true , considering the small amount of factual info I acquired from websites . The fact that there 's a lot of spelling mistakes also added to my doubts . I really hope this person who made this is n't filling it with assumptions and crap , because this is a report paper we are talking about !	-1
I 'd like to add my voice to those commenters who have complained about the lack of poems in this edition . Whoever scanned it must not know anything about the book , because the poems are absolutely necessary . For example , it 's really absurd to have Humpty Dumpty explaining the words in `` Jabberwocky '' without the poem ! Anyone who has never read this story would be baffled .	-1
This book is listed as young adult . I would never let my teenager read this . The main character is a drunk , egotistical girl , who can `` feel '' pain that others around her experience . She 's trying to solve a murder she `` felt '' while she was drunk and being kicked out of a bar . This book is crass , and absolutely not something I would recommend for a young person . The writing feels rushed , I occasionally felt it was hard to keep up with where it was heading .	-1
It was a quick easy read . It was ok but could just a easily been the beginning of Rose Harbor first book .	-1
The short story is cute ... I think it is meant to kick off a new series . However , reading Chapter 1 of the first book was a HUGE disappointment . Sorry - I guess I am different . But I choose to read trashy romance novels to escape real world experiences . I want happy endings ... lots of love ... and if there 's a mystery or thrill involved that 's a bonus . I hate hate hate hate books where they kill off much loved characters . Yes , I know that 's real life - and I live that every day . When I escape into a book I want to feel good . Otherwise , I would read a different venue . Very disappointed in Debbie again .	-1
Since it was an F. Scott Fitzgerald , I was hoping for something better . It was hard to get into and was just downright boring . I would daydream in the middle of reading which is the exact opposite of The Great Gatsby that was able to keep my attention . This book was nothing special and I 'm glad it was free because that 's about what is worth .	-1
This story was all over the place . Had potential at beginning but went downhill quickly . Lost interest halfway through took me a while to finish . A dull read .	-1
An interesting summary of the most significant events in the life of Julius Caesar . A very easy read . Good supplement to other readings on Julius Caesar .	-1
This book is about Ab Lincoln . We have read about him in history and we all want to know more about him . This book , which is very old , fails to clearly articulate life and philosophy of the great man . Does n't exactly tell ou much about the man and uses lots of unintelligible descriptives about Lincoln 's philosophy and his method of working . I failed to get clear idea , how and why the great man became so , from this book .	-1
This book , for me , is the perfect example of why teenagers may feel let down with reading habits in high-school . For a mandatory book , this is probably one of the most boring books I have ever read . It seemed to have every single characteristic of the grammar that the teacher always told me to AVOID . And yet , they make us read it in school . So ... besides having to bear the annoying writing style , I am expected to actually understand what is the big lesson behind this tedious story ? Then what , am I supposed to juggle eleven rubber balls while singing & # 34 ; O Sole Mio & # 34 ; meanwhile ? Anything can be deduced from this book , from a deep , angst story of a forbidden love to a critique of the society as it labels its sinful denizens ( like what happens in many other books , by the way ) , so I do n't understand why The Scarlet Letter in special is in the list of the & # 34 ; 1001 Books to Read Before You Die & # 34 ; . With so many books that are good in giving moral lessons and entertaining at the same time , I do n't see anything special in this one.I may look a bit revolted in this & # 34 ; review & # 34 ; , but all these words of despise do have a reason : the book 's writing style . The way the narrative flows ( or does not flow , in this case ) drags you back the whole time . Hawthorne changes the focus of his sentences so many times that by the time you get to the point , you already forgot what he was talking about . It 's like being hungry , being about to take a bite on a sandwich and being interrupted in every single attempt to do it . By the time you actually manage to eat the goddamned sandwich , you 're no longer hungry because it is cold and the mayonnaise became icky and liquid and the lettuce is dry.I gave it two stars rather than one because , somewhere in the book , there actually is a beautiful story of a forbidden love and the child that comes from it is , in a way , the material representation of the resentment of both parties . Still , at a certain part of the book , I did n't even know what the hell I was reading .	-1
This translation is into what appears to be King James English . After spending much time and effort into mentally translating into modern English , I 'm giving up and looking for a better translation . You get what you pay for .	-1
the first quarter was really interesting , then it got loooooong and so angst-ridden . i couldnt seem to get emotionally involved with the characters .	-1
I realize this book is fiction , but I found the humor and the romance relationship with Lark and her neighbor needed to be edited for a reader to follow their relationship through the book .	-1
After only the first part of the first chapter the story abruptly stopped , and an entirely new book by the same author started . I was truly disgusted with this bait and switch..	-1
James Rollins has written some very good books . This is not one of them . For a short story it is not bad , but I prefer longer books .	-1
Not worth reading and not as advertised do n't waste your time or money bad , very bad , not worth the hardware it 's stored on	-1
I was expecting more american style traditional scones ( what the heck was I thinking ? It DOES say BRITISH scone ! ! ) These are more of a biscuit recipe and not what I wanted .	-1
Jane Romsey , Traditional British Pudding Recipes ( No press listed , 2012 ) Points off : no press listed.Warning : this is not a book to read when you 're trying to eat healthier ... Fifty-two pages chock full of delicious dessert recipes from rice pudding to bread-and-butter pudding ( which is different than bread pudding -- for which there is also a recipe here ) to just about any other sweet pudding you can think of . I 'm not sure why I had thought this book was going to be exhaustive , and in the preface Romsey says that since she 's a vegetarian , she specifically left out steak and kidney pie , but what she neglected to go on and say is that she left out all the savory puddings , which I was really looking forward to seeing recipes for -- no white pudding , no haggis , no groaty pudding , no traditional blancmange ( which , yes , in its original form was a chicken dish , viz . The Forme of Cury ) . Hoping there 's a sequel that covers those . But if you 're looking for the desserty stuff , and your waistline can handle it , hop to , there is a bounty of steamed and baked puddings awaiting you here . This is a recommend despite the low rating ( which comes as a function of the author not including relevant information in the file or on the Amazon page ) . **	-1
You have to write your words down as you go because the book is not interactive . I think the book should have revealed that in the initial information online .	-1
I did not like this dictionary because if you wanted to look up a word you needed to go back to the front . then you had to put in the word and most time it did not have the word in the dictionary . I never use it because my bible has a concordance .	-1
This book was so far fetched that it made reading it hard ... To be stranded and then to be used by the mechanics to pay for your car is a very poor plot .	-1
My daughter gave me her old KIndle Fire tablet thing to use and I was unable to do much on it since it did not come with instructions . After much searching , I found the complete book of instructions on my Kindle so I ordered it on my Kindle . It loaded on about 100 pages of instructions which I found I was unable to actually apply while trying to use the tablet I had been given . After trying and trying I finally gave up on the free KIndle Fire tablet and I got a new Samsung Galaxy tablet for Christmas . It came with instructions and I am slowly learning my new toy . I deleted the Kindle Fire instructions from my Kindle . I guess that about covers this review !	-1
Too critical of those who differ in the teachings of the Bible , strictly denominational , which should be noted on the review	-1
OMG ! ! ! Seriously ? ! ! The H and h 's hormones were like that of a teenager . This story read like a first attempt at a romance . The author forgot little detail like the h working in a cubicle and then a couple of paragraphs later she was shutting the door to her office . She had a boyfriend she loved who died in the middle east and took an erotic writing class to help her move on , but a couple chapters later she telling her boss and loved him . There was no cohesiveness to the story that you could hold to to make the story work . I just looking at the story in disbelief and found myself repeating , `` What ? '' . I 'm so not interested in the continuing of the `` love '' story .	-1
This story was n't very clear . It was hard to understand at first if there was a student involved or not . I did figure out later that it was a mother of one of the students but it was still awkward to read . I did n't really like the setting or even the characters very much . The entire story just felt too weird and uncomfortable .	-1
I thought the book was base on one story I was really interested . At first but it his book became a bore to me	-1
This little book was a big disappointment for me . Lots of high volume sales pitch & hype , but no quality input on writing and designing a Blog .	-1
This book is replete with typos and grammar errors , but I can look past that . What is really disappointing is the fact that you are not told how many pages the book is when buying . I thought I was purchasing a book , not a booklet on Intro to Pigs . 1/6th of the book just describes pig breeds . If you really want to know about pigs , buy Storey 's Guide to Raising Pigs 3rd Edition .	-1
This is something I would not read . I read the first few pages and realized it was not for me . I should have read the book description before loading onto my kindle .	-1
I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review . Thank you to the author for his generosity.The premise pulled me in , but I soon became disenchanted.The good : -The author shines a light on bullying.-the vampire/human relationship is reversed ( kick ass female vamp w/underdog human ) The bad : -I feel no empathy for Jonathan despite the horrible amounts of bullying he goes through.-Thorn has no depth , and we are not even given any hints to her history , only a vague reference that she is very old.-The whole book is riddled with errors , enough that they continually pulled me out of the story.The book can be better , if the problems are fixed . As another reviewer noted , a developmental editor is needed to bring out the potential the book offers .	-1
This book would be so much better if it has gone thru an edit process . The typos were everywhere , bad punctuation , capital letters where none should be , and a lack of capital letters where some were needed . The story was OK and I finished it just to see how improbable it could be ( and was ) . Glad this book was free , if I had to pay for it I would demand my money back .	-1
Did not like the total book . Found it dull and uninteresting . Could not stay focused on the plot . Made the mistake of downloading the second book . Deleted them both .	-1
OK , I had read a great series with a similar title and thought this might be as good . It was n't . While an interesting , fresh perspective on the Grimm stories , I did not find the writing to be very convincing . I had trouble maintaining interest . In fact , I was a bit confused by a couple of events that did not seem to coincide with the fairy tale . I must admit , while pondering those ideas , I kept reading ... It is possible I missed a thing or 2 to the story.I have already purchased another book , ( bought before reading this one ) . I 'm kinda sorry I did . But I will read it and give it its due attention . It is possible that only this book was uninteresting .	-1
ETA : I just noticed the cover changed for the worse , WTF ? The other cover was perfect . This cover does not reflect this book at all IMO . Horrible cover is horrible . Pbffft ! Bring back the cat in the pink and black hat ! ! * * *I read the first chapter of this book as a short story from Smashwords a long time ago . The author said if readers liked it then she would consider writing more stories . I was one of those readers who said , `` More please ! '' Well , I guess enough people liked it and this novella was the end result . I do appreciate the author listening to the readers and following through.I really liked Max the cat and his antics . His part was told in first person so you get into his head and know what he is thinking . I think this part is what drove the story for me . However , the romance between Joe and Melody fell flat . There was an HEA and eventual `` I love you 's '' but I did n't feel any romantic tension or sense of a building relationship . I liked Joe and Melody individually but as a couple the romantic connection just was n't there for me . Also the bad guy and his eventual comeuppance felt anti-climactic . Overall I enjoyed the story well enough , but I would have liked it better if the romantic relationship was more developed.Max has two siblings that are mentioned a few times in the story and I am guessing they might be the subject of the next two books in the trilogy . I 'm still intrigued enough to check them out because let 's face it ... I 'm just a sucker for a good cat-based story !

I love Stephanie Laurens books . I have read maybe 10-15 of her other stories . Maybe it was my fault but when I sit down to read a book and only get a short story I am very disappointed . I generally stay away from the novellas for this reason . I do n't think any of the characters are fully developed or a story line is properly filled out . I bought what I thought would be a book and got a short story very disappointing .	-1
I was so glad when this book was done . I ended up disliking the main character early on in the book . I kept reading it hope the men in her life realized how she had no backbone & leave her . No such luck . Glad that this book was only 99 cents .	-1
At $ 5.99 , you get a summary on several other books , that the author has read , their names , and other suggested reading , plus some of her personal experience thrown in.Not that the suggestions are not good ones , just that , as I am finding while I look over ALL of the books by this author that I own , this one , too , is WAY OVERPRICED . No doubt she put some time and effort into this book , but it is not something that is worth $ 5.99 when you can get other , larger and more detailed volumes off of Amazon Kindle , or , through the mail in Amazon 's book dept.I am not going to list the MANY other Amazon books that are available , many of which I own . Instead , I am going to go delete this from my own library with a sad heart ... Sad , because I just realized one of the few ( new , to me as of this year ) 'How To ' authors I thought was 'legit ' is simply giving lengthy book reviews ( and , yes , supplying her references , so NOTHING is illegal ! ) and charging a pretty penny for the experience .	-1
There are so many descriptive words available in the English language , this author needs to find and use them . The premise for the story is barely adequate , but the pottymouth is totally unnecessary , especially in every scene . We got the point the first few pages , it does n't need to be hammered that she is immature and foul mouthed .	-1
I thought this was a full length story . It is just a teaser . It does have promise to be a good story .	-1
Hard to follow . But there is lots of history in this story Someone else may enjoy this type of book	-1
I gave up after just a couple of pages of some of the most overblown prose I have ever read . I just could n't wade through any more of it to see if the characters and/or story were worth the effort . If you can get past the writing style at the beginning , the book may be good . I 'm not willing to waste any more time trying to find out .	-1
Holbein is asked to produce an art work but first he has to listen to a very tedious and unlikely history story . I tried but could n't finish it .	-1

Clearly Edgar wrote himself into a sea adventure ; sort of Moby Dick meets Treasure Island , but from the get go the plot is preposterous to the point that one can understand the dangers of whatever drug or drink EAP was on at the time of the writing of AGP	-1
Only reason I finished this is because I thought there might be a story . Could have gotten what I got out of this book from playboy or playgirl . Horrible book for someone who actually likes to read books for a storyline .	-1
This is one of the silliest books I 've ever read . If it was n't such an easy read , I would n't have finished it . It 's written either by or for a 10 year old girl . It promotes the idea that a billionaire can be captured as a husband by teaching him to quilt , among other things . That , and the idea that he would honor a girl 's virginity enough to fall in love with her because of it is fairly dangerous , as far as I 'm concerned . The circumstances are wholly laughable , and the premise of the book seems to be to convince young girls that they have nothing , really , to fear under those conditions . I found myself snickering all the way through it . From the beginning , where we 're to believe that a billionaire does not have his own chauffeur , but uses a service , through the end , where his parents and friends are thrilled with the idea of him marrying someone unknown to everyone -- not of his circle -- because they 're `` not snobs '' . Oh come on . I would n't want my own 10 year old daughter reading this stuff . I 'd rather she knew that life is not full of `` fun '' rich guys who will be awed by her powers of abstinence .	-1
I 'm glad this was free . Still not worth the thirty minutes it takes to read it . I was just about to stop reading when the story ended .	-1
Narrative is beautiful . Story well thought out . Ingenious setting . The only naughty thing is the ending . I do n't get `` it . '' Shall look online if the author has other books .	-1

This book was terrible , I did n't even bother finishing it.. the writing was fine , it was proof read , but I could n't form any sort of attachment to the characters ! ! George the BF ( who I assume wrote this garbage ) comes across as a total leach , His GF leaves for 6 months and shags another woman then the Prince , then he helps her spend the money she earned on her back . He claims that he has morality issues about spending her money , but goes into a long discourse on how he ordered his meals and booze on her tab during the flight ? ! ? ! WTF ? ? sorry dude , where I live that 's called living off of your woman or in your case , your hooker.. not much better than a pimp ! ! And this woman ! ! she whines the entire time about being raped in japan after going there to work in a strip club , but I kind of get the impression she 's just pissed because she did n't get paid for it.. She is a hooker ! ! period.. at least be honest about that ! she is a B list actress who could n't act , but had a pretty face and body , so she sold it to the highest bidder.. lets just tell it as it is , I am not a prude , I enjoy a good steamy story.. this was grimy and made me feel a bit ashamed of even getting it for my kindle ! ! Obviously these people have burned through her earnings and now are trying to make some more money.. I 'm glad I ordered it while it was free.. there is no substance to the story or either one of the main characters ... if your wanting a interesting read.. this is not it ...	-1
I can not believe Amazon would even class this as a book . At most , it 's a paragraph . The poison is not a viable alternative in many instances .	-1
I have to admit that I did not finish this book . I barely got into the beginning before I was searching my Kindle for something else to read . The premise of the book piqued my interest , but I just really had a hard time getting into it .	-1
I bought this on an impulse , based on the glowing reviews.What a puerile piece of garbage ! Anyone who praises this preachy , simple-minded , third-rate , dogmatic dry heave has either never read anything more intellectually challenging than `` The Little Engine That Could '' , or has a massive chunk of their cerebral cortex missing.I could overlook the pseudo-spiritualism if the writing itself had any merit . But I 've found the ingredients label on a box of saltines more creatively engaging . This `` story '' __ calling it a story gives it way too much credibility and substance __ is as suspenseful as the assembly instructions for a bookcase from Ikea.I want my 99 cents back ! If that ca n't be arranged , then Mr. Ellis should buy one of my books to see what real fiction writing looks like .	-1
For some reason I thought this would really have much better tips for the AVERAGE home . Most of the bathrooms in the book were HUGE . The fixtures really seemed to be the most expensive . I have never had a house with a huge bathroom . I expected to see some examples done by regular people and not photos from designer showrooms . I just was NOT IMPRESSED . We recently remodeled our bathroom , but we just replaced the toilet , and flooring and pulled out the tub and put is a large shower and painted . We did it without using any of these suggestions and it came out great . Being rated as part of a DIY series , there was no real DIY stuff .	-1
Not my cup of tea . Female lead character was too aggravating to even sympathies with . Story line too fragmented to really enjoy . Found book too aggravating to be enjoyable .	-1
I did n't finish the book . Just bored and did n't wish to continue . Perhaps it 's just me but I wo n't recommend reading .	-1
I love mail order bride type books . This is one of those in a unique way but it 's enough to make you want to toss whatever device you 're reading it on against the wall hoping it 'll break and destroy the book you 're reading.Jason Sinclair , a coffee exporter in Brazil wants a wife . Hiding from his demons deep in the jungle , he wants a wife he can control and mold to his whims . He writes to his cousin and business partner in New Orleans about procuring him a wife . But his cousin does n't get the letters.Instead his cousin Derek 's secretary Caroline Marshall does . She reads Jason 's letters and falls for the lonely man writing them . With a knack for duplicating Derek 's handwriting , Caroline starts writing back to Jason as Derek . Thus securing herself as his wife by proxy to help exorcise the demons of the man she 's falling in love with through letters alone.Jason does n't like her . She 's too independent , too headstrong , too old at 25 and a widow aka not a mold-able , wide-eyed virgin.Jason is one of the worst heroes I 've read in awhile . It 's mindbogglingly annoying how much he protests not liking Caroline . At 60 % in the book he 's still running cold except for Jason Jr under his britches . His attraction to her is purley physical and only because he has n't had sex in so long.It 's hella boring . The cover is misleading if smutty sex if your thing . They do n't have sex until the VERY end of the book and it 's not sexy at all . It 's as if the author finally realized we grew tired of Jason 's woe is me routine and they need to play Hide the Tab in the Slot.If it 's free pass it on by and if there 's a price , run away fast !	-1
I was somewhat disappointed in this book . Think that maybe it was because the stories were much too short ; too chopped up ; or poessibly just not my reading 'cup of tea ' , if you will . Not bad , but not real good either in my humble opinion . Just okay , I guess .	-1
Oh my ! I so want to know how this book ends . I love the first person storytelling and the alternate tales of good and bad . But my LORD ! How to read this book with all of the typos , miscapatalization ( is that even a word ? ) , grammar faux-pas and punctuation goofs ? ? ? ? ? It 's so annoying ! I have to stop on every page to try to decipher what the author is trying to convey !	-1
Some of the recipes might taste good ( though the first looks awful ) but there are mistakes in the recipes ( cook raw pizza including raw dough at 100 degrees F ? My oven does n't even go that low ... that 's a dehydration temp , not a cooking temp ) and all the recipes seem to be written by someone whose first language is something other than English.Many recipes are more like serving suggestions like `` buy store bought diet crakers and make a spread with some veggies and low-cal cream cheese . Put spread on crackers and eat . '' Who needs a recipe for that ? In fact , why not just buy an already-flavored diet spread to spread on the store-bought diet crackers ? Many recipes include store bought items like `` strawberry sauce '' ( whatever that is ) .The first recipe looks absolutely gross -- egg whites , protein powder , and flour ? Yuck ! It needs some formatting and editing for punctuation as well.I would have given it only one star except I think some recipes or serving suggestions might be good for someone . This was a freebie to me , and it 's already deleted . I would n't suggest anyone pay anything for this . Better recipes can be found online for free .	-1
If you want the whole story right now , without this idiotic waiting for expensive monthly installments , try Chris Stewart Great and Terrible series . The whole thing is about $ 28 , but it 's the SAME story and the FULL story -- all there , no waiting . If there is a different ending for the Wrath and Righteousness , I may buy the last bit , but Great and Terrible is a riveting story and you can get it all NOW .	-1
Private Oz is the fourth novel in the Private series by James Patterson and is co-written by Michael White . Soon after Jack Morgan 's 2nd in charge , Justine Smith arrives in Sydney for the grand opening of Private Sydney , a horribly mutilated Asian man stumbles into Private 's party and dies of gunshot wounds . Ho Meng , the man 's father , engages Private to investigate as he does n't trust the Police : Private Sydney 's first case . But soon , Private Sydney 's boss Craig Gisto , has more to investigate : a string of women is disfigured , stabbed and left to die with a wad of fake banknotes intimately placed ; a 26-year-old rock star is worried his manager is arranging for him to join Jimi Hendrix , Kurt Cobain , Janis Joplin and others in `` Club 27 '' ; and a businessman 's wife is worried about his recent disappearance , considering the tenor of some of his business dealings.Of the characters , the majority are two-dimensional : the most interesting was the serial killer . None of the Private staff were interesting enough to want to read more of . The computer nerd was a stuttering stereotype . Again , Patterson features ultra-short chapters . I noticed the characters celebrated by toasting with Verve : I think they may have meant Veuve ( Cliquot ) .I was interested to read this novel as I wanted to see just how well Patterson and White could portray Sydney and Australians . Certainly the location was Sydney : the streets , schools and various organisations attested to that . But these events could have happened anywhere : apart from the setting , there is very little Oz about this novel . Australians ( and Brits ) refer to their mothers as mum , not mom . Since before 1988 , Australia has used Celsius instead of Fahrenheit to report temperature , kilometres instead of miles for distance , kilograms instead of pounds for weight . Down here we have the colour grey , not gray . Our paper money is notes , not bills . Mary 's use of the f word is not typical of Australian women . And the list goes on : tire ( tyre ) , sidewalk ( footpath ) , gas station ( petrol station ) , alley ( lane , although they could n't make up their minds about this and used both ) , cell phone ( mobile ) , drugstore ( pharmacy ) , windshield ( windscreen ) , slot machines ( poker machines ) , pissed with ( pissed off with ) , ass ( arse ) , wop ( wog ) , and college ( Uni ) .It 's disappointing that an international best-selling author chooses to tailor his writing to only an American readership , assuming they are too stupid or lazy to work out that Australians use some words and systems different from what they do . To achieve a genuine Aussie feel , Patterson & White could have included a glossary for their international readers ; failing that , the most basic find-and-replace word processing program could have ensured that the version published in Australia used metric and words like footpath , petrol station and mum . As with Private London ( which lacked a true British feel ) and the fiasco that was Cross Country ( set on the African continent ) , this is a poor effort . My advice to Mr Patterson is to stick to where you know ( USA ) because you sure do n't know Australia . I would have rated this higher except that I was so disgusted with the lack of Australian vernacular .	-1
If you 're looking for a starter book about Karla Homolka , this is n't the one you should read . The case is certainly worthy of reading about , and there is no lack of interesting material , and books published on the subject.The author essentially goes looking for the notorious killer and finds her , inserting a bunch of overdramatising about how scared she was for her safety .Homolka is n't an escaped convict , she made a deal with Canadian government that duped them , but that they were forced to honour.The idea that Homolka and her lawyer husband would attempt to harm the author given that the entire Canadian government and public would like to find a reason to put her back in prison is hooey . The author was in more danger driving around the Caribbean island where she eventually found her subjectEventually when found the author and her subject sit down for a few hours of uncomfortable discussion and she leaves . Then after Homolka refuses to pose for a photograph , she send a photographer to stake out her house and essentially wait for her wonder into his lenses view onion her own back yard so he can grab his picture.While the logic and reasoning the author uses to determin where her subject is living and under what name is interesting and an impressive piece of work . I found it disturbing how the author decided that though the Canadian government and obviously the island where she lived recognised her right to live as a private citizen , the author decided she was the final arbiter of who deserved privacy , and under what circumstances . I find the crimes and the duplicity that Homolka used with the government disgusting , and the end result a perversion of justice . I understand the governments position of needing to stand by the deals that they make , so that others can feel comfortable making deals with the government I 'm exchange for valuable information that they give , to not only protect life , but national security . The author deciding that the deal was n't good enough to morally prevent her subject from being stalked and then stalked again after she does talk to her pursuer is however , wretched in its own right , and a further perversion . This book is paparazzi schlock.There was nothing gained by this book . No information uncovered . No admission by Homolka that called for an entire book made from what was first a newspaper piece . What the author sought to do was hunt down her quarry , and force her into a discussion that revealed nothing by saying essentially if you wo n't talk to me , others will come .	-1
good story , but I thought I had bought the full version , was disappointed when it turned out to be just a sample book . double checking , it was not advertised as a sampler . That is why I am only giving this book 2 stars . The story it self would get at least 3.5 stars . TO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE ! ! ! !	-1
I started this one with high hopes , but unfortunately they were n't met . While the premise was interesting enough , the execution left much to be desired . It reads like a first draft YA novel for tweens by teens -- which is somewhat appropriate considering that 1/3 of the book is tied up in sorting out dangerous pranks done by snotty teenagers.The story feels rushed , as if running pell mell in a downhill rush to the finish line . Enough of it takes place through dialogue that I felt as if I 'd attended a scripted lecture . Exposition has its place , but it does n't need to be in the forefront.Part of the need for sprinting through and using copious amounts of exposition comes from stuffing too many subplots into one novel and then letting them grow like weeds . I found myself scanning through paragraphs and even whole pages in an effort to glean relevant details and avoid annoyance.I wish I could say the inherent naivety of the characters was light or refreshing , but to me it just came across as sophomoric.Sadly , I will not be adding subsequent works in this series to my wish list .	-1
So , the lead loved Zane , the best friend love the lead , then Zane dies and everyone finds out about everyone else 's feelings . The only thing I could think of throughout this whole story was when was the best friend going to lose his temper enough to hurt the lead or someone else . I mean , seriously , for most of the story he yells and flips out on everyone and it goes way beyond the caveman mentality .	-1
While I loved the premise of this book , the execution of the story was very disappointing . This book is very poorly written , the story does not flow and there is no sense of a timeline . After reading this book I was left with one HUGE glaring unanswered question ; WHY did Bonnie and Zane break up after being together for 10 Years ? This book had the potential to portray this heart wrenching story of the lost love between Bonnie and Zane , but if fell short . The emerging love story between Bonnie and Jon left me feeling like `` Wow , that 's it after all the years that Jon had been in love with Bonnie ? `` , again disappointing .	-1
this story was too short to enjoy . it ended at the best part . it was written very well , but needs to be longer .	-1
I enjoyed this short story but it was just too short . Just as you 're getting excited about where the plot is heading , the book ends . Felt cheated out of what really could had been a great short story .	-1
seems more like something you write while waiting for the bus , too short and too simple , there is no talent on it , at least thts my very personal opinion	-1
the stories were great , well written . going through a & # 34 ; ghost story & # 34 ; thing right now , so this was perfect reading	-1
First of all , if you 're going to write a short story , or just an intro to a short story , then sell it for what it is . Reading this reminded me of the old peep shows in Times Square ; every five minutes you have to pay more just to find out what happens next . Very annoying.Secondly , the writing is awful . Cheesier than a cheap porno flick . At first I thought I was reading another book by the same author as `` Fifty Shades , '' ( Lots of eye rolling , hot young billionaire , mousy assistant etc ) but honestly , Fifty Shades had more character development and was MORE believable than this junk.I will not buy any more of Delilah Fawkes ' `` writing . ''	-1
I like fairy tales and fantasy , and romance but i didnt care for this . After an intriguing start with a museum of artifacts and discoveries of family secrets and personalities , it flags . The prince and his associate are BORing and the writing becomes more stilted , with unnecessary detail ( example , describing a meal and its progress rather than enhancing the mood and moving the adventure forward is sort of like an eddy in the stream that could well have been shortened ) I got this for ebook because of the Bookbub clearinghouse of free/lowpriced ebooks to try and it is becoming very apparent that despite good reviews most of their offerings are not worth the download to me.If you have Nothing else to read , it might do .	-1
ok you cheat , what a rip off , not even a book . give me my money back ! ! ! ! ! should be a real book !	-1
This was my first Lee Child book . I knew it was a short story and I decided to read it as an introduction to Jack Reacher . I felt that it did not give me much of a sense about the character at all . I would consider trying one of his best sellers to see if that had any more substance . I could not recommend this book to anyone .	-1
I 'm sorry I could n't recommend this book . the language was so childish . just because you use the words p # $ $ y 2 dozen time does n't make it erotica . ok story and ok characters	-1
As a person who loves to laugh I just had to take a chance on this book . With that said , I got through 65 % of the short novel and had to give up . There was nothing in this novel that I found to make me smile let alone laugh.I give this short a one star for the simple reason the shorts are comparable to the worst stand-up I have ever watched ... do n't waste your time on this one . Maybe Ms. Medvedkov 's other Laugh books would be more comical .	-1
Mildly amusing in places , for the most part this book lacks a point . The stories might be entertaining if spoken to a group of friends , but the writing is lackluster , and for the most part , the stories just trail off as if the author got tired of that one and moved on.It 's not a bad book , it just is n't a good book . If I could give half stars , I would , but as Amazon only offers whole stars I 'm going with 2 rather than 3 .	-1
Judging by the language it seriously seems like this book was written by a teenager . I hate to give bad reviews but I do n't like the idea of people paying for such an under developed book . I can not believe all the 5 star reviews are for real .	-1
Any dimwit knows this . Just need to learn how to write a book about it , market it and then sell it .	-1
I got this book for free from FREE BOOKS kindle app and I am glad it was Free . this book reads like a 6 yr old is reading and writing it . and it goes on and on about the billionaire this and the billionaire that . if you want a really good book with true submission get the Brie books set they are 20 times better than this .	-1
Short , main characters under developed . Had potential to be a great story but author seems to have rushed plot in as few words as possible . The office scene was weird and the heroine on the plane even weirder . I 've got no problem with menages but it was the heroines inner monologue that did my head in , I really did n't like her at all . I think readers need to connect with the main characters on some level but this gives no opportunity to do so .	-1
Sorry , I just could n't get into the story . It seemed like it was taking a long time to get started and read like someone 's random thoughts trying to recount a story .	-1
I gave 1 star because I was quite bored reading ; there was no action , no romance , no meaningful dialogue , there was nothing to the book . The main character provides a monologue of his thoughts and actions during the outbreak of a world-wide virus that has no cure . The plot is ok but there is just no substance , you keep reading because something interesting , shocking , surprising or scary must be about to happen but there is nothing . I would not recommend this book to anyone .	-1
This story needs editing . It constantly wavers between tenses . The punctuation is missing and making it difficult to read . Needs some work .	-1
Light-hearted fare easily read in an hour or two . Author tells a story of her visit to NYC via Washington D.C . If you 've been there you 'll feel right at home with her narrative - if you have n't , you 'll get a smile or two .	-1
I read the first installment and can only say the author is doing himself no favours.The read was so short i can not really comment on the plot , the characters nor the flow of the story.Then to charge .99cents on such a short chapter im thinking this could really blow out money wise.I am a little cautious because i got involved with another series and spent $ 17.00 on a series that never looked like ending , and that $ 17.00 worth of read would have been as long a read as say a classic like `` The Postman '' which cost me $ 8.00 , and bare in mind the postman was a far better read ! I want bang for buck i guess , and i am prepared to pay for a quality read but this is too short and im not willing to payout on chapters this short , sorry	-1
I have read the first and second book . The first one was so short I did n't know what happened when it ended abruptly . The second seemed a few pages longer . I wo n't order the third book ... this should be a long novel . I do n't recommend you waste your money on these series until it is condensed .	-1
There 's not much information here . Most of the ebook consists of links to websites that provide the information you may be seeking . This is really not very helpful if you are looking for a comprehensive guide to the NWA area.Skip this unless you 're inclined to chase information by links from the pages .	-1
Plot : Dr Samantha has spent the last 12 months caring for children in Rwanda . Her father 's unexpected death , and surprising will , forces her to completely change her life - new job , new husband , and trying for a child.Comments : - Contemporary Erotic Romance.- 2517 kindle locations- m/f - explicit , plenty of dirty talk , and a variety of positions . Samantha 's first time followed by frequent , sometimes aggressive , encounters . Borderline Dominant , spanking , anal.- While Samantha is supposed to be a plus-size woman , written as curvy and rubenesque , most women would see her as *normal* . `` By current standards of beauty she was two dress sizes too big to be considered perfect . `` - Includes discussion of infidelity and child abuse.Opinion : '' Curves for the Billionaire '' had been recommended a few times on the Amazon Discussion Boards for Plus Size heroines so when it came up on a free list I decided to grab it . I probably would n't have grabbed it otherwise . But I did , and when I was looking for an easy , contemporary tale after overdosing on Medieval Historicals , this one floated to the top.First up , there are some general stylistic grammar issues and basic editing that may not be to everyone 's taste . I did n't feel it detracted from the story overall , but is indicative of an author just starting out , who is still honing her craft , and needed a better proofreader . Unfortunately , the issues did become more obvious as the book progressed.At it 's heart , there 's a good story . It needs work . The author needs experience , particularly when it comes to writing dialogue and bedroom scenes . She gets heavy-handed and lectures the reader . Scenes needed cutting . It needed to be tighter . It 's an okay , heavily erotic read that was n't really ready for the market.-CR-	-1
Interesting premise when I began the story , especially once I could see where the author was going with the plot . However , the ending is severely disappointing and a huge fizzle . Very glad I had n't paid for this book .	-1
Ok I am not happy with this book especially after reading the first one . I found it horrible compared to the first one . The first one I found excellent and coherent unlike the second one . It was to me disjointed and made little to no sense compared to the first one . It shot the storyline off on a ( to me ) worthless tangent with less than interesting characters.Here 's hoping he will get back on track with the main storyline but to be honest doubt I will find out as I have no intention of continuing with it . In other words no way in hell am I going to bother with it .	-1
Obviously , I 'm on a biker craze like a lot of readers right now . Could be due to Sons of Anarchy or maybe one of my fave KA 's , Motorcycle Man . Not sure . Anyhoo , this book takes disbelief to a whole new level . Turner Colson is this humongous ( almost 7ft ) man that belongs to the local motorcycle gang . He 's a mute-by choice . Georgia Pine is a savvy lawyer that had a case go wrong and a client lie so her reputation takes a beating . After her laudry is aired per se , she goes to a bar to get drunk . For some reason Turner decides he wants her and is going to have her so his brother the leader of the motorcycle gang says sure . ( cause the MC 's run the town and no one will gain say them . Plus he 's curious why his big ugly brother suddenly is in lust ) Then for some bizarre reason , Turner takes Georgia to the woods on some minimilist survivor mission where he 's going to train her up right , I guess.Here is where we end up in bizarro land.Turner is a dominant and feels like the week in the woods will make Georgia who he 's just met a perfect submissive slave . And if not , he 'll kill her , or so he threatens . Then the author drops interesting tidbits about how the hero is really big ... everywhere because his dad experimented and wanted big warrior babies . We dont get more information on this just curious hints here and there . Turner makes it very clear to Georgia that she cant have his babies because the size might kill her . In fact they have to have interesting sex because of his size.Then Georgia reveals another side to herself and whips out the hero 's knife to show she can hunt rabbit and deer with just the blade . I forced myself to finish and read to the end but the story gets crazier as we realize that Turner is a millionaire with an underground tunnel in the woods that leads to his gorgeous house . They take a road trip to save another MC member , get shot at , and up back home and then Turner tells Georgia she 's the only person he 'll talk to and she 'll talk for him . They fall in love or at this point are in love ? The end	-1
Please just save your money -- as little as it costs . The writing was substandard . The grammar atrocious . The spelling errors rampant . At some points in the Vampires Destined trilogy , there were even notes the author clearly meant for her eyes only that were inadvertently left in the text for all to read . The author thanks her beta reader for her editing skills . I do n't believe any were utilized . Books like this give self-published authors a bad name . Not at all recommended .	-1
Well writen but gets slightlly confused . Enjoyable but not great sience fiction . Did not feel it was a chore to finish .	-1
I do n't know if it got better after that . It looks like there will be 9 books I hope the author refines her craft . There was nothing in the first chapters to capture my attention and draw me into the character .	-1
I could not finish this book it was not what I thought it was . I did not like it . I only read two chapters .	-1
This is , almost hands down , the WORST book I have ever had the misfortune of reading . It sounded interesting from the teaser : psuedo-apocolyptic sci-fi with an unusually young protagonist . It fell far short of even these modest expectations . Apart from the completely unrealistic - I mean to the point of just asinine absurdity - plot line , the book was replete with terrible grammatical and spelling errors that would shame even the laziest of third-graders . This book reads like the delusional fantasies of a grammatically-challenged eighth-grader who has not yet learned the value of a compound sentence.The main character , Kevin , is a disgustingly narcisstic psychopath . He is also a computing and mathematical genius who develops an amazing new program at the tender age of five that makes him and his parents multi-billionaires . His grand plan in life , at that point , is to make trillions of dollars so that he can explore space . Harmless enough . But wait , there 's more ! Once his parents , who were pieces of work in and of themselves , are murdered after going on a million-dollar shopping spree with a random stereotypically hypersexualized gay salesguy they just met that day and are somehow now magically best friends with ( seriously ) , said random salesguy and 5-year-old Kevin murder the murderer ( with his own gun ! ) and continue on a whirlwind spree of ruthless violence , hedonism and stupidity throughout the rest of the story . Kevin then goes on to rule the world and have sex with really hot women . Also , to ensure that they always stay hot and do n't get gross and old , he creates this ultra-youth serum which gives everybody who takes it the ability to be 21 , but also cure disease and does all sorts of other snake-oil-advertisement-like things , which he then hoards and miserly rations out to dictators and other evil-doers in exchange for billions of dollars.I 've seen Playboy foldouts put together with more literary forethought and subtlety . It was like watching a train wreck unfold page by horrible , badly written page . There was n't a single likeable character in the entire book ; in fact , there was n't a single three-dimensional character in the entire book . Not one was fleshed out beyond the paltriest and laziest of details , and the glimpses you do get into their minds reveal them to be vapid , shallow and just plain awful people.I did read it to the end , really hoping against hope that this was going to be an allegory , a commentary on the pitfalls and dangers of absolute power in the hands of someone without the understanding , maturity , or ability to wield it . I have never hated a protagonist more , and I was really rooting for this guy to get his richly-deserved comeuppance , but no . He ends up conquering the world with his band of super-prostitutes.For all of its absurdity , the plot line could have led to a really interesting story in the hands of a talented and thoughtful writer . Sadly , it 's just a wretched , howling mess of a book that tries to make a hero out of a monster . I got this for free , and I still want my money back . Do n't waste yours .	-1
Glad it was free and short . Perhaps helpful to someone , but not for me . As with most of the free books I have downloaded , it needs a good proof reader .	-1
This is well written as the author paints a clear and compelling picture . However , the premise that a widow would so soon fall in love with her brother-in-law does not work for me . I finished it but I had no connection to the characters and therefore it does not ring true for me . I can not recommend this book .	-1
No classic -- but perfect for the time I was reading it . Now and then a light Christian romance is just the thing -- maybe even because you know where it 's going . Sure they were both being stupid -- but is n't that how romances go ?	-1
I wanted to love this book , The Paris Lawyer and the overall concept is good . I liked the young lawyer , Catherine , and the growth she goes through the course of this book . However , at times I was confused and unsure of the significant of certain activities included in the story.An example is , & # 8220 ; She responds , & # 8220 ; Nvr mnd. & # 8221 ; She turns off her cell phone , ready to return to boring paperwork . But first , she goes for a smoke in the storage room whose window opens onto a gloomy sky. & # 8221 ; From there it is a totally different scene . Makes no sense as far as a story goes.Perhaps something is just lost in translation.Copy provided by NetGalley for an honest review .	-1
It seems this book was written with no real purpose unless you consider that you can find love . That could have been written in one sentence and Kristopher could have eliminated all the other superfluous words .	-1
I have n't read anything this bad in a long time . The story line was just immature and the dialogue seemed washed out . Maybe the description of the story should be more clear . I was thinking I was reading a mystery . No mystery here , maybe a bit science fiction , but even that would be a stretch .	-1
I expected a decent book only to be given less than a chapter . And what I read , I was glad that was all there was to this . And also glad it was free . Will delete this from my Kindle immediately . If you are into horror you might like it . I did n't .	-1
Was something missing , like a middle of the story , a conclusion ? . Was I tricked into downloading a teaser , just a portion of a real book ? It will never be made into a movie is my prediction .	-1
I read the first book in this series and found the style of writing to be very stilted . I thought I would give the second one a try , and frankly I think it is worse.The story centers around a group called The Avalon Society and some religious artifacts they have . Supposedly these prove Jesus came to England , was married and had a child . The members of this society are the Lord 's of Honor , and they are being stalked by the Brown Coats . This opposing group does n't want this revelation to get out.There are at least three love stories going on , and there are so many characters the makers of Ben Hur would be jealous . Introductions are repeated over and over , and names drop like rain -- and you have no idea whether they are worth remembering.The writing is not fluid , and I ca n't imagine people actually talking to each other in the way the author presents . I just could n't find any depth to this bunch.Usually I can lose myself in the story and make a connection with the characters . That was just not the case in this one .	-1
Plot line contrived and forced . Every page filled with motivation for characters actions or lack of actions . Boo Hoo Hoo no body loves me , understands me and I did n't get everything I want out of life .	-1
I should of thought twice before buying the second sequel to this series . But I had bought it at the same time that I downloaded Book 1 of the series . I have never given a gook this bad of a review . Maya , who after becoming mated to the Prime Alex , has found herself pregnant and what does she do ... she goes to her best friend and acts like a bitch . Rips the door off of the freezer to get some ice cream and could care less . She is downright mean and gets off on being this growly bitch . She then shows up back home to find some visiting tigress rubbing up against her mate and that said tigress had scratched her friend . She then goes into attack mode . After an apology from the tigress her and Alex , her mate , are now upstairs having sex . And wham the book is almost done . She does n't reveal that she is pregnant until the last minute in the book . This book was not worth the $ 2.99 that I paid . I wish I could return for a refund . I am very hesitant in buying the next book in this series . I think the author needs to go back to these books and rewrite them and add a lot more content than a prima being bitchy and sex .	-1
I did not like this book . I am glad it was only 2.99 . The story was lame and the main people in the book said the dumbest things . I stopped reading it after the first 2 chapters . I just could n't go on . I will not read another book from this author .	-1
The positive reviews of this `` book '' are ridiculous and it is not possible that the recipes were actually tried . I would like to know how to measure : 1/4th ounce of salt ; 1/8th ounce of fresh thyme or 1/8th ounce of fresh ground pepper ; 1 1/3 cloves garlic ; 1/3 tsp anise seeds ... here are excerpts from the book : `` mix entire content till it takes on even texture '' ; `` cook the entire content under medium flame in covered condition for 25 minutes '' ( I cook OVER a medium flame ) ; `` use a hand mixer to smoothen the ingredients '' ; my absolute favorite part of Hot and Sour Soup with Chicken ( picture shows tofu in it along with egg and it is not in the recipe ) : `` Cook the mixture for 3-4 minutes til it emits a typical mind boggling smell '' ... really ? Again , I truly doubt that one of the positive reviewers has actually READ the book let alone made one recipe from it . This book is NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , I absolutely LOVE Kim Harrison and am addicted to The Hollows . I just found this story hollow and boring . Of course after all this time reading The Hollows I guess maybe I 'm just a little biased . Not to mention bitter that the series is ending soon . Just keep writing The Hollows Kim , stick to the good stuff !	-1
